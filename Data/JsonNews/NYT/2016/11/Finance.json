{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Blames F.B.I. Director for Election Loss", "Date": "2016-11-12", "News": "Supported byHillary Clinton on Saturday cast blame for her surprise election loss on the announcement by the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, days before the election that he had revived the inquiry into her use of a private email server.In her most extensive remarks since she conceded the race to Donald J. Trump early Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton told donors on a 30-minute conference call that Mr. Comey\u2019s decision to send a letter to Congress about the inquiry 11 days before Election Day had thrust the controversy back into the news and had prevented her from ending the campaign with an optimistic closing argument.\u201cThere are lots of reasons why an election like this is not successful,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, according to a donor who relayed the remarks. But, she added, \u201cour analysis is that Comey\u2019s letter raising doubts that were groundless, baseless, proven to be, stopped our momentum.\u201dHer campaign said the seemingly positive outcome had only hurt it with voters who did not trust Mrs. Clinton and were receptive to Mr. Trump\u2019s claims of a \u201crigged system.\u201d In particular, white suburban women who had been on the fence were reminded of the email imbroglio and broke decidedly in Mr. Trump\u2019s favor, aides said.After leading in polls in many battleground states, Mrs. Clinton told the donors on Saturday, \u201cwe dropped, and we had to keep really pushing to regain our advantage, which going into last weekend we had.\u201d\u201cWe were once again up in all but two of the battleground states, and we were up considerably in some that we ended up losing,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cAnd we were feeling like we had to put it back together.\u201dStill, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s instinct to shun any personal responsibility angered some Democrats. Several donors on the call, while deeply bitter about Mr. Comey\u2019s actions, said they believed that Mrs. Clinton and her campaign had suffered avoidable missteps that handed the election to an unacceptable opponent. They pointed to the campaign\u2019s lack of a compelling message for white working-class voters and to decisions years ago by Mrs. Clinton to use a private email address at the State Department and to accept millions of dollars for speeches to Wall Street.Hillary Clinton's campaign staff distributed an internal memo on Thursday detailing why it thought the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, had played a role in Mrs. Clinton's loss.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign was so confident in her victory that her aides popped open Champagne on the campaign plane early Tuesday. But that conviction, aides would later learn, was based largely on erroneous data showing that young, black and Latino voters and suburban women who had been turned off by Mr. Trump\u2019s comments but viewed Mrs. Clinton unfavorably would turn out for her in higher numbers than they ultimately did.Exit polls conducted by Edison Research found that among people who said they had decided in the final week before Election Day, 47 percent voted for Mr. Trump and 42 percent for Mrs. Clinton.As early as Wednesday morning, aides began to explain to Democrats shaken by the loss that the campaign\u2019s sophisticated data modeling had not taken into account the bombshell F.B.I. announcement.Mr. Comey\u2019s letters to Congress went against the F.B.I.\u2019s longstanding tradition of avoiding decisions that could affect elections, but he told aides that he felt he had no choice because he had already weighed in on the case so publicly. In July, he had taken the unusual step of publicly announcing that the F.B.I. would not charge Mrs. Clinton.At the time, she believed she had finally put the issue to rest. And after the final debate on Oct. 19 in Las Vegas, she emerged in such a strong position that she began to focus on campaigning for down-ballot Democrats and planned a campaign stop in traditionally Republican Arizona.\u201cWe felt so good about where we were,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told donors. Before Mr. Comey\u2019s first letter to Congress, she added, \u201cwe just had a real wind at our back.\u201dMr. Trump seized on the letter, telling voters in Nevada the Saturday before Election Day that \u201cthe F.B.I. has reopened its criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton,\u201d and that the matter \u201cwould grind government to a halt\u201d should Mrs. Clinton win the White House. The F.B.I.\u2019s examination of the new emails did not in fact reopen the investigation.Democratic pollsters attributed Mr. Trump\u2019s laser-thin victories in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin \u2014 states that President Obama had won \u2014 largely to a drifting of college-educated suburban women to the Republican nominee at the last minute, because of the renewed focus on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email server.\u201cWe lost with college-educated whites after leading with them all summer,\u201d a Clinton spokesman, Brian Fallon, said on Wednesday. \u201cFive more days of reminders about Comey, and they gravitated back to Trump.\u201dBefore Mrs. Clinton spoke on Saturday, her finance director, Dennis Cheng, thanked the donors on the call, each of whom had raised at least $100,000. The campaign brought in nearly $1 billion to spend heavily on data efforts, to disperse hundreds of staff members to battleground states, and to air television advertisements \u2014 only to fall short to Mr. Trump\u2019s upstart operation.Donors conceded that, ultimately, no amount of money could match Mr. Trump\u2019s crisp pitch, aimed at the economically downtrodden, to \u201cmake America great again.\u201d\u201cYou can have the greatest field program, and we did \u2014 he had nothing,\u201d said Jay S. Jacobs, a prominent New York Democrat and donor to Mrs. Clinton. \u201cYou can have better ads, paid for by greater funds, and we did. Unfortunately, Trump had the winning argument.\u201dOn Friday night, Mrs. Clinton thanked volunteers on a nationwide conference call. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not going to sugarcoat it,\u201d she said, sighing. \u201cThese have been very, very tough days.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump, and Great Business Ideas for America", "Date": "2016-11-26", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewA businessman with a lifetime of experience in management has been elected president of the United States. Donald J. Trump\u2019s administration may be viewed as an experiment \u2014 an opportunity to discover whether one particular businessman\u2019s perspective and skills will be assets in governing a nation.Mr. Trump\u2019s background evidently appealed to voters, but he should be careful not to be overconfident. His election may be a culmination of a trend in society of lionizing business stars and expecting too much of them.We\u2019ve seen this phenomenon in the outlandish salaries paid to top chief executives and in the public enthusiasm for them. Rakesh Khurana, dean of Harvard College, described the trend eloquently in his book \u201cSearching for a Corporate Savior: The Irrational Quest for Charismatic C.E.O.s\u201d (Princeton, 2002). He discerned a long trend in American business toward choosing chief executives from outside a company and paying them handsomely for some presumed business flair despite their ignorance of the long-term internal issues facing a company.Professor Khurana warned that expecting these people to perform acts of genius was asking for trouble. The charismatic outsider tends to become authoritarian, alienating others in the company. The executive\u2019s desperate efforts to live up to their promise may sometimes result in wild gambles. There are grounds for concern that President Trump could be this kind of outsider chief executive.Mr. Trump has a number of business books to his name, all written with co-authors. Often these books are amusing, if simplistic and boastful. \u201cHow to Get Rich\u201d (Random House, 2004, written with Meredith McIver) has advice like \u201cBusiness Rule #1: If you don\u2019t tell people about your success, they probably won\u2019t know about it,\u201d \u201cBusiness Rule #2: Keep it short, fast and direct\u201d and \u201cBusiness Rule #3: Begin working at a young age. I did.\u201d Maybe these nostrums are important for Mr. Trump but they seem to have little to do with making a country rich.But there is still possibly another, more interesting strand in his advice: Mr. Trump\u2019s admonition to be ambitious.A business-oriented president could be helpful in this intellectual world, too, by taking actions like doubling the budget for the National Science Foundation, which was created in 1950 when Harry S. Truman was president, and infusing the National Institutes of Health, the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities with more cash. But of course a president must resist the temptation to meddle in their grant-making process. These are democratic institutions and must stay that way.An inspirational business-oriented president would also promote enlightened business thinking \u2014 an approach that would embrace kindness and consideration to all people, workers included, and wouldn\u2019t be focused only on those destined for fortunes. The country could also use an emphasis on the technical side of business, an aspect that may be unexciting and even off-putting to many people but remains very important. I\u2019m thinking of such things as actuarial science, accounting, securitization and structured products.Business has many dimensions. Consider another book, one by Georgia Levenson Keohane, the executive director of the Pershing Square Foundation. It is \u201cCapital and the Common Good: How Innovative Finance Is Tackling the World\u2019s Most Urgent Problems\u201d (Columbia University Press, 2016).Ms. Keohane focuses on the welfare of those people who aren\u2019t anywhere close to becoming billionaires. She describes the theory and history of social impact bonds, green bonds, vaccine bonds, microfinance, public-private partnerships and other routes to financial inclusion. Ms. Keohane has many ideas that could do much good and could conceivably be pursued much further under a business-oriented president.In the best of outcomes, Mr. Trump will find a way to live up to this opportunity in the coming years, carefully fulfilling a promise to bring in the \u201cbest and most serious people\u201d in the business community rather than the most loyal \u2014 choosing people who have a history of thinking big while not overreaching and who have technical expertise and compassion as well.To be truly successful, Mr. Trump shouldn\u2019t shoot for flashes of genius with immediate results. It would be better to work patiently, in the hope of bettering lives over the long run. With the proper approach, modern business could really improve the work of our government institutions.ROBERT J. SHILLER is Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What President Trump Should Build", "Date": "2016-11-25", "News": "Supported byLettersTo the Editor:I thought this article was extremely interesting and relevant, although one essential example was missing: a new power grid for the country.With modern renewable power sources dependent on intermittent conditions (sunshine for solar, wind for turbines), an imaginative new grid would be able to store energy for limited intervals, to be available whenever and wherever needed.This is a challenge we are capable of meeting with America\u2019s technical ingenuity. Perhaps an immigrant like Nikola Tesla will help solve it.FRANCIS FORD COPPOLARutherford, Calif.The writer is the film director, screenwriter and producer.To the Editor:Let\u2019s hope Donald Trump doesn\u2019t read James B. Stewart\u2019s suggestion to \u201cbuild something awe-inspiring.\u201d Do we really have to appeal to his sense of grandiosity in order to stimulate action? The result may well be a mega-golf course and resort in the center of Yellowstone Park, complete with the TRUMP logo.Repairing and improving the country\u2019s roads, bridges, federal buildings, national parks, energy and computer systems may not be glamorous, but such projects will generate well-paying employment instead of minimum-wage service jobs, and would leave a real (not a real-estate) and lasting legacy.DONNA BERGENTOM MADDENSkokie, Ill.To the Editor:I\u2019d like to add an item to the list of infrastructure projects suggested in the article: a coast-to-coast project to put all power and telephone lines underground.Such a project could employ more medium and low-skilled people than the construction of the Interstate Highway System did during the Eisenhower administration. It could be financed, at least partly, through the military budget as a national security measure that secures our power distribution systems against attack. And it would save untold millions of dollars year-in and year-out by avoiding the cost of power outages every time a storm hits.The current generation would thank President Donald Trump for the jobs and the boost to the economy, and generations to come would thank him for his foresight. Quite a legacy.MARC H. ROSENBAUMSouthampton, N.Y.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Hires Will Set Course of His Presidency", "Date": "2016-11-12", "News": "Supported byIf anything, that understates the gravity of the personnel choices Mr. Trump and his transition team are weighing.Rarely in the history of the American presidency has the exercise of choosing people to fill jobs had such a far-reaching impact on the nature and priorities of an incoming administration. Unlike most new presidents, Mr. Trump comes into office with no elective-office experience, no coherent political agenda and no bulging binder of policy proposals. And he has left a trail of inflammatory, often contradictory, statements on issues from immigration and race to terrorism and geopolitics.In such a chaotic environment, serving a president who is in many ways a tabula rasa, the appointees to key White House jobs like chief of staff and cabinet posts like secretary of state, defense secretary and Treasury secretary could wield outsize influence. Their selection will help determine whether the Trump administration governs like the firebrand Mr. Trump was on the campaign trail or the pragmatist he often appears to be behind closed doors.\u201cA new president is really vulnerable and open to all sorts of influence by strong-willed advisers,\u201d said Robert Dallek, a presidential historian. \u201cTrump\u2019s appointments over the next six weeks will be very significant because they can show whether he wants to create some unity in the country, or whether he really intends to deliver on his ideas.\u201dThey conceded, though, that there was little historical precedent for such a relationship, especially when the incoming president had ousted the incumbent\u2019s party after such an acrid campaign, and that Mr. Trump and Mr. Obama were never likely to become buddies.Mr. Trump is drawing mainly from a pool of trusted aides and supporters, according to people familiar with the campaign. On Friday, he named three of his grown children \u2014 Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric \u2014 as well as his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to his transition team, an arrangement that rang alarm bells in Washington because they will also manage his businesses. The Trump family, it is clear, will wield unusual power in the composition of an administration that is already shaping up as remarkable for its clannishness.Even within Mr. Trump\u2019s tight circle, however, there are sharp differences in ideology, background and temperament that could play out in how the White House deals with Congress and how the United States deals with the rest of the world.Perhaps the deepest schism is between Stephen K. Bannon, the conservative provocateur and media entrepreneur who was Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, and Reince Priebus, the Republican Party chairman who came to terms with Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy. Both are on a short list for chief of staff, according to people close to the campaign, and whoever is chosen, the other is likely to get another senior White House post.Each would bring a radically different approach to a job often called the second-most powerful in Washington \u2014 gatekeeper to the president and often the first and last person he sees in the Oval Office.In some ways, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Priebus are proxies for the larger battle over what kind of president Mr. Trump will be. Some former Republican officials held out hope that Mr. Trump would be receptive to moderating influences, but others worried that he would simply listen to the last person he spoke to.\u201cYou always have that tension between what he said to get elected and what he actually believes,\u201d said John D. Negroponte, a former director of national intelligence under President George W. Bush. \u201cHow selective will his amnesia be?\u201dMr. Negroponte, a Republican who supported Hillary Clinton in the campaign, said he could imagine senior members of Mr. Trump\u2019s National Security Council warning him about the dangers of \u201ccutting loose countries from our nuclear umbrella,\u201d which Mr. Trump threatened during the campaign to do in reference to Japan and South Korea.General Flynn, a registered Democrat, has criticized the neoconservative policies of the Bush administration for leading the United States into quagmires like Iraq. \u201cThey\u2019ve gotten us into mess after mess for the wrong reasons,\u201d he said, echoing Mr. Trump\u2019s harsh criticism of Mr. Bush during the Republican debates. And like Mr. Trump, General Flynn is withering about the foreign-policy establishment of both parties.It may seem counterintuitive for Mr. Trump to recruit a Bush administration veteran. But Peter D. Feaver, who worked on President Bush\u2019s national security council and now teaches at Duke University, pointed out that Mr. Obama had campaigned \u201cvociferously against the Iraq surge, and then asked the architect of the surge\u201d \u2014 Robert M. Gates \u2014 \u201cto stay.\u201d Mr. Gates, as defense secretary, later persuaded Mr. Obama to deploy a similar surge in Afghanistan.\u201cYou can say one thing in campaigns, and mean it,\u201d Mr. Feaver said, \u201cand in personnel matters, do the opposite.\u201dThe contest for top economic posts does not expose the same ideological fault lines as those for the White House or national security jobs. But it does raise red flags, given the anti-establishment, anti-Wall Street sentiment that Mr. Trump stoked during the campaign.Several of the candidates on his short list for Treasury secretary come from Wall Street, including Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner who was the finance chairman of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, and Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase. People close to Mr. Dimon said he was not interested in the job.Another candidate is a conservative Texas congressman, Jeb Hensarling, who has called for the repeal the Dodd-Frank Act, the banking regulations passed after the financial crisis, during Mr. Obama\u2019s first term.The least predictable source of influence on Mr. Trump remains Mr. Obama. For all their differences, and the bitter words they flung at each other during the campaign, the two share traits. Both won the presidency as outsiders, and both hold their party\u2019s foreign-policy establishment in contempt.With Mr. Trump lacking elective-office experience or the political coterie that accompanies establishment candidates to Washington, administration officials said Mr. Obama would probably spend more time with him than was typical for other incoming and outgoing presidents.And Mr. Trump, some outsiders predicted, would respect the advice of a president 15 years younger, whose path to the White House was nearly as improbable as his.\u201cIf you\u2019re looking at things from a hiring point of view, as Trump does, Obama could have done anything he wanted,\u201d Douglas Brinkley, a professor of history at Rice University, said in reference to Mr. Obama\u2019s career options. \u201cThat has to impress Trump.\u201dMaggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York, and Jackie Calmes from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Elon Musk Faces Epic Juggling Act After Tesla-SolarCity Deal", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsTesla Motors\u2019 eager shareholders have made Elon Musk too cool to fail. Their decision to back the Silicon Valley billionaire\u2019s quixotic $2.6 billion bid for SolarCity, a solar-panel company run by his cousin, sets up an epic 2017 juggling act. A lot could go wrong as Mr. Musk tries to integrate the two companies without compromising on Tesla\u2019s ambitious production targets. Indulgent investors, though, are likely to give him a pass.His grand vision is to create a one-stop shop for people who want to power their lives with renewable energy. Tesla already makes electric cars and wall-mounted battery packs that can be used to power homes. SolarCity, whose main innovation is a clever financing model, will round out the picture with rooftop solar panels, solar shingles and the like.From Zip2 to OpenAI, a look at the entrepreneur\u2019s many companies.The vision is appealing, but in the short run it looks challenging. Tesla may have surprised investors by turning a narrow \u2014 and rare \u2014 profit in the third quarter, but the vast bulk of its current $28 billion market capitalization is predicated on Mr. Musk\u2019s turning the company from a niche supplier into a truly mass manufacturer of electric vehicles. Tesla\u2019s shares have fallen about 16 percent since the company unveiled its SolarCity bid in June, reducing the value of the all-stock deal to around $2 billion.Hitting a self-imposed target of cranking out 500,000 cars per year by 2018, from a current run rate of around 100,000, already looked daunting. Tesla, after all, has a history of missing production and sales targets; its Model X S.U.V., for example, was delayed by problems with its falcon-wing doors.Now Mr. Musk and his team also have a major acquisition to worry about. Throw in his continued role as chief executive of the rocket venture SpaceX, and he has a lot up in the air. Moreover, to deliver on its promises, Tesla will probably need to ask investors for fresh capital at some point next year.For most chief executives, all this would make 2017 a make-or-break year. But Tesla investors\u2019 overwhelming support of the SolarCity deal suggests that Mr. Musk is in a different category. Even if the wheels start to come off, he will probably be able to persuade the faithful to keep him in place and to hand over more cash. That may make Mr. Musk\u2019s all-electric vision a self-fulfilling prophecy, no matter the cost.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Auction That Could Transform Local Media", "Date": "2016-11-28", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorWith the demand for wireless broadband growing, the Federal Communications Commission is auctioning off a big chunk of the public airwaves. Billions of dollars are likely to change hands, a windfall that could transform local media across the country.This broadband spectrum is now used by TV stations to broadcast their signals to the comparatively small number of customers who rely on antenna reception at a time when most people use cable, satellite or streaming services.That\u2019s why broadcasters are being encouraged to sell some or all of their spectrum to the F.C.C. in the auction. Stations can opt to give up their channels, share a channel with another broadcaster, or move elsewhere on the dial. In turn, the F.C.C. will sell this spectrum to mobile communications companies hungry for bandwidth to deliver more videos, texts and social media to their customers.The proceeds from these sales could produce enormous public benefits if they are used to build a 21st-century infrastructure for public interest media. For states, communities and universities holding licenses in play, the auction presents an important opportunity to invest in new ways to meet the information needs of the public.A broad and exciting array of public interest initiatives, including digital news sites, blogs, podcasts, YouTube channels, public data sites, apps and civic engagement, could be built with some of the money generated by the auction.At least 54 public television stations in 18 states and the District of Columbia applied to participate in the auction, according to research by the nonprofit group Free Press. These include three stations in the Los Angeles market, a major outlet on Chicago\u2019s South Side, and the public station at Howard University in Washington. Each could be worth tens or hundreds of millions of dollars.Perhaps nowhere is there a better opportunity to take advantage of the auction than in New Jersey. The state is part of a metropolitan region with a huge population, crowded airwaves and a big demand for mobile data. It owns four public TV licenses that are operated by WNET, the New York public television station. The F.C.C. estimated before the auction began that these licenses together could be worth as much as $2.3 billion.New Jersey filed a nonbinding application to participate in the auction, but beyond that, its status is unknown. Under the rules, neither the F.C.C. nor the broadcasters can discuss the results until the auction has closed. The process is expected to be completed in early 2017, when winning bidders will be announced.Even so, New Jersey lawmakers are looking hungrily at the potential bonanza of any sale to plow into the state budget. But these airwaves are the public\u2019s, and their use has always come with public-interest obligations. A significant portion of any proceeds should be deployed strategically to meet the public\u2019s real need for news and for information that helps citizens live their lives.The governor and State Legislature should create a permanent fund to support a new model for public-interest media, financed by a significant portion of any auction revenue. This approach could serve as a model for other states, universities and communities seeking to sell their spectrum.Among other uses, the New Jersey fund could support civic technology apps to put valuable data about elections, services and government spending into people\u2019s hands; stronger community news coverage and watchdog journalism, particularly in underserved urban areas; more outlets for diverse voices that have traditionally been left out of newsrooms and news coverage; and a statewide civic engagement network to help people identify and explore the issues that matter most to them. Money might also be directed to support education, arts and culture.We have a rare chance to strengthen communities by breathing new energy into local news and information. Members of the public no doubt could come up with many other superb ideas. So why not ask them?This week, Free Press is starting a public education and engagement campaign to gather input from across the state and push New Jersey officials to create a new public fund with support from the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation, Carnegie Corporation of New York, Democracy Fund Voice and others, that we hope will be replicated by other communities that will be affected by the auction.None of this will happen without public involvement and pressure every step of the way. Bold action now could improve civic life and foster social trust and democratic participation across the nation. A vibrant democracy demands no less.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Next Generation of Hedge Fund Stars: Data-Crunching Computers", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "Supported byEvery five minutes a satellite captures images of China\u2019s biggest cities from space. Thousands of miles away in California, a computer looks at the shadows of the buildings in the images and draws a conclusion: China\u2019s real estate boom is slowing.Traders at BlackRock, the money management giant, then use the data to help choose whether to buy or sell the stocks of Chinese developers. \u201cThe machine is able to deal with some of the very complex decisions,\u201d said Jeff Shen, co-chief investment officer at Scientific Active Equity, BlackRock\u2019s quantitative trading, or quant, arm in San Francisco.The future star of the hedge fund industry is not the next William A. Ackman, Carl C. Icahn or George Soros. Rather, it is a computer like the one at Scientific Active Equity, which sifts through data like satellite images from China every day.Math whizzes have long dominated the hedge fund universe, but until recently, only a handful of well-known firms like Renaissance Technologies, the D. E. Shaw Group and AQR Capital Management used mathematical models and computers to plot out trading techniques. And other than the occasional blowup, as when Long-Term Capital Management went bust in spectacular fashion in 1998 after its models failed to factor in the possibility of a Russian government debt default, the world of quantitative trading has remained out of the limelight.Now, as the financial world faces dismal returns and investor criticism over high fees, hedge fund managers are turning to computers to make decisions that used to be left to humans about which stocks to buy and sell, for example. Celebrity investors like Mr. Ackman are slowly being replaced by teams of Ph.D. holders who develop mathematical equations for trading and systems to scrape huge sets of data for patterns.For instance, the billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones, who runs the Tudor Investment Corporation, needed to make changes after investors pulled more than $2 billion from his firm, which now manages $10.6 billion. So he cut staff and brought in mathematicians and scientists to build up an analytical team. Other hedge funds have made similar moves.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a kind of bifurcation among hedge funds, with some moving towards more quant-driven or automated style, while others are turning towards a more \u2018long-only\u2019 model, where they are judged on longer-term investment performance,\u201d said Craig Coben, global head of equity capital markets at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Big institutional investors are also diverting more money to the hedge fund firms that use computer-driven hedge fund strategies.While the hedge fund industry in recent months has suffered the biggest quarterly outflow since the financial crisis, investors continue to allocate money to hedge funds that use computer-driven strategies. Investors have put $7.9 billion into quantitative hedge funds this year, and the universe of hedge funds devoted to these strategies has more than doubled, to $900 billion from $408 billion seven years ago, according to Hedge Fund Research.More broadly, money flowing out of the hedge fund industry as a whole comes at a time when performance has been disappointing. The Hedge Fund Research Composite Index, the broadest gauge of hedge fund performance, has lagged the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index this year, gaining 3.56 percent through the end of October compared with the index\u2019s 4 percent gain over the same period, accounting for reinvested dividends.\u201cFrankly, we expect to see assets move from human managers to machine managers,\u201d Tony James, chief operating officer of Blackstone, told investors earlier this year. The Blackstone Alternative Asset Management arm, which manages $70 billion in hedge fund investments, is a big investor in quant-related hedge fund firms and has put billions of dollars toward these firms in recent years. The division now has $10 billion invested in quant-dedicated hedge fund firms, according to one person with direct knowledge of the firm; it has not publicly released the number.Some industry observers warn that hedge funds building out new quant arms may simply be trying to capture investor money that is flowing into the strategy. But veterans in the quant world see the trend as an indication that the industry is finally catching up to other industries in which technology has disrupted businesses.\u201cThe portfolio investment industry has been relatively late to adopting technology,\u201d said Philippe Jordan, the president of Capital Fund Management, a 25-year-old quant hedge fund firm that manages $6.9 billion. \u201cFinance is deeply conservative in nature,\u201d he added.Capital Fund Management has 160 employees, including 40 scientists, most of whom hold Ph.D.s in physics; 75 employees are focused on information technology, 20 of which are in data management. Like other types of hedge funds, the firm has a research department. The only difference is that at Capital Fund Management, the analysts who conduct research approach the work more like academics, and ideas are peer-reviewed.With more investor money going toward firms that build models to trade on, there is some concern that these models will begin to look similar, potentially resulting in overcrowding. That could be a problem if there is a sudden event that drives everyone to start selling at the same time, something that happened during the \u201cquant crunch\u201d in the summer of 2007. Over one week in August, AQR Capital Management, D. E. Shaw and Renaissance Technologies were all hit with huge losses as the housing market began to show signs of collapse. With similar models and huge positions, the losses each firm suffered were amplified.Mr. Shen at BlackRock thinks there are fewer risks this time around. \u201cThe diversity of data allows people to do a lot of different things,\u201d he said.Back in his San Francisco office, employees are using computers to create models for parsing the scripts from corporate quarterly financial earnings calls. At times, these computers are thinking faster than those who are using them.\u201cThe machines are certainly doing more and more, so humans should worry there is a human replacement factor,\u201d Mr. Shen said.\u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cultimately I do think it is the human who creates the machine and these techniques.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Though separation of the chairman and chief executive roles is a plus, Mr. Weinberg\u2019s arrival means there will be three insiders on what will become a 10-person board.These ought to be manageable issues. After all, advising on mergers and acquisitions is as much about personalities as finance; turmoil at the top of an advisory firm is simply bad for business.

{"Headline": "Japan\u2019s Nuclear Industry Finds a Lifeline in India After Foundering Elsewhere", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 Despite objections from antinuclear campaigners, Japan\u2019s government cleared the way on Friday for companies that build nuclear power plants to sell their technology to India \u2014 one of the few nations planning big expansions in atomic energy \u2014 by signing a cooperation agreement with the South Asian country.With the domestic market moribund, Japanese companies had been pursuing deals abroad, but success was elusive.The economic case for nuclear energy has weakened as a result of low oil and gas prices, prompting utilities and governments around the world to rethink construction. The Fukushima disaster increased safety concerns. And Japanese vendors have had to fight lower-cost rivals from places like Russia and South Korea for a shrinking number of customers.India looks like a rare opportunity. It is planning 20 new reactors over the next decade or so, and as many as 55 more have been proposed. Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, and Narendra Modi, his Indian counterpart, are hoping that trade can underpin a broader strategic relationship, aimed in part at fending off China.The nuclear deal has nonetheless drawn criticism in Japan. India possesses atomic weapons and has kept itself outside the international legal framework against proliferation. Because of that, many in Japan, which was hit by two nuclear bombs in World War II, would prefer not to establish ties with nuclear power.Left-leaning Japanese newspapers have published editorials against the Indian deal, and the mayors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the bombed cities, have issued pleas to stop it. Formal negotiations by the two governments lasted six years. Other countries have already begun allowing nuclear-related exports to India, including the United States, which signed a similar accord a decade ago.\u201cThere was a huge outcry when the government first said it would pursue this\u201d in 2010, said Masaaki Fukunaga, a professor at the Center for South Asian Studies at Gifu Women\u2019s University in Gifu, Japan, who has followed the issue closely. \u201cThe industry and the government were determined.\u201dMr. Abe said Japan had reserved the right to stop nuclear exports if India conducted another nuclear weapons test. \u201cThere is a legal framework to ensure India\u2019s responsible and peaceful use of technology,\u201d he said.Japanese leaders say they are looking to support more than just the nuclear industry. National economic growth may be at stake. As Japan has become less competitive in sectors like consumer electronics, big industrial projects are being counted on to fill the gap.In addition to the nuclear accord signed on Friday, Mr. Abe and Mr. Modi agreed to explore plans to build additional high-speed rail lines in India based on Japan\u2019s Shinkansen bullet-train technology. Construction on a previously agreed line from Mumbai to Ahmedabad will begin in 2023, the leaders said. Japan will help finance the project with low-interest loans.Japan\u2019s push to become a global infrastructure powerhouse has had setbacks. Vietnam\u2019s legislature scrapped plans in 2010 for a Shinkansen train line, citing costs, and is reportedly close to canceling plans for a proposed Japanese-built nuclear power station. Indonesia chose a Chinese group\u2019s bid last year to build a high-speed rail line over a Japanese bid that had been considered the favorite.South Korea underbid Japan to win a contract to build the first nuclear reactors in the United Arab Emirates. And Tokyo Electric Power, owner of the ruined power station in Fukushima, pulled out of a bid to build and run a nuclear power station in Turkey. A Japanese-French consortium ultimately won the Turkish contract in 2013, after a strong diplomatic push from Mr. Abe, but it remains the only successful Japanese nuclear-plant sale since the Fukushima accident.The bet on India is no sure thing. Nuclear plants can take decades to plan and build, and proposals to develop them are vulnerable to political and economic shifts. The Indian government must find new locations for some proposed plants because of local protests. And even for countries that have already signed nuclear trade agreements with India, little actual business has materialized so far, in part because of an Indian law that opens hardware vendors to potentially unlimited liability claims in the case of accidents.India has been working with the United States and other countries to create a framework for minimizing vendors\u2019 liability risk, including the creation of a domestic accident compensation fund. Officials hope to complete it next year.If that hurdle can be overcome, the first Japanese company to benefit from the agreement with India will most likely be Toshiba, whose American subsidiary Westinghouse has won conditional approval to build six reactors in India. Westinghouse uses components from Japan, including reactor-containment vessels built in Japanese steelworks, so the deal signed on Friday is essential to moving forward.Advertisement"}

Still, she enjoys living in a neighborhood in transition: \u201cI could feel the change in the air.

{"Headline": "\u2018Economic Tsunami\u2019: Fearing Donald Trump, Immigrants in New York Spend Less", "Date": "2016-11-23", "News": "Supported byIn Jackson Heights, Queens, days after the presidential election, an Indian-American jeweler was left holding an order of two custom men\u2019s gold rings worth $3,000. The customer told him he could not pay; he had to go back to his home country before he could be deported.At the furniture store Casa Dominicana on St. Nicholas Avenue in Upper Manhattan, the white leather sofas and bedroom sets have not been selling, the manager, Wendy Calderon, said. \u201cMost people are afraid to go out and shop,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are saving their money if anything crazy happens.\u201dThose most worried are undocumented immigrants, whom Mr. Trump during the campaign vowed to deport. Some 574,000 city residents are undocumented, and they pay $793 million a year in state and local taxes, according to a study commissioned by the City Council speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, a Democrat.About 10 percent of the city\u2019s workers are unauthorized, according to United States census figures, although an accurate count is hard to determine.It is likewise impossible to separate the underground economy from New York\u2019s larger economy, because the city is home to immigrants of every kind of legal status, like day laborers, taxi drivers, kitchen workers in restaurants owned by undocumented immigrants who pay taxes, and college-educated entrepreneurs who have temporary protection from deportation.If they were to leave the city, either by returning on their own to their home countries or by government order, \u201cit could be a massive ripple effect,\u201d Jonathan Bowles, executive director of the Center for an Urban Future, said.\u201cYou take away upwards of a half-million undocumented immigrants,\u201d Mr. Bowles added, \u201cand these are folks that pay taxes, that spend money in their communities, that may be employing other New Yorkers. And we could see others take flight.\u201dDr. Bastida had a dire prediction: \u201cIt will be an economic tsunami.\u201dElizabeth Vilchis, a technology entrepreneur who came to New York as a child from Mexico, said, \u201cBecause we\u2019re always in the backdrop, people don\u2019t realize the impact we have.\u201dHis constituents, he said, were saying: \u201cWhy not just slow down the expenditures? Because I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to need this money to defend myself.\u2019\u201dThat mentality is not prevalent only among low-wage workers. Cris Mercado, the founder of two start-up ventures, is doing the same. Mr. Mercado came to the United States as a child from the Philippines.But his financial clock is ticking, he said. \u201cI have about two months to really ramp up the next iteration of my app and also to secure the many independent contracting opportunities,\u201d Mr. Mercado said. \u201cI\u2019m really trying to hoard resources and cash, because I don\u2019t know what\u2019s next.\u201dErnesto Cury, a Dominican-born accountant in Jackson Heights, said that since the election, several clients had inquired about the tax implications of taking out their profits from restaurants, cleaning services and construction companies. Even if they are not legal permanent residents, Mr. Cury explained, immigrants can be self-employed, form a corporation and then pay taxes using an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, because they do not qualify for Social Security.In Queens, the self-employment rate of foreign-born people is 12 percent, according to the Center for an Urban Future, compared with 6.4 percent of those who are native-born.Juan Ospina, a naturalized citizen from Colombia, runs two businesses: Mama Empanada y Algo Mas on 82nd Street in Jackson Heights, and a contracting company that recently finished building a nearby hair salon. He says he relies on day laborers who are undocumented, and cannot imagine what would happen if they were not available.\u201cI don\u2019t believe that Trump will kick out the engine,\u201d Mr. Ospina said.But many undocumented immigrants are now wondering whether he will. In Bushwick, Brooklyn, curve-enhancing Colombian jeans are staying on the rack at a neighborhood store. Customers from Ecuador have told the Mexican-born owner, Maria de los Santos, that they might need any extra money in the coming year to move their families.At Patricia Salazar\u2019s clothing and catchall store on Roosevelt Avenue off 82nd Street in Jackson Heights, two customers told her last week that they were leaving the country. And her longtime hairdresser, who worked at a salon up the block, said she was going back to Colombia the next day.Ms. Salazar, who immigrated from Bolivia 30 years ago, said she had been a supporter of Mr. Trump because she thought he would be good for business. But now, even though her children and grandchildren are United States citizens, she is thinking of returning home.\u201cI don\u2019t want to live with this thing in my heart, because I am scared,\u201d she said.Around the corner from her store, Dr. Bastida and his daughter, Araceli Thornton, who manages his practice, were wondering whether they might have to combine practices with one of the other dental offices that line 82nd Street, all of them catering to the neighborhood\u2019s immigrant population.They see how the businesses in the area are interwoven. \u201cIt is a circle,\u201d Dr. Bastida said. \u201cOne that buys here later eats food from there.\u201dPerhaps the most ubiquitous symbol of New York\u2019s immigrant-driven economy is the bicycle-riding food deliverer.Soon after Ms. Vilchis, the entrepreneur, graduated from City College of New York with a degree in mechanical engineering, she helped create a start-up technology company to optimize food delivery in the Manhattan neighborhoods of Hell\u2019s Kitchen and Chelsea.She employed undocumented immigrants to deliver food at $15 an hour \u2014 a job that usually pays $7.50, she said. The most frequent orders came from finance professionals who had no time to leave their desks, which led Ms. Vilchis to another conclusion: Time is another currency propelling the city\u2019s economy, with lower-paid, often-undocumented workers performing tasks that higher-paid professionals are willing to outsource, including the delivery of pad Thai to their desks.\u201cA lot of people who are successful in the city, it is because there are immigrants to fill the roles that let them use their time to advance their careers,\u201d Ms. Vilchis said. \u201cIf we take that away, the whole thing crashes.\u201dTeodelina Basavilbaso contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Woman Who Has Transformed English National Ballet", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Artistic director, star ballerina, lobbyist, wrangler, psychologist, spokeswoman. Tamara Rojo, the artistic director of English National Ballet, is one busy woman.Does she sleep? \u201cAs a dancer, you learn focus,\u201d Ms. Rojo said.Looking pale and slightly drawn, Ms. Rojo, even so, appeared full of energy in an interview earlier this month at the company\u2019s headquarters near Royal Albert Hall. Every day, she said, involves a juggling act between dancing and directorial duties, with her attention constantly pulled among the needs of her dancers, administrative meetings and performing.And last year, she formed an association with Sadler\u2019s Wells that has given English National Ballet a London base to showcase its contemporary work. That is \u201cthe kind of risk-taking that a touring ballet company can\u2019t otherwise do in this climate,\u201d Debra Craine, the chief dance critic for The London Times, said in an email, referring to Britain\u2019s recent cuts in arts financing.Ms. Rojo has a narrow path to walk between popular appeal and artistic innovation. English National Ballet (called London Festival Ballet until 1989) was founded in 1950 by the British ballet stars Alicia Markova and Anton Dolin with the aim of taking ballet to the provinces. The troupe still has a touring obligation, and with subsidies at a much lower level than those of Royal Ballet, it depends on box-office certainties like \u201cSwan Lake,\u201d \u201cSleeping Beauty\u201d and an annual \u201cNutcracker.\u201d (The company\u2019s annual budget is about $19 million, with $7.5 million coming from Arts Council England, a government body.)\u201cI\u2019ve seen so many directors come through E.N.B. over the years \u2014 some of them with visionary ideas,\u201d Judith Mackrell, a dance critic for The Guardian, said in an email. \u201cAll were defeated by cautiousness of the board and by the company\u2019s remit from Arts Council England to deliver ballet to the regions.\u201dMs. Rojo, who danced with English National Ballet for three years before joining Royal Ballet in 2000, doesn\u2019t mean to lose. \u201cI actually saw advantages in most of the things people thought of as problems,\u201d she said. \u201cTouring means you can really build young artists by giving them proper time onstage. And the beauty of rivaling the Royal is that we can really create an identity of our own. How should we look at the classical repertory and perform it today?\u201dBallet has been her passion since she was 5, Ms. Rojo said, when she first glimpsed a class (\u201cit was a revelation\u201d) after school in Madrid, where she grew up. Her parents were not well off and made sacrifices to send her to an excellent ballet school, run by Victor Ullate, whose company she joined at 16. After winning the Paris International Dance Competition in 1994, she left Madrid to join Scottish National Ballet, where she spent just six months before being approached by Derek Deane, then the director of English National Ballet.She didn\u2019t think about directing a company, she said, until Spain\u2019s government approached her in 2006, when she was with Royal Ballet. \u201cThe president wanted something like an English National Ballet for Spain, a touring company, and he wanted to know what it would cost, what infrastructure would it need, would I take on?\u201d Ms. Rojo said. \u201cI felt it was too early for me, but I began to do the research, and I realized that I wanted to know as much as possible about how to run a company.\u201d (The Spanish government did not go ahead with the project.)Ms. Rojo is a leader, said Alistair Spalding, the artistic director of Sadler\u2019s Wells. \u201cShe is out there, looking for ideas, making things happen, looking for connections, a brilliant networker,\u201d he said. \u201cDespite the financial restrictions, she has been able to be more fleet of foot than she would have been at the Royal. The challenges for her are to raise enough money, and keep audience numbers up.\u201d\u201cToday, a ballet company will invest on average 1.8 million pounds\u201d \u2014 $2.25 million \u2014 \u201con a new production, then give themselves two days onstage because it\u2019s just too expensive,\u201d Ms. Rojo said. \u201cCompare that, again, with theater and its weeks of previews. But it\u2019s the same audience. Right now, we are asking them to somehow bear with us, and I don\u2019t want that. I want you to be moved and impressed and intrigued and overwhelmed. I want audiences to have the highest expectations.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Trump president of the United States.\u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of mistrust between the people and their government in Washington, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing a result like this,\u201d said Ken Merrifield, 53, the mayor of Franklin, N.H. \u201cIt\u2019s a revolution.\u201dOn Tuesday evening at an election party here, Dennis M. English Jr. stood in the crowd in a tailored suit, clutching a fat celebratory cigar. He jabbed a fist in the air as Fox News recorded victory after victory for Mr. Trump.\u201cThis isn\u2019t all white people!\u201d yelled Mr. English, who is black. \u201cMinorities are voting for Trump, I\u2019m telling you!\u201d (Exit polls showed 87 percent of Mr. Trump\u2019s vote came from whites; 2 percent came from blacks.)Mr. English is the director of a state office that helps businesses owned by minorities compete for government contracts. In his work, he said, he had toured some of the most depressed counties in eastern North Carolina. Before Mr. Trump, he said, it seemed that few politicians were addressing the grievances of people who were economically wounded by free-trade deals that hastened the downfall of the textile industry.\u201cWe need to get those jobs back,\u201d Mr. English said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be on the ground. I\u2019m talking thousands of people who are walking around those counties unemployed.\u201dIn Wisconsin, Beth Schmidt, chairwoman of the Rock County Republican Party, said she woke up Wednesday morning feeling happy but a little stupefied.\u201cAs a Republican, I should be bouncing off the walls,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know what to think.\u201dMs. Schmidt, a 58-year-old mother of three adult children, is fervently against abortion. She feels that welfare is necessary, but that it has become overused. She was not one of Mr. Trump\u2019s earliest supporters, instead favoring Marco Rubio or Carly Fiorina in the primary season. But she \u201cmoved forward\u201d in the general election, deciding to vote for Mr. Trump in the end.She is convinced that Mr. Trump will surround himself with smart and experienced people. \u201cI think that you\u2019re going to see that he will, surprisingly, bring people together,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to pray for this. As time goes on, people are going to see a different Trump.\u201dTo Mark Harris, a businessman from Georgia, Mr. Trump\u2019s indecorous outbursts and often crude behavior were a price worth paying for the shake-up he believed Mr. Trump would bring to government.\u201cA lot of the American people can put aside him being rough around the edges to take the chance on the change that he talked about,\u201d he said.Mr. Harris, 49, a retailer in one of Atlanta\u2019s northern suburbs, could hardly contain his glee over Tuesday\u2019s outcome. It was, he said, an unrestrained rejection of politicians, lobbyists and the news media. \u201cThe American people are sick and tired of the government in Washington, D.C.,\u201d he said.But he also had a warning for Mr. Trump: Break your promises at your peril.\u201cIn four years\u2019 time, we\u2019ll see if he\u2019s smart enough to be able to go through with what he\u2019s promised the American people,\u201d Mr. Harris said. \u201cIf he\u2019s able to put into motion what he has proposed over this election, he will win in four years, hands down.\u201dJoseph Connor, of Bergen County, N.J., said it was the general principles in Mr. Trump\u2019s message that were more important, particularly the idea of getting government out of the way of commerce.\u201cI think it\u2019s time to shed regulation and let Americans do great things in the world,\u201d said Mr. Connor, who works in finance and belies the stereotype of Trump voters as working class and rural. \u201cAnd I see that in Trump.\u201dAt Republicans\u2019 election night party in Phoenix, a pair of friends, Linda M. Wright and Susan Cheatham, pumped their fists and thanked Jesus for Mr. Trump\u2019s victory.\u201cHe\u2019s not going to raise our taxes,\u201d said Ms. Wright, 58, of Phoenix.\u201cHe\u2019s going to protect our borders,\u201d said Ms. Cheatham, 53, of Scottsdale.\u201cHe won\u2019t take our weapons away,\u201d Ms. Wright said.\u201cHe will appoint Supreme Court justices who will protect our Constitution,\u201d Ms. Cheatham said.\u201cYeah, protect the Constitution \u2014 that\u2019s key,\u201d Ms. Wright concluded.They agreed that Mr. Trump represents their version of America: a place that loves God and cares for its military.\u201cNobody has the right to come into our country and steal it from me,\u201d Ms. Wright said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like our country, don\u2019t move here. Don\u2019t come here and try to impose your religion on us.\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d Ms. Cheatham said, \u201cShariah law.\u201d\u201cThe great mass of his supporters, the overwhelming white vote, they also have a right to respect their heritage, their values,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe he\u2019s really an advocate of Western Christian civilization.\u201dBut Mr. Duke rejected the idea that racism was part of Mr. Trump\u2019s message. So did Bridg Webb, 21, who was walking into a celebratory Republican rally at the Rice-Eccles football stadium of the University of Utah on Tuesday.On the way, Mr. Webb said, someone drove by him and shouted, \u201cNazis!\u201d That, he said, was exactly what Mr. Trump\u2019s opponents \u2014 in the news media, on the left, in urban centers \u2014 failed to grasp about voters like him.\u201cI\u2019ve been called a bigot; I\u2019ve been called a white supremacist,\u201d he said. \u201cI pride myself on being a good guy. I go out of my way to help people. All these things are so unfair, and it\u2019s all because I said I like Donald Trump.\u201dHe worried the American economy would not have a stable job for him. He hopes to become a police officer, and he worried that Mrs. Clinton would pass gun restrictions that could disarm law enforcement. Mr. Trump, he said, was a balm for those fears.Supporters like Jeanne Koval, 57, and her husband, Alan, 59, see themselves as part of a global movement against corrupt governments run by insiders. The couple, who hail from Fenton, Mich., were playing the slots on the Las Vegas Strip on Tuesday night.Ms. Koval, a nurse, compared her support for Mr. Trump to the support that the Filipino nurses she works with have shown for the president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte.\u201cThey were tired of the corruption, and they want someone who can get something done,\u201d she said.Neither could specifically say what change they wanted Mr. Trump to make, but they voiced concern about rising health care costs and jobs going overseas. Ms. Koval said her parents\u2019 health care premiums recently increased $600 a month.In Utah, Olivia Blackham, who was adopted from Guatemala as a baby, voted for Mr. Trump in her first presidential election.She did so in large part because, she said, she believed America\u2019s immigration system was broken.Ms. Blackham said she had been frustrated after working with refugees who received free health care while her middle-class friends and family had to pay high premiums and hundreds of dollars for prescriptions. She said she believed Mr. Trump could fix that.\u201cI\u2019m really passionate about getting it straight,\u201d she said.But as the reality set in that Mr. Trump would become the 45th president of the United States, Ms. Blackham, 34, expressed a lingering uneasiness.\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be scary,\u201d Ms. Blackham said. \u201cWe\u2019re in for a change.\u201dReporting was contributed by Katharine Q.

{"Headline": "Sentence Structure", "Date": "2016-11-22", "News": "Supported byWordplayWEDNESDAY PUZZLE \u2014 Not bad for a midweek outing. David Steinberg is back, and he offers us a fresh theme that eluded me for a bit, but was very \u201cgettable\u201d as soon as I solved the first theme entry which, for me, was FLASH MOBSTER.Not only that, but a piece of trivia that will win you bets at the bar makes its return after a three-year absence. Stay tuned in the Tricky Clues section, because you will be able to amaze and astound your friends with this one.We have a four-entry theme set that attaches the suffix -STER to one of the words in each theme entry, which changes the meaning and allows the constructor to clue the resulting phrase punnily.All four of the theme entries made me smile, although I wish that they had all been people (the exception is HIPSTER FLASK), to make the set perfectly consistent.\u25a0 1A: I am woefully derelict when it comes to visiting fast food chains, although I admit to a once-a-year pilgrimage to Burger King for a Whopper. I knew that A AND W sold beverages like root beer, but was not aware that they have restaurants. #NowIKnow\u25a0 22A: I initially misread this as \u201cFinance initials\u201d and put in IPO (for Initial Public Offering), because I already had the P in PROLE at 23D. Once I reread the clue and solved around it, I realized that the answer was APR, for Annual Percentage Rate.\u25a0 65A: \u201cSentence structure?\u201d is not a critique on grammar. Think about it this way: If you have received a sentence, the structure you will most likely be living in is a jail CELL.\u25a0 3D: N.R.A. is the answer. It\u2019s wordplay on the fact that guns are sometimes called \u201cpieces.\u201dThis puzzle is a relatively recent construction. I\u2019d been making only themeless puzzles for the preceding few months, which was a blast, but I found myself craving the satisfaction of getting a theme to work. My original theme set for this one was HIPSTERS DON\u2019T LIE, WHAT A DUMPSTER, DRAGSTER QUEEN and SWITCH TEAMSTERS. Will and Joel liked the idea but justifiably felt it was a bit inconsistent. Two of the theme entries added STER before an S, and DUMP \u2192 DUMPSTER wasn\u2019t much of a change in meaning. After numerous back-and-forths, we settled on the current theme set. I still have a soft spot for HIPSTERS DON\u2019T LIE, but the new theme entries are definitely better!The only problem was that I now had to build a grid around two 12-letter theme entries and two 13-letter theme entries, a cruciverbal nightmare! I knew that no matter what I did, I\u2019d be stuck with more crosswordese than would be ideal. So I decided to focus on making the long and midlength entries shine as much as possible. My original grid had blocks dividing up CHASE SCENE and OPEN SEASON, but I chose to remove them after noticing that they didn\u2019t really improve the fill quality. And besides, having more long entries is always nice.I hope you all enjoy the puzzle and have a happy Thanksgiving! I turn 20 tomorrow, which is super exciting ... though I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll have stomach space for both pumpkin pie and birthday cake.You can only try, Mr. Steinberg. Happy birthday!Your thoughts?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Immigrants Who Came to U.S. as Children Fear Deportation Under Trump", "Date": "2016-11-19", "News": "Supported bySince then Mr. Roa, now 29, has put himself through college and is training to be an architect, drafting blueprints at a Chicago firm.But with the election of Donald J. Trump as president, Mr. Roa and 750,000 other immigrants in the program, who came to the United States as children, have been swept up in a wave of anxiety, worried about losing the progress they have made and being forced back underground or even deported. Mr. Trump has promised to \u201cimmediately terminate\u201d Mr. Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration, including the youth initiative.With deep roots in the United States, and with many supporters in civil rights groups, universities and city governments already mobilizing to shield them, many who came here as youths said they were prepared to fight efforts to end the program or expel them from the country.\u201cI have been here for 27 years, and I am not going anywhere,\u201d Mr. Roa said, in between strategy sessions at Casa Michoac\u00e1n, a gathering place in Chicago where immigrants planned moves to resist.Young immigrants, who call themselves Dreamers, are already protesting at many colleges, and they have called for a march from New York to Washington starting Tuesday. They are pressing universities and employers to organize to defend the program and are making plans for havens on campuses and in churches.Most young people in the program are Latinos, and Latino organizations place a priority on protecting them, said Daniel Garza, the president of the Libre Initiative, a conservative Latino advocacy organization.\u201cThese kids are going to be exposed if DACA is rescinded and that\u2019s so unfair,\u201d Mr. Garza said. \u201cWe should be keeping families together, not tearing them apart.\u201dBut the program was set up through policy guidelines written by the secretary of Homeland Security at the time, Janet Napolitano \u2014 there is not even a formal presidential order \u2014 so it can be terminated with a stroke of a new secretary\u2019s pen.Another Trump adviser, Kris Kobach, the Republican secretary of state of Kansas, brought a federal lawsuit against the program in 2012; it did not succeed.Mr. Trump\u2019s pledges are chilling for the immigrants because when they signed up to the program, they provided identity information \u2014 including the names of their parents, home addresses, utility bills and school transcripts \u2014 to United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. The authorities deferred any action to deport them and gave them two-year renewable work permits, but no official immigration status.Administration officials said the citizenship agency could be asked to turn over that information to Homeland Security enforcement agents, who could track down the immigrants to deport them or their parents.Mr. Trump could also take a less harsh approach by allowing existing work permits to lapse and not approving new ones, but not initiating deportations.Advocacy groups have been inundated with calls from people afraid or despondent.Ruben Rivas, 27, a Mexican immigrant, said he had vacillated from fear to sadness to denial. In 2012 Mr. Rivas, the son of undocumented immigrants who spent their lives working minimum-wage jobs, graduated from San Jose State University with a degree in business finance.He applied that year for DACA, never stopping to worry about offering the government details about his life. Now he works as a financial consultant and co-owns a small income tax firm.\u201cThe first thought I had is that I have done everything right and it is all going to be taken away from me,\u201d he said of his fears for the future of the program. \u201cIt feels a little bit like a betrayal. I\u2019ve been here since I was 4 years old. I\u2019m an American.\u201dJennifer Marin, 29, a legal assistant, was brought to California from Guatemala when she was 1 year old. As a student at California State University, Dominguez Hills, she worked at a check-cashing store to pay her tuition. She applied for the program to get her driver\u2019s license, worried that one missed stop sign could send her to jail and deportation, a prospect she could not face with two children.Now she has a license, a car and a home in a Los Angeles suburb she bought with her savings.\u201cIt feels like a step backward, to be back in this insecure place where you don\u2019t know what the next step might be,\u201d she said, her voice breaking with tears. She has tried not to cry in front of her children and to assure them that she is safe.Last week, Mr. Obama appealed to Mr. Trump \u201cto think long and hard\u201d before scrapping the program.Dick Durbin of Illinois, the second-highest Senate Democrat, said on the floor and on Twitter that he would do \u201ceverything in my power\u201d to save the program and protect \u201cDreamers who have stepped forward to contribute\u201d to the country.Rights groups have been encouraging immigrants up for renewal on the program to reapply quickly. But they are generally urging newcomers not to apply.\u201cThe risk for everyone feels much larger than the potential benefit right now,\u201d said Daniel Sharp, the legal director of the Central American Resource Center, a nonprofit legal aid organization in Los Angeles. Groups are pressing the Obama administration to speed up approvals to eliminate any backlogs before Mr. Trump takes office.On Thursday three House Democrats, including Representative Luis V. Guti\u00e9rrez of Illinois, asked Mr. Obama to issue a pardon to immigrants in the program. But White House officials said the president did not have the authority for a pardon that would provide lasting protection.If their work permits are canceled or expire, immigrants could face cascading consequences \u2014 losing jobs, driver\u2019s licenses, professional certificates and the chance to pay in-state tuition for college. The impact would vary by state. In places like California \u2014 home to half of all DACA recipients \u2014 and New York, additional protections are enshrined in laws. But in the South and Midwest where there are fewer protections, \u201cpeople might find they really stand out and are targeted,\u201d said Roberto Gonzales, a Harvard professor who has studied young people in the program.Yet there were signs that young immigrants, who have been battling for a legal foothold in the United States for more than a decade, would not go back underground quietly.United We Dream, a national organization of young immigrants, said it would work with Voto Latino, a voter mobilization group, to encourage colleges to create havens for students who become undocumented once again. At the University of Houston, students organized a walkout on Monday and are working with local activists to designate the city as a sanctuary for undocumented immigrants.Mr. Roa, in Chicago, recalled that a decade ago he was afraid to confess his undocumented status to other students or have his photograph published in a newspaper.\u201cDo you really think we are going back in time?\u201d he asked. \u201cI am going to be kicking and screaming.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Buy a Car When You Have an Upside-Down Loan", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported byYour Money AdviserMORE people who trade in their car when buying a new vehicle are \u201cupside down,\u201d meaning that they owe more on their old auto loan than the car is worth, the automobile website Edmunds.com says.Edmunds estimates that 32 percent of trade-ins for new car purchases in the first nine months of this year had \u201cnegative equity,\u201d up from 30 percent for the same period last year. The upside-down shoppers had average negative equity of more than $4,800 at the time of trade-in, which Edmunds said is the highest since it began tracking such data in 2002.About a quarter of trade-ins from shoppers buying used cars also had negative equity, averaging $3,600, Edmunds said.Being upside down on a car loan is akin to being underwater on a mortgage, in that the asset securing the debt is worth less than the loan.Say that you owe $20,000 on a car now valued at $18,000. That means you have negative equity of $2,000. If you trade in your vehicle for a new car, you must make up that $2,000 somehow \u2014 either by writing a check or rolling the amount into your loan on the new car. It will then take longer to build equity in the new loan, too, meaning you could get stuck in a cycle of loans with negative equity.Several factors are converging to create negative equity, said Ron Montoya, senior consumer advice editor with Edmunds. New cars have always lost value quickly, as soon as they are driven off the dealer\u2019s lot. But now, as cars have become more expensive, auto loans are several years longer than they once were. The average new car loan for borrowers with good credit is now 68 months \u2014 five and a half years \u2014 while the average used-car loan is 63 months, according to data from Experian Automotive.\u201cIt\u2019s a symptom of long-term loans,\u201d Mr. Montoya said.The estimated average new car price was nearly $35,000 in October, up more than 2 percent from a year earlier, according to Kelley Blue Book. And the average loan amount for a new car was about $30,000, up from nearly $29,000 a year earlier, second-quarter data from Experian showed.Longer loans help keep monthly payments lower and enable borrowers to afford a more expensive car. But the long-term loans also mean it takes more time to build equity. And since buyers might tire of their cars after a few years, they are more likely to be upside down should they decide to buy a new car halfway through their loan.\u201cA long-term loan doesn\u2019t necessarily keep the consumer in the car longer,\u201d said Melinda Zabritski, senior director of automotive finance at Experian.Being upside down may not pose a problem, as long as things are going well. But if you had an unforeseen financial setback and had to sell the car, you may have to come up with extra cash at a time when you may not be flush. Or, if your car is wrecked or stolen, you may find your insurer won\u2019t pay out enough to retire the loan, said Tony Giorgianni, associate money editor for Consumer Reports.\u201cThat\u2019s a terrible situation to be in,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re putting yourself in a position where you\u2019re really at risk.\u201dIf you find yourself upside down on your car loan, the most financially sound thing to do is to hang on to your old car until you pay down the debt enough to have equity. To do so faster, you can make extra payments toward the loan\u2019s principal.Still determined to get a new car? You could look for incentive offers like cash-back rebates that could help cancel the effect of the negative equity, Mr. Montoya said.Here are some questions and answers about car loans:When shopping, consider whether you really can afford the model you want to buy. If it\u2019s necessary to take out a six-year loan to afford the monthly payment, it may be wise to choose a less expensive ride, said Mr. Giorgianni of Consumer Reports.A rule of thumb is 20-4-10: Put at least 20 percent down in the form of cash or a trade-in, finance the car with a loan of no more than four years and make sure the monthly expenses, including the car payment and insurance costs, are no more than 10 percent of your gross income. If you can\u2019t abide by that rule, Mr. Giorgianni said, \u201cthen you can\u2019t afford the car.\u201dMr. Montoya of Edmunds also suggests taking more than a single, short test drive before settling on a car to reduce the chance of buying an unsuitable model that you will want to trade in when you\u2019re more likely to be upside down.He recalled a very tall shopper who traded in his small car soon after purchasing it. He was simply too cramped driving it each day. Do your research, Mr. Montoya said, and consider how you will need to use the car over time.The Federal Trade Commission warns consumers to be especially careful when trading in a car with negative equity. Some dealerships may advertise that they will pay off your old car loan if you buy a new car from them. But if your trade-in has negative equity, the dealer may quietly roll the shortage into your new loan.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Hide $400 Million", "Date": "2016-11-30", "News": "FeatureWhen a wealthy businessman set out to divorce his wife, their fortune vanished. The quest to find it would reveal the depths of an offshore financial system bigger than the U.S. economy.Supported byPursglove grew up in a working-class family. She did not consider herself to be a complicated person, or a greedy one. Recent events in her life had, however, inculcated a newfound habit of suspicion. Her husband\u2019s tirades, his frequent absences and threats to leave, had led inexorably to the day when she tailed him through the streets of Toronto and caught him picking up an interior designer for what appeared to be a romantic ski getaway. She had been with Oesterlund since she was 25 and scraping by as a cruise ship\u2019s photographer. Now, as she assessed her crumbling marriage and girded for divorce, she wondered what else she didn\u2019t know.Pursglove would soon learn, however, that navigating this offshore archipelago is not easy. In any given year, trillions of dollars sit safely in the offshore financial world, effectively stateless, protected by legions of well-compensated defenders and a tangle of laws deliberately designed to impede creditors and tax collectors. Even the United States government finds it challenging: A special Internal Revenue Service division known as the \u201cwealth squad,\u201d set up in 2010 to crack down on high-end tax evaders with multinational holdings, today has enough manpower to assess only about 200 cases a year.Pursglove would rely on her own wealth squad: a pair of highly creative lawyers, using Pursglove herself as the ultimate informant. It would take them more than two years and millions of dollars to breach the defenses of the offshore financial world. Their efforts would leave a trail of thousands of pages of court documents through Canada and the United States, revealing the inner workings of a system exquisitely engineered to repel scrutiny.But much of her family\u2019s financial situation was still a mystery when she first saw the bank statement on her husband\u2019s desk in the Bahamas, Pursglove later told me. She packed the laptop and documents, left her suitcase near the front door and went for one last walk on their beach. When she returned to the house, the caretaker was nowhere to be seen. A different member of the household staff, a kindly older man who tended to the landscaping and washed the family boats, had already put her suitcase into a waiting taxicab. She hugged him goodbye and drove to the airport.When she opened her suitcase at the security line, there was no laptop. No paperwork. It was all gone.Living in Florida and New York, they started a series of companies. Oesterlund came up with most of the ideas, Pursglove would later state in court filings, and ran the companies day to day. Pursglove hired the employees, trained them and helped manage the offices. Their earliest success was a direct-mail firm called Credit Key Express, which promised credit cards to people with bad credit. Later they started Columbia House-style online membership clubs that sold discounted movie posters, books, DVDs, even dietary supplements. Xacti, which came to enfold most of their ventures, sold banner ads, video games and various other kinds of software, including \u201ctoolbars\u201d that promised to clean viruses off your computer or free up space on your hard drive. The businesses threw off enormous amounts of cash, and by the mid-2000s, Oesterlund and his wife had become wildly rich. They bought a $5 million house back in Finland and their first yacht, a 48-foot cruiser.Pursglove is 47, with a round, watchful face and well-kept brown hair. I first met her in the spring of 2015, over coffee in New York. She rarely smiled, and I found her unexpectedly reserved for the wife of a jet-setting, large-living entrepreneur. She explained that Oesterlund was the flamboyant one, an insecure man ruined by his sudden wealth. \u201cI was his stop button \u2014 \u2018No, we don\u2019t need it,\u2019\u2009\u201d Pursglove told me. \u201cHe was kind of never content. He always needed to buy the next thing.\u201d In 2007, they bought their first private jet, and then a bigger boat, an 82-footer that Pursglove named Integrity. She liked the name, she explained. \u201cAt the time, Robert was \u2014 I thought he had integrity.\u201dNot everyone agreed. In 1999, the Florida attorney general sued to shut down Credit Key Express, saying that it misled customers into thinking they would receive preapproved credit cards. (In fact, all they got for their money was a list of banks that might give them credit cards.) Some years after Credit Key Express shut down, the Florida attorney general came after Xacti\u2019s club businesses, claiming that Oesterlund\u2019s companies had again misled customers. According to court filings, they had abused what are known as \u201cnegative options\u201d: Customers would provide their credit card number for a \u201ctrial offer,\u201d only to be charged a monthly fee, disclosed in the fine print and difficult to cancel.When the investigations began, in 2009, Pursglove was living with the two children in Boca Raton, but Oesterlund lived on Integrity in the Bahamas, unable to join them. He had overstayed an earlier visa, and the United States denied him a green card. The denial and the investigations enraged him, Pursglove told me. He employed dozens of people in Florida, he fumed, and had provided the United States millions of dollars in tax revenue. He told his wife their businesses were being unfairly harassed by bureaucrats. Going forward, Pursglove explained, \u201che wanted to pay as little taxes as possible to the U.S.\u201dIn 2011, they went into contract on the penthouse in Toronto, hoping to unite the family eventually in Canada and establish residency for Oesterlund there. While it was being renovated, they bought yet another boat, the 165-foot yacht they named D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu, and spent a year sailing around Europe and the Caribbean, with tutors for the kids. But their relationship would soon grow strained. Oesterlund later testified that their marriage was a \u201crocky ride ever since the start,\u201d but Pursglove blamed their new lifestyle. Somewhere along the way, she told me, Oesterlund had fallen in with a tribe of wealthy globe-trotting nomads and minor celebrities. He befriended Kevin O\u2019Leary, a judge from \u201cShark Tank,\u201d she says, and partied at the Maya-themed Lyford Cay estate of Peter Nygard, the Finnish-Canadian retail mogul. Oesterlund\u2019s money and his boat attracted hangers-on and women, Pursglove says.By his wife\u2019s account, some of Oesterlund\u2019s new friends also began tutoring him in how to minimize his taxes. (Oesterlund himself declined to comment for this article, as did most of the lawyers, accountants and financial advisers named in court records.) He traveled constantly, Pursglove says, in part to reduce the amount of taxes he would be required to pay to any of the countries where he owned a home. At the time, Pursglove told me, she regarded these efforts \u2014 spearheaded by a well-known Florida accounting firm, Daszkal Bolton \u2014 as aboveboard \u201ctax planning.\u201d But court records suggest that Oesterlund had begun exploring how to structure his business to insulate himself not just from taxes but also from future civil litigation. \u201cI want to have in writing a statement,\u201d he wrote to his lawyers in 2011, \u201cthat I can no longer be subject to Florida or U.S. law.\u201d Take every step necessary, he added, to \u201cremove myself from the country of Evil.\u201dIn 2012, Oesterlund and Pursglove moved with the children to Toronto; at the end of the year, Oesterlund raised the idea of separating, Pursglove says, and at the beginning of 2013 he flew to Dubai to party with friends. \u201cHe was backward and forward that year in Toronto,\u201d Pursglove says. \u201cI would ask, So, are we getting divorced? And he wouldn\u2019t do anything.\u201dIt was in early 2013, when she learned that her husband had sought to sell off Xacti, Pursglove told me, that she started to think about hiring lawyers of her own. \u201cYou want to throw me away like I was a piece of [expletive] and then take everything too,\u201d she emailed him one night.\u201cWomen get 10 percent in Russia by law,\u201d Oesterlund wrote back. \u201cIn Dubai they get 0 percent.\u201dWhen she asked for copies of documents related to the potential sale, her husband was livid. \u201cI am closing out all checking accounts on you now,\u201d he texted her. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to use my funds to pay some Jewish lawyer.\u201dThat night, he cut off her Xacti email account. \u201cWe will file papers and as I no longer own anything of value you get nothing then I can start a new company later in life,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWas it really worth it?\u201dI first began hearing about Fisher a few years ago, when he approached a college friend of mine, Zachary Potter, to join his practice. Potter was working at one of the country\u2019s largest law firms, advising Fortune 500 companies. He enjoyed the challenge, but the work could be stodgy: When Fisher called him, Potter was working a seven-year, $100 million case that hinged on federal leasing rules for long-haul trucking companies.Around the same time Potter moved to Palm Beach to join Fisher\u2019s firm, I began writing for The Times about the political activism of the very wealthy, much of it oriented around defending their fortunes from the predations of government. Our professional interests soon converged. We joked about spending our days trading phone calls with the same class of handlers, consultants and lawyers, hired by the rich to guard their wealth and privacy.One day last year, we caught up over drinks at a Palm Beach hotel. Potter was easy to spot: In a town of pastels and prints, he still favored charcoal suits and crisp white shirts. All around us was the chatter of lithe women and their expensively tailored, somewhat older male companions \u2014 inhabitants of a world at once ostentatious and opaque. As we sat down, Potter slid a neatly stapled stack of papers down the bar toward me. It was a court brief, Potter explained, one of hundreds he and Fisher had filed in a particularly knotty case involving a man named Robert Oesterlund. If I truly wanted to peer inside the hidden world of the superrich, Potter told me \u2014 and if I really wanted to understand how extremely wealthy people protected that wealth \u2014 I ought to read the case\u2019s public court file and judge for myself.Not long after, I met Fisher at his office in Florida, a modest fourth-floor space equipped with plush leather chairs and a sweeping view across the water to client-rich Palm Beach. At 61, Fisher is short and wiry, with thinning gray hair swept back over a high and gently tanned forehead. In a cross-examination, he stands erect, chest cocked, as if to fill the courtroom. When Fisher talks about working the Florida divorce circuit, he makes it sound almost fun. \u201cThe beauty of high-end divorce law it is that it is usually handled on an expedited basis,\u201d Fisher says. \u201cIf you\u2019re a person like me, who doesn\u2019t want a five-year-long case, there\u2019s nothing better.\u201dPursglove hired him about a year earlier, not long after seeing her husband with the interior designer. Oesterlund responded by filing for divorce in Canada \u2014 where Fisher could not personally represent Pursglove \u2014 and threatened to cut off his wife. She had $90,000 in the bank, not enough for a protracted legal battle. But she also had cellphone pictures of documents concerning something called a Cook Islands asset-protection trust, which she found a few months earlier. Oesterlund was listed as the \u201csettlor,\u201d the person who \u201cdonates\u201d property to a trust.The Cook trust was a bad sign. A typical estate-planning trust is designed to allow someone to benefit from a property \u2014 a car, a home, a plane, a bank account \u2014 without technically owning it or controlling it. An independent trustee, sometimes an individual, sometimes a specialized firm, is assigned to make decisions about the best use of the assets. That independence can, for example, provide a tax advantage or prevent a spendthrift beneficiary from plowing through an inheritance. But in some cases, the claim of independence is a sham. The trustees are puppets; the settlor still controls the asset in practice. And trusts organized in the Cook Islands, a self-governing state associated with New Zealand, are particularly difficult to investigate. Cook courts typically do not recognize American court orders, including divorce judgments. To sue a Cook trust, you have to actually fly to the Cook Islands, in the middle of the South Pacific, roughly 6,000 miles southwest of Florida. \u201cIt\u2019s like Switzerland used to be, but squared,\u201d Fisher told me. Once assets were hidden inside a Cook trust, he had learned, it was almost impossible to get them out.Emails in Pursglove\u2019s possession hinted at why Oesterlund might have found a Cook trust appealing. Searching through the trash folder on Pursglove\u2019s laptop, Fisher\u2019s paralegal found that the 2011 email she had been copied on \u2014 the one in which Oesterlund had asked his lawyers to remove him from \u201cthe country of Evil\u201d \u2014 also contained a reply from Xacti\u2019s corporate counsel, Jennifer Miller. She wrote that if Oesterlund created \u201ca parallel corporate structure of companies outside the U.S,\u201d moved his operations offshore and \u201cimplemented a personal asset protection strategy,\u201d he could become almost untouchable. Any money spent to sue him in the United States, Miller assured him, \u201cwould probably be wasted.\u201dThe documents in Pursglove\u2019s cellphone pictures showed corporations in the Caymans and Nevis, both well-known offshore financial centers. But she didn\u2019t know exactly what these companies did. Oesterlund had stopped making mortgage payments on the house in Boca Raton, she later said in court filings, and threatened to evict her mother and disabled aunt from a house they had bought in Wales. He warned Pursglove that he wouldn\u2019t pay any bills until she agreed to a settlement. \u201cYour mortgage of $20,000 was due on the first,\u201d he texted to Pursglove. \u201cLate fee $500 on Friday. Bad credit in 30 days. I recommend you pay it!\u201dFisher had to freeze Oesterlund\u2019s transactions in place until he could gather more evidence. The only way to do that, Fisher concluded, was to hit him from two sides at once. In late March 2014, Fisher filed a divorce action on behalf of Pursglove in Palm Beach County, hoping to wrest the divorce proceeding back to Florida from Canada. But he also prepared a related civil complaint, citing the Cook trust and Oesterlund\u2019s threatening emails: Oesterlund, Fisher wrote in court papers, was using illegal asset transfers to defraud his wife, the co-owner of his companies. One set of claims would leverage Pursglove\u2019s rights as a wife. The other, crucially, would leverage her rights as an owner.Within days, Fisher persuaded a judge in Palm Beach County, Jeffrey D. Gillen, to impose a sweeping asset injunction against Oesterlund, one that prohibited him from selling, merging or borrowing against any of his assets. The order would stop additional offshoring \u2014 if Oesterlund complied.Fisher also obtained a 2012 tax return for the family\u2019s holding company, RSOP. (The name is an anagram of Oesterlund and Pursglove\u2019s initials.) The return showed that RSOP had grossed more than $73.5 million that year, an amount that Pursglove says she found astonishing. But when Fisher scrutinized the tax return, he found something even more shocking. Despite the impressive grosses, RSOP was reporting ordinary business income of just $12,284. Virtually all the revenue had somehow evaporated.That was when \u2014 and why \u2014 Fisher dispatched Pursglove to the Bahamas: to gather clues about where the money went. When Pursglove returned to the house to confront the caretaker that day, she told me, the caretaker admitted removing the papers from her suitcase. Bahamian police took custody of the papers, but later, and for reasons they never explained, handed them over to Oesterlund. When Fisher tried to subpoena the papers back, Oesterlund\u2019s lawyers said he could not find any such documents; in any case, they wrote, Pursglove had no right to \u201cstolen\u201d materials.But back in Florida, Fisher\u2019s legal blitz was having the intended effect. In a rush to unfreeze his assets, Oesterlund invoked his right to an emergency hearing. That handed Fisher a crucial opening: Florida law now gave Fisher the right to demand documents, on a highly expedited basis, from any company or person who might have evidence relevant to the hearing. Shortly thereafter, Fisher\u2019s detailed requests began arriving on the desks of Oesterlund\u2019s bankers, his lawyers, his accountants and tax planners, his stockbroker and most of his senior executives. When the opposing parties finally met in Florida court in April 2014, the room was overflowing. Oesterlund had sent his divorce lawyers. The companies had their own lawyers. There were lawyers for the banks. There were lawyers for the accountants. Even some of the lawyers had lawyers.More important, some of these lawyers had brought thousands of pages of records with them to the hearing. Under normal discovery rules, Fisher might have spent months or years fighting for them. Instead, it took four days: Potter flipped through the boxes in the courtroom, yanking out whatever seemed interesting, while Fisher cross-examined witnesses on the fly. There were bank statements, emails between accountants and lawyers and a few organizational charts tantalizingly stamped \u201cconfidential.\u201d One piece of paper, from a lender called Fifth Third Bank, showed that Oesterlund had claimed a net worth of $400 million, even more than they thought. Other documents showed that Pursglove owned a third of RSOP.In Canadian court, Oesterlund accused his wife of making \u201cwild accusations\u201d and absconding with their two daughters to Florida. But Fisher now had a growing heap of evidence that not only bolstered Pursglove\u2019s claims but also rooted them in the Florida jurisdiction where his client lived and he practiced. Seeing the danger, Oesterlund\u2019s attorneys switched tactics, hoping to block the corporate fraud suit entirely and send Pursglove\u2019s divorce back to a Canadian judge. She was a resident of Toronto, they argued to Judge Gillen, and a Florida court had no jurisdiction over the divorce.For Pursglove and her husband, as for many members of the global 1 percent, \u201cresidency\u201d was an elusive and easily manipulated concept. Pursglove was a British citizen with a United States green card who now lived in Boca Raton. Oesterlund was a citizen of Finland who had also obtained a passport from Dominica. They had homes in at least four countries and spent a year living on their yacht. \u201cThese parties are global citizens of substantial means,\u201d Judge Gillen mused from the bench. \u201cTheir situation is a blessing and a privilege for them, but for this court, their lifestyle creates a challenge.\u201dGillen decided to split the difference. The divorce would stay in Toronto. But the civil litigation \u2014 the corporate fraud lawsuit \u2014 could proceed in Florida, where many of the family\u2019s companies were still run out of a Boca Raton office park. In late April, Fisher\u2019s assistants began stacking boxes of files in the hallway outside his office. A similar pile grew next door, outside Potter\u2019s office. In May, they started reading in depth.Omega didn\u2019t appear to have any employees. In fact, it seemed to consist of little more than a post office box in a government building in Nassau. But Omega did at one point have a lucrative contract with Oesterlund\u2019s Florida company, Xacti L.L.C., to pay search engines to advertise his websites. This contract appeared to be an extraordinarily bad deal for Xacti. For every dollar of advertising Xacti purchased, it also had to pay Omega \u2014 Oesterlund in corporate form \u2014 58 cents. For this privilege, Xacti also paid Oesterlund another $200,000 each month, personally, for \u201cmanagement services.\u201dOesterlund appeared to be charging his own companies to pay their bills, Fisher argued in court papers. He was charging them so much, in fact, that RSOP was making almost no net income. Yet Omega was taking in millions of dollars a year. With the stroke of his signature on a few pieces of paper, it appeared to Fisher, Oesterlund had used Omega to make virtually all of his family\u2019s United States tax liabilities disappear.What Oesterlund had done is known as \u201ctransfer pricing,\u201d a practice that has come under growing criticism in recent years. Multinational corporations use it to shift their costs to high-tax countries and their profits to low-tax countries. Often, there is little or no economic reality to these transactions. Apple, for example, is an American company headquartered in Cupertino, Calif. Most of the research and development that goes into an iPhone happens in California. But according to Apple, if you buy an iPhone in Europe or Asia, the intellectual-property rights contained in your phone actually belong to Apple subsidiaries in Ireland, where the company has negotiated for itself a special tax rate of around 2 percent. Apple charges those subsidiaries relatively little for the rights to this intellectual property, yet allows them to collect most of the money Apple makes from selling the phone. In 2011, the Irish subsidiaries \u2014 which conduct virtually none of Apple\u2019s research and build few of its products \u2014 collected two-thirds of Apple\u2019s 2011 worldwide pretax income.Fisher didn\u2019t have time to wait for the I.R.S. to take an interest in Oesterlund. He needed some other lever \u2014 a legal basis to look more closely into the myriad offshore entities that appeared to be connected to the Oesterlund companies. A solution presented itself when Fisher, searching online for Oesterlund\u2019s name one morning, learned about the long trail of consumer disputes Oesterlund\u2019s companies had left behind. Until he saw the settlement with the Florida attorney general, Fisher had assumed Oesterlund was running a basically legitimate internet business. Now he realized not only that Xacti had come under investigation, but also that the investigation created an opening for Pursglove. Oesterlund had signed a binding agreement with the Florida attorney general just nine months earlier: To keep Xacti from skipping out on refunds, the agreement barred Oesterlund from implementing \u201cany change in the form of doing business or organizational identity as a method of avoiding the terms and conditions set forth in this settlement agreement.\u201dFisher felt this was a pretty good description of what Oesterlund seemed to be doing with the offshore companies. Moreover, papers turned over at the hearing showed that Pursglove was the sole owner of an Xacti subsidiary that was subject to the same settlement. That meant Pursglove was also bound by its terms.This gave Fisher an idea. In May, he opened a third front, one that would give Pursglove her most powerful legal tool to begin peeling back the layers of her husband\u2019s finances. Intervening in the Florida attorney general\u2019s dormant case, he claimed that Oesterlund had embroiled Pursglove\u2019s company in a fraud against the people of Florida. The only way to stop it was for the court to drag the whole business \u2014 the Cook trust, the Nevis company and whatever else the court would let Fisher go find \u2014 back to Florida. To put it another way, Pursglove sued herself.Oesterlund\u2019s lawyers moved to toss this new lawsuit out of court too. Fisher thought he could become a kind of \u201cprivate attorney general,\u201d as he put it, pursuing Oesterlund for the public good. Oesterlund\u2019s lawyers saw it differently. It was \u201cunfounded, illogical, frivolous\u201d for Pursglove to sue herself and her husband on behalf of the attorney general, they argued. Oesterlund\u2019s personal lawyer, a veteran litigator named Gary Rosen, dismissed the lawsuit in court as \u201ca leverage point\u201d concocted by Fisher to pressure Oesterlund in the divorce. Oesterlund\u2019s offshore trust was not an elaborate scheme to defeat the settlement, the lawyers argued, but the normal estate planning of a wealthy and successful businessman. And Pursglove, they said, was no victim. She had been part of her husband\u2019s planning from the very beginning.Indeed, because Pursglove was a United States resident with a large ownership stake in several profitable United States businesses, she stood to pay far less in taxes if her husband could move the profits offshore. Moreover, both Pursglove and Fisher now stood to benefit from his new legal strategy: Lawyers are barred from working on contingency in divorces, but in the civil lawsuits, Fisher would be allowed to charge Pursglove a percentage of whatever money he could find and drag back to Florida.Strikingly, Pursglove didn\u2019t seem to have much sympathy for the consumers who had filed complaints against her family\u2019s companies \u2014 the very basis of Fisher\u2019s carefully plotted legal strategy. On more than one occasion, first during a long meeting in New York and later over a candlelit Italian dinner with Fisher and Potter in Delray Beach, I asked Pursglove whether she had any reservations about how she and Oesterlund had made their money. Whatever regrets she had about her husband, I learned, did not extend to the family business. \u201cEvery time you click on an ad, someone gets money,\u201d she told me, shrugging. \u201cWe were the people who got the money.\u201dAll this raised the possibility that Pursglove\u2019s main objection to the offshoring scheme was that her husband had decided to cut her out of it. Oesterlund himself insinuated as much. \u201cWow your Jeff is desperate,\u201d he texted her in May 2015, meaning Fisher, after a Canadian judge issued a further freeze of his assets. \u201cWhy would he want to expose you by trying to reopen the attorney general settlement? But ok we will throw you under the bus.\u201dPursglove says she always knew Oesterlund was trying to minimize their taxes. But like many wealthy people who hire expensive help to execute complex tax transactions, Pursglove had considered herself to be avoiding taxes, not evading them \u2014 precisely the distinction wealthy people hire an accounting firm like Daszkal Bolton to observe on their behalf, however finely. Now, though, she was relying on Fisher to dismantle Daszkal Bolton\u2019s handiwork.Fisher\u2019s argument was that Oesterlund had begun offshoring the companies to shield himself from consumer lawsuits, but then, as a divorce grew imminent, redeployed the same plan to shield assets from Pursglove. And that assertion was bolstered by a new discovery.Studying bank documents Fisher had subpoenaed, Fisher\u2019s paralegal, Lindsey Crews, noticed that Pursglove\u2019s stamped signature appeared on paperwork in early 2013 that gave an Xacti executive named Skip Middleton, Oesterlund\u2019s right-hand man, authority over at least six Xacti-related bank accounts with Wells Fargo. A few months later, Middleton used his newfound authority to remove Pursglove from the accounts. Not long after, around the time Oesterlund created the Cook Islands trust, someone using Pursglove\u2019s signature stamp had caused RSOP, the family holding company, to guarantee a $17.5 million loan from a Florida lender called C1 bank, using the D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu as collateral. The loan papers attested that Middleton had witnessed Pursglove signing for the loan in Florida. But Pursglove wasn\u2019t in Florida on the date indicated: Her passport stamps proved that she was actually in Toronto.A clearer picture emerged as they studied documents subpoenaed from Daszkal Bolton. It turned out that in early 2013, after Pursglove asked Xacti\u2019s executives to inform her of any large cash transfers or major business decisions, Oesterlund ordered Middleton to cut her off. Over email, he told Middleton to ban her from their Boca Raton offices and to remove Pursglove as a signatory to the company bank accounts. Middleton forwarded the email to a Daszkal Bolton accountant. \u201cUmm, Houston, we have a problem,\u201d Middleton wrote, referring to Oesterlund\u2019s demands. The bank forms adding Middleton to the accounts \u2014 supposedly with Pursglove\u2019s permission \u2014 were filed two days later.A lawyer for Middleton did not reply to a request for comment. (When Fisher deposed him this past April, Middleton invoked his Fifth Amendment rights almost 300 times, including to the question of whether he had forged Pursglove\u2019s signature.) A spokesman for Daszkal Bolton told me that the firm would not comment on litigation or client matters. But documents obtained by Fisher suggest that Oesterlund\u2019s lawyers and accountants had indeed spent 2013 trying to make him untouchable, trading complex organizational charts, debating what companies to create in which countries, even what value to assign them.Early in the fall of 2014, Fisher printed out a copy of the Xacti organizational chart and taped it behind his desk. He ordered everyone in the office to keep a copy as well. Every time they found a new Oesterlund company, they would add it the chart, which came to resemble a convoluted treasure map. In the Caribbean, there were shell companies with names like Paradise Liquidity I and Integrity Investment Holdings, formed by a Nevis holding company and then immediately transferred to Oesterlund\u2019s Cook Islands trust. There was a second Cook Islands trust, also created in June 2013, right as the Florida attorney general began nosing around Oesterlund\u2019s businesses again. There was $35 million or more in cash, in bank accounts in, among other places, Monaco, Luxembourg, Canada and the Bahamas.Yet on paper, it was hard to find anything that Oesterlund actually owned himself. Shortly after Judge Gillen froze his assets, Oesterlund removed himself as a \u201cbeneficiary\u201d of the two trusts, even though they now appeared to contain much of the family\u2019s businesses and property. The Toronto penthouse was now owned by a Delaware corporation, which was owned by a Nevis corporation deposited in one of the Cook trusts. At some point, Omega had also been transferred into one of the trusts. The D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu, meanwhile, was now owned by a Caymans corporation whose \u201cmembership interest\u201d \u2014 its ownership \u2014 had been shifted into one of the trusts. In exchange, the trust paid Oesterlund the sum of $100.Unknown to his wife, Oesterlund had even purchased an apartment complex in Georgia, using $23 million in loans backed by the Housing and Urban Development Department. The application, which Potter obtained with an open-records request, was personally signed by Oesterlund, who listed an address in Boca Raton where he hadn\u2019t actually lived in at least four years. But after the sale closed in 2013, other documents indicated, control of the apartment complex was shifted to a Bahamian company, and finally into the trust. The United States government appeared to be guaranteeing a $23 million loan to a Cook Islands trust in the South Pacific.Potter, who had to write most of the replying briefs, believed that Oesterlund\u2019s trusts were filing motions or objections it seemed certain to lose, just to exhaust and bankrupt Pursglove. In one lawsuit, the trusts fought against releasing a single piece of paper. The goal wasn\u2019t merely to win, Potter felt, but to prevent the case from progressing far enough for its actual merits to be heard. \u201cThis isn\u2019t some weird aspect of the process,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is the game itself.\u201d Nor could Fisher, despite invoking the authority of the Florida attorney general against Oesterlund, count on help from the actual Florida attorney general. The office had sent a lawyer to monitor at least one hearing in Pursglove\u2019s lawsuit, but had taken no official position on her claims. Fisher was on his own.But in the late fall of 2014, Oesterlund ran short of a commodity that had once seemed in bountiful supply: time. For many months, his lawyers had successfully delayed Fisher\u2019s demands to depose him in person, insisting on a variety of jurisdictional, geographic and practical complications. In the process, however, Oesterlund had exhausted the patience of a series of Florida judges. Now, under threat of being held in contempt (and, potentially, the court\u2019s issuing a warrant for his arrest), Oesterlund agreed to show up in a Toronto law office.A video of the day shows that he arrived a few minutes late. \u201cYou\u2019re shorter than I thought you were,\u201d Oesterlund told Fisher. But for the rest of the deposition, Oesterlund was studiously restrained. He answered most questions in a monotone, rarely meeting Fisher\u2019s eye. Fisher tried repeatedly to get Oesterlund to list his assets. \u201cI owned lots of assets, different assets, various assets,\u201d Oesterlund said vaguely. He had \u201cthings that most people would have, like a watch.\u201d Was he really worth $401,769,834, as his accountants once thought? Oesterlund waved the question away. \u201cI don\u2019t know where these numbers are taken from,\u201d he said, staring fixedly at the table. How did the penthouse end up in a Cook Islands trust? It was \u201ca transaction between me and my attorney.\u201d Which attorney? \u201cI can\u2019t remember,\u201d Oesterlund retorted. \u201cI have too many.\u201dBut bit by bit, Fisher began to connect Oesterlund back to his own wealth. Oesterlund admitted that he had signed a rental agreement to live in the Toronto penthouse now owned by the trust. In that case, Fisher asked, was Oesterlund paying rent? Oesterlund looked up at the ceiling. \u201cIt\u2019s being accrued,\u201d he replied; no money was actually changing hands. Under orders from Rosen, one of his lawyers, Oesterlund refused to say who was paying the utilities and maintenance at the penthouse. But he admitted that the trust was paying to fuel, maintain and crew the D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu \u2014 a boat that he was the only person permitted to use, according to a copy of the boat\u2019s insurance contract.Documents accompanying the deposition provided further evidence that there was little distance between Oesterlund and the theoretically independent trusts holding his former property. The trusts were paying to furnish Oesterlund with a private helicopter and even fund his trips to St. Maarten.In court papers filed that spring and summer, Fisher and Pursglove\u2019s Toronto divorce lawyer, Harold Niman, sharpened their attacks. Oesterlund was \u201ca highly successful internet swindler,\u201d engaged in \u201cinternet scams, forgeries, tax fraud, bank fraud, HUD fraud, immigration fraud, fraudulent overseas transfers and other misconduct,\u201d Fisher told a Florida judge. They also moved to freeze even more of Oesterlund\u2019s income, and not just to make him suffer personally. Fisher and Potter estimated that Oesterlund was burning through about a million dollars a month, much of it going to pay the lawyers and accountants keeping his maze of trusts and shell companies in working order.In March, Fisher went after Wells Fargo, Oesterlund\u2019s main link between the name-brand financial-services world and the gray market of offshore shell companies and trusts. The Wells Fargo accounts, they believed, were still accumulating revenue from some of the old Xacti businesses \u2014 the ones selling travel deals or DVDs or antivirus toolbars \u2014 some of which had been reconstituted under new, offshore corporations. Fisher, citing Pursglove\u2019s possibly forged signature removing her from the accounts, threatened to sue Wells Fargo, asserting that the bank had allowed Oesterlund to defraud his wife of millions of dollars. Because of the competing claims to the accounts, Wells Fargo quickly froze them until the dispute could be settled. Now neither Oesterlund nor the trusts could access the money.An even bigger threat to Oesterlund began taking shape in June 2015, when a Florida judge ruled that Pursglove was entitled to view thousands of pages of emails and documents exchanged by Oesterlund and other executives at Xacti with their lawyers. Oesterlund\u2019s attorneys had tried to keep the documents out of court, arguing they were protected by attorney-client privilege. Fisher was certain the privileged documents would contain what he called a \u201csmoking gun.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t just see where the money was hidden, Fisher believed. He would see Oesterlund plotting how to hide the money. He would get not only direct evidence of fraud against Pursglove and others, but also emails and memos that might implicate many of the lawyers and accountants who had helped him. The whole thing could be laid bare.Fisher and Potter strolled down the block in West Palm Beach to the offices of Squire Patton Boggs \u2014 a well-regarded multinational firm that represents Oesterlund\u2019s Florida companies \u2014 to hear them out. The suggestion made everyone wary. Pursglove could lose by winning: If her husband went into hiding, it would be hard to wring money out of him. But it would also be bad for Oesterlund\u2019s lawyers, particularly for the Americans. For one thing, Potter would later realize, Oesterlund now had large unpaid legal bills. And beyond the financial risk was a reputational one. It was one thing to defend a businessman in a civil suit. It was another to defend a fugitive.Documents turned over at the June meeting and subsequent ones that summer laid out Oesterlund\u2019s position. Most of his net worth was tied up in the value of his companies, and they were worth less than his accountants once claimed. He didn\u2019t actually have enough wealth to give his wife half of a $400 million estate \u2014 the sort of net worth he once declared in order to secure loans for a jet or Georgia real estate. But now the baroque complexity of Oesterlund\u2019s finances had become a noose around his neck. To prove that Oesterlund\u2019s fortune was much smaller, his lawyers had to reveal where and how he had hidden it. If they refused, and a judge decided to award Pursglove $200 million, Oesterlund wouldn\u2019t have enough liquid wealth to pay up. He could be ruined.Trapped, Oesterlund\u2019s lawyers were now doing Fisher\u2019s work for him, providing documents that suggested further violations of the Judge Gillen\u2019s original asset injunction, Potter told me. One trust had recently sent Oesterlund\u2019s lawyers more than $1 million to cover legal fees. In Potter\u2019s opinion, Oesterlund had no choice. He \u201chad to decide whether to pay the lawyers, and expose that he could get cash from the trust whenever he wanted,\u201d Potter says, \u201cor not pay them, and not be able to fight the suit.\u201dAnother bank statement they handed over showed that on a single day in 2014, Oesterlund transferred $48 million into one of the Cook trusts. It was the same day, Fisher quickly realized, that Pursglove discovered Oesterlund with his new girlfriend. Fisher believed this would be strong evidence in court that the trust had been set up in anticipation of owing his wife money, which even in most offshore jurisdictions is against the law.Hundreds of thousands of dollars had been drawn out of one trust each month to operate the D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu. Fisher\u2019s paralegal hunted for the boat in Oesterlund\u2019s usual haunts. Using public webcams at ports around the French Rivera, she discovered the D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu anchored in the middle of the harbor in Saint-Tropez. Potter took a working vacation to France and, after a few days of carefully planned sightseeing, found the boat anchored in Nice. Halfway through a meal at the Grand-Hotel du Cap-Ferrat, he also found Oesterlund himself, who strode out onto the dining patio with the interior decorator. Potter\u2019s own girlfriend snapped a picture on her cellphone. They left quickly, before Oesterlund noticed them.In Florida, Oesterlund\u2019s lawyers were again running out of time. Oesterlund was now subject to an increasingly stern series of court orders that he turn over the privileged documents, regardless of any potential settlement.This didn\u2019t just threaten Oesterlund\u2019s fortune. It also had the potential to carve open a portal into the world of offshore finance, a place that the global elite has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to build and defend. In the offshore archipelago, their interests are hidden behind shell companies and trusts, their anonymity guaranteed under the law, from Delaware to the Bahamas to the South Pacific. James S. Henry, a former chief economist at McKinsey, calls the offshore financial world the \u201ceconomic equivalent of an astrophysical black hole,\u201d holding at least $21 trillion of the world\u2019s financial wealth, more than the gross domestic product of the United States.This darkness shields the tax-averse businessman and the criminal alike. Dictators use the offshore system to loot their own countries. Drug lords use it to launder money. As Gabriel Zucman, a University of California economist and an offshore expert, puts it: \u201cThey use the same banks, they use the same incorporation agents to create shell companies, they send money in the same ways.\u201dIf Fisher could prove that one Cook trust was a sham, then the settlors and administrators of other Cook trusts could have a harder time defending them in reputable courts. For attorneys and accountants working in the offshore industry, having private correspondence with a client entered into a public court record would be a disaster. Anybody could see what they were doing and how they did it. Fisher\u2019s legal assault now presented Oesterlund\u2019s helpers with a painful choice: Protect one client, or protect the system.They rejoined the case within days, after Oesterlund agreed to let them release a portion of the files. But it was a sign that Oesterlund had begun pushing his camp into dangerous territory, both professionally and legally. The wall of secrecy around Oesterlund\u2019s offshore holdings began to collapse. The first batch of documents, five or six notebooks\u2019 worth of emails arrived last fall. More would soon follow.When I spoke with Fisher by phone in February, he sounded confident. Oesterlund appeared to be running out of cash, Fisher told me; he was missing payments on the loan from C1 Bank. In August, after further delays in producing the documents, Judge Gillen held Oesterlund and his companies in contempt of court, dangling the prospect of criminal penalties. Soon after, Oesterlund\u2019s personal lawyer in the case quit, citing \u201cirreconcilable differences\u201d with his client. Court filings this fall suggested that the civil litigation was drawing to a close, though both Fisher and Oesterlund\u2019s remaining lawyers said they were barred from discussing any final settlement.More even than the laws of the world\u2019s tax havens, the offshore financial system is kept afloat by the legions of professionals \u2014 accountants, lawyers, incorporation agents \u2014 who are paid well to service it. But the people who work to dismantle that system also have to be paid. If the case Fisher had constructed against Oesterlund was correct, I once proposed to him, then at least some of the money coming to him and Pursglove would seem to be tainted. Fisher disagreed, and unspooled an intricate accounting of his own. When he cracked open the Cook trusts, Fisher argued, the money would come back home. Whatever liabilities Oesterlund had to consumers would be payable by what remained of the businesses. Pursglove and her payout would live in Boca Raton, within easy reach of United States law. \u201cI would always view the dollars that I get to be legitimate dollars,\u201d Fisher said.But this would be a justice of wealth battling wealth, hammering through the veneer of trusts and shell companies to serve private ends. Fisher\u2019s own role as public crusader would end, circumscribed by Pursglove\u2019s interests. He and Potter had sent packages of evidence to the Palm Beach sheriff\u2019s department, the inspector general of HUD, and the United States attorney\u2019s office. Those authorities might take a hard look at Oesterlund\u2019s business dealings and the well-paid professionals who made them all possible. Or they might lay the packages aside, alongside other complex cases that take extraordinary amounts of time and money to pursue. \u201cIn the end, I\u2019m not a private attorney general,\u201d Fisher mused. \u201cI\u2019m a private attorney.\u201dNicholas Confessore is a national political reporter for The Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Coaches Take Lessons in Hardwood Diplomacy in America", "Date": "2016-11-13", "News": "Supported bySALT LAKE CITY \u2014 About 15 coaches filed onto the mezzanine-like balcony overlooking a basketball practice court. They wore warm-up apparel and sneakers. As the Utes men\u2019s team began its practice, some took notes in small Moleskine notebooks; others consulted printouts of set plays.It was late September, so several assistant coaches were on the road recruiting, and the practice itself was focused on getting players into shape and integrating new faces as opposed to game-planning any opponents.But it was still a big-time college basketball practice, so at times, it got intense. Utah Coach Larry Krystkowiak stopped one drill and, in a not-angry-just-disappointed tone, told his team, \u201cYou guys are just full of it today; everybody\u2019s got something to say.\u201dThe observing coaches did not know exactly what Krystkowiak said, but they understood the coach\u2019s frustration and determination. And they took note. They were among the best junior high and high school basketball coaches in China, brought to Utah\u2019s gorgeous campus in a partnership between their government and the Pacific-12 Conference and the University of Utah.This is no longer Ping-Pong diplomacy.\u201cThe coaches \u2014 they are very passionate when they train their players,\u201d said Sun Fengleng, who coaches in Jilin, a province in China\u2019s northeast. \u201cHe is really good with the players, trains them well.\u201dSun added, \u201cI want to learn the attitude and bring it back.\u201dKrystkowiak, a onetime N.B.A. power forward who has led the Utes to the N.C.A.A. tournament the past two seasons, seemed to endorse Sun\u2019s takeaway.\u201cIf they want to improve at basketball,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s not always the place to be polite.\u201dThe Chinese government hopes many more coaches will learn that lesson. Nearly 100 Chinese junior high and high school coaches in the sports of men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball, track and field, swimming and cheerleading were sent to Utah, and roughly the same number of Chinese college coaches went to Arizona State, which is also in the Pac-12.The coaches observed practices and weight-room sessions. They got some time on the court themselves with Utah coaches. They participated in talks on injury rehabilitation and conducted film-room sessions. They even got to see the final bit of this year\u2019s football game against Brigham Young, known locally as the Holy War.Indeed, it is partly America\u2019s fairly unusual model of competitive athletics enshrined in educational institutions that the coaches have come to study, said Kyle Brennan, Utah\u2019s deputy athletic director.\u201cCoaches are coaches,\u201d he said with a chuckle. \u201cGiving them a compliance class, they want to push the boundaries. \u2018Why can\u2019t I recruit a kid from another school?\u2019 Well, these are the rules we\u2019ve got.\u201dThe program is financed by the Chinese Scholarship Council and organized by Federation University Sports China \u2014 a sort of state-sponsored Chinese N.C.A.A. that saw the coaches\u2019 trips as much more than relaxed junkets.\u201cChina\u2019s interested in making sure that they come back, and this isn\u2019t just a sightseeing tour,\u201d Brennan said. \u201cThey want them to learn something.\u201dTheir three-month residency in Utah, near mountains whose peaks were already snow-capped, was one of several signs of the Pac-12\u2019s interest in claiming dominion over the Pacific Rim.This college football season opened with Cal\u2019s 51-31 victory over Hawaii in Sydney, Australia. On Friday night in Shanghai, Stanford scored an 80-70 victory over Harvard in men\u2019s basketball \u2014 the second game in a series of Pac-12 contests held in China. Washington beat Texas there last year in the first regular-season game in China, and the series will continue next year, the conference announced Friday, with U.C.L.A. facing Georgia Tech.The games are part of the Pac-12 Globalization Initiative. Larry Scott, the Pac-12 commissioner, said that the initiative sprung out of meetings he held with the conference\u2019s presidents in 2009, his first year on the job.\u201cI posited, given the global focus of our universities and given that athletics is meant to act as the front porch, does it make sense for us to pursue international conference athletics activities to help promote the broader agenda the universities have?\u201d Scott said. \u201cAnd there was a resounding yes.\u201dFrom Washington to Cal to Stanford to Utah and beyond, many Pac-12 members have large numbers of Chinese students, as well as extensive relationships in China. Scott noted that several Washington officials went along to last year\u2019s Huskies-Longhorns basketball game to further an initiative between the university and Tsinghua University in Beijing.\u201cWe are making progress in terms of building the brand and exposure for the Pac-12,\u201d Scott added. \u201cThat leads to very specific opportunities for our universities.\u201dNearly 40 percent of the University of Utah\u2019s foreign students are Chinese, and the state\u2019s former governor Jon Huntsman, for whose father the Utes\u2019 basketball arena is named, was the American ambassador to China. At a ceremony welcoming the coaches to Salt Lake City, Huntsman spoke to them in fluent Mandarin.\u201cWe\u2019re interested in recruiting top Chinese students,\u201d said Michael L. Hardman, who runs the university\u2019s Office for Global Engagement.Chris Hill, Utah\u2019s athletic director, said that when the idea for the residencies for Chinese coaches was first raised among Pac-12 members, about four raised their hands.\u201cI think other people were afraid of the challenge, and your coaches have to be cooperative,\u201d Hill said, \u201cand I think some of the others felt, \u2018Do we need to be the first ones to do this?\u2019\u201dTo that end, athletics staff members received cultural training and, in turn, insisted that the visiting coaches abide by certain rules so as not to get in the way of the Utah coaches\u2019 primary jobs \u2014 training their teams.\u201cWe had to work hard on the front end of education, trying to get them to understand there\u2019s certain things you can\u2019t do because it will hinder our success,\u201d Brennan said. \u201cIf you\u2019re up there talking while Coach is trying to teach, that\u2019s going to be a problem. We had some upfront conversations.\u201dDuring one practice, the coaches were largely silent.\u201cThey are very effective,\u201d Gu Hong Xia, a woman who coaches a top junior high squad in Nanjing, said through an interpreter, referring to Utah\u2019s coaches and players. \u201cThey don\u2019t train for a very long time, but they are very efficient.\u201dWang Hui, who coaches in Shanxi, said through an interpreter that his time in Utah had made him feel good about his own postpractice rehabilitation practices, which appeared to match Utah\u2019s. More than any technical expertise, the most valuable lesson he learned, he said, concerned \u201cattitude.\u201d\u201cThe players here are very motivated and want to do good,\u201d he said.The coaches received their own cultural training, in the form of a seminar in China on how to adjust to American mores.\u201cThey trained us for four days on American culture, manners, different things \u2014 like don\u2019t smoke in the building \u2014 and told us to learn as much as we can and bring it back to China, to our players,\u201d Sun said.Fortunately, Sun added, he does not smoke.Advertisement"}

She was 64.The cause was apparently a stroke, said Chase Scott, a spokesman for the family.Ms. Hennessee was a frequent presence at industry conferences and was an early supporter of the industry association 100 Women in Hedge Funds.Ms. Hennessee started her hedge fund index, tracking which strategies were making or losing money across the industry, in 1987.That same year, while working for E. F. Hutton, she founded the Hennessee Hedge Fund Advisory Group, a division of Hutton. The firm conducted research and advised clients about investments in hedge funds, an industry that at the time was growing quickly but was even more tight-lipped about strategies or returns than it is today.After E. F. Hutton was acquired by Shearson Lehman Brothers in 1988, Ms. Hennessee and the hedge fund advisory firm stayed on. It later moved to Republic New York Securities and then to the investment management firm Weiss, Peck & Greer before it was turned into a stand-alone operation, the Hennessee Group, in 1997.The reputation she built over many years on Wall Street suffered in 2005, when a fund her group had recommended, Bayou Management, based in Connecticut, collapsed. Bayou\u2019s chief executive and founder, Samuel Israel III, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and fraud in cheating investors out of $450 million.About 40 clients lost $56 million in Bayou funds after investing on the Hennessee Group\u2019s recommendation, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.In 2009, the firm paid a $100,000 fine and repaid $549,000, plus interest, to settle claims filed by the S.E.C. that it had failed to perform adequate due diligence on Bayou before recommending it. The settlement did not include any admission or denial of the claims.In 2013, the Hennessee Group\u2019s advisory business was acquired by Terrapin Asset Management.Elizabeth Lee Hennessee was born on Sept. 1, 1952, in Raleigh, N.C., to Mary Frances Dillon and William E. Hennessee. Her father was a senior vice president in charge of advertising and tobacco sales at the Dillon Supply Company.She graduated in 1975 from Randolph-Macon Woman\u2019s College (now Randolph College), in Lynchburg, Va. She started working on Wall Street a year later.Ms. Hennessee served as a finance chairwoman for Elizabeth Dole\u2019s campaign for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000 and organized the Billy Graham crusade in New York in 2005.

{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s Juggling Act", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byIn one Goldman Sachs talk, Clinton was clearly sympathetic to the concerns of the finance industry, noting that assessing the right level of regulation is no easy task:There\u2019s nothing magic about regulations, too much is bad, too little is bad. How do you get to the golden key, how do we figure out what works? And the people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry.Clinton\u2019s difficulties speak to the challenges of reconciling the various interests within a changing Democratic coalition.Understandably, this largess sits well with the pro-business faction within Democratic ranks.Nationalists see patriotism as a virtue; they think their country and its culture are unique and worth preserving. This is a real moral commitment, not a pose to cover up racist bigotry. Some nationalists do believe that their country is better than all others, and some nationalisms are plainly illiberal and overtly racist. But as many defenders of patriotism have pointed out, you love your spouse because she or he is yours, not because you think your spouse is superior to all others.I asked Haidt where Clinton fits into this scheme, and he replied in an email:She\u2019s a globalist, through and through. Globalist morality tends to be very concerned about human rights and transnational concerns, especially those related to suffering and oppression. One of Clinton\u2019s most famous lines from the 1990s is her speech in Beijing where she said \u201cHuman rights are women\u2019s rights, and women\u2019s rights are human rights.\u201dThe result, Stewart wrote in an email, is the emergence of two competing identities or \u201ctwo distinct views about what constitutes a good society, one cosmopolitan and the other parochial.\u201dDavid Leege, a professor of political science emeritus at Notre Dame, has a parallel, but different, take. He argues that \u201ca major source of the unwieldiness is the changed meaning of liberalism/conservatism\u201d that can no longer be measured \u201calong an economic dimension\u201d alone.By the year 2000, Leege argues, the Republican Party and conservative movement successfully merged \u201cwhite nativism\u201d with \u201cthe family values\u201d appeal to demonize \u201cblacks, Hispanics, single mothers, Hollywood, educated elites at the universities who did not advocate or live the moral life of conservative Protestants and Catholics\u201d as \u201cunworthy of recognition by the state with financial resources.\u201dThe result, according to Leege, has been \u201ca new referent for \u2018liberal\u2019 and \u2018conservative\u2019 anchored in cultural differences, i.e., the way we are supposed to live as an American people. It has strong overtones of change and expressive individualism, on the one hand, and tradition and respect for authority on the other\u201d \u2014 a division similar to that of globalists v. nationalists and cosmopolitan v. parochial.Clinton\u2019s struggles, in the view of David Mayhew, a political scientist at Yale, reflect disturbing developments within the Democratic Party. In an email, Mayhew wrote:The Democratic Party has become inhospitable to the accommodation of multiple intraparty interests. That is obvious. Clinton\u2019s crack about the \u201cdeplorables\u201d and \u201cirredeemables\u201d wasn\u2019t just a misstatement. It was a window into the thinking of the party\u2019s current activist core. Central to the party\u2019s mind-set is an arrogant dismissal of a major share of the U.S. population. These folks are dismissed as incapable of making judgments about their own lives, their aspirations, and the larger politics and society surrounding them.Mayhew warned: \u201cThis dismissiveness does not go unnoticed.\u201dGlobalists see nationalists as hopelessly parochial. The word \u201cparochial\u201d means, literally, concerned with matters of the local parish, rather than the larger world. But as it is commonly used, the word is an insult. OxfordDictionaries.com offers these synonyms: narrow-minded, illiberal, intolerant, conservative.There is a case to be made for the contribution so-called elites make to the progressive project, disagreements between globalists and nationalists notwithstanding.Daron Acemoglu, an MIT economist, argues that the left alliance needs its upscale wing.Democrats, Acemoglu argues, \u201cshould seek a coalition that stands for the most vulnerable people in society,\u201d but he believes \u201csuch a coalition could not stand by itself without the support of influential, well-off members of American society.\u201dSuch a coalition is possible, Acemoglu said,As long as the Democratic Party shakes off its hard-core anti-market, pro-union stance, there is a huge constituency of well-educated, socially conscious Americans that will join in.Realistically, the likelihood that Democrats will abandon labor in the foreseeable future is zero.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Probably Avoided His Medicare Taxes, Too", "Date": "2016-11-02", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsIn the final debate, Hillary Clinton said she would secure Social Security and Medicare by raising taxes on high-income earners, including herself and her opponent, Donald J. Trump, \u201cassuming he can\u2019t figure out how to get out of it.\u201dAs we\u2019ve learned in the past few weeks, Mr. Trump has used all kinds of extravagant maneuvers to get out of paying taxes. Without Mr. Trump\u2019s returns, we can\u2019t know for certain whether he figured out a way to get out of paying into Medicare and Social Security. But we have some clues.The only public information he has offered about his finances is buried in the 2015 Financial Disclosure Form 278e that he filed when he entered the Republican primary. According to his financial disclosure, Mr. Trump owns and controls an extensive business empire.Given that, it seems incredible that he reported only $14,222 in total salary on his 2015 financial disclosure form, all of it paid by 208 Production LLC, which made his reality show \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d He claims that the other part of the form, which asks about \u201cSources of Compensation Exceeding $5,000 in a Year,\u201d is \u201cnot applicable.\u201dThat means that he was paid no salary by the more than 200 corporations that he owns and runs \u2014 corporations that own or manage businesses having more than a billion dollars in value and hundreds of millions of dollars in income.By declaring such a low salary, Mr. Trump, we believe, avoided paying millions of dollars of Medicare taxes that should have gone to support senior citizens and their families. He may even have shortchanged Social Security by declaring salary and self-employment income below the limit on Social Security taxes ($118,500 in 2015).Everyone who receives a salary or self-employment income finances Medicare and Social Security through contributions withheld from their paycheck or by paying a self-employment tax. High-income taxpayers currently finance Medicare partly through taxes of about 3.8 percent on all of their salary and self-employment income. (Unlike Social Security, Medicare obligations apply to 100 percent of earned income.)While it is legal under current law to minimize Medicare taxes, there are limits. If you work for a corporation, you are expected to declare a reasonable salary, and if you are a member of a partnership, you are expected to declare fair compensation for your management services.If you understate your salary and self-employment income, you aren\u2019t paying what you owe in Medicare taxes. A common method of avoiding these taxes is to underreport your salary or self-employment income and overstate some other kind of income not subject to Medicare taxes.How is it possible that Mr. Trump\u2019s financial disclosure form is almost completely free of salary or self-employment income? For example, he was president and sole shareholder of the Trump Corporation \u2014 but received no salary from a company he valued at more than $50 million with income of more than $5 million.Mr. Trump was also president and sole shareholder of Trump Endeavor 12 Management Corp., which in turn manages Trump National Doral, an 800-acre resort with four golf courses near Miami. His corporation was not listed on Part 2 of Mr. Trump\u2019s financial disclosure form, meaning his 100 percent ownership stake had no value and no income, and paid Mr. Trump no salary \u2014 despite the fact that Doral itself had income of $49,448,432. In other words, Mr. Trump received no salary or self-employment income for owning and managing a business that earned close to $50 million.High-income taxpayers also help fund Medicare through a 3.8 percent tax on their net passive investment income. According to his financial disclosure form, Mr. Trump had passive investment income (interest, dividends and capital gains) having a midpoint value of at least $43 million. Based on that estimate, Mr. Trump would therefore be liable for about $1.7 million of net investment income taxes going to fund Medicare.Did he pay those taxes? We can\u2019t know for sure. We do know, based on the revelations about his 1995 returns, that Mr. Trump aggressively uses business losses to avoid paying taxes. He could have used the same kind of losses to reduce his income and therefore reduce or avoid that portion of his Medicare tax in 2015.Mr. Trump would hardly be the only wealthy American who used tax schemes to avoid contributing to Medicare and Social Security. The Treasury has estimated that these loopholes cost about $25 billion a year. Such schemes tripped up the presidential candidates John Edwards in 2004 and Newt Gingrich in 2012. It is now called the Gingrich-Edwards Loophole in their dubious honor.We can\u2019t know for certain what Mr. Trump paid or did not pay without looking at his 1040, starting with Page 1 (showing his wages), Schedule SE (showing his self-employment income), Form 8959 (showing his additional 0.9 percent tax on salary and self-employment income above $250,000) and Form 8960 (showing his Medicare net investment income tax).We don\u2019t have his returns, so we don\u2019t know what Mr. Trump paid. But absent any evidence to the contrary, the inescapable conclusion is that Mr. Trump has failed to pay millions of dollars in Medicare taxes.Fred T. Goldberg Jr. served as I.R.S. commissioner under George H.W. Bush. Michael J. Graetz, a Columbia law professor, served in the Treasury Department under George H.W. Bush.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Blockbuster Deals in a Race to Stay Ahead of the Competition", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorWorld-changing corporate transactions just seem to keep coming. It won\u2019t last, however.The number of multibillion-dollar deals announced in recent weeks is staggering by any measure, particularly in an election year, when the uncertainty tends to drive away deals.Time Warner\u2019s & AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion proposed tie-up has dominated the headlines as consumers latch on to tales of media dominance, but in October alone, $329 billion worth of deal activity in the United States has been announced, according to Thomson Reuters, a record. The worldwide number, $483.1 billion, is also no slouch and the fifth highest on record.Other gigantic deals include General Electric\u2019s combination of its oil business with that of Baker Hughes, British American Tobacco\u2019s $47 billion takeover offer for Reynolds American and Qualcomm\u2019s $38.5 billion deal for NXP Semiconductors. One of the biggest deals this year is Bayer\u2019s $56 billion takeover of Monsanto.Looming in the future are potential other big deals like a recombination of Viacom and CBS.Conventional wisdom is that this activity is all about cheap money. Interest rates are at 400-year lows and the world is awash with liquidity as investors try to find anything that yields a decent rate. Capital markets are so well developed that AT&T can seek to borrow $40 billion to buy Time Warner without missing a step. The days of the financial crisis are well and truly over as lenders are again jumping to lend \u2014 albeit at lower leverage rates. (We did learn something from the crisis, thankfully.)The other broad force driving this merger boomlet is confidence. The worldwide economy is choppy, but we are actually in a period of stability. Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union has come, and though it may prove to be a disaster for the British economy, it has not brought the trade bloc down with it.Indeed, since the British referendum on June 23, the British stock market is up about 15 percent. The decline in the value of the pound has spurred deal-making, like Softbank\u2019s $32 billion acquisition of the British chip maker ARM Holdings.Forget about shareholder value; the top priority of any chief executive is to remain employed. And in a sluggish economy with few obvious opportunities, a big merger has become the only way to acquire growth or a new product or new technology and ensure that the chief executive holds on to power.The challenge facing chief executives is compounded by the changes wrought by technology. Companies, particularly in technology, media and telecommunications, are racing to keep up and avoid being outmaneuvered. Microsoft\u2019s $26.2 billion purchase of LinkedIn can be viewed solely as a defensive play \u2014 keeping its global reach on the internet.This trend has also been apparent in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology deal making of the past years as companies bought drugs instead of developing them.And tech itself continues to produce new challengers and spur further deal activity. The potential initial public stock offering of Snap at very likely an extraordinary valuation will push other tech companies to go public, generating more money in the pockets of the tech elite to make acquisitions.But the result of all this merger activity is a broad push toward oligopoly, meaning industries are dominated by just a few big players.Take media and telecommunications. We are heading into a world that is focused on video as people spend their lives on their smartphones, at least for now. The AT&T-Time Warner combination is built on this premise as AT&T\u2019s chief executive, Randall L. Stephenson, bets that the money in telecom is in content.In this new media world, there will probably be four or five big providers of content, two of which will certainly be Facebook and Google. AT&T is making its play to stay in that elite league through its proposed acquisition.A cynic might see the AT&T deal and others getting ahead of any changes to our inadequate antitrust laws. In a low-growth economy, getting bigger and squeezing out competitors is a clear way to success.Yet the monopolistic power play has changed. In the case of AT&T, its businesses do not overlap with those of Time Warner. This is a so-called vertical merger, which is harder to stop, and there is little history of the government doing so.It is how Facebook has been allowed to preserve its dominance by acquiring WhatsApp and Instagram \u2014 two emerging potential rivals that were swallowed before they could challenge the Google/Facebook dominance.You may have noticed that the \u201cbigger is better\u201d mantra is not politically popular at the moment. Republicans and Democrats alike have called for regulators to block the AT&T-Time Warner deal.In Washington, you can expect not just greater enforcement but possibly a change in the laws to focus on corporate giants that dominate a market through their immense size.So there is a rush to get deals through before the laws change. Either way, things are not getting better. And the risk of being left behind because of technological disruption and change is driving companies to make acquisitions faster. It is also a trend that, not surprisingly, affects larger companies. Thomson Reuters reports there have been 615 deals year to date, down from 967 in 2014, so the deals are concentrated at the higher end.This trend is spurring the return of the oft-derided conglomerates that came about in the 1960s. As was the case then, instead of growth and survival, we may just end up with bloat.At the moment, it is hard to find anything that can slow the merger train. Everything is going right. But it is in these times that perhaps caution is necessary. The merger market has always been cyclical. The current is moving forward, but sentiment can change. In addition, the risk of disruption still exists, whether it be the United States election, renewed uncertainty in Europe or global turmoil from Russia. And there is the prospect of higher interest rates, and how that will affect cheap deal financing is anybody\u2019s guess.If we have learned anything from more than 100 years of corporate mergers, it is that the lurking influences eventually emerge and the current trends driving all of this merger activity are unlikely to last. Let\u2019s hope it ends slowly and not with a sudden burst.Advertisement"}

Trump stickers, working feverishly, his lips chapped. As he taped homemade \u201cLock Her Up\u201d signs to a lamppost, other students tore them down. Mr. Hudson recorded them on his phone.Trump supporters, he said, were \u201cscared to speak out unless someone else does.\u201dBut in deep-red Oklahoma, where Mr. Trump was all but certain to win, fear coursed in the opposite direction. Outside an Oklahoma City church, Khalil Benalioulhaj, standing in a line of hundreds of people waiting to vote, said he had witnessed a white man shout \u201cWhite power!\u201d at blacks and Hispanics, stopping conversations cold.\u201cWhenever he passed, there was just silence,\u201d said Mr. Benalioulhaj, 25, an entrepreneur whose father immigrated from Morocco. \u201cEveryone was angry and questioning, \u2018Why would someone do that?\u2019\u201dThe election seemed to pit a rising nation \u2014 younger, optimistic about the future, diverse in makeup and cosmopolitan in outlook \u2014 against a declining one: older and white, resentful of its lost primacy, desperate to win again.Layered over the familiar fissures of American life \u2014 those of race and religion \u2014 a new divide yawned, one of education and opportunity.\u201cThere is really a disconnect between the people who feel like they\u2019re aspiring to do well and America is the place that they can do it,\u201d said the demographer and sociologist William H. Frey, \u201cand another group who feel like America has left them behind, and they don\u2019t see a ladder.\u201dAmericans with a college degree were voting for the Democratic candidate, Mrs. Clinton, by a wider margin than any other Democrat in modern American politics, polls showed. They were joined by immigrants and racial minorities hopeful that the ladder leads upward.Whites with only a high school education \u2014 the lifeblood of a work force that once spun cotton or poured steel, working hard toward the promise of a good life \u2014 were poised to throw in their lot with Mr. Trump, hoping he could reverse the decline of their lives and, as they saw it, the theft of their prospects.At a family restaurant in Sturtevant, Wis., Jane Michalek, 53, stabbed a fork into her taco salad, grousing about the steep increase in her health care premiums since she retired three years ago. Her date, Jim Harnden, 55, said a rising tide of leftist politics had left conservative Americans isolated.\u201cYoung people are always socialists,\u201d Mr. Harnden said. \u201cWomen are socialists, too. White men really did build this country, and now they\u2019re a minority.\u201dMost of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s supporters believe that life is getting better for people like them, according to studies by the Pew Research Center. The vast majority of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters do not.\u201cNo one cares. People are scared,\u201d said Pamela Bojtos Lent, 52, a Democrat from Brownsville, Pa., who cast her vote for Mr. Trump with her children and grandchildren in mind. \u201cAs bad as it is now, if it doesn\u2019t go to the flip side, what happens next? They\u2019re all going to work in fast-food restaurants.\u201dIn the wake of a campaign that exposed rich seams of misogyny and prejudice marbled through American politics, the prospects for any kind of national harmony looked bleak on Election Day. Most voters said in a New York Times/CBS News poll just before the election that the campaign had left them disgusted. In exit polls Tuesday, the idea of either candidate\u2019s taking office made most voters concerned or scared.Many Americans came out to vote against someone, not for someone.\u201cI\u2019m down here to vote against Trump,\u201d said Estraya Ingel, a middle-aged blackjack dealer in the Centennial Hills neighborhood of Las Vegas, where the city\u2019s sprawl tapers into the former horse ranches and scrub brush of rural Nevada. A worn brown vinyl purse hung from her left arm, and she stared down at the cracked pavement. The daughter of Mexican immigrants, Ms. Ingel said she had never failed to vote since turning 18.Times reporters provided real-time analysis of Donald J. Trump\u2019s stunning upset in the presidential election on Tuesday.\u201cI don\u2019t really like either of them,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI don\u2019t think either of them are great for me and my family, but Trump is too much \u2014 too awful.\u201dEven in the event of a landslide, polls before Tuesday suggested, either candidate would be the most unpopular president to take office in modern history.Tuesday\u2019s voting seemed to send shudders through fault lines long in the making, now bursting clearly into view.Bryan Enriquez, a student from South Florida, said the prospect of a close popular vote made him feel alienated from his own country.\u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s going to be very narrow, and that makes me sad,\u201d said Mr. Enriquez, 24.\u201cIt\u2019s so weird and eerie to see that people buy into this stuff,\u201d he added of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters. \u201cI don\u2019t like to judge anybody, but they\u2019re ignorant.\u201dNever before have Americans lived in a country so socially and geographically segmented.About half of Americans now live near people more politically like them than not, whether in conservative rural towns or sprawling liberal cities. Few Trump supporters report having close friends voting for Mrs. Clinton. Many Clinton supporters are more likely to see Trump voters on television than in person. Social media feeds are powerful echo chambers, with partisans for each candidate unfriending or trolling their opposites in steadily more strident terms.Each side views the other, warily, as closed-minded.Amid the wounds and anger, some Americans tried to move past the campaign. As the polls opened in Wisconsin, the Rev. Kathy Monson Lutes opened the doors of Trinity Episcopal Church in Janesville, a longtime union town where General Motors once employed thousands of workers. She had never urged her congregation to vote for one candidate or the other. But on Tuesday, for the first time on an Election Day, she held a daylong prayer vigil.As it wore on, she sat inside with the doors open, listening to the Beatles. Some congregants came in to pray, others to sit in silence.\u201cPeople are afraid because they\u2019ve been told to be afraid,\u201d Ms. Monson Lutes said. \u201cI think the reason I was moved to do this had to do with helping people to place their fear in a place of hope.\u201dBut elsewhere, fear triumphed. In the days before Election Day, on the borders between Mrs. Clinton\u2019s America and Mr. Trump\u2019s, many Americans seemed uneasy with the very act of coexistence.In the parking lot behind a Food Lion in a North Carolina strip mall, outside a county Republican headquarters that had been vandalized with anti-Trump graffiti, a handful of antigovernment gun-rights activists stood watch against further pranks, handguns strapped to their thighs.In Punta Gorda, Fla., a 69-year-old Trump supporter who voted last week lurked around his polling place for an hour afterward, looking behind the voting machines to make sure there were no markings connecting them to a company that conservative websites had linked, erroneously, to the liberal financier George Soros.And in Los Angeles, Cari Bjelajac, a fitness instructor, tried to put herself in the mind of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters. She failed. She did not live in their country, she concluded. And they did not live in hers.\u201cRegardless of who wins,\u201d Ms. Bjelajac said, \u201cthere is going to be a large group of people, I\u2019m not listening to a word they say.\u201dReporting was contributed by Emily Cochrane, Jonathan M.

{"Headline": "Betsy DeVos and the Wrong Way to Fix Schools", "Date": "2016-11-25", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorNEW ORLEANS \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s selection of Betsy DeVos as secretary of education has sent shock waves through the educational establishment. Understandably so, since this is a clear sign that Mr. Trump intends a major national push to direct public funds to private and charter schools. But this is more than just a political or financial loss for traditional public schools. It will also most likely be a loss for students.The choice of Ms. DeVos might not seem surprising. Mr. Trump has, after all, proposed $20 billion to finance \u201cschool choice\u201d initiatives and Ms. DeVos supports these ideas. Yet of all the candidates the transition team was apparently considering, Ms. DeVos has easily the worst record.As one of the architects of Detroit\u2019s charter school system, she is partly responsible for what even charter advocates acknowledge is the biggest school reform disaster in the country. At least some of the other candidates for education secretary, like Michelle Rhee, the former District of Columbia schools chancellor, led reforms that were accompanied by improved student results.Consider this: Detroit is one of many cities in the country that participates in an objective and rigorous test of student academic skills, called the National Assessment of Educational Progress. The other cities participating in the urban version of this test, including Baltimore, Cleveland and Memphis, are widely considered to be among the lowest-performing school districts in the country.This evidence should create a real problem for Ms. DeVos in her confirmation hearings. Fortunately, even if she is confirmed, the low level of federal funding devoted to education will limit the new administration\u2019s ability to pursue these policies. Also, any real expansion of unregulated vouchers will require action both by state governments and by Congress.But you don\u2019t have to be in the educational establishment to be worried about where this is going. The DeVos nomination is a triumph of ideology over evidence that should worry anyone who wants to improve results for children.Advertisement"}

Because if Mr. Trump keeps up the posture he displayed during the campaign \u2014 all-out war footing \u2014 the future will hold some very grim days, not just for news reporters but also for the American constitutional system that relies on a free and strong press.It\u2019s one thing to wage a press war as a candidate, when the most you can do is enforce reporting bans at your rallies, hurl insults and deny interviews and access (all of which are plenty bad).It\u2019s another thing to do it from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, where you have control over what vital government information is made public, and where you have sway over the Justice Department, which under President Obama has shown an overexuberance in investigating journalists and the whistle-blowers who leak to them.Imagine what somebody with a press vendetta and a dim view of the First Amendment would do with that kind of power.For their part, American newsrooms are conducting their own reassessments, vowing to do a better job covering the issues that animated his supporters, and acknowledging that Mr. Trump tapped into something in the national mood, the power of which they failed to grasp.They now know they underestimate him again at their own peril. Yet they also know that the need to continue with probing, unflinching reporting that promotes the truth in the face of whatever comes at them will be great.In the days immediately after Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, journalists that don\u2019t work at organizations with Breitbart in their names were preparing for potential reporting challenges, the likes of which they have never seen, while lawyers were gaming out possible legal strategies should Mr. Trump move against press freedoms.But then came the Saturday night release of his \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview in which he said he would keep his Twitter account so that when any news organization gave him \u201ca bad story,\u201d he would \u201chave a method of fighting back.\u201dAnd he didn\u2019t skip a beat on Sunday morning, when he attacked The New York Times with a Twitter post that read, \u201cWow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the \u2018Trump phenomena.\u2019\u201dThe statement was false. The paper said Sunday that postelection cancellations were so substantially outstripped by a surge of new subscriptions that its subscription growth rate in the period that followed Tuesday\u2019s result was four times the growth rate in the same period of last quarter.In an atmosphere in which it\u2019s not shocking to hear about anti-Semitic literature being sent to the home of a Jewish reporter \u2014 the address having been published online by supporters of Mr. Trump \u2014 it was hard to see any of this as very presidential, though the definition may be changing.The funny thing is that few major political figures have had a more codependent and at times friendly relationship with the press than Mr. Trump. Before he stopped doing news briefings in the later phase of the campaign, he was shaping up to be the most accessible major-party nominee in modern history.But displeasing him could have an intensely personal cost, which the Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly vividly recalls in her new book, \u201cSettle for More.\u201dMs. Kelly, who became Mr. Trump\u2019s leading television nemesis during the primary campaign, writes about how the candidate, unhappy with a segment she did in July 2015, threatened to unleash \u201cmy beautiful Twitter account against you.\u201dAfter a paid stint at CNN, Mr. Lewandowski returned to the Trump fold last week, and could wind up in the administration or at the Republican Party headquarters.Though that was technically an invasion-of-privacy case, it was a model for what Mr. Trump has said he wants to see in opening up libel laws.First Amendment lawyers are more immediately concerned with potential leak investigations, as well as Freedom of Information Act requests, which can provide the best way to expose government secrets.Success at court was meaningless given that proceedings kept the information out of public view for so long that \u201che really won,\u201d said George Freeman, who was the assistant general counsel for The New York Times then and is now the executive director of the Media Law Resource Center.I\u2019ve said it before, but the solution will be what it has always been \u2014 good, tough reporting.The wrong lesson to take from the past year is that reporters should let up in their mission of reporting the truth, wherever it leads.But if there is one thing we learned this year, it was the wisdom of the old mnemonic device for the spelling of \u201cassume\u201d (makes an \u201cass\u201d out of \u201cu\u201d and \u201cme\u201d). Mr. Trump campaigned through surprise and may well govern through surprise. We\u2019ll know how this thing is going to go only when we know.Now, where\u2019s my seatbelt?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "House Hunting in ... Milan", "Date": "2016-11-30", "News": "Supported byInternational Real Estate15 PhotosA FOUR-BEDROOM LOFT NEAR CORSO SEMPIONE$2.44 MILLION (2.3 MILLION EUROS)This 3,600-square-foot, three-level loft was built in 2008 within a former industrial building. It is a stand-alone unit, not part of an association, according to Roberto Magaglio, the listing agent with Engel & V\u00f6lkers and the agency\u2019s licensed partner for Milan. The loft is about a 10-minute drive from the old city center, not far from the tree-lined Corso Sempione thoroughfare and the Parco Sempione. The Milan airport is about a 30-minute drive.The main entrance leads to the open living area, with wall-height windows, marble floors and vaulted, 20-foot ceilings. The gas fireplace, in a shelflike wall recess, is remote-controlled. A glass wall separates the kitchen from the living area. The kitchen has stainless-steel appliances and thick wood counter tops. Amenities include a professional-quality gas stove and a wine cooler, along with a high-end prosciutto slicer.Two bedrooms, each with an en-suite bath, are also on the main floor, along with a powder room. A stone staircase leads to the basement, which has a heated counter-current pool, a sauna, an exercise room and a full bath.The same staircase leads from the main living area up to a balcony that overlooks it and provides access to the master suite and a fourth bedroom. The master bedroom has a spacious walk-in closet; the master bath, with resin floors, has a custom bathtub with a whirlpool. The fourth bedroom also has an en-suite bath.The entire loft is heated and cooled through a geothermal system. The only fuel cost is for electricity to pump the water throughout the system, Mr. Magaglio said. The hot-water heater is solar powered. There are also programmable alarm and lighting systems.The loft comes with one on-street parking space. The furnishings are negotiable, Mr. Magaglio said.The nearby Corso Sempione begins at the Piazza Sempione with its neo-Classical Arco della Pace, or Arch of Peace, a gateway to Parco Sempione that dates to the Napoleonic era. The dense concentration of restaurants and bars in this area draws a crowd for its night life.MARKET OVERVIEW\u201cOver the last five years, prices were too high and confidence in the market was low,\u201d said Gabriele Torchiani, the commercial director and a partner at Tirelli. \u201cNow things are changing.\u201dAccording to Mr. Magaglio, at its height in 2008, sales volume in Milan was about 18,000 transactions; by 2013, it had plummeted to around 10,000. He expects this year\u2019s tally to come in at about 12,000. Prices are about 25 percent below their peak, he said.Properties commanding the highest prices are in the old downtown center, including the prestigious Quadrilatero della Moda and Brera districts. The average for apartments there is roughly $800 to $900 per square foot, but those in the best condition can command more than twice that, according to Mr. Torchiani.Over all, the Milan market is oversupplied with apartments, many still overpriced, Mr. Torchiani said, but demand is increasing from both local buyers and foreigners. He noted that the city\u2019s profile was helped by last year\u2019s Expo Milano, the international fair, which drew thousands of visitors from abroad.Mr. Torchiani expressed optimism that the market will continue to improve, as consumer confidence has increased and credit is loosening. \u201cThe banks completely blocked financing after the crisis,\u201d he said, \u201cbut now they are trying to offer some good conditions to buyers.\u201d Still, he added, demand is a bit \u201cunstable\u201d and is highly dependent \u201con the mood of people in Italy.\u201dWHO BUYS IN MILANMilan is dominated by local buyers, with foreign buyers making up a small percentage, said Simone Rossi, the managing director at Gate-Away, a website that promotes Italian property to overseas buyers. Foreign buyers making inquiries through the site are more often interested in living close to but outside Milan in the Lake Como area, he said.Among foreign buyers within Milan, Europeans make up the largest share, particularly the French, Germans and Swiss, Mr. Magaglio said. Some Russians who like to attend fashion and design events have purchased pieds-\u00e0-terre to use on their visits. And more Chinese have started to buy in the last couple of years, he said.BUYING BASICSThere are no restrictions on foreign buyers. Lawyers are not usually involved in purchases, which are instead handled by notaries, Mr. Magaglio said. A deposit of 5 percent to 20 percent is due when an offer is accepted. Most purchases close within three to four months. The agent\u2019s commission is 4 percent to 6 percent in Milan, and is split between buyer and seller, he said.The transfer tax on properties is very complicated, as many factors are involved. In general, the transfer tax on a sale between private individuals involving a primary residence is 2 percent of the assessed value (the assessed value being typically about a third of the sales price), Mr. Magaglio said. The tax on second homes and luxury homes, as defined by law, is 9 percent. This property has not been categorized as a luxury home, he said.LANGUAGES AND CURRENCYItalian; euro (1 euro = $1.06)TAXES AND FEESThe current owners do not pay property tax because of a recent change in the law that exempts resident owners of a first home, Mr. Magaglio said. The change was one of several tax measures aimed at boosting the sluggish housing market.WEBSITESCONTACTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gawker and Hulk Hogan Reach $31 Million Settlement", "Date": "2016-11-02", "News": "Supported byIn fighting a lawsuit filed by the former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan, Gawker Media lost nearly everything \u2014 the verdict, its founder, its independence \u2014 but it maintained its resolute conviction that it would win on appeal.On Wednesday, however, Gawker capitulated, settling with Hulk Hogan, whose real name is Terry G. Bollea, for $31 million, according to court documents, and bringing to a close a multiyear dispute that stripped the company of much that once defined it.All of these developments were viewed by some as the end of an era, and journalists \u2014 not just those who had worked at Gawker \u2014 published articles that often read like obituaries for a media company that had ushered in a certain style of irreverent, no-holds-barred journalism online.Still, those at the company held on to a steadfast belief that it was in the right and that it would be vindicated on appeal. The fight became a symbol of press freedom, pitting a wealthy individual against a take-no-prisoners news organization.But that fight ultimately proved too difficult to sustain.\u201cAll-out legal war with Thiel would have cost too much, and hurt too many people, and there was no end in sight,\u201d Mr. Denton added. \u201cGawker\u2019s nemesis was not going away.\u201dMr. Denton did not respond to a request for further comment.In a statement issued on Wednesday, Mr. Thiel said, \u201cIt is a great day for Terry Bollea and a great day for everyone\u2019s right to privacy.\u201dDavid Houston, a lawyer for Mr. Bollea, said in a statement of his own, \u201cAs with any negotiation for resolution, all parties have agreed it is time to move on.\u201dSome Gawker employees struck a more ominous tone and expressed outrage over what the decision could represent.\u201cThis entire sorry spectacle spells doom for anybody who aspired to do what we aspired to do,\u201d said John Cook, the executive editor of Gizmodo Media Group.The debtors have had settlement discussions with Mr. Denton though they have not reached a final agreement, according to the court documents filed on Wednesday.Gawker Media also settled two other lawsuits, according to the documents \u2014 with Shiva Ayyadurai over a 2012 article about a claim that he invented email, and with the journalist Ashley Terrill over a 2015 article about her efforts to uncover information about a former Tinder executive. Those articles, as well as the one involving Mr. Bollea, will be removed from the internet as part of the deal between the sides.Ms. Terrill will receive $500,000 from Gawker Media, and Mr. Ayyadurai will receive $750,000, according to the court documents. It is not clear if Mr. Thiel was supporting those lawsuits. Charles J. Harder, a Los Angeles-based lawyer who represented Mr. Bollea, also represented Ms. Terrill and Mr. Ayyadurai.\u201cHistory will reflect that this settlement is a victory for truth,\u201d Mr. Ayyadurai said in a statement.If the settlements are approved by the bankruptcy judge, the money would come from the proceeds of the sale to Univision.Founded in 2002, Gawker became a go-to site for New York media gossip and a magnet for young journalists who would later go on to work at places like The New Yorker, The Awl and Time. Mr. Denton was widely known for saying journalists shared their most interesting stories at the bar after work, and his mission was to guide those stories onto his sites \u2014 to entertain and surprise their readers with information that traditional news organizations often shied away from.There had been murmurings for months of a potential settlement between Gawker and Mr. Bollea, but even in the weeks leading up to its sale to Univision, Gawker maintained its typical swagger, hosting parties \u2014 one at a burlesque club in Lower Manhattan \u2014 and publishing articles as part of a \u201csenior week\u201d in August that seemed both to be a collection of pie-in-the-sky stories and a reminder of its brashness.On Wednesday, employees were angry but melancholy. Some wondered why the settlement had come now, after so many months.\u201cObviously, the way that we ran this, we suffered the maximal possible damage and gained the least from it,\u201d said Tom Scocca, the executive features editor of Gizmodo Media Group. \u201cA settlement at this point does nothing to repair any of the harm that was done.\u201dOne longtime employee, Hamilton Nolan, had a more cursory response over email: \u201cUgh.\u201dDavid Streitfeld contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Steven Mnuchin, Expected Treasury Pick, Is an Outsider to Public Policy", "Date": "2016-11-30", "News": "Supported byDealBookSteven Mnuchin started his career as a trader.Up until the last several weeks, Mr. Mnuchin \u2014 an entrepreneur, a Wall Street investor and a Hollywood producer \u2014 would have appeared an unlikely choice for the position made famous by Alexander Hamilton. Over his business career, he was never particularly involved in politics, nor did he publicly express an interest in public policy. He never ran a large organization or showed himself to be an accomplished economist.With his appointment to the Treasury, Mr. Mnuchin would be sidestepping \u2014 or passing over \u2014 the more conventional paths to having his signature on United States currency and an office neighboring the White House.On the surface, all of that may make Mr. Mnuchin an outsider of sorts. But he is very much a part of the firmament of the finance world, even if he never reached the corner office of one of Wall Street\u2019s top firms.He started his career at Goldman Sachs, where his father, Robert, was a legendary trader. He then worked for his Yale roommate, the hedge fund manager Eddie Lampert, who runs Sears Holdings, and later for George Soros, before striking out on his own \u2014 with the backing of Mr. Soros \u2014 to start Dune Capital Management.Along the way, he also developed a side business as a financier of many Hollywood hits. His name regularly appears in the credits of films. Just in the past year, he produced \u201cSully,\u201d \u201cStorks,\u201d \u201cThe Legend of Tarzan\u201d and \u201cBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.\u201dMr. Mnuchin is known as a smart, hard-working, talented executive. Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former Treasury secretary who was critical of Mr. Trump during the campaign, was very complimentary of Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s performance at Goldman Sachs.\u201cI think Steven Mnuchin would be an excellent choice for Treasury secretary,\u201d Mr. Paulson said on Tuesday evening. \u201cHe is very talented, has a deep understanding of finance and markets, he knows how to bring people together to get things done, and \u2014 importantly \u2014 he has a working relationship with and the confidence of the president-elect.\u201dThat confidence and loyalty appear to be what clinched the role for Mr. Mnuchin. Unlike several Trump insiders who have publicly campaigned for jobs, Mr. Mnuchin has remained relatively behind the scenes and never seemed to seek the spotlight.While Mr. Mnuchin, who served as the Trump campaign\u2019s national finance chairman, was always considered the probable pick for the Treasury, Mr. Trump spent the last two weeks considering others. The most prominent was Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s chief executive. Others on the shortlist included David McCormick, president of the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates and the former under secretary of the Treasury for international affairs, according to people involved in the process.It is hard to discern what policies Mr. Mnuchin will seek to enact beyond those espoused by Mr. Trump. Like the president-elect, he has talked about lowering taxes and lifting regulations, but mostly without describing specifics.While Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s deepest relationships are with hedge fund managers, investors and big names in Hollywood \u2014 less so among the chief executives of the biggest banks and multinational companies \u2014 he is expected to be welcomed as what one former colleague described as one of the adults in the administration that the industry will feel it can work with.Still, he is expected to face a steep learning curve when it comes to working on international trade, where he doesn\u2019t have much previous experience. And even though he is both an insider and an outsider, some of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters and critics may see him as too much of the former.Mr. Trump criticized Goldman Sachs, Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s former employer, during the campaign, as well as Hillary Clinton for giving paid speeches to the bank.But anyone looking for hints about Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s ideology may be disappointed: His friends say he is not ideological and that, if anything, his ideology is simply his ambition.Advertisement"}

Trump probably could not have found a better candidate for the job than Mr. Ebell.The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.Mr. Ebell, who revels in taking on the scientific consensus on global warming, will be Mr. Trump\u2019s lead agent in choosing personnel and setting the direction of the federal agencies that address climate change and environmental policy more broadly.Mr. Ebell has said that the plan, which has been tied up in the courts since it was finalized in 2015, is illegal. In the interview in Paris last year, he said he hoped whoever was elected president would \u201cundo the E.P.A. power plant regs and some of the other regs that are very harmful to our economy.\u201dAs the person Mr. Trump has chosen to lead the transition at the E.P.A., Mr. Ebell, 63, will be in a position to begin to do just that.Mr. Ebell, who did not respond to a request for an interview, grew up on a ranch in Oregon.

{"Headline": "Asserting a Muslim Fashion Identity", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byLast week, quietly and without much fanfare, the 22nd global Vogue went live.Framed in striking black and gold, the glossy digital pages look, in many ways, much like any other international issue of the world\u2019s most powerful fashion magazine. There is a video interview with the star model Gigi Hadid, a colorful carousel of spring 2017 runway trends, a lavish editorial featuring the latest Chanel, and bright, chatty pieces about hot local brands and social media stars.But then there is this: \u201cHow to Style Your Hair Under a Hijab.\u201d And this: Malikah, a fiery Beirut-raised hip-hop star, describing how she began her career spitting lyrics into a face mask to hide her identity from disapproving conservatives.And, just after a cinematic short film featuring the Lebanese designer Elie Saab and the model Elisa Sednaoui amid ornate dining rooms and lush walled gardens, there is this: the definitive edit of this season\u2019s most stylish abayas (robelike dresses).\u201cThis Vogue is very overdue,\u201d said Deena Aljuhani Abdulaziz, 41, the Riyadh-based Saudi princess, former retailer and newly crowned editor in chief of Vogue Arabia, while she was in Paris during fashion week last month. \u201cThe Arabs deserve their Vogue, and they\u2019ve deserved it for a long, long time.\u201d\u201cThe Vogue Arabia woman is one who celebrates her tradition but also considers herself a highly educated global citizen,\u201d Ms. Aljuhani Abdulaziz said. \u201cDon\u2019t forget that we understand luxury almost better than anyone else on earth. Middle Eastern women have been serious couture clients since the late 1960s. We\u2019ve been around long before the Russians and the Chinese ever came into the picture.\u201dA key part of her Vogue editorial mission, she said, is to eradicate misconceptions around the Arab and Muslim diaspora. The new magazine\u2019s headquarters will be in Dubai, and alongside the online platform starting next March, the 25-member editorial team will produce 11 print issues a year, two of which will be solely in Arabic.\u201cVogue Arabia is not just about appealing to our own region, but about providing a cross-cultural bridge, a beautiful source of inspiration you would want to pick up even if you were from another area,\u201d she said.\u201cMany people don\u2019t really know exactly what Arabia is, and there are major misunderstandings around modest dressing, too,\u201d Ms. Aljuhani Abdulaziz added. \u201cI have a responsibility to tackle those issues, through a fashion lens, of course. I am not interested in being a political magazine. There are plenty of others who do that. But what I can lay out to readers, both near and far, is that what brings us together is far greater than what sets us apart.\u201dA hijab is not just a symbol or a statement, \u201cbut a part of a Muslim woman\u2019s identity, an identity they are asserting more confidently,\u201d Ms. Hasibuan said. (Her show received a standing ovation.) \u201cI believe fashion is one of the outlets in which we can start that cultural shift in today\u2019s society to normalize the hijab in America and other parts of the West, so as to break down stereotypes and demystify misconceptions.\u201dIndeed, modest fashion is fast becoming a commercial phenomenon; the global Muslim clothing market is forecast to be worth $327 billion by 2020, according to the latest Global Islamic Economy report \u2014 larger than the current clothing markets of Britain ($107 billion), Germany ($99 billion) and India ($96 billion) combined. And a rising Muslim middle class, having greater affluence and sophisticated tastes as well as pride in its religion, is likely to triple from an estimated 300 million in 2015 to 900 million by 2030, according to Ogilvy Noor, the Islamic branding consultancy.Shelina Janmohamed, vice president of Ogilvy Noor, said: \u201cThe rise in modest fashion over the last decade has come hand in hand with the emergence of \u2018Generation M\u2019: Muslims who believe that faith and modernity go hand in hand. They want to wear their religion with pride but also feel part of the societies around them.\u201dShe said that more than one-third of today\u2019s Muslims are younger than 15, and nearly two-thirds are younger than 30. And when it comes to young women, more are digitally connected, marrying later and in possession of a disposable income than ever before.\u201cConsumption is part of their identity,\u201d Ms. Janmohamed said. \u201cWhen they buy products that help them better their practice and that reinforce their beliefs, then they believe it will also make them better Muslims.\u201dThe modest fashion catwalk, which hosts three to four runway shows per day, largely from foreign brands, is the centerpiece of the weekend, said the Expo\u2019s chief executive, Tahir Mirza, though it also includes live cooking demonstrations and workshops on Islamic art put on by local galleries.\u201cThe shows are packed,\u201d Mr. Mirza said. \u201cMany young British Muslim women love these modest fashion houses from abroad, because they have westernized branding but traditional values. And they don\u2019t want to compromise.\u201dFor Jacob Abrian, the chief executive of the Arab Fashion Council, the industry body responsible for organizing Arab Fashion Week, his primary focus beyond show seasons is on reinforcing local infrastructure and the framework necessary to create a viable, interconnected fashion industry across the region. By strengthening the existing manufacturing roots and luxury heritage \u2014 from the small traditional factories and village damask weavers to glossy fashion houses being started from the glittering skyscrapers of the Gulf \u2014 and encouraging Western designers to come and showcase their work to a valuable client base, the Middle East could become a center for fashion in its own right.Ms. Aljuhani Abdulaziz appeared acutely aware that her role as Vogue Arabia editor in chief would require relentless careful navigation of religious and regional codes.But as the first Vogue editor to have formerly been a retailer (she was a founder of a fashion concept store in Riyadh called D\u2019NA), she pointed out that she was in the best possible position to understand the demands of her 21st-century readership, \u201cbe it the sophisticated Qatari woman able to shop in Europe, or to help a young woman in a remote village in Algeria or Yemen have dreams and feel like she can belong to something.\u201d\u201cThis job is not without its challenges,\u201d she said. \u201cIt only really dawned on me after the appointment that this won\u2019t just be me doing something I love, but is also a massive responsibility. But I know what offends in this world and what doesn\u2019t, because I am one of them. I have my own sensitivities as to what is appropriate and what is not. I certainly don\u2019t believe that you have to have blatant sexuality or absolute nudity to do a beautiful editorial.\u201d\u201cAny regional title outside the so-called Western world has to make decisions on models and their ethnicity, skin color and body type rather than the usual default Caucasian, and consider considering cultural distinctions,\u201d Ms. Lewis said. \u201cBut Vogue Arabia will have to constantly cross overtly into religious as well as national and regional identities, practices and a variety of income brackets in order to find her reader. And that won\u2019t always be easy.\u201cThen again,\u201d she continued, \u201cthis is something Western brands are being forced to think about more and more when it comes to appealing to observant women from numerous religious backgrounds. Fashion designers in particular need to think more laterally about how they design and the nonnegotiable elements of some lifestyles they design for.\u201cModest fashion and Muslim fashion are no longer on the periphery of the industry, and an industry that stopped being able to afford to be elitist and exclusive long ago. This movement is really driven by an empowered new demographic who are expressing their presence in the modern world, and attempting to assert their place in it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Other kinds of Muslim characters are woefully absent across the dial. Could that change now, after a divisive presidential campaign that included vows by Donald J. Trump to stop Islamic immigration? Or will it be more difficult than ever?These are edited excerpts.There was a lot of worry in the Muslim community \u2014 well, if you start to wash our dirty laundry in public, then everyone will say, \u201cOh, we always knew.\u201d But the opposite started happening, because the show was about a whole Muslim community, the good and the bad. And so they started seeing them as full human beings. What they started saying to me was, \u201cThis reminds me of my community, my synagogue, my church, my temple. We have the same exact debate you guys have.\u201dIt was brought to my attention pretty quickly from some Muslim Americans: \u201cHey, I like your show, but you have to understand that you\u2019re contributing to this xenophobia by trafficking in this worst fear, the sort of basest fears.\u201dIf nothing else, that started a dialogue \u2014 the dawning sense that there\u2019s a responsibility not to just traffic in these not-helpful stereotypes. At the same time, you have the conundrum [that] the show is about counterterrorism.And then 9/11 happened, and we made this movie based on the show. And then the show became political because it wasn\u2019t about terrorism. All people wanted to talk about after 9/11 was terrorism \u2026I have a question for you guys. For me, one of the biggest stumbling blocks wasn\u2019t how the community approached [that portrayal], it was how the industry talks to us about that \u2014 which was very difficult.But then they realized the white people actually wanted the show. They were like, \u201cMake it more Muslim, Muslim, Muslim.\u201dI\u2019m like, I\u2019m running out of ideas! Because we don\u2019t really do that many weird, wacky things. After a certain point, we act like you guys. We\u2019re kind of all the same.For instance, this year, the beginning of it involves the sort of big business of prosecuting entrapment. It actually tests the edges of free speech. How can someone express their discontent with American policy \u2014 even a reckless kid who might express his views that may be sympathetic to enemies of America, but still is not, himself, a terrorist, but is being set up to be one by the big business of government?For me to answer, personally, that question, it\u2019s a difficult one. \u201c24\u201d having been the launching point for me to engage in these conversations, which I have been having for 10 years, and being very conscious about not wanting to be a midwife to these base ideas. We\u2019re all affected, unwittingly, by who we are and how we see the world. It requires creating an environment where people can speak freely about these things. It requires this vigilant empathy.Most network executives, most showrunners, don\u2019t know these people. So even on \u201cThe Brink,\u201d we ended up casting a Persian actor to play a Pakistani general, who was supposed to speak Urdu, and then spoke Urdu really badly. They were like: \u201cThat\u2019s fine. It\u2019s good.\u201dShe\u2019s like, \u201cOh my God, you have to put that in a show, because that is hilarious.\u201d Unless you put someone like me in a show, you\u2019re never going to get that story line.The short answer is no. I don\u2019t think that we could have done anything differently. I could have left the show. Was my conscience sufficiently bothered that I decided to leave the show? No \u2014 I mean I didn\u2019t.I tried to continue with a new level of understanding. The writing reflected, as best as possible, that new dawning and obviously still primitive awareness.An article last Sunday about the portrayal of Muslim characters on television referred imprecisely to Howard Gordon\u2019s role on the Fox show \u201c24.\u201d While he was an executive producer and eventually served as a showrunner, he was not \u201ca creator\u201d of the show.

{"Headline": "Sotheby\u2019s, Christie\u2019s and Phillips Take Different Paths to \u2018Sold!\u2019", "Date": "2016-11-23", "News": "Supported byIt was difficult to escape a sense of unreality in Manhattan last week.High in his eponymous 664-foot-high tower in Midtown, a real estate tycoon and erstwhile reality show host, having just been elected as the 45th president, was appointing members of his administration while protesters down below chanted their disapproval.At the same time, the three big international auction houses were trying to persuade the superrich to buy some of the world\u2019s most expensive art. By and large, they succeeded.\u201cEveryone has been in the dark about how the market would react to the craziness that has been going on in the outside world,\u201d said David Nisinson, a private art dealer based in New York. \u201cWe\u2019re not back to 2007, but this must have a positive effect,\u201d he said about the success of the five evening auctions, which all registered selling rates of more than 80 percent.But all three auction houses, using contrasting strategies, did manage to coax onto the market significant paintings in the $20 million to $50 million range, and ensure they found buyers.Phillips posted the most improved results. Its Wednesday evening auction of 20th-century and contemporary works raised $111.2 million, more than double the $46.6 million from the equivalent sale in May.The auction house, privately owned by Mercury, a luxury retail group based in Russia, has recently made a number of high-profile hires, including Robert Manley, a former deputy chairman at Christie\u2019s, and Cheyenne Westphal, Sotheby\u2019s former worldwide head of contemporary art, who starts in March.Edward Dolman, the chairman and chief executive of Phillips, described the result of his sale as \u201ca significant step up in a market that has contracted.\u201dBut the auction houses\u2019 reliance on third-party guarantees to source and sell big-ticket artworks, particularly at Phillips and Sotheby\u2019s, does raise the question of how much that $25.6 million for the Richter represented a \u201ctrue\u201d market price.Values can be inflated when auction houses offer competitive guarantees to secure major consignments. These guarantee can then be transferred to a third party, who will either buy a work at a sale, or be rewarded for their unsuccessful bidding. More recently, some third-party guarantors \u2014 called \u201cirrevocable bidders\u201d at Sotheby\u2019s \u2014 have also been paid fees if they are the purchaser. These confidential arrangements, denoted by symbols in the catalog, can have the effect of deterring bidding in the salesroom.\u201cIt\u2019s a sold picture, with uplift if possible,\u201d said Alan Hobart, director of the Pyms Gallery in London. \u201cThe price is arranged by the vendor and is normally high. It\u2019s become very opaque,\u201d added Mr. Hobart, who paid $8.45 million for Picasso\u2019s unguaranteed 1951 bronze sculpture, \u201cTete de Femme,\u201d at Sotheby\u2019s Nov. 14 auction of Impressionist and modern art.Bidders at Sotheby\u2019s were similarly lukewarm when Edvard Munch\u2019s 1902 Symbolist masterwork, \u201cGirls on the Bridge,\u201d was offered \u2014 with a third-party irrevocable bid \u2014 as the star of an otherwise relatively thin 42-lot Impressionist and modern auction. Estimated at a heady $50 million, this was bought for $54.5 million by the guarantor.In the case of both the Richter and the Munch, the third-party buyer was also paid a fee by the auction house. Following an approach from Sotheby\u2019s, the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs recommended in September that \u201cnet\u201d prices reflecting buyer discounts should be published after such sales, and all three houses have complied. The buyer of the Richter received about $1.6 million from Phillips; the buyer of the Munch $2 million from Sotheby\u2019s, according to post-auction calculations.\u201cThe air has got quite thin at the top,\u201d said Wendy Cromwell, an art adviser based in New York. \u201cThere used to be at least two bidders on most of the lots, but now there is usually only one. Guarantees do provide cover for the lots and give a sense of security. But what do the totals mean in terms of profit? We\u2019re blind.\u201dWith 16 of the Ameses\u2019 works covered by third-party \u201cirrevocable\u201d bids, competition was conspicuously measured. But a sumptuous red-hued 1986 Richter abstract, \u201cA.B. Still,\u201d which the Ameses bought at Sotheby\u2019s in 1991 for $264,000, was doggedly pursued by two telephone bidders to a top price of $34 million, against an estimate of $20 million.Over all, the 79 lots of the Ames Collection raised $131.3 million, a total which would suggest that Sotheby\u2019s did make a profit on the guarantee.Similarly, the following evening at Christie\u2019s Impressionist and modern sale of 48 lots, Claude Monet\u2019s 1891 \u201cGrainstack\u201d \u2014 a spectacular sunset from the artist\u2019s first set of series paintings, also offered without a guarantee \u2014 set off a 14-minute bidding duel that ended in a telephone buyer paying $81.4 million with fees, also an auction high for the artist and the highest auction price this year.Christie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s, the historic rivals of the auction world, are taking different approaches to winning consignments. The privately owned Christie\u2019s has drawn back from the high-rolling guarantees that bought it market dominance in 2015 and is now luring sellers with the promise of higher prices in competitive bidding at its auctions.With Phillips now in the mix, three-way bidding for consignments of blue-chip works is becoming the new reality at the top end of the auction market. This is good news for owners of valuable art, if not bidders in salesrooms.\u201cI\u2019m very happy, said a smiling Fran\u00e7ois Odermatt, a collector based in Montreal, just before Phillips\u2019s auction last Wednesday. \u201cThe more competition the better.\u201dAn earlier version of the article mischaracterized the status of Cheyenne Westphal at Phillips. She will take up a position there in March; she has not already joined the company.Advertisement"}

Even if the state wanted to, an exit would require two-thirds approval of both the House and Senate in Washington, along with the blessing of 38 state legislatures \u2014 a feat analysts say is implausible.But Mr. Evans may be on to something. After Mr. Trump clinched his victory late Tuesday, at least three tech investors signaled a willingness to finance a secession effort.Speaking by phone, Mr. Hemeon, who is the founder of Design Inc. in Orange County, said he was \u201creeling\u201d from Mr. Trump\u2019s win.

{"Headline": "Where to Be Single in New York", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported byThere may be no such thing as an ideal neighborhood for single people, but even in this age of dating apps and websites, neighborhood continues to play a huge role in how, and whom, people choose to date.Whether one is striking up a conversation at a coffee shop or tallying up proximity points with a potential love interest, geography matters in large ways and small. Not fretting about an hourlong postdate commute allows drinks to turn into dinner, for instance. A bar filled with friends may bestow the confidence to initiate a conversation with a stranger, which in turn may lead to the confidence to approach some other stranger, at some other bar, on some other night.In a city as diverse as New York, a neighborhood where dating happens naturally can be difficult to find. And statistics may, like a pickup line, mislead.Dorothy Castillo found the prospect of moving to Manhattan enticing for any number of reasons. Not least of all because she assumed the city\u2019s dating scene would be far superior to that of suburban Rockland County, N.Y., where she\u2019d spent most of her life.\u201cI thought, \u2018This is going to be my golden ticket! I\u2019m going to date all the time!\u2019 \u201d recalled Ms. Castillo, 27, a special-education teacher who bought a studio apartment in Washington Heights two and a half years ago.\u201cI was truly and honestly \u2014 I don\u2019t know if this is na\u00efve \u2014 but I was hoping to meet someone at the grocery store or walking down the street,\u201d she said. Instead, meeting people in person was \u201cnear impossible,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd I consider myself a social person.\u201dThough not opposed to online dating, she felt out of place in family-friendly Washington Heights and found her forays to Midtown and Lower East Side bars disappointing, the men standoffish.\u201cI love it here,\u201d Ms. Castillo said. \u201cThere are a lot of young people here because it\u2019s a fun place to live. I\u2019d like to meet someone not in a bar, but I\u2019m just enjoying my 20s, going on some crazy dates.\u201dIn a similarly surprising corollary, a neighborhood with a high percentage of single people doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into a good singles neighborhood.Between 2010 and 2014, Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, had a 36 percent increase in the number of single men (single being defined as a person aged 20 to 34 who has never been married) to 15,121 from 11,127, and a 31 percent increase in single women, to 12,272 from 9,361 \u2014 one of the largest increases in the city, according to the census bureau\u2019s American Community Survey. Based on that data, the New York City Economic Development Corporation declared the neighborhood \u201can attractive spot for all young singles\u201d in 2014.\u201cIt\u2019s a middle-class neighborhood. People go to work, go home, go to sleep. When people want to go out, they go elsewhere. It\u2019s not like Park Slope, where people are hanging out all the time.\u201dThough it may be the envy of Bensonhurst, the Park Slope dating scene did not impress Robert DiBiase when he moved there from Washington, D.C., several years ago.The neighborhood had plenty of bars, conceded Mr. DiBiase, 42, an associate broker at Halstead Property, \u201cbut they were small and filled with locals, not people coming from Manhattan to hang out.\u201d The local bars were places where neighbors went to grab a beer and catch up, he said, not places to meet a potential mate.Now he won\u2019t date anyone who lives in Brooklyn. Or Queens. Or the Upper East Side, for that matter. He prefers to stay within blocks of home. \u201cThat\u2019s what apps are for,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m so used to convenience living in New York. I don\u2019t want an hour-and-a-half obstacle just to grab a coffee. I don\u2019t want to end up coming back at midnight on some train that stalls in the station because of an investigation.\u201dAnd for those hoping to meet in what her clients often refer to as \u201cthe natural way,\u201d neighborhood can make all the difference, she said. Certainly, it did for her.One evening, she saw an attractive man at an event on the Upper West Side, where she lived, but she was too shy to approach. Afterward, she was standing on the sidewalk and he walked by again. Loath to let another opportunity pass, she caught his eye, smiled and struck up a conversation. She later found out that he had come into the cafe where she was an owner just the day before. He is now her husband. \u201cFate gave us another chance!\u201d she said.\u201cI know this sounds hokey, but you get a chance to cross paths with people and you often miss it,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the same neighborhood you get that chance over and over again.\u201d\u201cI want someone I can communicate with and bring into my circle of friends. Someone who can be equal or better,\u201d Ms. Zamor said, adding that, \u201cunfortunately, this seems to create a standard that can never ever be met.\u201dTara Atwood, 33, lived in Manhattan for 10 years after college, first on the Upper East Side, then in Midtown East. She worked in finance and dated \u201cmeatheads who wore baggy jeans ripped at the bottom and didn\u2019t want to do anything but drink beer and watch football.\u201dIn Manhattan, she said, the men she met through apps would boast about being a top person at a place like Oracle, the high-tech company.\u201cNow I\u2019m into the kind of guy with facial hair who wears a leather bracelet and goes salsa dancing,\u201d she said.While finding one\u2019s tribe may be the underpinning of dating success, certain factors make it more likely to happen in some places than others. Neighborhoods popular with singles tend to have comparatively affordable housing, convenience to transportation and a good assortment of bars and restaurants \u2014 think Astoria in Queens and Murray Hill and the East Village in Manhattan.Charles Conroy, a salesman for Citi Habitats, said that for his post-college clients who want to walk out the door into night life, he usually recommends the East Village. He recently found an apartment on Second Avenue and 10th Street for three men in their early 20s, one of whom broke up with his girlfriend so he could move in with his friends and \u201cextend the college experience before moving in with girlfriends down the road.\u201d\u201cHis dating life has skyrocketed,\u201d Mr. Conroy said. \u201cHe sends me texts all the time.\u201dThe New York neighborhoods with the highest ratio of single women to single men, ages 20 to 34, are the Upper East Side (0.6 men to every woman), Murray Hill (0.68), the Upper West Side (0.79) and Brownsville, Brooklyn (0.8) according to 2014 data from the American Community Survey compiled by the city\u2019s Economic Development Corporation.Neighborhoods with the highest percentages of single men tend to be immigrant communities, according to a researcher at the development corporation \u2014 Elmhurst/South Corona, Queens has the best odds for women in the city, with 1.57 men to every woman; Jackson Heights/North Corona is a close second at 1.54 men to every woman. Not all of those men are looking for women \u2014 Jackson Heights has grown increasingly popular with gay men.Newcomers quickly find themselves overwhelmed with invitations for Friday night Shabbat dinners, and synagogues vie to be the center of the scene, luring singles with snacks like kosher sushi and meatballs.The dating scene is so frenetic, some people weary of it, including those who fail to meet someone despite what would appear to be every conceivable opportunity.For some singles, less may be more.Dr. Carlos J. Huerta, 40, a dentist, moved to Hell\u2019s Kitchen recently after nine years in the East Village. He left an apartment share to be closer to his then-boyfriend, his friends and the practice he had just started.When he and his boyfriend broke up a short time later, he found himself single in the center of one of the city\u2019s most vibrant gay dating scenes. \u201cI loved the East Village. It felt serendipitous, like you could meet people from different walks of life,\u201d Dr. Huerta said. \u201cHell\u2019s Kitchen is so concentrated with eligible men,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do you pick and choose?\u201dHe said he was glad that his rental building, Gotham West, is on 11th Avenue, because it affords some distance from the scene. Even so, he\u2019s thinking about moving back downtown. \u201cIt\u2019d just be nice to have to think about it a little less, to live in less of a concentrated dating pool,\u201d he said. \u201cTo meet someone in more of a chance encounter.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Resist Much", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported byThis is a very dangerous man, our next president. Dangerous in his certitude about what he doesn\u2019t know. Dangerous in his ignorance of history, his antipathy toward reading, his inability to sort fact from fiction. The last man to play things by the gut while in control of the world\u2019s most powerful military left a mortal mess.But welcome, for now, President-elect Donald Trump. It feels, in much of the nation, like the death of a loved one \u2014 the sudden, unexpected kind. I haven\u2019t felt this way since the nuns told our second-grade class that John F. Kennedy had been assassinated. Still, grief is an emotion that has little power in politics.A majority \u2014 well, not from the popular vote, which Hillary Clinton won \u2014 chose radical change over reasoned predictability. They\u2019re going to get plenty of change, much of it chaotic and cruel. Those who think Trump can be contained, or trained by seasoned K Street hacks to act reasonable, are deluding themselves. He\u2019ll do it his way.The Republicans will control everything, including the Supreme Court. Washington is theirs, with minimal checks and balances. And if the forgotten, the undereducated, the Rust Belt survivors think they are going to see a renaissance of their communities, consider this headline from Yahoo Finance on the day after the election: \u201cTrump win is a \u2018grand slam\u2019 for Wall Street Bankers.\u201d He will not betray his class.But resistance is not futile. Within the durable strength of the Constitution are many options \u2014 peaceful, legal, effective countermoves, not the burn-it-all down schemes of the Trumpsters, had Clinton won. One question is existential: Can the world survive the 45th American president?When he looks the other way while Russia takes a small country, we can remind him that the United States signed a treaty with war-broken European allies that cannot be dismissed by fiat. When he orders the generals to torture suspects, kill family members of suspected terrorists, they can cite Geneva Conventions \u2014 something the generals know much more about than Trump.The State Department, which usually tries to be a force for good, advocating human rights over bottom lines, cannot be easily pressed into aiding the globe\u2019s gangsters and oligarchs, even if Newt Gingrich is secretary of state.When Trump takes away people\u2019s health care, when he tries to reinstate a system that was not, in fact, fabulous for those with pre-existing conditions, he will find a constituency of people who are one medical bill from bankruptcy. They will have to shout to be heard above the lobbyists, but they won\u2019t go away quietly.When Trump tries to ignore the provisions of a global accord to curb climate change, and charts a path for the United States as a rogue nation, the resistance will come from the millions of young Americans who found a voice in old Bernie Sanders. They will be similarly roused when he attempts to let the despoilers have their way on public land. Millennials will learn the hard way that failure to turn out in sufficient numbers at election time could cost their children a habitable planet.The wall will not be built, nor will it be paid for by Mexico. It\u2019s absurdly expensive, and unworkable. It was always a ruse. Instead, Trump will stage a photo op in Arizona, and, noting a net out-migration pattern started under President Obama, declare victory. Same with the authoritarian plan to round up 11 million people, tearing families apart. He\u2019ll be stopped by majority sentiment, appalled at a police state in neighborhoods.Speaking of people power, the gloomiest of progressives should look at what voters did at the ballot box \u2014 measures that a Republican Congress never would do. Gun-safety initiatives, some of them quite strong, passed all over the West, even the wilder parts, as in Nevada, where the National Rifle Association spent $4 million in a losing cause. These new laws are designed, in general, to keep unstable people from getting military-style weapons \u2014 something that is also backed by a majority of the people.In red and blue states, a hefty raise in the minimum wage was instituted through the ballot box. Congress won\u2019t even consider giving many of Trump\u2019s most ardent supporters a boost in their wages, but those measures passed in all four states where they were offered.The strongest resistance should come from the white working class; they will soon find out that Trump will treat them the same way he treated the suckers who signed up for his fraudulent university. When steel mills fail to return to Youngstown, or when new trade deals produce no more magic than the old ones, these economic exiles will wonder how they got betrayed. Look to the euphoria of soon-to-be deregulated Wall Street bankers for your explanation.Finally, all of us in the American family should never trust anyone from the pollster industrial complex, including those at my own newspaper.

Trump filled two lower-profile but influential White House staff jobs on Friday, while his high-profile candidate for secretary of housing and urban development, Ben Carson, continued to deliberate about whether to join the administration.For the politically sensitive post of White House counsel, Mr. Trump chose Donald F. McGahn II, a Washington election lawyer who pushed to deregulate campaign finance and election laws. The counsel\u2019s job may be even more daunting than it was in previous administrations, given Mr. Trump\u2019s far-flung business empire, with which he shows no inclination toward severing ties.In rolling out the appointments, the Trump transition team lined up testimonials from big names in both parties.Former Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, regarded as a foreign policy hawk, praised Ms. McFarland, 65, as \u201cone of our country\u2019s most experienced, informed and wise foreign policy and national security experts.\u201d Mr. Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat turned independent, was a Yale College and law school classmate of Ms. McFarland\u2019s husband, Alan R. McFarland, a well-known investment banker.Edwin Meese III, an attorney general under President Ronald Reagan, said Mr. McGahn, who was the general counsel for the Trump campaign, had \u201cdealt ably with the intersection between politics, government ethics and the rule of law.\u201d C. Boyden Gray, a White House counsel to the elder President George Bush, said Mr. McGahn was well suited to the job because of his \u201cserious prior relationship with the president\u201d and his \u201cworking knowledge of government ethics and election law.\u201dA brash, guitar-playing conservative born in Atlantic City, Mr. McGahn learned the fine points of election law from a longtime Republican expert in the field, Benjamin L. Ginsberg.At the Federal Election Commission, where he served five years, including terms as chairman and vice chairman, Mr. McGahn was a powerful voice of opposition to what he often saw as intrusive government meddling in elections. He also spent nearly a decade as the general counsel to the National Republican Congressional Committee.Ms. McFarland\u2019s national security experience dates to the Nixon administration, when she was an aide to Henry A. Kissinger. She was a staff member on the Senate Armed Services Committee, a speechwriter for Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger, and the principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for public affairs.She is a familiar presence on Fox News, where she has harshly criticized Mr. Obama over his handling of the Islamic State. \u201cThe president has stuck his head in the sand,\u201d she said in September 2014 after the group had kidnapped and executed two American journalists.\u201cTo me, it\u2019s a dereliction of duty,\u201d she added. \u201cWhat was this president doing? Well, he was playing a lot of golf this summer, but he clearly was not attending to the defense of the United States.\u201dIn 2006, Ms. McFarland mounted a bid for the Republican nomination for the Senate in New York. The mayor of Yonkers, John Spencer, defeated her and went on to lose to the Democratic incumbent, Hillary Clinton. During the campaign, Ms. McFarland came under scrutiny for gilding her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u2014 claiming, for example, that she had been the highest-ranking woman in the Pentagon when, in fact, two other women outranked her.The deputy national security adviser has one of the most demanding jobs in the West Wing, coordinating meetings of deputies and principals to formulate policies and organizing the vast flow of paperwork from the agencies to the White House.\u201cThat job is the ultimate policy nuts-and-bolts and paper-pushing job,\u201d said Peter D. Feaver, who served in the National Security Council under President George W. Bush. \u201cIt is all about reviewing policies, framing disagreements and teeing up decisions. It is supposed to be the place where bad ideas die, and so places a premium on analytical insight.\u201d\u201cHer early work in the Reagan administration is more important than her recent work on TV,\u201d he said of Ms. McFarland.As Mr. Trumps fills key staff positions, some of his cabinet decisions have become complicated. The search for a secretary of state has bogged down as rival factions argue for Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor and a Trump loyalist, and Mitt Romney, the former Republican presidential nominee, who stridently opposed Mr. Trump during the campaign.Among those raising questions about Mr. Giuliani is Vice President-elect Mike Pence, according to people in the Trump transition who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive internal matters. Mr. Pence, they said, has favored Mr. Romney in internal discussions. Reince Priebus, whom Mr. Trump named as chief of staff, has said positive things about Mr. Romney but has been more circumspect, and has tried to offer perspective to Mr. Trump on both men.But other people, including Kellyanne Conway, who managed the campaign, have raised questions about Mr. Romney\u2019s loyalty after he became one of the most vocal critics of Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy. Mr. Trump has remarked to people that he was surprised by the intense resistance to Mr. Romney.Mr. Romney and Mr. Trump spoke again in recent days, according to people briefed on the deliberations, and plan to speak again early next week. But some of Mr. Romney\u2019s allies, who have no interest in seeing him apologize for criticizing Mr. Trump during the campaign, say privately that his chances of being chosen are dimming.With Mr. Carson, the delay appears to be less about fissures within the Trump camp than within Mr. Carson himself.\u201cHe\u2019s still pondering, believe it or not,\u201d Mr. Williams, his friend, said on Friday. \u201cDr. Carson is very methodical, just like he\u2019s going through a surgery, planning every aspect.\u201dMr. Carson endorsed Mr. Trump after ending his own campaign. But he has appeared conflicted about joining the administration. Last week, Mr. Williams was quoted as saying his friend was reluctant to take a job for which he had no experience and that \u201ccould cripple the presidency.\u201dMr. Carson, however, then took to Facebook, where he has built much of his grass-roots political following, to say his reasons for declining a cabinet job had been misreported. He was on Facebook again on Wednesday, explaining his change of heart.\u201cAfter serious discussions with the Trump transition team,\u201d Mr. Carson wrote, \u201cI feel that I can make a significant contribution particularly to making our inner cities great for everyone.\u201dReporting was contributed by Maggie Haberman and Trip Gabriel from New York, and Jeremy W. Peters and Eric Lichtblau from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Renewable Energy Grows in an Unlikely Place: the Sunny Mideast", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 When it comes to energy, the Middle East and Persian Gulf are best known for their oil and gas. But across the region, governments, power companies and investors are beginning to exploit another abundant resource: the sun.In places like Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, solar power plants are providing an affordable and reliable source of electricity, badly needed by nations that produce oil and those that must import it. Wind farms are appearing, too.But experts see real potential for growth in an area that gets some of the strongest and steadiest sunshine in the world. Parts of Jordan, for example, average 330 sunny days a year.\u201cIn the past, whenever I used to meet with ministers of energy in some of the oil- or oil-and-gas-rich countries, they would talk about renewable energy, and that meeting would end in a nanosecond,\u201d said Nabil Habayeb, General Electric\u2019s president and chief executive for the Middle East and North Africa. \u201cToday, many of them are eager to talk about it. Whether you\u2019re oil-rich or not, it\u2019s a big trend.\u201dAfter a previous wave of interest in renewable power was derailed by the global financial crisis in 2008, the fresh surge of investment has been driven by anxiety over maintaining reliable supplies of energy in times of political and economic turmoil and the allure of solar panels that are 60 percent cheaper than in 2009, Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimated.Many experts and renewable energy advocates see solar as the smartest way to meet a demand for power that the energy analysis firm says has been climbing by about 4.5 percent a year, as growing populations increasingly embrace middle-class comforts like air-conditioning.While there has been more talk than action in some nations, particularly those with their own oil reserves, things are beginning to change, said Elena Giannakopoulou, an energy markets economist at Bloomberg New Energy Finance in London.\u201cWe expect them to start ramping up,\u201d she said \u201cBecause it\u2019s cheap, it makes sense,\u201d the region\u2019s sunshine is very reliable and \u201cthey have issues that solar can solve, like the security of supply.\u201dThere are frustrations. Shifting policies and the failure of officials to follow through on ambitious plans have left some international companies disappointed, said Browning Rockwell, executive director of the Solar GCC Alliance, a solar trade group for the gulf.Centralized political power and state control of utilities can also make doing business difficult, he said.\u201cPeople are a little bit fatigued, because there\u2019s been a lot of promise and hype,\u201d Mr. Rockwell said. Now, though, many nations \u201care reaching a point where they have no choice\u201d but to get serious about renewable energy.The region\u2019s biggest energy divide is between countries rich in oil and gas, most notably Saudi Arabia, and those that must buy fuel beyond their own borders. Both have an incentive to expand solar generation \u2014 oil- and gas-producing nations so they can sell more of what they drill and importers to reduce their dependence on volatile international markets.Not surprisingly, though, it is the energy importers who are moving most aggressively.The Shams Ma\u2019an solar farm, built by First Solar and owned by a consortium of companies, began commercial operation in September near the ancient city of Petra, generating enough power for 35,000 homes, First Solar, which is based in Arizona, said.And the 38-turbine Tafila wind farm increased Jordan\u2019s total power capacity by 3 percent when it opened last year, said Masdar, one of the project\u2019s developers.Dubai and Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates, are also serious about renewables. The Gulf states\u2019 emissions of planet-warming carbon dioxide are among the world\u2019s highest, and the U.A.E. has vowed to shrink its footprint. Dubai aims to get 25 percent of its energy from clean sources by 2030 and 75 percent by 2050.\u201cThey have understood here very clearly that they need to change,\u201d said Christian von Tschirschky, an energy expert at Ernst & Young in Dubai.The Dubai Electricity and Water Authority said in May that it had received a bid of 2.99 United States cents per kilowatt-hour from developers vying to be part of the third phase of the giant Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum Solar Park, expected to be among the world\u2019s largest when complete.It was a record that did not stand long. In September, neighboring Abu Dhabi received a bid of 2.42 cents, marking another milestone in a sector whose costs have been dropping drastically toward competitiveness with more traditional fuels.Egypt is also pushing forward on solar, although a shortage of hard currency and shifts in policy have put some big projects in question.Leaders in Saudi Arabia have vacillated about their commitment, announcing ambitious renewable power goals and then backing away.The low price of oil has created serious budget pressures in the kingdom, which relies on oil for much of its income and still burns some of its crude for electricity.\u201cThey could release it to the world markets and generate increased revenues,\u201d Mr. von Tschirschky said. And if oil rises, \u201cthe incentive to export at a higher price is even higher.\u201dIf Saudi Arabia chose to put muscle into developing a solar power sector, its companies could become the region\u2019s suppliers and installers, said Mr. Rockwell of the Solar GCC Alliance.\u201cSaudi has always been the big multiplier for the region, because if the Saudis can figure out how to make it work in their country, they\u2019ll go elsewhere,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can drive development of solar in other markets.\u201dThat has yet to happen. If Saudi leaders fail to make a big push on solar, Mr. Rockwell said, they will miss a chance to bolster power production and to create a new source of jobs for a generation of well-educated but underemployed young people.Experts say the subsidies fuel corruption, discourage efficient energy use and make it hard for newer sources to compete.The biggest advantage solar now has, though, is its falling cost.\u201cThat was the main challenge in the past,\u201d said Mr. von Tschirschky of Ernst & Young. \u201cRenewable energy was more expensive than the technologies to burn oil and gas Now, it\u2019s more attractive.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Josh Gottheimer Defeats Scott Garrett in New Jersey Congressional Race", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byJosh Gottheimer, a first-time Democratic candidate and former aide to President Bill Clinton, defeated Representative Scott Garrett of New Jersey on Tuesday, ending a bruising campaign for a seat that both parties had targeted in seeking gains in their battle for control of the House.The race was marked by negative advertising and a flood of outside money, as Democrats sought to unseat Mr. Garrett, a seven-term Republican incumbent who was one of the most conservative members of Congress.With 97 percent of precincts reporting, Mr. Gottheimer held a nearly four-point lead. Mr. Gottheimer declared victory shortly after midnight, although Mr. Garrett did not immediately concede.\u201cThey said this couldn\u2019t happen, that our district was just too partisan, too entrenched,\u201d Mr. Gottheimer said at his victory party, which his campaign streamed on Facebook Live. \u201cBut handshake by handshake, call by call, living room by living room, vote by vote, you, all of you proved them wrong.\u201dA ballot measure that would have allowed casinos to be built in the northern part of New Jersey was soundly defeated, while The Associated Press reported that voters approved a second measure that would require the proceeds from a newly increased gas tax be dedicated to the state\u2019s Transportation Trust Fund, which pays for infrastructure projects.In races for the state\u2019s other 11 congressional seats, the incumbents \u2014 six Democrats and five Republicans \u2014 were on track to be re-elected.And in the presidential race, Hillary Clinton, a Democrat, easily beat Donald J. Trump, a Republican, in the state where he once controlled a casino empire, giving New Jersey\u2019s 14 electoral votes to her. Democratic presidential candidates have won in New Jersey in every election since 1992, when Mr. Clinton was elected.The race between Mr. Garrett and Mr. Gottheimer in a crescent of suburbs and rural communities that runs along New Jersey\u2019s northern border, between the Hudson and the Delaware Rivers, was the state\u2019s most closely watched congressional contest.Mr. Garrett was a founding member of the Tea Party-aligned Freedom Caucus in the House, and is well to the right of the more moderate Republicans that New Jersey has tended to send to Congress.The district is also the only one in the state with relative parity between the two main political parties, with about 140,000 voters registered as Democrats and about the same number as Republicans. About 216,000 voters are registered without a party affiliation.Mr. Gottheimer made Mr. Garrett\u2019s far-right views and votes a key part of his campaign, focusing at times on his opposition to same-sex marriage and reports that he had objected to the Republican Party\u2019s backing for gay candidates to Congress \u2014 reports that Mr. Garrett has denied.Mr. Garrett portrayed Mr. Gottheimer as being too liberal for the district, accusing him of being a typical tax-and-spend Democrat.In the race\u2019s last days, an anti-Semitic flyer emerged showing Mr. Gottheimer with devil\u2019s horns; the flyer had a gothic-style script similar to that used historically in anti-Jewish propaganda. Mr. Garrett\u2019s campaign manager, Sarah Neibart, sent out an email condemning the flyer but also asking whether it was a \u201cpolitical ploy\u201d by the Gottheimer campaign \u201cmanufactured by them to fabricate a hate crime\u201d \u2014 a statement that brought fresh condemnations and counter-condemnations.The gas-tax ballot measure called for amending the State Constitution so that all of the money produced by a recently increased tax would go to the Transportation Trust Fund. Proponents, including unions and many businesses, said it would keep politicians from using the money elsewhere.Opposition to the measure was led by Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, a Republican who is expected to run for governor next year. She argued that the ballot measure would clear the way for $12 billion in state borrowing to support the transportation fund.Patrick McGeehan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Coal\u2019s Political Heft Plunging? One State May Be Canary in Mine", "Date": "2016-11-02", "News": "Supported byBELLINGHAM, Wash. \u2014 The American coal industry, with its billions of dollars and army of lobbyists, has a storied history of muscle and might. But in this northwest corner of Washington, people like Christopher Grannis, a 69-year-old building contractor and stalwart in local civic causes, are standing up to coal.And coal is losing.\u201cThere are financial rewards for a few, but risks are borne by many,\u201d Mr. Grannis said, standing at a microphone at a recent Whatcom County Council meeting in support of a moratorium on new applications for fossil fuel transport through the county. Council members passed the moratorium later that evening.And on Election Day, this state may go further, with a vote on a first-of-its-kind ballot initiative to tax carbon emissions \u2014 a policy that most economists say is the most effective way to tackle global warming. Across the country, both advocates and opponents of climate change measures are watching closely to see if the Washington ballot initiative will herald national efforts to fight global warming through higher taxation of fossil fuels.The state ballot initiative would create a tax of $25 per ton on planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions, and use the revenue to cut one percentage point from the state sales tax, give a rebate of up to $1,500 for low-income families and effectively eliminate a tax on manufacturers.\u201cIt\u2019s a global problem, so it can\u2019t be done only in one state,\u201d Mr. Mankiw said. \u201cThe answer has eventually got to be a global carbon price. But this is the right step to a global solution.\u201dThe coal industry sees Washington\u2019s efforts as a one-two punch. But what really scares coal executives is the prospect of a trend.Mr. Murray spoke disdainfully of those efforts. Although he would like to ship his coal to Asia through Washington, \u201cthey won\u2019t let me,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019m taking it to Vancouver.\u201d Of local activists like Mr. Grannis, he said: \u201cAll they\u2019re doing is hurting themselves. It\u2019s a political movement. I don\u2019t have time for these radicals.\u201d\u201cThe decisions those folks on the coast are making affect more than just the future of their state \u2014 it is deciding the future of citizens of Wyoming and Montana and other major coal states,\u201d said Mr. Mead, whose state is the nation\u2019s largest coal producer.Mary L. Lyons, 64, a former office manager who retired to Longview from the Seattle area, was not impressed.Though she has never been much involved in politics, promises about coal and its benefits brought back memories of a childhood trip through Appalachian coal country, where the poverty and environmental damage stayed in her memory, she said.As Mr. Mead made his case, she stood up to challenge him, she recalled, and her involvement rolled on from there.\u201cIt just made me really angry, that\u2019s all,\u201d she said.And supporters of the carbon tax have vastly outspent opponents. As of Oct. 27, Mr. Bauman\u2019s campaign to pass the carbon tax had raised $2.4 million and spent $1.4 million, while the campaign opposing the initiative had raised about $790,000 and spent just $411,000. About 23 percent of the money raised in favor of the tax was from outside the state, compared with about 51 percent of the money raised against it.Those numbers also appear to bode well for the continuing efforts to block the coal export terminals, environmentalists say. But that does not mean the terminals are dead, said Clark Williams-Derry, the director of energy finance for the Sightline Institute.\u201cThese things are zombies,\u201d he said. \u201cThey never quite die. They keep shambling forward even when their economic heart has stopped beating.\u201dKirk Johnson reported from Bellingham, and Coral Davenport from Washington.

{"Headline": "A One-Cent Soda Tax Gets Expensive in California", "Date": "2016-11-06", "News": "Supported byScaling BackIn this most contentious of elections, you wouldn\u2019t think that a soda tax would be the issue to attract the big bucks. But measures in just two California cities have drawn more money than that state\u2019s Senate race and statewide referendums on marijuana legalization and gun control \u2014 combined.Soda taxes are on the ballots in San Francisco and Oakland, Calif., and spending to persuade citizens to vote for or against them has topped $50 million \u2014 enough to buy every person in those two cities about 100 cans of Coke, at least if you bought them in bulk.The battle is the biggest so far by health advocates in their efforts to reduce the consumption of sugary carbonated soft drinks that they say leads to obesity, diabetes and tooth decay.Recently, the tide has begun to turn, helped in part by big donations from Mr. Bloomberg. Two years ago, Berkeley, Calif., became the first city in the country to pass such a tax. Mr. Bloomberg got involved late in the effort, when it became clear the law had a chance of passing. (San Francisco had its own failed soda-tax initiative that year; it won a majority of votes but failed to clear a supermajority threshold, a bar it won\u2019t need to clear this time.)Albany, Calif., another community in the Bay Area, is also voting Tuesday, though there has been less direct spending there. Boulder, Colo., will vote on a 2-cent-per-ounce soda tax measure Tuesday. And Cook County, Ill., which includes Chicago, is to consider a soda tax measure later this month.The Bay Area initiatives are expensive prizes. Unlike Philadelphia, where much of the battle was fought through lobbying, both California tax proposals must win passage by a majority of voters. That means both sides have invested in big public outreach campaigns.\u201cIt was intense and expensive, and folks were amazed in talking about it,\u201d he said of 2014. \u201cAnd it was nothing like this.\u201dThe measures are similar in both cities: They would impose a tax of one cent per ounce of any drink with added sugar, including sugary soft drinks, iced teas and smoothies. The taxes would be imposed on beverage distributors, not at the checkout registers. The emerging evidence from existing soda taxes suggests those higher prices will be passed through to retailers and then to shoppers. If they are, they could result in a price increase of 67 cents on a two-liter bottle, or $1.44 for a 12-pack.Those higher prices are intended to discourage shoppers from consuming so many sugary drinks, which have been linked to obesity, diabetes and tooth decay. The pro-tax side has been emphasizing the negative health effects of soft-drink consumption, and arguing the tax will make the city\u2019s children healthier.A local coalition of anti-tax advocates, led by the American Beverage Association, a trade group for drink-makers, began sending direct mail months earlier than is typical for a ballot initiative.Susan Neely, the association\u2019s president, said her organization was committed to fighting soda taxes on every front. \u201cWe oppose them wherever they are introduced \u2014 that is a clear position that we have staked out,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is not going to change.\u201dThere has been little public polling on the measures, though consultants on both sides said they have been polling privately, and the vote will be close. The complexity of the city\u2019s ballots this year makes predicting a result hard. In San Francisco, voters are considering more than 40 initiatives, including two separate measures about plastic shopping bags. The beverage tax is fairly far down on both ballots, which means some voters may grow fatigued and fail to weigh in.An earlier version of a headline with this article gave an incorrect distinction to the level of spending on the soda tax referendums in the Bay Area. A California initiative that would limit the prices paid for prescription drugs has prompted the most spending among the state\u2019s ballot measures. The spending on the soda tax referendums is not the most expensive on the California ballot.Advertisement"}

Julie Menin, the commissioner of the Mayor\u2019s Office of Media and Entertainment, who conceived of the program in her previous job as the commissioner of consumer affairs, said the district chosen would be announced in December.Children enrolled in traditional public and charter school will receive accounts. The program will be overseen by a newly created nonprofit, NYC Kids Rise, whose board is to include Ms. Menin, Schools Chancellor Carmen Fari\u00f1a and Mr. de Blasio\u2019s deputy mayor for strategic policy initiatives, Richard Buery.Ms. Menin said that soon after taking office in 2014, she met with the treasurer of San Francisco, Jos\u00e9 Cisneros, who told her about that city\u2019s program.\u201cI became more and more excited about the possibility that we could do this here in New York City,\u201d she said, \u201cand I felt that it fit in perfectly with the mission of the de Blasio administration in terms of increasing access and inclusion for low-income New Yorkers.\u201dThe initial $100 contributions will be deposited into an omnibus 529 account, so that undocumented immigrants, who do not have the Social Security or individual taxpayer identification numbers needed to set up individual accounts, can participate. At the same time, families will also be encouraged to start their own individual 529 accounts for saving.Actual college savings, if families do not add money to the funds, will be slight: With only the $100 initial contribution and $200 in matching funds, assuming a 4.5 percent annual return, the child\u2019s account would be worth about $475 after 12 years.William Elliott, an associate professor and director of the Center on Assets, Education and Inclusion at the University of Kansas, said child savings accounts had many potential financial benefits.\u201cIf you have savings early on, you\u2019re more likely to be connected to financial institutions later in life,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re more likely to buy stocks, invest in real estate, buy a home, do the things that build assets.\u201dMore than 800,000 New Yorkers do not even have bank accounts, Ms. Menin said. She said she hoped that the program would have a ripple effect in connecting families with financial institutions.Mr. Gray said he and his wife were attracted to the idea of increasing financial literacy among low-income families and encouraging saving.\u201cI love the idea of democratizing the benefits of long-term investing,\u201d he said.Ms. Menin said she hoped eventually to expand the program to the rest of the city, which she estimated would cost $15 million annually.Mr. Gray said he was open to making additional donations but would first see how many families opened up their own 529 accounts and saved enough to get the $200 in matching funds.\u201cIf we get a lot of takeup,\u201d he said, \u201cand we have a lot of families saving money, investing, opening up these 529 accounts, that to me and to us would be a sign of real success.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Start-Ups Face Challenges", "Date": "2016-11-16", "News": "Supported byIn the competitive start-up world, even the shrewdest entrepreneurs \u2014 with the latest and greatest gadgets \u2014 can find themselves thrown unexpectedly into legal quagmires that could derail or blow up a dream before it gets off the ground.Sometimes it\u2019s a simple oversight. Other times, a fresh-faced business owner tries to save a few dollars by ignoring such issues as liability, patents, copyright and taxes. But many of these business-killers are not only foreseeable, but preventable as well, experts say. And several who have paid heed have avoided potential business land mines. \u201cI didn\u2019t start training anyone until I had the insurance,\u201d said Mr. York, who has a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration from the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University.But getting insurers on board wasn\u2019t easy. He contacted five companies before finding one that would sign him on. Mr. York had to demonstrate that he could strap down the equipment in the van to reduce the risk of road accidents and that his certification as a personal trainer reduced the chance that clients would be injured.Initially, he tried to save money by not insuring his equipment, thinking that it would be safe while locked in a van. Nevertheless, after one van was vandalized in 2014, he started insuring the equipment as well.Insurance to cover liabilities is often an afterthought for many start-ups, but it should often be at the top of the list. A manufacturing defect, an injury to an employee or customer, or even a hacker breach of a payment system or website could lead to a lawsuit and kill a budding start-up.\u201cSometimes a lot of start-ups don\u2019t want to hear about the coverages because they think it will cost them money,\u201d said Melnora Cruz, a vice president at MOC Insurance Services, based in San Francisco. But they cannot afford not to protect themselves, she said: \u201cThey could have a claim that costs $1 million and could put them in bankruptcy.\u201dOther legal issues can also trip up companies. Mr. York, for instance, got a trademark on his logo right away and bought both spellings of the domain name \u2014 GymGuyz and GymGuys \u2014 to protect himself from copycats.\u201cPeople laughed at me and told me I was crazy,\u201d Mr. York said. \u201cThey said, \u2018Why would you do that?\u2019\u201dUndaunted by the skeptics, Mr. York pushed ahead. His company will have franchises in 100 markets in 18 states by year-end, up from one location eight years ago. Its revenue, which totaled $101,000 in 2008, is on track to reach $5.5 million this year from the company-owned business and franchise fees.When would-be underwriters heard the word trampoline, many conjured up visions of 1960s-style backyard trampolines, where reports were rampant of people tumbling off and being rushed to hospitals with broken bones.\u201cWe went to six to 10 insurers\u201d before finding one that would provide coverage, said Jeff Platt, chief executive of Sky Zone. It took considerable time to educate insurance brokers about the netting, safety guards, rules and monitoring staff before he could convince a company that the injury risk at his parks was low.\u201cThe only way to fall off of our trampolines would be to climb up a trampoline wall, then climb up about seven feet of netting and then literally jump over it,\u201d Mr. Platt said.Mr. Platt said he was constantly learning about new liabilities and addressing them. In 2012, he installed cameras inside and outside the parks after a break-in. In 2014, Sky Zone faced a security breach of one park\u2019s pay systems, where a small number of credit card numbers were stolen. Mr. Platt quickly brought in security experts to fix the breach and monitor the systems at all the parks.His vigilance has paid off. Sky Zone owns four parks and holds franchises in 175 locations in six countries. Its revenue, which stood at $800,000 in its first full year in 2005, rose to $54.1 million from company-owned parks and franchise fees in 2015. It is on track to reach $60.1 million this year.Mike Howell, 38, a Seattle resident with a degree from the London School of Economics, is a co-founder of Dolly, which began in 2014. He said insurers were initially reluctant to sign on, fearing that the risk of damage or injury would be high for a business that relied on someone with no moving expertise to transport furniture and other items from one location to another.But Mr. Howell said underwriters misunderstood the business. Dolly is aimed at consumers who want a fast, cheap and easy way to move a small number of items from one apartment or store to another. It is not competing with moving companies that deal with the entire contents of a house.Most moves involve fewer than five items and cost an average of $80. Dolly picks up a 15 percent to 25 percent commission on each move. Damage has been reported in fewer than 1 percent of the 100,000 moves Dolly has done, according to Mr. Howell.\u201cWe now have an investor who\u2019s a big-time insurance broker\u201d and advises the company on insurance matters, Mr. Howell said.Dolly has raised about $10 million in financing, with Jeffrey A. Wilke, chief executive of Amazon\u2019s worldwide consumer unit, among the investors.Patent, ownership and copyright issues could also sink a company if not addressed.Some cash-short entrepreneurs opt to skip the search for patents and trademarks to save money \u2014 and that\u2019s a mistake, warned Allan H. Cohen, managing partner at Nixon Peabody\u2019s Long Island law office.He recalled one client who built a health care app, adopted a name, and then spent tens of thousands of dollars developing a logo, website and marketing materials using that name. However, when a trademark search was later conducted, the company discovered that the name was already being used by a small firm in another state.The client, however, did not want to change the name, and is now gambling that the company will not be sued.But company owners who want to be a huge success should pay heed, Mr. Cohen said. \u201cThey could get a cease-and-desist order and have to stop using the name or be sued,\u201d he said.Taxes are also often overlooked out of concern over costs \u2014 but some tax provisions can actually be beneficial. Some programs, such as the angel investor tax credit available in some states, can make raising money easier. And the federal research and development tax credit can save money on a start-up\u2019s tax returns, said Mitchell Kopelman, a certified public accountant and a partner at HA&W, a business advisory firm in Atlanta.All of these crucial issues should be addressed early and re-examined as a company grows.\u201cEven today we learn about new liabilities with our business,\u201d said Mr. Platt of Sky Zone. \u201cRisk management doesn\u2019t end; it is an ongoing process that is living and breathing every single day.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Escape From East Berlin", "Date": "2016-11-16", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Television viewers expecting the usual programming on NBC on Dec. 10, 1962, were greeted instead with a 90-minute documentary film depicting in startling detail the escape of 29 East Germans who had fled through a tunnel under the Berlin Wall.It was hardly an accident that the network ended up with such great footage. NBC had financed the project, giving the students who led the excavation the equivalent in today\u2019s dollars of about $150,000 in exchange for exclusive rights to film them digging their way from a former swizzle-stick factory in West Berlin into the Communist east. The broadcast was sponsored by Gulf Oil.The Kennedy administration had opposed airing the documentary. On top of the safety concerns and ethical questions raised by the payments, the White House argued that NBC was dangerously heightening tensions between the two superpowers at the peak of Cold War anxiety. As Bobby Kennedy, the president\u2019s brother and attorney general, summed it up, \u201cThat was a terrible thing you people did, buying that tunnel.\u201dBut for the NBC correspondent Piers Anderton, the subject was irresistible and the peril integral to the drama. \u201cThis was history in the making,\u201d Greg Mitchell writes in \u201cThe Tunnels,\u201d \u201ccin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9, danger at every turn, day after day, happening right in front of the camera\u2019s eye \u2014 one might call it something new for TV, a reality show filmed at the front line of the Cold War.\u201dThe book chronicles the mad moment between the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 and the Cuban missile crisis over a year later, when residents of the divided German capital were gripped by an obsession with tunneling. After the East German government decided to block the flow of refugees streaming into West Germany with barbed wire and concrete, people jumped from windows and roofs, crawled under the wires, climbed over the barriers and crashed through checkpoints behind the wheels of trucks. As border guards shot to kill, the need for new approaches became apparent.One obvious solution was to go under instead of over or through the wall. According to Mitchell, work began on roughly 75 tunnels, of which fewer than 20 were successful. But those few successes were touted in the press with photos and testimonials, stoking a sensation. NBC and CBS competed to see which would be the first to film a tunnel for their news programs, even as Hollywood beat them to the punch with a feature film called \u201cEscape From East Berlin.\u201dMGM built a plaster replica of the wall in West Berlin that was 300 yards long and became a tourist attraction. Knowing that filming near the real wall would draw the attention of East German sentries, the filmmakers used them as unwitting extras. A crew recorded the guards flashing their spotlights across the border. \u201cTalk about realism!\u201d the director Robert Siodmak exclaimed.Mitchell, the author of several books on politics and history, could have written a light riff with such strange, satire-ready material, but he has chosen a serious approach. Lengthy forays into transcripts of President Kennedy\u2019s deliberations with his advisers provide context but drag in places, as do accounts of the drudgery of long hours in damp underground passageways.But Mitchell quickly wins the reader back with his tense descriptions. The most dramatic are the moments when the diggers were about to find out if they had blindly burrowed up to the right basement floor and succeeded in keeping their plots a secret, or were about to stare down the barrels of border guards\u2019 rifles and long prison terms \u2014 or even death.In spite of the financial support of the television network, the NBC tunnelers \u2014 led by three students, a German and two Italians \u2014 nearly didn\u2019t make it. Boulders blocked their path, forcing exhausting detours; two different leaks nearly ruined their underground passageway with floods; and they risked exposure at every turn by a Stasi agent, Siegfried Uhse, who had infiltrated one of the main groups in West Berlin dedicated to rescues.The greatest strength of \u201cThe Tunnels\u201d is in the details, the hand-cranked World War II-era field telephones the diggers used to communicate underground; a joking sign on the ceiling of the tunnel that read \u201cAchtung! You are now leaving the American sector!\u201d Uhse had been caught by the East Germans smuggling 112 cigarettes \u2014 fewer than six packs \u2014 but that was all the leverage the Stasi needed to turn him into an informant of devastating effectiveness.Days after finishing the book I could not escape one of Mitchell\u2019s images \u2014 of a hat with a small hole in it landing softly on the Western side of the border while its owner\u2019s dead body fell back into the East, waiting for the guards to hurry it out of sight. For those who see walls as the answer to policy problems, this book serves as a stark reminder that barriers can never cut people off entirely but only succeed in driving them underground.Nicholas Kulish, formerly the Berlin bureau chief for The Times, is now a correspondent in New York. He is the author of the novel \u201cLast One In\u201d and a co-author of the nonfiction book \u201cThe Eternal Nazi.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Refinancing Your Mortgage Can Pay Off Your Student Loan", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byYour Money AdviserA new home-loan refinance program allows borrowers to swap student loans for mortgage debt at today\u2019s low interest rates. But the move could carry risks for some borrowers.The cash-out refinance program \u2014 called the Student Loan Payoff ReFi \u2014 is offered by the nonbank lender SoFi and backed by the government-controlled mortgage giant Fannie Mae.Under the student loan payoff program, homeowners who have student loans \u2014 or home-owning parents who co-signed student loans for their children or who have their own parent loans \u2014 can refinance their mortgage and take out additional home equity as cash. SoFi pays off the student debt with the extra cash and the borrower is left with a new, larger mortgage, but at a lower interest rate.Borrowers already have the option of taking out a home-equity loan or line of credit and paying off their student debt. But since second home loans generally carry higher interest rates than a first mortgage, there\u2019s often little benefit to doing so, said Michael Tannenbaum, senior vice president of mortgage at SoFi.The current rate for federal undergraduate student loans is 3.76 percent; the rate for federal Plus loans, for parents of undergraduates or for graduate students, is 6.31 percent. But rates were often much higher in the past, so homeowners with that debt probably have higher rates. Private student loans \u2014 made by banks and other lenders, and usually requiring a co-signer \u2014 typically carry significantly higher rates than federal loans. The current average rate for a fixed-rate private student loan is about 6.5 percent, Mr. Tannenbaum said. But the rate can be in the double digits.SoFi and Fannie Mae estimate that 8.5 million households are potentially eligible to pay down or pay off their student debt using the cash-out refinance option. About 41 percent are homeowners with their own student debt; more than a third are co-signers of student loans. The average homeowner with outstanding co-signed student loans has a balance of $36,000, according to Experian data cited by the companies.\u201cIt\u2019s a great opportunity for parents who co-signed on student debt,\u201d said Jonathan Lawless, vice president of product development and affordable housing at Fannie Mae.Consumer advocates cautioned, however, that exchanging student loans for mortgage debt carries risks that borrowers should consider.The lender is able to offer a lower rate on the new, refinanced mortgage because unlike student debt, it is secured by collateral: your house. If you default on the mortgage, the lender ultimately has the right to foreclose on the home.In contrast, defaulting on student loans means you may ruin your credit and face financial havoc, but you\u2019re unlikely to lose the roof over your head, said Persis Yu, director of the Student Loan Borrower Assistance Project at the National Consumer Law Center.\u201cThis adds a new layer of risk,\u201d Ms. Yu said.Borrowers with federal student loans, in particular, should think carefully before making such a trade. Federal loans, unlike most private loans, come with protections, like the option to defer payments if you lose your job and flexible repayment programs that tie your monthly payment amount to your income. By refinancing federal student loans into a new mortgage, you\u2019ll lose those rights.\u201cYou\u2019re essentially giving up your safety net,\u201d said Ashley Harrington, counsel with the Center for Responsible Lending.It\u2019s also wise to consider just how much money you\u2019ll save over the long term, she said. You\u2019ll pay a lower rate, but for a longer period of time. The standard student loan repayment plan is 10 years, while most mortgages are 30-year loans (although 15-year loans are an option).Mr. Tannenbaum said that borrowers with federal and private student loans could benefit from the payoff program, but he considered it a \u201cslam dunk\u201d for those with private loans. If, however, you have federal loans, and \u201cif you\u2019re concerned that in the future you might not be able to make your payments,\u201d he said, the student-loan payoff option may not be for you.Here are some questions and answers about using home equity to pay student loans:SoFi arranges the payoff of the student debt directly with the lender. The borrower does not receive the cash.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Behind Closed Doors, Measures to Reform City\u2019s Campaign Laws Raise Concerns", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byAbout New YorkThree years after the 2013 elections revealed serious flaws in New York City\u2019s campaign finance laws, the City Council may finally be moving to fix some of the worst problems \u2014 but not without including a few changes that would benefit individual Council members.Up to a dozen new bills are being shaped behind closed doors, and although no drafts have been released yet, word coming from the Council has alarmed some of the city\u2019s most persistent and careful advocates for better and fairer elections. At least some of the legislation being discussed would make it easier for candidates to amass war chests of public money for future races, or to spend campaign money on expenses that are not permitted by the city law but are for state politicians. By way of egregious example, one powerful state senator used campaign money to buy covers for his swimming pool, somehow deeming them not to be a personal expense.Gene Russianoff, a lawyer with the New York Public Interest Research Group who helped drive reforms 30 years ago, said, \u201cThe Council is considering what additional goodies it wants to put onto these necessary changes.\u201dNew York City has one of the country\u2019s premier campaign finance laws, a system of public funding designed nearly three decades ago, when some of the most powerful figures in government were raking in millions from companies doing business with the city.That law turned city politics around. It rewarded candidates who collected many small donations over those who got big ones. The first $175 of a contribution is matched at a rate of $6 in public money for each $1 donated. An individual may give up to $4,950, but only the first $175 is matched. That is a way to spread financial power to people of moderate means.Admirable as the law\u2019s record has been, it gets stress-tested every election as candidates, power brokers, businesses and unions figure out new ways to funnel money.In other forays, lobbyists and others in the influence business were able to get $1.2 million in city matching funds by bundling contributions.Back in 2006, the Council contemplated not matching \u201cbundled\u201d contributions, but passed on it. Three years ago, the city\u2019s Campaign Finance Board proposed changes that would exclude the bundled money of lobbyists from being matched. The change was supported by the mayor. The Council, inexplicably, has sat on the legislation, but is now getting ready to take action, Council officials said.\u201cMost contributions exceeded the limit applicable to candidates,\u201d she continued, \u201cand at least a dozen were as large as $100,000.\u201dThe City Council speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, said through a spokesman that the new bills would address the bundling and the independent expenditures of groups like Campaign for One New York.\u201cThe Council\u2019s legislative package, which is still being drafted, builds on the strongest campaign finance law in the country, closes loopholes, increases transparency and reduces the influence of lobbyists and entities which do business with the city,\u201d the spokesman, Eric Koch, said. \u201cThe City Council has been engaged in rigorous discussions about campaign finance reforms and expects to introduce several bills in the very near future.\u201dTwo Council members said to be involved in the legislation, Dan Garodnick of Manhattan and David Greenfield of Brooklyn, did not respond to requests for comment on any of the bills. The chairman of the Council committee that will hold hearings on them, Benjamin Kallos, said he was skeptical, adding that \u201cI am concerned about undermining the best parts of a system that has worked for the people.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Could Put Climate Change on Course for \u2018Danger Zone\u2019", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For a look at how sharply policy in Washington will change under the administration of Donald J. Trump, look no further than the environment.Mr. Trump has called human-caused climate change a \u201choax.\u201d He has vowed to dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency \u201cin almost every form.\u201dAnd in an early salvo against one of President Obama\u2019s signature issues, Mr. Trump has named Myron Ebell of the business-backed Competitive Enterprise Institute to head his E.P.A. transition team. Mr. Ebell has asserted that whatever warming caused by greenhouse gas pollution is modest and could be beneficial. A 2007 Vanity Fair profile of Mr. Ebell called him an \u201coil industry mouthpiece.\u201dGlobal warming may indeed be the sharpest example of how policy in Washington will change under a Trump administration. President Obama has said his efforts to establish the United States as the global leader in climate policy are his proudest legacy.But if Mr. Trump makes good on his campaign promises, experts in climate change policy warn, that legacy would unravel quickly. The world, then, may have no way to avoid the most devastating consequences of global warming, including rising sea levels, extreme droughts and food shortages, and more powerful floods and storms.\u201cIf Trump steps back from that, it makes it much less likely that the world will ever meet that target, and essentially ensures we will head into the danger zone,\u201d said Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University and a member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which produces global reports on the state of climate science.Mr. Trump cannot legally block other countries from fulfilling their Paris agreement commitments, nor can he quickly or unilaterally erase Mr. Obama\u2019s climate rules.But he can, as president, choose not to carry out the Paris plan in the United States. And he could so substantially slow or weaken the enforcement of Mr. Obama\u2019s rules that they would have little impact on reducing emissions in the United States, at least during Mr. Trump\u2019s term.That could doom the Paris agreement\u2019s goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions enough to stave off an atmospheric warming of at least 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, the point at which, many scientists say, the planet will be locked into an irreversible future of extreme and dangerous warming.Without the full participation of the United States, the world\u2019s second-largest greenhouse gas polluter, after China, that goal is probably unattainable, even if every other country follows through on its pledges.The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.And, the experts say, without the participation of the United States, other governments are less likely to carry out their pledged emissions cuts.\u201cThat target is already extremely difficult to achieve, but it could be done with very hard, very diligent work by every single country,\u201d Mr. Oppenheimer said.The election of Mr. Trump is likely to cast a pall over Marrakesh, Morocco, where global negotiators have gathered for a 12-day conference to hash out the next steps for the Paris accord: how to verify commitments are being met, and how to pay for enforcement by poor countries that cannot afford the technology or energy disruptions.Traveling in New Zealand, Secretary of State John Kerry was asked if he still planned to attend the conference, given the results of the election.\u201cI\u2019m absolutely going to Marrakesh, perhaps even more important,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I look forward to being there very, very much.\u201dPessimism appears to be warranted. Mr. Oppenheimer and other climate policy experts said all major emitters needed to take action in the near term to stave off the 3.6-degree increase.Scientific reports released over the last two years have concluded that the measurable warming of the planet because of human activities has already begun. This year is on track to be the hottest on record, blasting past the previous records set in 2015 and 2014.An analysis by Climate Interactive, a scientific think tank that provides data used by many governments, concluded that the policies by the United States would account for about 20 percent of the expected greenhouse gas reductions under the Paris plan from 2016 to 2030. But absent the expected policy actions in the United States under the Trump administration, scientists at Climate Interactive said, the math of emissions reductions will be much more difficult to maintain.\u201cPessimists will find abundant support for despair this morning,\u201d John Sterman, a professor of system dynamics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wrote in a Climate Interactive analysis on Wednesday morning.\u201cWith Mr. Trump in the Oval Office and Republican majorities in both houses,\u201d Mr. Sterman wrote, \u201cthere is little hope that the Clean Power Plan will survive in the Supreme Court or for federal action to meet the U.S. commitment under the Paris accord. Worse, other key emitter nations \u2014 especially India \u2014 now have little reason to follow through on their Paris pledges: If the U.S. won\u2019t, why should developing nations cut their emissions?\u201dThe Clean Power Plan is the ambitious centerpiece of Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change legacy and the key to his commitment under the Paris accord. At its heart is a set of Environmental Protection Agency regulations intended to curb planet-warming pollution from coal-fired power plants. If enacted, the rules could transform the American electricity sector, close hundreds of coal-fired plants and usher in the construction of vast new wind and solar farms. The plan is projected to cut United States power plant emissions 32 percent from 2005 levels by 2030.But the program is currently under litigation by 28 states and more than 100 companies, and it is expected to go before the Supreme Court as early as next year.Mr. Trump and other Republicans have attacked the Clean Power Plan as a \u201cwar on coal.\u201d As president, Mr. Trump would not have the legal authority to unilaterally undo the regulations, which were put forth by the E.P.A. under a provision of the 1970 Clean Air Act.However, Mr. Trump could target the rules by appointing an industry-friendly justice to the Supreme Court and then refusing to defend the plan when it goes before the court.He could also direct the E.P.A. to reissue the plan to be extremely friendly to industry. Such a move would also be subject to lawsuits by environmental advocates, which would further drag out the process. And in concert with congressional Republicans, he could decimate the E.P.A.\u2019s budget, crippling its rule-making capacity.\u201cThey may still have to have a regulation, but they don\u2019t have to do it the way the Obama administration did it,\u201d said Jeff Holmstead, a former E.P.A. official in the George W. Bush administration. \u201cAnd in the meantime, those suits often go on for years and years.\u201dEven if Mr. Trump ultimately fails to gut Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change rules, he could ensure that their enforcement is delayed through his term, as lawsuits wind their way through the courts.Mr. Trump would face difficulties in his plans to eliminate the E.P.A., although it is likely he could substantively reduce its size. He would need approval from Congress to completely erase the agency, said Jody Freeman, a professor of environmental law at Harvard University and a former counselor to Mr. Obama.Ms. Freeman noted that several major environmental laws, including the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, specifically call for rules to be enacted and overseen by the E.P.A. Changing those decades-old rules would also require action from Congress, and Senate Democrats would certainly block such efforts \u2014 unless Senate Republican leaders opt to scuttle what is left of filibuster rules already weakened by Democrats.In China, the world\u2019s largest greenhouse gas polluter, climate change officials said they intended to continue with plans to cut carbon emissions regardless of Mr. Trump\u2019s plans. The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, has vowed under the Paris agreement that Chinese emissions will drop after 2030, and that China will put in place a national system next year to force companies to pay a fee for their carbon pollution.\u201cChina\u2019s attitude toward low-carbon development, as President Xi Jinping has said when he met with Secretary of State Kerry earlier, is that tackling climate change is not something anybody asks us to do,\u201d Chai Qimin, a Chinese negotiator, said in an emailed response from the Marrakesh talks. \u201cIt\u2019s what we want to do.\u201dBut in India, the world\u2019s third-largest greenhouse gas polluter, the election of Mr. Trump has raised doubts about a willingness to move forward. Under the Obama administration, Hillary Clinton, then secretary of state, pledged that rich countries would mobilize $100 billion annually by 2020 to help poor countries make the transition to cleaner forms of energy. Indian officials have made clear that their steps to cut emissions will depend on financial aid from rich countries, but Mr. Trump has also vowed to cut all \u201cglobal warming payments.\u201d\u201cI think most certainly it will affect the momentum in negotiations because it throws up a lot of questions,\u201d said Arunabha Ghosh, chief executive of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a New Delhi policy group.\u201cThe chances of public funds coming from climate finance are much more dismal now,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now I don\u2019t feel very optimistic.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Friday about Donald J. Trump\u2019s climate policy misspelled, in one instance and in some editions, the surname of the head of the president-elect\u2019s transition team for the Environmental Protection Agency. As the article correctly noted elsewhere, he is Myron Ebell, not Ebel.Justin Gillis contributed reporting from Christchurch, New Zealand, Vanessa Piao from Beijing, and Ellen Barry from New Delhi.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pinkerton Foundation, Born of Detective Agency, Prefers to Work Unobserved", "Date": "2016-11-16", "News": "Supported byAmong the New York philanthropies with dynastic names and assets in the billions, one local charity with a nine-figure endowment has been doing its work almost invisibly \u2014 for half a century.In 2015 alone, the Pinkerton Foundation gave $35 million to 300 organizations for a range of projects, including crisis intervention, art classes and sports clubs, mentoring in science projects and college research, reaching about 160,000 young New Yorkers.\u201cThey are now a major force in youth-serving organizations,\u201d said Jeremy Travis, the president of John Jay College of Criminal Justice, which is working as a partner with the foundation to help young people in trouble navigate the legal system.But little seems to be publicly known about the Pinkerton Foundation\u2019s efforts. And that is by design, the foundation president, Richard M. Smith, said in a recent interview at his Midtown Manhattan office. The better \u201cto keep the focus on the organizations we support,\u201d he said.\u201cWe don\u2019t advertise,\u201d Mr. Smith, a former editor in chief and chief executive of Newsweek, said. \u201cWe don\u2019t support big advocacy campaigns. We don\u2019t even go to galas.\u201dBut for this week, at least, as the foundation turns 50, Mr. Smith and his staff are allowing some fanfare. A birthday celebration is being held on Thursday at the New-York Historical Society, and a public relations firm was hired to promote the occasion.The foundation\u2019s original benefactor, Robert Pinkerton II, set a plainly worded mandate to \u201cprevent juvenile delinquency,\u201d using the wealth he had accumulated as chief of the Pinkerton Detective Agency, which was founded by his great-grandfather in 1850.The firm was both the forerunner of the Secret Service and a hired gun involved in strike-busting clashes with steel workers at mills owned by another future charity icon, Andrew Carnegie.Under Mr. Pinkerton, a Brooklyn native, the agency handled more routine corporate security. He seeded the foundation with $10 million and steered its first three grants, totaling $17,000, to a school, a hospital and a church, all on Long Island, where he lived. The foundation no longer has ties to the detective agency.Today, the foundation, with a $600 million endowment, supports an intricate braiding of people, organizations and programs like one held last Friday at the American Museum of Natural History.About 100 high school juniors and seniors spent Veterans Day at the museum\u2019s third annual Student Science Summit, where students worked toward completing their certifications as Pinkerton Science Scholars.Mr. Smith said the program allowed students in underfinanced public schools \u201cwith no science labs or poor science labs\u201d to study science, technology, engineering and math.

{"Headline": "Mayor de Blasio\u2019s Donors Are Avoiding Democrats in State Senate Races", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byTwo years ago, Alex Lodde, a Texas transportation magnate, made his first political donation in New York a meaningful one: He gave $100,000 to a small county political committee in the Hudson Valley to support an all-out effort by Mayor Bill de Blasio to deliver control of the State Senate to his fellow Democrats.A day later, the committee transferred a similar sum to the re-election campaign of State Senator Terry Gipson, part of a flood of late cash linked to allies of the mayor that Mr. Gipson received.Things could not be more different this year.Mr. Gipson, who lost that race and is now seeking to regain his old seat, has seen the flow of outside money to his coffers dwindle, forcing him to run a much leaner campaign.\u201cWe\u2019re doing a lot more with a lot less,\u201d he said on Wednesday.The Democratic committees in Monroe, Putnam and Ulster Counties, which saw an unusual influx of contributions as part of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s previous fund-raising push, have seen their bank accounts and influence wane, according to campaign finance disclosures filed so far.And Mr. Lodde has taken his money elsewhere: He gave $25,000 to a group working to help Republicans retain control of the State Senate.Other donors who featured prominently in the mayor\u2019s 2014 drive to flip the Senate have also switched sides or have simply stayed away from the races this year \u2014 perhaps with good reason.This year, Democrats are trying again to win control of the Senate, focusing, as they did before, on several potentially close races across the state. Mr. de Blasio, asked last month if he would get involved in the races this time around, said he would not. (He has nonetheless been a presence \u2014 in Republican candidates\u2019 ads that portray him as a liberal boogeyman who would gain greater influence if Democrats controlled the Senate.)Outside money continues to flow on both sides of contested races: Various groups, including companies and powerful unions, have been spending heavily in Nassau County and elsewhere, including the race between Mr. Gipson and his Republican opponent, Senator Susan Serino.Much of the money is coming through so-called independent expenditures by outside groups, like political action committees involved in fights over public support for charter schools or whether to restrict home-sharing services like Airbnb.By this point in 2014, Mr. Gipson had received more than $400,000 in transfers from Democratic committees, including the committee in Putnam County, part of which lies within his district, and had spent more than $700,000 in a three-week period in October. This year, Mr. Gipson has not received a penny from the committees, and does not expect to. He spent a little over $90,000 over the same three-week period.He outlined his strategy of going door to door, and conducting in-person events to offset a lack of money for mailings and television advertising. \u201cEven the commercials that we\u2019re making, we\u2019re making a real effort to keep them simple,\u201d he said.Mr. Gipson said he was not aware at the time of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s involvement in helping to deliver funds for his campaign in 2014. But he came to believe that the money was not always well spent.\u201cWe were ultimately paying for a lot of stuff that was ineffective and was not usable in this particular area,\u201d he said, singling out campaign mail pushed by consultants as one expense that was not worth the cost.The Putnam County Democratic Committee has taken in just $500 so far this year, compared with the $663,050 \u2014 $100,000 of it from Mr. Lodde \u2014 it received in the weeks just before and after the 2014 election. Virtually all the money donated two years ago was quickly transferred to the campaigns of Mr. Gipson and Justin Wagner, who ran in another Senate district that included part of the county.The biggest contribution the Ulster County Democratic Committee received this year was for $135. In 2014, the committee got three contributions of more than $100,000, two from unions and one from a private corporation.The Monroe County Democratic Committee has seen more activity. The largest contribution it has reported so far was for $10,000 in May from a teachers\u2019 union political action committee \u2014 nowhere near the two donations of $100,000 each that the county committee received in October 2014, from the United Federation of Teachers and the Communications Workers of America.Then there is Mr. Lodde, a founder and owner of a company based in Dallas, MV Transportation, that owns a school bus company operating in New York City. Mr. Lodde\u2019s $100,000 donation to the Putnam County committee was the first political contribution he had ever made in New York State, according to the state Board of Elections.Mr. Lodde\u2019s donation this year, to the New York State Senate Republican Campaign Committee, came four weeks after word broke that federal and state investigators were examining the 2014 Senate contributions.Mr. Lodde also gave the Republican Senate committee $2,500 in 2015, and he made a $2,000 donation last year to Senator Martin J. Golden, a Brooklyn Republican, who sponsored a version of the bus contract bill, according to state records.The bill was passed by the Senate and the Assembly in June; it has not yet been signed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat.Mr. Lodde declined to comment for this article. No one has been charged with wrongdoing in relation to the 2014 donations.Some other donors who answered the mayor\u2019s call two years ago have also given the Republicans money since then.Gina Argento, a fund-raiser for the mayor whose company, Broadway Stages, does business with the city, gave $10,000 to the Putnam committee in 2014 through a company she controls.John Catsimatidis, a businessman who regularly donates to candidates and groups of both parties, contributed $50,000 to the Putnam Democratic committee in 2014. He often gave to the Senate Republican committee before that, and did so again this year, making a $25,000 donation last month.But some donors involved in Mr. de Blasio\u2019s 2014 Senate fund-raising effort have simply stayed away. Joseph A. Tahl, a developer of affordable housing who had long been a regular contributor to Democratic candidates, donated $10,000 to the Putnam County committee in 2014. Campaign finance records show that was the largest political donation Mr. Tahl ever made in the state. They also show it was his last.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In India, Black Money Makes for Bad Policy", "Date": "2016-11-27", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorNEW DELHI \u2014 On Nov. 8, the Indian government announced an immediate ban on two major bills that account for the vast majority of all currency in circulation. Indians would have until the end of the year to change those notes for other bills, including newly minted ones.On Wednesday, the government released via a smartphone app called \u201cNarendra Modi,\u201d named after the prime minister, the results of a survey purporting to show 90 percent support for its so-called demonetization policy.The government\u2019s wish to tackle these problems is laudable, but demonetization is a ham-fisted move that will put only a temporary dent in corruption, if even that, and is likely to rock the entire economy.Many Indians have been scrambling to change their old notes, causing snaking queues in front of banks and desperation among the poor, many of whom have no bank account and live from cash earnings.Anyone seeking to convert more than 250,000 rupees (about $3,650) must explain why they hold so much cash, or failing that, must pay a penalty. The requirement has already spawned a new black market to service people wishing to offload: Large amounts of illicit cash are broken into smaller blocks and deposited by teams of illegal couriers.Demonetization is mostly hurting people who aren\u2019t its intended targets. Because sellers of certain durables, such as jewelry and property, often insist on cash payments, many individuals who have no illegal money build up cash reserves over time. Relatively poor women stash away cash beyond their husbands\u2019 reach, as savings for the children or the household.Small hoarders often fear being questioned about the source of their money \u2014 they are accustomed to being harassed by tax collectors, among others \u2014 and may choose instead to forgo some of their savings.People have also been skimping in response to the new policy, causing demand for certain basic goods to fall, which has hurt farmers and small producers and could eventually lead them to scale back on their activities.And even more pain is around the corner. With so much money in circulation suddenly ceasing to be legal tender, India\u2019s economic growth is bound to nose-dive. Another risk is that the Indian rupee could depreciate as a result of people and investors moving to more robust currencies.One reason is that the bulk of black money in India isn\u2019t money at all: It\u2019s held in gold and silver, real estate and overseas bank accounts. Another is that even if demonetization can flush out the black money that is held in cash, with no improvement in catching and punishing tax evaders, people with ill-gotten gains will simply start saving in the new bills currently being issued.Both these justifications are flawed. Catching fake notes already in circulation neither helps trap the terrorists who minted them nor prevents more such money from being injected into the economy. It simply inconveniences the people who use it as legal tender, the vast majority of whom had no hand in its creation.There also is no evidence that black money actually is more inflationary than white money; nor in theory should it be. Black money is just money held by people instead of the government. It\u2019s an excessive money supply that tends to create inflation; whether that money is white or black makes little difference.Demonetization may have been well-intentioned, but it was a major mistake. The government should reverse it. It could at least declare that 500 rupee notes, which many poorer people frequently use, are legal again.Tackling corruption also goes beyond currency, cash or even banking. It requires changing institutions and mind-sets, and carefully crafting policies that acknowledge the complexity of economic and social life. The government could start by increasing penalties for tax evasion and amending India\u2019s outdated anti-graft laws.In a country like India, where the illegal economy is so intimately intertwined with the mainstream economy, one inept government intervention against shadow activities can do a lot of harm to the vast majority, who are just trying to make a legitimate living.Kaushik Basu, the C. Marks Professor of International Studies and professor of economics at Cornell University, was chief economic adviser to the Indian government in 2009-12 and chief economist of the World Bank in 2012-6.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vice President-Elect Pence to Take Over Trump Transition Effort", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Vice President-elect Mike Pence will take over as the leader of Donald J. Trump\u2019s transition effort, pushing aside Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, as Mr. Trump moves quickly to assemble a government after his stunning upset victory, the transition team said on Friday.The reorganization puts the urgent task of selecting cabinet officials and key West Wing posts in the hands of Mr. Pence, whose loyalty to Mr. Trump and deep contacts with the Republican establishment on Capitol Hill are seen as critical to navigating the often politically treacherous transition period.But in shuffling those responsible for shaping his administration, Mr. Trump is also keeping close the inner circle of campaign advisers who are deeply skeptical of Washington and who helped design an outsider campaign built on angry and often divisive rhetoric. Stephen K. Bannon, the conservative provocateur and chairman of the Breitbart News website, will be a top transition adviser.Three of Mr. Trump\u2019s adult children and his son-in-law, who were among his closest campaign advisers, will join a 16-member advisory committee to help guide his choices. Rick Dearborn, the chief of staff to Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama and a fierce advocate for Mr. Trump, will move from the campaign\u2019s Washington office to help direct the transition operations.Mr. Christie will become a vice chairman of the transition effort, the campaign said.The new inner circle at the transition offices will direct the activities of dozens of corporate consultants, lobbyists and other specialists who will be responsible for recommending candidates for agency jobs across the breadth of the federal government. Some of those advisers come from industries for which they are now in charge of finding top regulators.\u201cThe mission of our team will be clear: put together the most highly qualified group of successful leaders who will be able to implement our change agenda in Washington,\u201d the transition team announced Friday afternoon.In a statement, Mr. Christie said that he is \u201cproud to have run the pre-election phase of the transition team\u201d and said that he looks forward to working with Mr. Pence. \u201cI want to thank President-elect Trump for the opportunity to continue to help lead in this next phase,\u201d Mr. Christie wrote.Two people familiar with the reorganization discussion said Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, had wanted to marginalize Mr. Christie, who had come to recognize that he was not in the running to serve as a top adviser in Mr. Trump\u2019s White House. It was unclear whether concerns about his ability to be confirmed might prevent him from being offered a cabinet post.The changes will also push aside Richard H. Bagger, a former top aide to Mr. Christie who had been working on the transition. The transition team said Mr. Bagger will \u201creturn to the private sector\u201d but will remain an adviser.Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, and Michael T. Flynn, a retired lieutenant general who has been a top campaign supporter, will also serve as vice chairmen of the transition, the transition team said Friday afternoon.The 16-member advisory committee is made up of four women and 12 men. It will include several members of Congress; Rebekah Mercer, a top Republican donor; Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee; Peter Thiel, a founder of PayPal; Attorney General Pam Bondi of Florida; Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs executive; and Anthony Scaramucci, a hedge-fund manager and Trump supporter. Mr. Bannon will also serve on the committee. A political committee supporting Ms. Bondi received a $25,000 donation from the Trump Foundation, raising questions because it was around the time her office was reviewing allegations against Mr. Trump\u2019s for-profit education programs.\u201cThis team of experienced leaders will form the building blocks of our presidential transition team staff leadership roster, and will work with elected officials and tireless volunteers to prepare our government for the transfer of power on Jan. 20,\u201d Mr. Pence said in a statement.There are some indications that the transition effort was slow to start, perhaps the result of Mr. Trump\u2019s upset victory, which caught much of the political world by surprise. At least a few of the people helping organize the search for Mr. Trump were tapped at the last minute, while others have been preparing quietly for weeks.At the Pentagon and the State Department, officials of the Obama administration said on Thursday that they had not yet heard from Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team about beginning the complex work of transferring responsibilities and authority. A spokesman for the State Department said he did not have \u201cany firm word\u201d on when briefings might begin for designated officials from the new government.Several people briefed on the transition process described it as somewhat chaotic after Mr. Trump\u2019s surprise victory on Tuesday. His campaign was led by four leadership teams over 18 months, and most of those people were back in view on Thursday, including Corey Lewandowski, the campaign\u2019s first manager. Mr. Lewandowski is said to have told people he would prefer a White House senior adviser role, although he has also been mentioned as a possible Republican National Committee chairman. Mr. Lewandowski resigned on Friday from his role as a CNN political commentator.One thing is clear already: those helping Mr. Trump make the decisions are the members of his campaign\u2019s inner circle. On Friday morning at Trump Tower in Manhattan, the president-elect\u2019s closest aides arrived, one by one, waving to the press corps as they entered the elevators.Trump Tower, the president-elect\u2019s residence, has been transformed into a kind of fortress by the Secret Service and the New York police. The building has been ringed by Jersey barriers and concrete blocks marked with \u201cNYPD.\u201d The Secret Service has set up checkpoints on each end of 56th Street near the tower, and pedestrian access has been restricted around the building.With just about 70 days left before the inauguration, Mr. Trump\u2019s administration is largely being assembled behind the scenes. But like much else in the nation\u2019s capital, little stays secret for long.The list of names being mentioned as possibilities for crucial posts in Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet is growing by the hour, giving official Washington what it craves most: a never-ending parlor game as speculation grows about who might actually get a nod.The latest to be swept into the speculation is Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, who was mentioned as a possible candidate for secretary of the Treasury by CNBC. Officials with the Trump transition team said they reached out informally to Mr. Dimon, who was clear he did not want the post.Aides to Mr. Trump have declined to confirm who is on the short list for cabinet posts. And despite the president-elect\u2019s return to Twitter on Thursday night, he has so far said nothing specific about his possible picks.The critical position of chief of staff \u2014 the gatekeeper for the president inside the West Wing \u2014 is expected to come down to a choice between Mr. Bannon and Mr. Priebus. The two men spent more than an hour in a meeting on Friday at Trump Tower.Mr. Giuliani told CNN on Thursday that he might accept an appointment as attorney general, saying that \u201cthere\u2019s probably nobody that knows the Justice Department better than me.\u201dMr. Mnuchin, who served as Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign finance chairman, is said to be a serious contender for Treasury secretary (though Carl Icahn, the investor, and Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, have also been mentioned in the news media).An earlier version of this article misidentified the state Senator Jeff Sessions represents.

{"Headline": "Infrastructure Build or Privatization Scam?", "Date": "2016-11-19", "News": "You should immediately ask three questions about all of this.First, why involve private investors at all? It\u2019s not as if the federal government is having any trouble raising money \u2014 in fact, a large part of the justification for infrastructure investment is precisely that the government can borrow so cheaply. Why do we need private equity at all?One answer might be that this way you avoid incurring additional public debt. But that\u2019s just accounting confusion. Imagine that you\u2019re building a toll road. If the government builds it, it ends up paying interest but gets the future revenue from the tolls. If it turns the project over to private investors, it avoids the interest cost \u2014 but also loses the future toll revenue. The government\u2019s future cash flow is no better than it would have been if it borrowed directly, and worse if it strikes a bad deal, say because the investors have political connections. Second, how is this kind of scheme supposed to finance investment that doesn\u2019t produce a revenue stream? Toll roads are not the main thing we need right now; what about sewage systems, making up for deferred maintenance, and so on? You could bring in private investors by guaranteeing them future government money \u2014 say, paying rent in perpetuity for the use of a water system built by a private consortium. But this, even more than having someone else collect tolls, would simply be government borrowing through the back door \u2014 with much less transparency, and hence greater opportunities for giveaways to favored interests.Third, how much of the investment thus financed would actually be investment that wouldn\u2019t have taken place anyway? That is, how much \u201cadditionality\u201d is there? Suppose that there\u2019s a planned tunnel, which is clearly going to be built; but now it\u2019s renamed the Trump Tunnel, the building and financing are carried out by private firms, and the future tolls and/or rent paid by the government go to those private interests. In that case we haven\u2019t promoted investment at all, we\u2019ve just in effect privatized a public asset \u2014 and given the buyers 82 percent of the purchase price in the form of a tax credit.Again, all of these questions could be avoided by doing things the straightforward way: if you think we should build more infrastructure, then build more infrastructure, and never mind the complicated private equity/tax credits stuff. You could try to come up with some justification for the complexity of the scheme, but one simple answer would be that it\u2019s not about investment, it\u2019s about ripping off taxpayers. Is that implausible, given who we\u2019re talking about?Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times.Advertisement"}

The decision would give the head of the finance board the power to sell municipal assets, renegotiate union contracts and fire city employees.\u201cIt\u2019s an incredible responsibility, one that I\u2019ve lost sleep over the last few weeks,\u201d Timothy Cunningham, the head of the finance board, told reporters, according to The Associated Press. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m going to lose sleep tonight.\u201dIt was not immediately clear what authority the city\u2019s Republican mayor, Donald Guardian, or its elected council would retain. Mr. Guardian said before the vote that the city would go to court to assert its rights to manage its own affairs.Afterward, Mr. Guardian released a statement that said that a five-year recovery plan drawn up by the city \u201cwould have saved the state a substantial amount of money and would have allowed us to maintain complete local sovereignty.\u201d He said the city would continue to work with the state but would \u201ckeep all of our options on the table.\u201dOther New Jersey cities, including Camden, have been placed under state supervision in the past, but the state has granted itself more authority to take direct control in Atlantic City, said Marc H. Pfeiffer, assistant director of the Bloustein Local Government Research Center at Rutgers University.\u201cThis is a new process,\u201d Mr. Pfeiffer said. \u201cWe\u2019ve never done a process like this before.\u201dIn 2002, the state assigned a chief operating officer to help sort out Camden\u2019s financial problems. One of the changes that ensued was the dissolution of the city\u2019s police department and the transfer of authority to patrol Camden to the county police.\u201cCamden is effectively not on the critical list any more\u201d and is in better shape than Trenton and Paterson, Mr. Pfeiffer said. \u201cAtlantic City\u2019s fiscal problems are far more critical that those of Trenton or Paterson.\u201dAtlantic City, which has around 39,000 residents, has sunk deep into debt as much of its lifeblood, the money that gamblers lose at its casinos, has been drained away by Pennsylvania and other neighboring states that have legalized gambling in recent years.Three years ago, Atlantic City had 12 casinos, two of which had once been controlled by Donald J. Trump, the president-elect. But five of the 12, including the Trump Plaza and the Trump Taj Mahal, have shut down as the industry\u2019s annual revenue has been cut in half in the past decade.During that period, the value of the city has plunged to about $6 billion from $21 billion, Mr. Pfeiffer said. But the city has not adjusted its budget to account for that sharp decline in fortunes, he said.\u201cThe city\u2019s not dead,\u201d he said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t been able to get their expenses under control to live within their circumstances.\u201dThe state had ordered the city to submit a five-year plan for solving its financial problems. But last week, the commissioner of the state\u2019s Department of Community Affairs, Charles A. Richman, rejected that plan, concluding that the city was \u201cnot likely to achieve financial stability\u201d without raising taxes or taking more drastic actions.The city has few assets that it could sell to pay down its $500 million of debt. City officials have been loath to divest the most valuable of them, the local water utility, operated by the Municipal Utilities Authority. The city also owns a defunct airport, Bader Field.Rather than selling the utility, city officials proposed another idea: having the utility issue bonds and using the proceeds to buy the airfield for $100 million. Mr. Richman said that would not be \u201cprudent fiscal management.\u201dMr. Pfeiffer said that the state might opt to dissolve the Municipal Utilities Authority and sell the utility company or enter into a long-term contract with an outside entity for its operation. But city officials have made it clear that they would sue to stop such a move.Advertisement"}

Despite what felt like an excruciatingly long wait \u2014 during which Ms. Newman even delayed by sipping water \u2014 the painting attracted only a single bid.That was from a buyer who had agreed before the auction to guarantee the sale.\u201cI was surprised by that,\u201d Morgan Long, senior director at the Fine Art Group in London, said. \u201cIt was a good picture.\u201dConventional wisdom says that sellers are taking a wait-and-see approach in light of tumultuous world events.\u201cThe sales are thinner,\u201d said James Roundell, the director of Impressionist and Modern art at Dickinson, an art advisory based in London and New York. \u201cPeople have wondered, \u2018Do I sell now, or wait?\u2019 There was an argument for waiting.\u201dStill, Ms. Newman said after the auction that the final price of $54.5 million with fees was \u201cstill the second-highest price for a Munch ever achieved at auction.\u201d She also said \u201cit was a lively room,\u201d though none of the evening\u2019s three big-ticket works with third-party guarantees appeared to attract an external bid.Art auctions can be unpredictable. See how you match up in this interactive quiz.Many collectors and dealers deemed the sale solid; the low bids, they said, were more about the quality of works for sale, rather than the state of the world.\u201cNot a single one of my clients has held back because of the election,\u201d Mary Hoeveler, a New York art adviser, said. \u201cBut there is a supply issue. We\u2019ve seen this over the last couple of years. So much of this auction was day-sale quality,\u201d she said, referring to day sales\u2019 less desirable offerings.One of the few lots that generated competition was an early minimalist 1923 painting by the Bauhaus artist L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy, which went for an auction high of $6.1 million on an estimate of $3 million to $4 million. The buyer: Mathias Rastorfer of the Galerie Gmurzynska, who had sold the work to the seller in 1987.\u201cIt was a very good buy, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to have a work of that importance,\u201d Mr. Rastorfer said after the sale.The Munch, the most high-valued auction lot of the week, was consigned by a collector who had bought the painting for $30.8 million at Sotheby\u2019s in 2008. The composition, showing a gaggle of young girls chatting beside the sinister reflection of a tree, is one of the Norwegian artist\u2019s most celebrated Symbolist subjects. It is one of the earliest of Munch\u2019s 12 known paintings of the subject and is one of just two left in private hands.Sotheby\u2019s also had third-party guarantees for Pablo Picasso\u2019s 1963 painting \u201cLe Peintre et Son Mod\u00e8le,\u201d estimated at $12 million to $18 million, and Vincent van Gogh\u2019s 1886 flower still life, \u201cNature Morte: Vase aux Gla\u00efeuls,\u201d at $5 million to $7 million. The typical late-period Picasso, formerly owned by the New York collector Joan Oestreich Kend, who died in April, sold for $12.9 million to the guarantor. Van Gogh\u2019s darker study of gladioli, painted in Paris before his move to Provence, raised $5.9 million.The opacity of Sotheby\u2019s third-party arrangements has been criticized by the art trade for hiding the true sales prices.Some of this may become a little clearer. New York City\u2019s Consumer Affairs Department recommended in September that the auction houses publish net prices for works that have been backed by external finance. For example, the $54.5 million for the Munch was a net price that reflected a \u201cfixed fee\u201d of about $2 million paid by Sotheby\u2019s to the third-party guarantor.An article on Nov. 15 about an auction of Impressionist and Modern art at Sotheby\u2019s in Manhattan, using information from the auction house, erroneously attributed a distinction to the auctioneer, Helena Newman. Sotheby\u2019s now says that Lorna Kelly, who came to Sotheby\u2019s in the 1970s, was the first female auctioneer to lead an evening sale in New York, not Ms. Newman.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Louisa Guinness, a Life in Art Jewelry", "Date": "2016-11-21", "News": "Supported byIt started almost as a whimsy. Then it took over her life.But her life didn\u2019t start this way. Ms. Guinness, who was born in Ireland, spent nearly 20 years in the finance world, first in London and then in Hong Kong and New York, before returning to Britain in 2000. \u201cI needed a break,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what it was I wanted to do, but I knew somehow it should be with art, or jewelry and art.\u201dIn 2003, she and her husband, the art dealer Ben Brown, came up with the idea to organize an exhibition of artist-designed outdoor furniture. Soon after, inspired by her mother-in-law\u2019s Calder necklace, Ms. Guinness organized a Christmas-season sales exhibition of jewelry by artists.\u201cI wanted to put together all the artist jewelry I could get my hands on,\u201d Ms. Guinness recounted, \u201cbecause the more I discovered and the more others discovered it, I just wanted more and more.\u201dThat first exhibition focused on Picasso and Max Ernst and included a gold Picasso pendant with carved bulls\u2019 heads, as well as several pendants by Niki de Saint Phalle \u2014 all art jewelry classics. In addition, she approached Mr. Kapoor, who produced a special Water Ring for the occasion.From there, she quickly expanded to include well-known artists like Lucio Fontana and contemporary names such as Damien Hirst, both for her exhibitions and her personal collection. And she bought her own Calder necklace, which she still considers among her favorites in her own collection, now totaling about 100 pieces.Artist-designed jewelry is frequently referred to as wearable art: essentially, each piece is a tiny sculpture. Its primary appeal is form, not glitter; with rare exceptions, pieces do not include large or flashy gems. Rather, its appeal lies in its design, often in the context of the artist\u2019s larger oeuvre. The fashion editor Amanda Ross, for example, recalled that when she visited Ms. Guinness\u2019s gallery for the first time, \u201cshe had this one Picasso choker that was extraordinary \u2014 but many thousands of dollars. I asked her why it cost so much, and she said, \u2018Well, just think: it\u2019s the most affordable Picasso.\u2019 \u201dThe same could be said of many of Ms. Guinness\u2019s own pieces: a 1967 silver and lacquer bracelet by Mr. Fontana, for instance, could easily stand alone as one of his typical \u201cconcetto spaziale,\u201d complete with perforations.Collecting such jewelry poses unique challenges, however: Coveted pieces are specific, and examples are scarce. Salvador Dal\u00ed\u2019s 1949 ruby-and-pearl \u201clips\u201d brooch, for instance, was produced in an edition of only eight, and \u201cthere are only two I know of in the world,\u201d Ms. Guinness said. She does not own one, but she includes the design in her ideal \u201cperfect collection of artist\u2019s jewelry.\u201d (Also on her list: \u201ca fantabulous, amazing Calder necklace\u201d that is \u201ctoo difficult to wear, to sit on a bust, to have in my bedroom. That would make me really happy,\u201d she said.)As important works appear only rarely on the market, the hunt can be that much more thrilling \u2014 and fiercely competitive, especially as interest in artist-made jewelry is rising. On one occasion, Mr. Brown said, his wife asked him to visit a shop in New York where she had seen a pair of Dal\u00ed earrings for $9,000. He forgot \u2014 and by the next day, they were sold. \u201cShe has never forgiven me for that,\u201d he said.Still, Ms. Guinness prides herself on having what she called a \u201cfairly comprehensive collection\u201d of the \u201cOld Masters of modern jewelry.\u201d Alongside these pieces, she has begun assembling a special collection of the designs she has commissioned, all of which are sold in her gallery \u2014 but their commercial aspect is secondary, she said.\u201cI don\u2019t compromise the artists. I don\u2019t steer them and say, \u2018This won\u2019t sell,\u2019 \u201d she explained. \u201cI may warn them and say, \u2018If you make it like that, it might not sell,\u2019 but if they say \u2018I don\u2019t care,\u2019 I let them do it. I don\u2019t care, either, because what I really want is a great piece of art that you can wear.\u201dThe Water Ring she commissioned from Mr. Kapoor is one piece that succeeded commercially, and it remains among her favorites. (\u201cKapoor will always have a special place in my heart, as he was one of the first collaborations I ever worked on,\u201d she said. \u201cSo wearing this ring \u2014 a very early piece \u2014 reminds me of our journey together.\u201d)Although she is sentimental about some pieces, Ms. Guinness curates her collection much as art collectors do, \u201cfinding what I like and what I think is important and will sit well with the rest of the collection.\u201dAnd it isn\u2019t only artist jewelry that attracts her. She has a penchant for fine detail, and anything that shows \u201cthe skill of a worker,\u201d like the paper jewelry she picked up in Japan. \u201cI also love lapis and gold,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a beautiful pair of \u201960s earrings \u2014 not important, but whenever I wear them I get so many compliments. \u201dDespite all the collecting, selling, designing and curating, Ms. Guinness still is thrilled by art jewelry. \u201cReally, I\u2019ve found that the more you get to know about something, the more you become passionate about it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve become passionate about the whole thing. It\u2019s not that I stood up and said I\u2019m going to enter the jewelry world. I entered the jewelry world and now I love it.\u201dAnd while that love came to her later in life, she observed, she always had an interest in art: \u201cJewelry is more a medium. It\u2019s the way we tell the story. Through the jewelry.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Justin Trudeau Faces Criticism Over Fund-Raisers in Canada", "Date": "2016-11-24", "News": "Supported byNow, after being the chief attraction at a fund-raiser attended by wealthy businessmen, Mr. Trudeau himself is facing criticism from some who say he is not following his own rules.The article was the latest in a series by The Globe and Mail that suggests, opposition members of Parliament say, that donors get privileged access to members of Mr. Trudeau\u2019s cabinet in exchange for cash, which can sometimes be as little as 500 Canadian dollars, or $370. Mr. Trudeau has maintained that no rules have been broken or ethical boundaries crossed.On Thursday, the questions over the May fund-raiser followed the prime minister to Liberia, where he was making a two-day visit. Speaking to reporters in Monrovia, Liberia\u2019s capital, Mr. Trudeau rejected the idea that the large donation from Mr. Zhang and the Chinese association\u2019s honorary president, Niu Gensheng, to the foundation named for his father could influence his thinking or the direction of government policies.Mr. Trudeau said he had cut all ties to the foundation, which promotes and funds academic research in the humanities and social sciences, when he entered politics.\u201cI stepped down from any of my family-related responsibilities shortly after having gotten elected, in order to demonstrate that there is a tremendous separation there,\u201d he said.Mr. Zhang did not respond to a request for comment.Efforts by Mr. Trudeau and his cabinet members to defend the fund-raisers have not placated opponents.\u201cNot only does this event break the prime minister\u2019s own ethics rules, but it does not pass the smell test,\u201d Rona Ambrose, the interim Conservative leader, told the House of Commons on Tuesday. \u201cHe could stop this right away. Why does he not?\u201dAfter The Globe and Mail reported on fund-raisers involving some members of Mr. Trudeau\u2019s cabinet, Mary Dawson, the independent conflict of interest and ethics commissioner, told a House of Commons committee the sessions did not break any laws, but noted that she had repeatedly called for stricter rules.On the way out of the committee room Ms. Dawson told reporters that the fund-raisers were \u201cnot very savory.\u201d\u201cThere should be no preferential access to government, or appearance of preferential access, accorded to individuals or organizations because they have made financial contributions to politicians and political parties,\u201d Mr. Trudeau\u2019s rules state.When they were in power, the Conservatives held fund-raisers that sometimes cast the party in an unflattering light.Lisa Raitt, a former cabinet minister from Toronto, became the subject of an investigation after a prominent lobbyist organized one of her fund-raising events. While Ms. Dawson cleared Ms. Raitt, she called for tighter rules related to fund-raisers, a request that so far remains unheeded. Ms. Raitt is now campaigning to lead the Conservatives.Mike Storeshaw, a spokesman for the Conservatives, said that when the party was in power, guest lists at fund-raisers were vetted and anyone who did business with the government was asked not to attend. He acknowledged that the system was not always perfect.Since The Globe and Mail began publishing its articles, the Liberal Party decided to bar lobbyists from fund-raisers attended by cabinet ministers they lobby. This month, the chairman of a large generic drug company based in Canada pulled out of a group organizing an event attended by the federal finance minister.\u201cDropping them to just $100 per person would price cash-for-access fundraising out of business for good,\u201d The Globe and Mail wrote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Paris Agreement on Climate Change Is Official. Now What?", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 When the landmark Paris Agreement to address climate change officially goes into effect on Friday, the Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe will be floodlit green to celebrate the occasion. Now comes the hard work: figuring out the details.Top energy policy makers and corporate leaders caution that it will be challenging to meet even the deal\u2019s modest goals to reduce planet-warming emissions of greenhouse gases.Many companies have not even figured out yet how much greenhouse gas they emit, much less made plans to curb these emissions. Rapid technological advances in areas like electric cars are not enough to stop the world\u2019s long climb in oil consumption, let alone reverse it.The financial framework, namely a carbon price or tax that would force industries to pay for the pollution they spew, has barely started to emerge. And while tens of billions of dollars of green bonds have been issued to finance environmental projects, these are a pittance compared to the sums required to make a difference.\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of billions, it\u2019s a question of trillions,\u201d said \u00c1ngel Gurr\u00eda, the secretary general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, speaking on Thursday at The New York Times Energy For Tomorrow conference in Paris.The Paris Agreement, reached in December among 195 countries, was never imagined as the silver bullet for global warming. Rather, the goal of the agreement was to stave off the most devastating effects of climate change by limiting the increase in global temperatures to two degrees Celsius, and to just 1.5 degrees Celsius if possible.But even that may prove problematic. If every country fully accomplishes its initial pledges, the increase would be closer to 2.7 degrees, according Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, which is based in Paris. (In the next several years, countries are supposed to set additional goals for deeper reductions.)Nor have all the countries actually ratified the Paris Agreement. S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, France\u2019s minister for ecology, sustainable development and energy, announced at the conference on Thursday morning that 94 countries that had signed the agreement had ratified it, representing 66 percent of global emissions.From a market perspective, many companies do not yet have a strong financial imperative to make sweeping changes to address climate change.Fledgling exchanges for trading carbon emissions rights have attracted limited interest. And the prices on those markets are well below the $100 a ton or more that experts say would force companies to limit their emissions of greenhouse gases.The world needs \u201ca big, fat price on carbon,\u201d Mr. Gurr\u00eda said at the conference.The market for carbon emissions has actually weakened in the months since the deal was approved. \u201cIt has gone from $9 after the agreement to $6 \u2014 it shows us the market impact of the Paris Agreement has not been as strong as we all think,\u201d Mr. Birol said.The scope of the issue continues to expand.Worldwide petrochemical consumption is doubling every 10 years. Aviation fuel consumption has surged as hundreds of millions of people in China and other advanced developing countries have become able to afford air tickets. And sales of fuel-guzzling trucks have soared in developing countries.Ben van Beurden, the chief executive of Royal Dutch Shell, said in an interview on the sidelines of the conference that he thought worldwide demand for oil in the transportation industry, as well as worldwide demand for oil over all, would not peak until the 2030s.Technological advances by themselves may not slow the surge in the world\u2019s oil consumption.Electric car sales, for example, have taken off globally, increasing elevenfold in the last five years. But they still represent a little less than 1 percent of all cars sold.Some automotive experts have predicted a rapid embrace of electric cars in the next decade, as governments and automakers set ambitious targets for sales. If plug-in hybrids are included, more than 20 electric car models are already on the market.But it is unclear how powerful a force they will be in fighting climate change.If half the cars sold worldwide were electric starting next year and continuing for the next 20 years, worldwide oil demand would keep rising, Mr. Birol said at the conference, citing an analysis that his agency plans to release on Nov. 16. The problem is that trucks, aviation and petrochemical production are now the main drivers of the growth in oil consumption.Patrick Pouyann\u00e9, the chairman and chief executive of Total, the French oil and gas giant, predicted that electric cars would not represent more than a third of sales until 2025 and would not represent a third of all cars on the road until a decade later. That will be too late and too little to make a big difference in global oil consumption, he said.Even so, automakers view electric as crucial to their future profits. They are convinced that regulators will keep loading more rules onto gasoline- and diesel-powered cars.\u201cIf you don\u2019t have 20 percent-plus of your sales in electric cars, you\u2019re not going to make it,\u201d said Carlos Ghosn, the chairman and chief executive of Nissan and Renault and the chairman of Mitsubishi Motors.There are other forces at work, too. A common refrain among many executives these days is that they are feeling more social pressure to address global warming \u2014 sometimes from within their own families.Mr. van Beurden of Shell said that a year ago he found his 9-year-old daughter inconsolable, and initially thought it was because he and his wife were leaving the children for a short excursion. But when he spoke to his daughter, he learned that her teacher had talked about dire risks from climate change, blamed oil companies for causing it and suggested that the answer was giving money to Greenpeace.He said he reassured his daughter that global warming would be addressed and that he would help in the struggle. \u201cShe said, \u2018Of course, I trust you,\u2019\u201d Mr. van Beurden said, adding, \u201cand in that sense she is different from the rest of society.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Among their new targets: working-class Americans frustrated by an economy that is no longer producing the middle-class jobs they or their parents once held.Many of these workers voted for Donald J. Trump.\u201cA whole bunch of us out there are not doing well,\u201d Scott Courtney, executive vice president of the Service Employees International Union and one of the chief architects of the Fight for $15 campaign, said in an interview last week.\u201cIn red states, blue states; black, brown, white \u2014 people are hurting,\u201d he said. \u201cSixty-four million of them don\u2019t make $15 per hour.\u201dAs part of the push, thousands of workers turned out in dozens of cities on Tuesday to demand a $15 wage, better working conditions and the right to unionize. Thousands of airport workers, including baggage handlers, cabin cleaners and wheelchair attendants, loomed at the center of the protests, demonstrating and even walking off the job at some of the nation\u2019s busiest airports, like O\u2019Hare International in Chicago.Leaders of the Fight for $15 highlighted the symbolic importance of the airport workers, whose jobs decades ago paid a living wage. More recently, the jobs have become a source of financial hardship as outsourcing to nonunion contractors has taken its toll \u2014 a dynamic arguably central to Mr. Trump\u2019s election.In other cases, blue-collar workers have lost high-paying union jobs at factories and replaced them with lower-paying jobs at nonunion factories or e-commerce fulfillment centers.\u201cWe\u2019re shining a light on a part of the economy that used to be living-wage work,\u201d said Mary Kay Henry, the president of the Service Employees International Union, which has spent tens of millions of dollars on the Fight for $15 campaign. \u201cThey\u2019re joining with fast-food workers, child care, home care, which have never been living wage work.\u201dOrganizers said that in addition to extending the movement to a different profile of job, they believed the Fight for $15 campaign had to become more disruptive to achieve a new round of victories. The campaign had already planned Tuesday\u2019s protests before the election, but leaders say the imperative for sowing chaos became all the more urgent after Mr. Trump\u2019s victory.For example, the idea of workers striking at airports, as opposed to just protesting there, came about after the election.In Chicago, hundreds of demonstrators representing labor unions, churches and community groups converged at O\u2019Hare. Stretched along the walkway between Terminals 2 and 3, the protesters chanted, sang, beat drums and blasted trumpets.In Los Angeles, several thousand workers turned up to protest around noon on a major airport access street, including Ashley Adams, 25, who had been arrested earlier at a rally outside McDonald\u2019s on accusations of stopping traffic and disturbing the peace. \u201cWe really need to fight for this,\u201d said Ms. Adams, who takes orders at a pizza restaurant and makes a bit more than $8 an hour. \u201cI want to see my baby grow up being able to afford basic things and survive.\u201dThere is no question that the incoming Trump administration presents obstacles to the Fight for $15 movement. In recent years, the Service Workers and other unions helped change labor law doctrine as it relates to employers like contractors or franchisees that have a relationship with larger, more profitable companies.Under Mr. Trump and his future appointees to the labor board, this so-called joint employer doctrine is almost certain to be undone, making organizing fast-food workers through traditional means nearly impossible.In other ways, however, the Fight for $15 movement is very much built for the Trump era, having never relied excessively on the Washington power structure to sustain itself.Many of the movement\u2019s successes came in cities and states, where its pressure helped enact new minimum wage laws, and with individual employers whom the movement helped persuade to lift wages voluntarily.\u201cIf a messiah was going to save us, that person is in the White House right now,\u201d Mr. Courtney said. \u201cBy himself or herself, no president can make this happen.\u201dJanice Fine, an associate professor of labor studies at Rutgers University, said one possible animating principle for the organizations that emerge from the Fight for $15 could be enforcement of minimum wage laws, and other laws affecting paid leave and scheduling, once they are enacted.None of these innovations \u2014 whether the uniquely public form of bargaining or the creation of worker organizations focused on enforcement \u2014 require the assent of officials in Washington or the blessing of federal labor law.Not all of the recent gains for workers are the doing of the Fight for $15 and other advocacy efforts, of course. Some of the changes, particularly in the private sector, simply reflect employers\u2019 need to raise wages to fill jobs in a tightening labor market.Critics argue that while the Fight for $15 has engineered significant wage increases for many workers, the movement will be harder pressed to notch victories in the future.\u201cThey used low-hanging fruit to create a sense of momentum, but it was always limited\u201d to certain states and jurisdictions, said Michael Saltsman of the business-backed Employment Policies Institute.Mr. Saltsman said he expected a backlash to the recent minimum wage increases as \u201cthe bill starts to come due for the policies over the next year,\u201d by which he meant the possibility of layoffs and the outright failure of businesses as wage increases take effect.Other critics have pointed out that whatever the gains for workers, the tens of millions of dollars the Service Employees have poured into the campaign has netted the union little in the way of new members (although existing members have been beneficiaries of the recent wage increases).But Ruth Milkman, a sociologist who studies labor at The Graduate Center of the City University of New York, rejected that analysis. She said unions simply had a different calculus than corporations, which are more focused on the bottom line, and called the Fight for $15 campaign \u201cthe single most important initiative on the labor front in the last few years.\u201dReferring to the tens of millions of dollars that the union spent on the recent presidential election, Ms. Milkman added, \u201cI suppose they could have given more to Hillary Clinton, but that might have been a worse investment.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the given name of a wheelchair assistant who protested on Tuesday at O\u2019Hare Airport.

Putin dismissed Mr. Ulyukayev from the minister\u2019s job he had held since 2013, citing a \u201clack of trust.\u201dIt was a rare bribery case to reach behind the high red walls of the Kremlin \u2014 though relatively small in a country where corruption is rampant \u2014 and to an unusual degree parted the curtains on the extended, opaque battle within the ruling elite over the direction and control of the sickly Russian economy.Amid myriad questions about what actually happened, which may never be made public, one explanation emerged as the favorite.The Kremlin and its allies, struggling to right an economy waterlogged by two years of recession, are seeking a life raft, analysts said. Mr. Ulyukayev\u2019s mistake was to question their methods publicly.In this line of thinking, Mr. Ulyukayev was being punished for initially trying to block Rosneft from expanding its reach by purchasing Bashneft, and for generally restraining its growth. On a larger scale, the arrest served as a warning from the increasingly dominant security services that no one should challenge them.\u201cI think the purpose of the whole thing was to eliminate resistance,\u201d said Vladimir S. Milov, an opposition politician and former deputy minister of energy who now leads a think tank. \u201cThe message is, \u2018Don\u2019t stand in my way.\u2019 A clear message for all future deals.\u201dThe basic scenario goes something like this:As the head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, a former K.G.B. agent and Putin confidant, is sitting on about $15 billion in cash. With the state\u2019s two main reserve funds dwindling, the Russian government covets that cash.Mr. Sechin\u2019s purchase of state assets transfers that money directly into the Russian treasury. It also increases his power, though there was a small wrinkle in the form of a law suggesting, except in extreme instances, that state assets should be sold into private hands. A private company, Lukoil, also expressed interest at a lower price.As minister of economic development, Mr. Ulyukayev had to sign off on the sale of any state assets. So Bashneft was a major test case.Mr. Sechin wanted it for Rosneft, despite the law and the widespread, negative public perception that the elite was once again, as it did in the 1990s, abusing privatization laws to seize commodity resources at bargain prices.Mr. Ulyukayev tried to postpone the deal, but Mr. Putin backed the sale after initially hesitating. In October, it was announced that Rosneft would acquire a little more than half of Bashneft for more than $5 billion.Mr. Sechin is known for a take no prisoners attitude toward anyone who challenges him, so the bribery charges against Mr. Ulyukayev were interpreted as revenge.For Mr. Putin, the nation\u2019s special reserve funds have served as Russia\u2019s main, tangible economic cushion.\u201cThe reserve funds have been something sacred. Putin always refers to them when he talks about economic difficulties,\u201d Mr. Milov said. \u201cThey have been used as a strong, public indicator that the state still has capabilities.\u201dBut they are shrinking fast with no economic revival in sight. Two sovereign funds, the Reserve Fund and the National Wealth Fund, are now down to less than $104 billion, compared with a combined $160 billion at the beginning of 2015, according to the Finance Ministry\u2019s website.The financial reserves are expected to run out by the end of 2017, just as Mr. Putin faces a campaign for a fourth term in the spring of 2018.The Rosneft stash would help tide over the country for a longer period while the Kremlin ties its hopes to a rebound in the price of oil and the possible lifting of Western sanctions imposed over Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and the Ukraine crisis. Prospects for the latter brightened with President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s criticism of the American policy of isolating Russia.For now, the Russian economy hovers around zero growth, and consumers still struggle with inflation caused by a sharp drop in the ruble, along with food restrictions imposed in response to the Western sanctions.With minimal outside investment, Russia\u2019s economic fate is increasingly in the hands of the state. New statistics from the federal antimonopoly service show that the government controls about 70 percent of the economy, compared with 35 percent in 2005.Olga V. Kryshtanovskaya, a leading sociologist who studies the Russian elite, said the Ulyukayev case cast a shadow over the entire government. \u201cPeople resent the fact that they had to give up French cheese in order to support the president\u2019s policies and such corruption cases still erupt,\u201d she said in an interview.On Tuesday, the Kremlin cranked its information machinery into high gear to paint the arrest as part of a continuing anticorruption crusade that has included the arrest of three governors in the last two years.A report called \u201cFight Against Corruption\u201d was the top one for much of the day on the main state-run television news network. A caravan of politicians appeared on screen to praise the arrest as evidence that nobody was above the law.Mr. Ulyukayev was charged with extorting a large-scale bribe, Svetlana Petrenko, a spokeswoman for Russia\u2019s Investigative Committee, said on state television. Mr. Ulyukayev threatened to use his official standing to create future problems for Rosneft, she said, and was detained on Monday while accepting $2 million.Russian security services had monitored Mr. Ulyukayev\u2019s telephone calls for a year, and Rosneft had put the $2 million in a safe deposit box, according to various news reports, but the accused had not touched it.Timofei Gridnev, identified by Business FM radio as Mr. Ulyukayev\u2019s lawyer, said the minister denied all the charges, calling them a \u201cprovocation\u201d by Rosneft against a government official.Mr. Ulyukayev was put under house arrest for two months.Another school of thought, though not as widespread as the revenge story, holds that the bribery scandal was meant to hurt Rosneft, to show that it was a source of corruption and so to weaken Mr. Sechin.Evidence for that was harder to find, however, especially because various politicians had demanded Mr. Ulyukayev\u2019s head. Gennadi A. Zyuganov, the leader of the Communist Party, suggested that Mr. Ulyukayev was happy to enrich himself while denying the funds needed for a children\u2019s cancer hospital in Moscow.Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, told Russian reporters, \u201cThis is a very serious accusation which calls for very serious evidence.\u201d He said a court would make the ultimate determination about Mr. Ulyukayev\u2019s guilt or innocence.There was some mocking criticism of the charges from business leaders and others.Apparently referring to Mr. Sechin\u2019s reputation, Alexander N. Shokhin, the president of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, told the website Gazeta.ru that anyone who tried to shake down Rosneft for money should be the subject of a psychiatric investigation rather than a police investigation.\u201cIf Alexei Ulyukayev had been accused of running over an old lady while driving a Gelandewagen at high speed through Moscow late at night, even that would look more probable,\u201d Mr. Shokhin said.Ilya Shumanov of Transparency International, which fights corruption, told RBC Daily, a financial newspaper, that a $2 million bribe was a paltry, unrealistic sum in Russia\u2019s moneyed oil industry, suggesting that was the kind of sum a deputy mayor might solicit.A recent shake-up among Mr. Putin\u2019s advisers prompted some analysts to suggest that Mr. Ulyukayev\u2019s arrest was part of a trend of replacing seasoned veterans with a younger generation less likely to question the president\u2019s decisions.Many analysts, however, considered the arrest part of a different trend: the increasing power of the siloviki, or members of the security services, over the whole government.Oleg Feoktistov, the head of security at Rosneft and identified in news reports as the main executive behind Mr. Ulyukayev\u2019s arrest, used to run internal security and corruption cases in the federal security service, or F.S.B.\u201cIn the past six to eight months, these repressions have become more widespread,\u201d said Kirill Rogov, an independent political analyst. \u201cThis is directly linked to the new people occupying new posts in the F.S.B., who want to expand their turf.\u201dIvan Nechepurenko and Sophia Kishkovsky contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Loving\u2019 Aims to Speak Softly to History", "Date": "2016-11-08", "News": "Supported byIf history is written by the victors, it is typically filmed by the feel-good crowd pleasers. Whether Hollywood histories chronicle the exploits of brave gladiators, courageous soldiers or noble civilians, they almost always exalt the past in a similar cinematic register, with soaring speeches, swelling strings, sweeping montages, thrilling fights and breathless romances.The Lovings\u2019 case remade American history, yet Mr. Nichols described the emotional peak of the film as, \u201ca man coming home and crying on the edge of the bed because he can\u2019t take care of his wife.\u201d He spoke in his Arkansas drawl over lunch at a downtown Manhattan restaurant: \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m giving people as a climax? But it\u2019s so true and that\u2019s what\u2019s so crushing. That guy was good at one thing: going out and building a brick wall. That should have been enough.\u201d\u201cImmediately I saw that end scene, which may or may not represent reality: Richard playing with his kids on the lawn and not saying anything,\u201d Mr. Nichols said. He was aware enough of the danger of such a contrarian choice that he called his producers at Big Beach to warn them, or at least temper their expectations.\u201cI remember saying, \u2018I don\u2019t think this is going to be \u2018The Help,\u2019 though \u2018The Help\u2019 made a lot of money and got nominated for a lot of Oscars,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess I must have known we were taking a risk in its execution but I never thought there was another way.\u201dHowever, when Mr. Nichols was looking for financing, he met one investor who was not so confident. \u201cHe\u2019d shown the script to his bigwig boss who said, \u2018I just don\u2019t get it. It\u2019s like a courtroom drama without the courtroom,\u2019\u201d he said.When this financier asked Mr. Nichols if he could \u201cpunch it up,\u201d Mr. Nichols said he launched into the sort of rebellious speech that is absent in his film. \u201cWhat you need to worry about right now is not whether I\u2019m going to punch up this script so you can be involved,\u201d he recalled saying. \u201cWhat you need to be worried about is how I will ever come back to work with you guys ever again because that is the most simplistic, stupid response I\u2019ve heard.\u201dPeter Saraf, a Big Beach producer on the film, said that the production company knew what it was getting into. \u201cJeff\u2019s idea was to tell the story from Richard and Mildred\u2019s point of view and stick to it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t commit to that and then say oh, but we need the big courtroom moment with the gavel falling.\u201d\u201cEvery year in Hollywood, true stories get made and we feel the need to renovate them, and suit them up,\u201d Mr. Edgerton said, then continued: \u201cThat\u2019s legitimate sometimes. But to make Richard more articulate or defiant or to place him in that courtroom would have negated the idea of trying to tell a true story truthfully.\u201dOr as Ms. Negga put it, when discussing her character on the phone, \u201cIt would have been really unfaithful and quite grotesque to have made her any different.\u201d\u201cIf Mildred were alive now, I don\u2019t think she\u2019d want to do any junkets, any of this nonsense, any of this hoopla,\u201d said Ms. Negga, on a day in which she joked that she had done 782 interviews. \u201cAnd there\u2019s not much that would have terrified Richard more.\u201dThen he relented.\u201cThis film doesn\u2019t speak with the histrionics of other potential award contenders, but it does fit into the frame of the award season and that\u2019s still how they\u2019re going to cut the trailer,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sleight-of-hand is just to get people into the theater. I get it. My hope is that people will go see the movie maybe expecting one thing but maybe pleased it\u2019s something else.\u201dMr. Nichols, polishing off his steak and fries along with his fifth of the day\u2019s seven interviews, said that in the thundering horse race of the Oscar season: \u201c\u2018Loving\u2019 is not even a horse.

I like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201dMs. Kirkpatrick, 66, embraced the positions pushed by Hillary Clinton, banking on support from Latino voters, moderate independent voters and disaffected middle-of-the-road Republicans to propel her to victory.Mr. McCain was buoyed by a deep campaign war chest and by help from the Republican establishment. Last week, Mitt Romney, the party\u2019s nominee in 2012, stumped for him in Arizona.The senator, a Cuban-American conservative, fended off a forceful challenge by Representative Patrick Murphy, 33, a Democrat who consistently portrayed Mr. Rubio as an absentee lawmaker with misplaced allegiances \u2014 first to the presidency instead of to his job, and then to Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee.In an election pitting two young, ambitious strivers, Mr. Rubio, a Republican who had vowed not to seek re-election to the Senate, has been by far the better-known, better-financed candidate. Before his presidential race and Senate race six years ago, Mr. Rubio began his career in the Florida Statehouse, where he became speaker of the House. But the race proved surprisingly tight as Mr. Rubio, 45, struggled to characterize his support for Donald J. Trump, his onetime opponent in the presidential primary contests. Mr. Trump bested Mr. Rubio in the Florida primary and ridiculed him as \u201cLittle Marco.\u201d Even as Mr. Rubio endorsed Mr. Trump, who is highly unpopular among Hispanics, a crucial constituency for the senator, he mostly avoided mentioning him on the stump.A moderate South Florida congressman, Mr. Murphy, 33, was depicted by Mr. Rubio as overprivileged and overly reliant on his father\u2019s considerable fortune and connections. Mr. Murphy, one of the youngest candidates to run in a high-profile Senate race, was in turn accused of inflating his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and accomplishing little in Congress during his two terms.Mr. Kirk, a centrist Republican with bipartisan alliances, has long walked a delicate line in a state that tends to vote for Democrats, especially in presidential election years. It is a model that has seen success in Illinois in decades past but that has grown increasingly tangled in this battering election year. Some of Mr. Kirk\u2019s stances have appealed to Democrats and independents (he has supported gay rights, for instance), but he has risked annoying his Republican base along the way. (He said he would support Donald J. Trump if he were the party\u2019s presidential nominee, then backed away from him.)\u201cEvan Bayh had his chance, but he put money ahead of us,\u201d Mr. Young, 44, a former Marine, said in one advertisement.Missouri was not expected to be one of the prime battlegrounds in the battle for control of the Senate. But Mr. Blunt, 66, has had to fend off accusations that he is the very type of Washington insider that his party\u2019s presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump, built his campaign against. And although Missouri has been a reliably red state in recent years, Mr. Blunt\u2019s support of Mr. Trump also turned off some of the moderate voters who have traditionally backed him.Ms. Cortez Masto, 52, a former Nevada attorney general and the granddaughter of a Mexican immigrant, focused her campaign on immigration reform and future Supreme Court picks before the Senate. She capitalized on the extensive ground operation built by Hillary Clinton, and energized Latinos by railing against Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to build a border wall, while trying to pin Mr. Trump\u2019s most controversial views on her opponent.Mr. Heck, 55, a physician and Iraq war veteran, tried to stress a record of across-the-aisle compromise. But he was tripped up by Mr. Trump\u2019s statements on immigration, veterans and women, observers said.Mr. Heck started off critical of Mr. Trump during the primary contests, then threw his support behind him after his nomination, only to call in October for Mr. Trump to step down.\u201cHe was doing a good job trying to thread the middle and not alienate the base until the whole Donald Trump thing,\u201d said David Damore, a professor of political science at the University of Nevada. \u201cThen it was like he couldn\u2019t say anything right.\u201dThe main challenge for both was to keep their bases happy while appealing to the state\u2019s large number of independents. This forced both candidates to emphasize bipartisanship and to try to keep politics out of major issues, like the state\u2019s crushing opioid epidemic.Ms. Ayotte, 48, a former prosecutor, has been a rising star in Washington, where she allied herself with conservative causes, like defunding Planned Parenthood and opposing a confirmation vote on a Supreme Court nominee.Ms. Hassan, 58, a former State Senate majority leader who helped pass same-sex marriage, allied herself with the Democrats\u2019 biggest stars, including President and Michelle Obama, as they flooded the state for Hillary Clinton.Ms. Ross, 53, a lawyer who served from 2003 to 2013 in the State House of Representatives, blasted Mr. Burr, 60, early in the race as a self-dealing politician who exemplified a dysfunctional Washington. She also criticized him for continuing to support the Republican presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump, after Mr. Trump\u2019s vulgar comments about women, and for being named to Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cnational security advisory council.\u201dLate in the campaign, Ms. Ross called attention to an Oct. 29 recording of Mr. Burr in which he said he was \u201ca little bit shocked\u201d that a National Rifle Association magazine with a picture of Hillary Clinton on it did not have a bull\u2019s-eye over the candidate. On the tape, Mr. Burr also vowed that if Mrs. Clinton were elected, he would work to keep her from filling the vacancy on the Supreme Court.Mr. Burr, known for wearing shoes without socks in the Senate, worried some Republican leaders with his decidedly mellow attitude toward campaigning. But both sides viewed Ms. Ross as vulnerable because of her A.C.L.U. background, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee blanketed the airwaves with ads claiming that Ms. Ross opposed a state sex offender registry, an allegation Ms. Ross strongly rebutted.Times reporters provided real-time analysis of Donald J. Trump\u2019s stunning upset in the presidential election on Tuesday.Mr. Toomey\u2019s victory in this battleground state was a relief to Republicans who had feared he might become a casualty of the Trump campaign.Ms. McGinty, 53, a former aide to Gov.

{"Headline": "San Diego Voters Reject Funding of New Chargers Stadium", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byAfter years of posturing and threats, the Chargers could be on the move.The Chargers must decide whether to pay for the stadium themselves, look for an alternative site elsewhere in the city for a stadium, or move to Los Angeles, where they have an option to move into a stadium being built by Stanley E. Kroenke, the owner of the Rams.The Chargers, who have several years left on their lease at Qualcomm Stadium, have until the second week of January to exercise that last option. If the team\u2019s owner, Dean A. Spanos, decides not to move the Chargers to Los Angeles, the Oakland Raiders will then be given the option to join hands with Kroenke.The Rams had no comment on the result of the vote in San Diego.The Chargers have spent years trying to get the public to share the cost of a new stadium to replace Qualcomm Stadium, opened in 1967 and one of the oldest buildings in the N.F.L. Last year, the team rejected a plan championed by the mayor and a committee that included building a new stadium on the property where Qualcomm Stadium sits in the Mission Valley neighborhood.Instead, the Chargers focused on moving to Carson, Calif., south of Los Angeles, and building a privately funded stadium with the Raiders. In January, the N.F.L. owners voted instead to let the Rams move to Los Angeles, and gave the Chargers the option to join them.The Chargers then came up with a proposal to build a downtown stadium on a tight plot near the city\u2019s convention center. The team wanted voters to raise the county\u2019s hotel bed tax, which it portrayed as a levy on tourists.Many of the city\u2019s hoteliers opposed the increase because they said it would drive up room rates, making San Diego a less affordable city to visit.Although the mayor eventually backed the team\u2019s proposal, the Chargers did not enlist local power brokers or their star players and ex-players, said Jim Lackritz, co-founder of the San Diego State University Sports Business M.B.A. program.Some fans also opposed the project because the new stadium would have had limited parking and room for tailgating. Fans also remember how the team threatened to leave San Diego a year ago.\u201cPeople have long memories, and many people want no public money to be given to the Chargers for a stadium, even though the public money would be coming predominantly from out-of-town people paying the hotel tax,\u201d Lackritz wrote in an email. \u201cMany felt that the Chargers have tried to hold the city and taxpayers hostage to get the new stadium. Many are convinced the Chargers will never leave for L.A.\u201dGetting voters anywhere to approve tax increases is a challenge, but the Chargers faced a greater one because in California the threshold for approval of such increases is a supermajority of two-thirds of the vote. The Chargers contended that only a simple majority was needed, but a lower court judge rejected that interpretation.Commissioner Roger Goodell has said that the league prefers that teams remain in their markets, and some owners said they hoped the Chargers would stay in San Diego, where they have played for more than a half-century.While the Chargers decide what to do, the N.F.L. may have to consider the fate of the Raiders, who may apply to move to Las Vegas. Lawmakers in Nevada last month agreed to increase a hotel bed tax in Clark County to raise $750 million for a stadium the team and the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson want to build.Things went better on Tuesday for the Texas Rangers\u2019 stadium project. Voters in Arlington, Tex., approved, by 60 percent to 40 percent, a proposal providing up to $500 million in public financing for a new stadium with a retractable roof.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Marijuana Company Prepares to Cross State Lines, as Legally as Possible", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "EntrepreneurshipDixie Brands wants to navigate complex laws in multiple states to sell its marijuana-infused drinks and edibles beyond Colorado.Supported byAlmost all small-business owners dream of the day when they can expand nationally. This has proved to be a unique challenge for those in the marijuana industry because the products they create are illegal under federal law, and the checkerboard of states that permit marijuana sales have complex and constantly changing regulations.The legal cannabis industry is dominated by small businesses operating in individual states, so these new laws could open significant prospects for entrepreneurs. And for the companies that can figure out how to operate in multiple states, the opportunity is tremendous.Chuck Smith and Tripp Keber, who founded Dixie Brands seven years ago, have been taking steps to be at the forefront of the growing market.The company makes Dixie Elixirs, bottled beverages infused with THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. It also makes THC-infused chocolates, drops and topical lotions. All are sold at licensed recreational pot shops and medical marijuana dispensaries. Low-dose \u201cawakening\u201d and \u201crelaxing\u201d mints containing five milligrams of THC (half a serving) are among the company\u2019s top sellers. Most of the company\u2019s revenue comes from Colorado.Because of federal laws on controlled substances, one challenge to expansion is that products cannot cross state lines, so a pot brownie baked in Oregon, for example, cannot be sold in neighboring Washington, even though the product is legal in both places.Add the complications of financing as well as unique packaging, distribution and marketing laws for each state, and establishing a national brand seems daunting and expensive. Some states require marijuana businesses to be owned by in-state residents, further impeding multistate expansion.Also, because the industry is in its infancy, rules are changing constantly, including regulations governing packaging, food production and agriculture management. When Colorado recently required all marijuana food products to be stamped with a THC symbol, Dixie Brands had to create all new molds for its chocolates and discontinue their Dixie Roll product, which is similar to Tootsie Rolls, because it could not be stamped efficiently. The new rule requires a THC stamp on all packaging as well.\u201cThese changes are costly for small businesses,\u201d said Joe Hodas, chief marketing officer for the company.In addition, because of federal laws, marijuana companies cannot open bank accounts, cannot use credit cards and cannot deduct business expenses from their federal taxes. Giant safes full of cash and pickups by armored cars are the norm.Many companies in the marijuana industry had been started by product aficionados with little business experience. As legalization spreads, the industry is quickly drawing more business professionals, as evidenced by Mr. Smith and Mr. Keber, who began their endeavor with experience in corporate finance, marketing and management.When recreational marijuana joined medical marijuana as a legal market in Colorado in 2014, they were poised to expand Dixie Brands by adding to their line of products. Since that time, the number of employees has expanded from 20 to 100 and sales have increased about sixfold.Expanding beyond Colorado, however, has taken creativity. Two years ago, in their first move outside of the state, the pair found a licensing partner to produce Dixie products in California. After a year, the founders decided to take a more hands-on approach.\u201cOur partner wanted to manufacture other companies\u2019 products as well as ours, and we wanted more focus on absolute quality and consistency,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cTo have total legal, financial and operational control, we decided we would need to control the manufacturing and distribution facilities in any state we expanded to.\u201dTo make this happen, Mr. Smith had to find a way to work within regulations that require owners of marijuana businesses to be residents of the state. He decided that Dixie Brands would own and run anything that did not \u201ctouch the plant\u201d and therefore was not subject to local ownership regulations. A local partner would grow and process the marijuana, but only for Dixie Brands, and only under the company\u2019s strict instructions.Consistent product quality is critical, Mr. Smith said. \u201cCoca-Cola in Denver and Seattle taste exactly the same, and we want Dixie Elixirs and our other products to have that reputation.\u201dEach new manufacturing site will cost about $2 million, according to Mr. Smith. The Dixie holding company will own and control a building that they will rent to the partner as well as the equipment that will be leased to them. All of the noncannabis raw materials and packaging, and the accounting, marketing and legal services, will be provided by Dixie Brands.The state-based partner will own the marijuana itself and employ the personnel who work with the marijuana in any form: plants, concentrates, finished products and the like. This will allow Dixie to control the business while maintaining a clear separation from the federally illegal aspect of it. That separation also protects their investors and gives the company flexibility to react to changing state and federal regulations.To finance the expansion, Mr. Smith says he has tapped a handful of investors from among the 30 who have funded his efforts over the last seven years. Those sources helped to open manufacturing facilities in Arizona and Nevada last month, and one is scheduled to open early next year in Washington State.For efficiency as it enters new locations, Dixie Brands follows the most stringent state\u2019s laws in each area of its operations. For example, Colorado has the strictest packaging requirements encompassing child-safety measures, clear dosing and single-serving packaging. The state also bans cartoon or other child-friendly images, and has many other regulations.Dixie Brands uses those packaging rules for the products they make in every state. \u201cIf it is safe enough for Colorado, it will work for the other states,\u201d Mr. Smith said.The company also uses the cleaner carbon dioxide extraction method to strip the oils from the plants instead of butane, even though it is not required everywhere.Colorado also requires multiple rounds of product testing in the manufacturing process, including testing of the raw plants, the extracted oil, batches of products and individual packages.

{"Headline": "With Philip Hammond\u2019s Plan, U.K. Shelves Austerity", "Date": "2016-11-23", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 After years of tough spending curbs, Britain\u2019s government on Wednesday cast aside the language of austerity as it acknowledged the high economic cost of withdrawal from the European Union, and tried to placate struggling working-class families whose incomes have stagnated.A pledge by the previous chancellor of the Exchequer, or finance minister, George Osborne, to balance the budget by 2020 has been shelved. The current chancellor, Philip Hammond, is replacing it with a vaguer ambition to do so as soon as practical after 2020.Help for workers whose low earnings are supplemented by welfare payments, an increase in the minimum wage and new infrastructure spending were features of the first Autumn Statement, or spending plan, from Mr. Hammond, who became chancellor in July.Mr. Hammond laid out plans to finance construction of 40,000 new affordable homes and to provide more help with child care, though there was also a less welcome increase in the tax on insurance premiums.And there is a bigger catch. For the JAMs, as for others, the specter of Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union hovers over the economy. The uncertainties complicate life for Mr. Hammond and threaten to hit living standards just as they were beginning to improve for some.While Brexit has not had the immediate negative effects some economists predicted, Mr. Hammond announced lower growth projections and higher borrowing estimates and inflation forecasts.\u201cOur task now is to prepare our economy to be resilient as we exit the E.U.,\u201d Mr. Hammond told lawmakers.One of the cabinet\u2019s steadiest, and most sober, performers, Mr. Hammond is nicknamed Spreadsheet Phil because of his reputation for approaching politics more as an accountant than a visionary.He was moved from his post as foreign secretary to become chancellor shortly after the June referendum. He, like Mrs. May, had argued against Britain\u2019s withdrawal.That has made him a target of ideological opponents on the right of the governing Conservative Party, who want to speed British withdrawal, fearing that their goal of a swift, clean break with the European Union will be betrayed.Despite the positive economic signs so far, forecasts from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility underscored the high price Britain is likely to pay for Brexit over the next five years.During that time, potential growth will be 2.4 percentage points lower than would have been the case, Mr. Hammond said. Over the five-year forecasting period, around $75 billion of a total of $150 billion in additional borrowing can be attributed to Brexit.Driven by the steep fall in the value of the pound, inflation is coming back. \u201cWe expect the pound\u2019s fall to add almost 2 percent to the level of consumer prices over the next two years,\u201d said the Office for Budget Responsibility, adding that \u201creal earnings growth will consequently fall close to zero next year.\u201dBritain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.It added that, over all, \u201cthe government has opted neither for a large near-term fiscal stimulus nor for more austerity over the medium term.\u201dBritish businesses have been jittery since the referendum, and there was alarm at Mrs. May\u2019s suggestions in October that she prioritized regaining control of immigration policy over maintaining unfettered access to the bloc\u2019s single market. So Mrs. May\u2019s comments suggested to many that she was aligning herself with those in favor of a clean break.Britain faces some longstanding economic difficulties. According to a research note from three economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, those include \u201cwoeful productivity performance, the already probably undeliverable austerity that is planned in day-to-day government spending and the large long-term deterioration in the finances that will result if the government delivers on its plan to reduce migration to the tens of thousands.\u201dOver all, they added, \u201cBrexit means, eventually, higher taxes, lower government spending or permanently higher borrowing.\u201dWhile much of Mr. Hammond\u2019s address had been telegraphed in previous days, he did throw one curveball: His first Autumn Statement, he said, would also be his last.Starting next year, he will move Britain\u2019s annual budget statement from the spring to the autumn, so that taxation changes can be announced well before the start of the tax year, in April. There will be an annual spring statement responding to economic forecasts, but no regular fiscal event, he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tense Senate Tussle in New Hampshire Illustrates Murky Finish Line", "Date": "2016-11-05", "News": "Supported byROCHESTER, N.H. \u2014 Maggie Hassan, the Democratic governor of New Hampshire now running for the Senate, squeezed by an older woman grimly examining some potatoes at a grocery store here last week. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll consider me,\u201d Ms. Hassan said. The woman, still glowering, grumbled, \u201cI might.\u201dIn half a dozen states, similar sentiments prevail. Democrats, who just two weeks ago expressed confidence they would retake control of the Senate, are now far less certain, and their fates may well be tied to the rancorous presidential race and the downbeat attitude of voters that contest has created.Many thought Hillary Clinton\u2019s once-clear lead in New Hampshire would all but ensure a victory for Ms. Hassan over the Senate Republican incumbent, Kelly Ayotte, who won her seat in a 2010 Tea Party-infused election.But this Eastern cornerstone for Democrats appears to be cracking; Mrs. Clinton plans to make a hastily scheduled dash to Manchester on Sunday. Ms. Hassan and Ms. Ayotte, both well known to voters here, are on a desperate hunt for every last vote in the state\u2019s grocery stores, taverns, Rotary clubs, Burger King drive-throughs and even town dumps, in one of the nation\u2019s tightest and most expensive Senate races.Democrats\u2019 hopes had risen largely because of Donald J. Trump\u2019s weakness in some states and an overall disorganized Republican effort to rally potential voters. Now, at least four races \u2014 in New Hampshire, North Carolina, Indiana and Missouri \u2014 are considered dead heats, and Democratic prospects are only slightly better in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Nevada.An even split or a bare minimum majority for either party in the next Congress, one with an aggressive policy agenda, no matter who sits in the White House, seems increasingly possible.Democrats will need four more seats if Mrs. Clinton is elected, or five if Mr. Trump prevails, to regain control of the Senate.In the House, Republicans are bracing for a loss of possibly a dozen seats, but will almost certainly remain in control, albeit with a majority in which a conservative faction could continue to roil the party.Unlike many other races around the country, the fight for the Senate seat in New Hampshire features two women whom voters know well in a state where most elected officials seem familiar with at least half the people they run into. Ms. Ayotte was the state\u2019s attorney general before she was elected to the Senate, and Ms. Hassan is a product of the Democratic mentoring system under Senator Jeanne Shaheen, another former governor.Ms. Ayotte runs a five-kilometer race almost every Saturday in towns around the state, and favors truck stops and town dumps to meet voters. She will campaign for 24 straight hours beginning Monday morning. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fun,\u201d she said, perhaps redefining notions of enjoyment.The New Hampshire race has been staggeringly expensive, with over $100 million spent on behalf of the two candidates, the majority of which has supported an all-out assault of television advertising. \u201cI should be embarrassed to have either of you as my senator,\u201d Larry Gray, a doctor in Portsmouth, groused during a Rotary Club meeting where Ms. Hassan spoke.Only the Senate race in Pennsylvania, which has nearly 10 times the population of New Hampshire, has attracted more outside money. Outside spending on Senate races nationally has passed half a billion dollars this cycle, a record.\u201cThe Republicans are not helping themselves down ballot,\u201d said Andrew E. Smith, a political scientist and pollster at the University of New Hampshire. \u201cWhen you have a party that is not unified, it makes it difficult for them to win, especially when they are not the majority party.\u201dMs. Hassan hopes to be aided by an elaborate turnout operation conducted by the Clinton campaign. But Ms. Ayotte is unlikely to get any corollary benefit from Mr. Trump, who Republicans complain has a limited get-out-the-vote operation.Still, Ms. Ayotte is clearly competitive in a race where both sides believe they have a slight advantage, with scant real-time proof either way. \u201cBoth candidates are both under 50 percent,\u201d said Rich Killion, a Republican strategist here. \u201cBut the weight of the stuff that has been thrown on Ayotte has not had the marginal effect Democrats want to open up the gap.\u201dFew know where the election is heading, even as so many are deeply invested in the outcome.\u201cI have two bumper stickers on my car,\u201d Mr. Cullen said, one for Ayotte and one for Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, a former Republican candidate for president, \u201cwhich is another way of saying, \u2018Don\u2019t blame me.\u2019\u201dMr. Cullen added, \u201cI feel like I have never had an election in which I have had less confidence to say how it\u2019s going to turn out.\u201dRachel Shorey contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

The labor minister, Giorgos Katrougalos, who has been criticized for the slow pace of efforts to streamline Greece\u2019s bloated pension system, was replaced by a young aide.One of Mr. Tsipras\u2019s key aides, Dimitris Liakos, was moved from his job running the prime minister\u2019s economic office to oversee the enforcement of Greece\u2019s bailout program.The new cabinet is to be sworn in Saturday.

{"Headline": "As Auto Lending Rises, So Do Delinquencies", "Date": "2016-11-30", "News": "Supported byRegulators are airing \u201csignificant concern\u201d about the millions of Americans who are falling behind on their car loans, even as auto lending continues to boom at a near record pace.On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York noted increasing distress among auto borrowers with shaky credit, as subprime delinquencies rose in the third quarter.In the third quarter, 2 percent of subprime auto loan balances became at least 90 days delinquent, up from 1.6 percent in the third quarter of 2014.In the depths of the recession, in the second quarter of 2009, that rate peaked at 2.4 percent.The report is the most strident warning yet from the New York Fed about stresses in subprime auto lending. The New York Fed analyzes trends in borrowing by American households each quarter.The swelling delinquencies come at a time when unemployment is low and borrowers typically should be able to make their payments.That such serious trouble is emerging in a relatively good economy suggests that lenders have been loosening their standards and letting borrowers take on more debt than they can afford.Violette Morin, of Pulaski, N.Y., a 74-year-old grandmother, said she did not need or particularly want to buy a car. But after receiving a mailing from a local dealership promising a prize of a pearl necklace and a fishing rod, she visited the used car lot in May 2015.The dealer qualified her for a $20,350 loan, according to her lawyer, to purchase a 2011 Ford Fusion. Earlier this year, she stopped making the payments. \u201cI eventually had them come and get the car because I couldn\u2019t pay for it,\u201d said Ms. Morin, who lives on Social Security, receives food stamps and lives in subsidized housing.Economists fear that if the economy dips into another recession, the already large number of Americans on the verge of losing their cars to repossession \u2014 about six million \u2014 will swell to record levels.Although the subprime delinquency rate may be lower today than it was in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis, economists are concerned about the sheer number of Americans who are behind on their car payments because so many more have subprime auto loans than in 2009.But industry experts have dismissed comparisons between subprime auto loans and the mortgage bubble that led to the global financial crisis. Back in 2008, trillions of dollars of investments were correlated to the American housing market. The auto loan market is huge \u2014 with $1.1 trillion in outstanding loans \u2014 but defaults are not very likely to have the cascading effects on the banking system that home foreclosures did.If anything, the New York Fed report notes that delinquencies on auto loans originated by banks remained low, while many of the troubled loans were made by finance companies, which are not large enough to harm the broader financial system.Still, widespread repossessions could deliver a stinging hit to the economy, as Americans struggle to get to work or go about their daily lives in areas with limited public transportation.Nashua Moore, 28, gets up at 2 a.m., takes two buses, and reaches her office in Las Vegas by the time her shift as a medical dispatcher starts at 5 a.m. She schedules plenty of time to avoid being penalized for being late. By car, her commute takes about 20 minutes, she said.\u201cI was desperate to get a car,\u201d said Ms. Moore, who went back to work this spring after her daughter was born.She borrowed $6,580 at a 30 percent interest rate to purchase a 2008 Chevrolet Impala. Her car was repossessed this fall, after she got in a dispute with the dealership. She is now working with a legal aid lawyer to get her down payment back and other damages.\u201cI see this all the time,\u201d said her lawyer, Sophia Medina, of the Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada.Auto loans are one of the few types of lending that has not been curtailed after the financial crisis.Lenders have been willing to take more risks with auto lending based on a belief that Americans \u2014 even those who are struggling \u2014 will keep making car payments because they need their cars to keep their jobs and to keep their households functioning.As competition becomes fierce, banks, private equity firms and credit unions have been extending loan terms as long as seven years \u2014 longer than many used cars are on the road.Most of the growth in subprime lending has been driven not by traditional banks but by finance companies that specialize in making loans to borrowers on the financial margins. Subprime lending is more profitable because lenders charge interest rates as high as 30 percent and they often bundle the loans and sell them to investors \u2014 much as mortgages were securitized before the financial crisis.The New York Fed noted in the report that overall delinquencies among prime auto borrowers remained low, despite \u201cnotable deterioration in the performance of subprime auto loans.\u201dAnalysts at Fitch Ratings said that although losses on subprime loans were rising, they were within the firm\u2019s expectations.Annualized net loss on an index of subprime auto loans hit 9.6 percent in October, up from about 8 percent a year earlier, according to Fitch.\u201cSubprime auto performance could decline further if there are any stresses to the underlying economy,\u201d Kevin Duignan, Fitch\u2019s global head of structured finance, said in an interview.As auto lending has boomed, regulators and investigators have been looking into increased cases of fraud where dealers have misstated borrowers\u2019 income to qualify them for loans.Ms. Morin, the borrower from New York, said that when she asked for a copy of her loan application, she noticed that the document listed her monthly income as more than $3,300, which was false. She collects about $850 a month in Social Security.Ms. Morin worked with the consumer law clinic at the Syracuse University law school, which contacted the lender, a credit union, on her behalf. Ms. Morin\u2019s loan was forgiven and her default was scrubbed from her credit report.\u201cI wasn\u2019t car smart, I was just an average person,\u201d Ms. Morin said. \u201cI am car smart now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After High-Profile Shootings, Blacks Seek Prosecutor Seats", "Date": "2016-11-05", "News": "Supported byAfrican-American lawyers, racial justice groups and the liberal hedge fund billionaire George Soros are combining forces to try to elect more black prosecutors in response to what they see as an insufficient response by incumbent district attorneys to the killings of black people by the police.The effort faces steep demographic and institutional obstacles that have kept the offices of elected prosecutors \u2014 those deciding whether to seek criminal charges against the officers responsible \u2014 among the whitest reserves in American politics.But that number has begun to grow, with activists and lawyers recruiting black candidates while outside groups \u2014 largely financed by Mr. Soros, who is as revered on the left as he is reviled on the right \u2014 hire political consultants to produce slick campaign ads.Together, the candidates and their allies are often overwhelming white candidates \u2014 some of whom have complained that they were targeted merely because of their race.Since last year, the effort has produced two black district attorneys in rural Mississippi and one in Caddo Parish, La. \u2014 known as the nation\u2019s leading jurisdiction for death sentences. And on Tuesday, four black candidates are expected to cruise to election as the top local prosecutors in Chicago; St. Louis; Orlando, Fla.; and suburban Henry County, Ga.\u201cIn many ways, it is just as important as the governor\u2019s race or the presidential race,\u201d said Benjamin L. Crump, a Tallahassee, Fla., lawyer involved in the push, who has represented families of the victims in some of the most highly publicized killings of African-Americans in recent years, beginning with the shooting of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman in 2012.\u201cIt may have a more profound effect on your life than any national office will have, because this is going to determine whether your children get trumped-up charges and have the words \u2018felony conviction\u2019 on their backs for the rest of their lives,\u201d Mr. Crump said, \u201cor, even worse, if they are going to be killed in cold blood and broad daylight, and no one will be held accountable for it.\u201dAramis Ayala, who defeated a Democratic incumbent in the primary for Florida state attorney for Orange and Osceola counties, was a television analyst during the trial in which Mr. Zimmerman was acquitted. And Kim Foxx was advised by Mr. Crump in her successful primary challenge to Anita Alvarez, the incumbent state\u2019s attorney in Cook County, Ill., who was criticized for her handling of the 2014 fatal police shooting of Laquan McDonald, a black 17-year-old.Mr. Crump has also worked with the family of Michael Brown, whose fatal shooting by a white police officer in 2014 set off days of unrest in Ferguson, Mo. Mr. Crump said the white prosecutor\u2019s failure to obtain an indictment there led him to believe that black people were being \u201cstripped of their fundamental humanity,\u201d and to seek a new strategy to curb police violence: electing more black district attorneys.While cities elect mayors, elected prosecutors typically represent counties, often including majority-white suburbs, \u201cwhich may have different ideas about what makes sense for criminal justice and law enforcement and safety,\u201d Mr. Robinson said. District attorney posts also do not have natural steppingstones, the way novice politicians can gain experience running for alderman or a seat on the school board. And first-time candidates often must challenge entrenched incumbents who are also their bosses.Ms. Ayala, who is unopposed in November and is set to become the first black elected prosecutor in Florida history, started out as a prosecutor but became a public defender because she believed too many defendants were receiving inadequate counsel. She returned to the state attorney\u2019s office in 2014 out of frustration with the Zimmerman case. The defense had done everything it could to portray Mr. Martin as a thug, she said, adding that if the prosecution had included an African-American, it might have portrayed him as more sympathetic.She said she hoped to address strained relations between many black people and police. \u201cI want to work to fix that,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile they may not have the shootings, there are a lot of reports and allegations of excessive force.\u201dWhat clobbered the man Ms. Ayala unseated, Jeffrey L. Ashton, was $1.4 million from the Florida version of the Safety and Justice political action committees Mr. Soros has bankrolled in one state after another since last year.\u201cIt was like she had a megaphone and I was whispering,\u201d Mr. Ashton said ruefully in an interview. He argued that he and Ms. Ayala barely differed on policy, and bluntly called himself a victim of \u201cracism.\u201d\u201cThe only thing that differentiated my opponent and I was that I\u2019m a white male and she\u2019s a black female,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re basically saying, \u2018Well, I have a lot of money and I want a black face in this office, so here\u2019s $1.4 million.\u2019 I just think that\u2019s scary.\u201dSimilarly, more than $700,000 from Illinois Safety and Justice helped carry Ms. Foxx to a primary victory over Ms. Alvarez, a two-term incumbent who was denounced for her handling of the McDonald case, in which a video of the teenager being shot 16 times by police officers was not made public for more than a year.Ms. Foxx represented foster children as a young lawyer, but saw how prosecutors had the power to remove children from their homes, and decided to become one herself. \u201cAll of that discretion lies with the prosecutor,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we only have diversity in responding to that, it\u2019s too late.\u201dFar from promising to keep race out of their decision-making, the new black prosecutors and candidates \u2014 like Kimberly Gardner, who won a four-way primary for circuit attorney in St. Louis and is unopposed on Tuesday \u2014 are explicitly promising to address issues like disparate incarceration rates and police misconduct.And they are drawing on personal experience for lessons on how to be tough on crime without being needlessly harsh.Ms. Ayala, in Florida, said her husband had once been caught up in the juvenile justice system, and later served seven years in prison on drug charges. He now works for a nonprofit. \u201cYou have to distinguish between a child who is misguided and frustrated from home issues, and a child who is dangerous,\u201d she said.The thin ranks of black elected prosecutors do include some high-profile figures. Since the Ferguson protests, R. Seth Williams, the Philadelphia district attorney, has held informal talks with a small group of African-American peers on the best ways to respond to police killings. And it was Marilyn Mosby, the state\u2019s attorney for Baltimore, who led the investigation into the case of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man who died after riding unsecured in a police transport wagon.Six officers were charged with crimes; the first trial ended in a hung jury, and three officers were acquitted. Ms. Mosby dropped the remaining charges.But she is unapologetic. Had the case been handled differently, \u201cthere would have been no accountability,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cYou have to have a seat at the table, and you have to be the change you want to see.\u201dA small group of advocates are leading the charge. The National Bar Association has urged black line prosecutors to run for office; the National Black Prosecutors Association is offering to mentor candidates; and Mr. Soros, through Color of Change and his growing network of Safety and Justice PACs, has funneled nearly $5 million into the cause since last year.Outside Atlanta, Mr. Soros spent $147,000 helping a DeKalb County line prosecutor, Darius Pattillo, seek the district attorney\u2019s post in neighboring Henry County; his general-election opponent recently quit the race.Not all the campaigns have ended so well for Mr. Soros: Robert Shuler Smith, a black district attorney whom he helped win re-election in Hinds County, Miss., has since been indicted on charges of conspiring to aid a criminal defendant.And in Houston, Mr. Soros\u2019s first choice, Morris Overstreet \u2014 a former judge who was the first African-American elected to a statewide office in Texas since Reconstruction \u2014 was defeated in the Democratic primary by a white woman, Kim Ogg. Mr. Soros has now spent $500,000 to aid her against the Republican incumbent, Devon Anderson.Mr. Soros, who declined to be interviewed, has also supported Hispanics seeking prosecutors\u2019 posts in Arizona and New Mexico, a spokesman said.\u201cRace does not explicitly play a role, but in seeking candidates who understand the injustices of the current system, many of them turn out to be African-American or Latino, because it is people of color who have been disproportionately affected by those injustices,\u201d the spokesman, Michael Vachon, said in an email.Mr. Crump said he wants to focus attention next on elected prosecutors in Staten Island, Minneapolis, and Baton Rouge, places that have each seen high-profile killings of black men.He pointed to his decisions to stop prosecuting most low-level marijuana cases, create a program aimed at helping people clear warrants for low-level offenses, and devote resources to reversing wrongful convictions. Electing more black district attorneys, he said, might give blacks and the poor a fairer shake.\u201cWe should first determine if those who enter the criminal justice system belong in the criminal justice system \u2014 not just sort of process them on,\u201d he said.\u201cThere are a lot of lock-\u2019em-up, keep-\u2019em-moving D.A.s,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m not one of those guys.\u201dKitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}

She was worried about the red ink in her budget.Ms. Long, a graduate student who has been holding down three jobs trying to cover her expenses, was out to beat a deadline that haunted drivers in and around New Jersey on Halloween: At midnight, the state\u2019s gasoline tax would jump by 23 cents per gallon, to 37.5 cents.\u201cI\u2019m going to need a new car because of this, maybe a Prius,\u201d said Ms. Long, 24, who lives in Suffern, N.Y., as she handed the attendant three $1 bills \u2014 the cost of 1.485 gallons of regular. \u201cI\u2019d like to keep the \u2019Stang, but I can\u2019t be cool forever.\u201dHalf a tank here, a tiny top-off there. Drivers descended on service stations on Monday night for one last fill-up before the increase descended on them. Many were New York residents accustomed to sneaking into New Jersey for a better deal. Less-expensive gasoline has long lured drivers from other states, and many New Jersey drivers considered the gasoline tax a bargain that offset their high property taxes.\u201cI said to myself, \u2018Fill the car up while you can,\u2019\u201d said Barry Simpson, who lives in the mid-Hudson Valley of New York, 45 minutes away. In New York, he said, gasoline cost $2.21 to $2.45 a gallon, while in New Jersey the price, at least before Tuesday, was $1.90.The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan research organization based in Washington, said the gas-tax increase had pushed New Jersey from having the second-lowest tax in the nation, behind only Alaska, to having one of the 10 highest. As drivers in the habit of crossing the state line from New York to New Jersey are well aware, New York\u2019s gas tax is fourth highest in the nation, according to the organization.\u201cWe are not happy that the tax had to go up, but we understand why it did,\u201d said Sal Risalvato, the executive director of the New Jersey Gasoline, C-Store, Automotive Association, which represents gas stations. \u201cIt\u2019s a bitter pill, but it could have been a much more bitter pill.\u201dIn some ways, New Jersey is defined by cars. It had the first drive-in. It not only has a turnpike that runs from end to end, it has a parkway. It has Bruce Springsteen songs like \u201cThunder Road.\u201d And when it comes to gasoline, it is still the only state in the nation in which pumping your own fuel is against the law. (Oregon relaxed its restrictions earlier this year, allowing limited self-service.)Mr. Risalvato said there had been talk of allowing self-service gas when the trust fund issue surfaced more than a year ago. \u201cWe thought giving people the convenience of doing that and saving 10 cents a gallon would be a way to offset the gas tax increase,\u201d he said.But legislative leaders said it would not happen. The State Senate president, Stephen M.

Over the years he had watched customers dig deeper as the price climbed above $4 a gallon. He, and they, breathed easier when the prices dropped. He said the tax increase was troubling because it would be permanent.He said he figured that Monday had been his last busy day for a while. He said he expected business to be \u201cslow, slow\u201d starting on Tuesday.He replaced the numbers on the sign, marking the price jump to $2.24 a gallon, cash or credit, from $2.01. \u201cThat looks good, eh?\u201d he said, but he was talking about the numbers, straight in their slots, not the complaints he knew he would hear when the station reopened before dawn.An earlier version of this article misstated the size of a reauthorization of the New Jersey Transportation Trust Fund.

{"Headline": "Where\u2019s Gonzaga? Butler? Xavier? Blue-Blood Bias Creeps Into Showcases", "Date": "2016-11-15", "News": "Supported byOn College BasketballWhen Duke, Kentucky, Kansas and Michigan State converged on Madison Square Garden\u2019s hardcourt on Tuesday night, men\u2019s college basketball fans were treated to the first-, second-, seventh- and 13th-ranked teams in the country. The event was a potential Final Four preview, five months early. It was also a vivid reminder that the sport remains an oligarchy.This was the sixth straight year these programs competed in the so-called Champions Classic, broadcast on ESPN, with the No. 2 Wildcats defeating the No. 13 Spartans, 69-48, followed by the No. 7 Jayhawks defeating the No. 1 Blue Devils, 77-75, in the final seconds.A month from now, four other top programs with similar pedigrees \u2014 well, three plus Kentucky, since the Wildcats will appear in both \u2014 will meet in Las Vegas for another annual event, called the CBS Sports Classic. For three years now, it will have featured the same four programs: North Carolina, Ohio State, U.C.L.A. and Kentucky.\u201cThese are the blue bloods of the sport,\u201d said Dan Weinberg, CBS Sports\u2019s executive vice president for programming, referring to the teams in his network\u2019s event next month, although the statement was also true of Tuesday\u2019s event. \u201cThey have won for a long, long time.\u201dAs a new college basketball season opens, having formally tipped off just a few days ago, these early showcases are both symptoms and self-reinforcing causes of the sport\u2019s status quo, in which the most fortunate programs find themselves in a virtuous cycle involving wins, money, coaching and recruits \u2014 as well as exposure, which is where these annual early-season mini-tournaments come in.But Division I men\u2019s basketball, symbolically the N.C.A.A.\u2019s most open sport \u2014 with a postseason tournament renowned for binding together 32 otherwise disparate conferences and for featuring unpredictable upsets and lovable underdogs \u2014 is far from a democracy.\u201cThe deck is stacked against these smaller teams, smaller programs, because it\u2019s not in anyone\u2019s interests to have it any other way,\u201d said David Carter, who directs the Sports Business Institute at the University of Southern California.\u201cIn every sport, there are certain schools or teams that carry glamour, that carry history, that carry passionate fan bases,\u201d said Ilan Ben-Hanan, ESPN\u2019s vice president for college sports programming.\u201cDuke, Kansas, Kentucky and Michigan State have long histories, a lot of success,\u201d he added, \u201cand while you don\u2019t know what the future\u2019s going to hold, chances are they\u2019re going to be good for years down the line.\u201dSuch confidence in future squads ought to be remarkable, since the best college basketball players depart after just one or two seasons. Kentucky\u2019s roster three years from now, for example, is unknowable.But ESPN and CBS can have faith because, in college basketball, the rich have stayed rich. Consider that every Final Four going back to 1987, except 2013\u2019s, has featured at least one of the seven teams in these two showcases. During that span, all except Ohio State have won the national championship.And these early-season events are not mere bystanders to this phenomenon. The opportunity for this kind of exposure \u2014 wearing a famous jersey while competing against players wearing other famous jerseys, in a famous arena on national television in prime time as the college season tips off \u2014 is something these programs can sell to prospects.\u201cKids love that stuff,\u201d said Corey Evans, the managing editor of HoopSeen, which covers college basketball recruiting. \u201cWe\u2019re adults, and we love that stuff. Can you imagine being 17?\u201dMore broadly, in recruiting, Evans added, there is a \u201chigh-major rung and a high-high-major rung.\u201dNot infrequently, a top prospect will mull several offers from big-time programs near where he grew up, only to have North Carolina or Kentucky or Kansas swoop in with a scholarship offer at the last moment; such a player will nearly always say yes to the blue-chip (and frequently blue-hued) latecomer.The one-and-done phenomenon actually increases these programs\u2019 advantages, according to Evans, since rather than plucking just a couple of top prospects per high school class, the extra turnover requires that they sign half a roster\u2019s worth with each new season.\u201cIn the past, they\u2019d need two or three guys,\u201d Evans said. \u201cNow it\u2019s six or seven every year. Some of those guys who might have gone to North Carolina State or Tennessee or Virginia Tech or Georgetown, now they\u2019re going to Duke.\u201dThere are other advantages these programs enjoy, such as fan bases and donors to finance better facilities and higher salaries for coaches. Recruiting successes also beget more recruiting successes, as college coaches can show the most talented prospects that they know how to get players selected high in the N.B.A. draft.This overarching dynamic did not preclude a midmajor (Butler) from playing its way into two consecutive title games recently, nor does it keep programs like Gonzaga or Wichita State from consistent excellence. No. 3 Villanova, the defending national champion, is a somewhat idiosyncratic exception to this rule, as in a parallel sense is its conference, the Big East.Still, Carter described the programs in these early-season showcases as \u201cbig-market teams,\u201d not unlike baseball\u2019s Yankees or the N.B.A.\u2019s Los Angeles Lakers.He acknowledged the telling irony in applying the term \u201cbig market\u201d to towns like Chapel Hill and Durham, N.C.; Lexington, Ky.; East Lansing, Mich.; and Lawrence, Kan. But, he explained, \u201ccable television has been able to deliver national brands in other markets \u2014 not just to alumni in Los Angeles or New York being able to follow Michigan State, but building a national following among young people who would have no exposure to that team otherwise.\u201dHe added, \u201cThere are quite a few big brands from small markets.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Can Latin America Move to Low-Carbon Energy?", "Date": "2016-11-24", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsWASHINGTON \u2014 Climate negotiators convened in Morocco, this month to discuss how to turn the Paris climate accord into action. The accord, signed by almost 200 countries last year, came into force on Nov. 4. Many questions persist about how each country can move toward the zero carbon-energy target that experts say is necessary to avoid destructive climate change. Some parts of the world are better positioned than others to take this test. Latin America is a good example.To reduce per capita emissions consistent with this goal, by 2050 Latin America would not only have to stop deforestation and reduce emissions from agriculture and other non-energy sources, it would also have to cut consumers\u2019 energy use by 40 percent through huge improvements in efficiency. The region would also need to \u201cdecarbonize\u201d 90 percent of its power sector and electrify its entire transportation sector, according to a study by the Inter-American Development Bank. Decarbonization would require replacing high-carbon energy sources like oil and gas with zero carbon sources, like solar or wind energy.As middle-income economies, the region\u2019s countries have among the highest growth rates of car ownership in the world. In lower-income countries, like many in Africa and South Asia, only a small portion of the population owns cars, while in high-income countries like the United States car ownership has already peaked.However, hydropower has become less reliable because of increasingly frequent droughts and social opposition to new projects. As a result, several countries are expanding natural-gas-fired power to provide a reliable source of baseload power. While this helps meet short-term emissions targets because natural gas is cleaner than coal or oil for power generation, these investments will encourage the use of fossil fuels for decades, making it more difficult to reach long-term goals.Cutting energy emissions is increasingly important for reducing Latin America\u2019s total carbon footprint. Historically, two-thirds of the region\u2019s emissions have come from land-use changes and one-third have been energy-related \u2014 the reverse of the world average. But more recently, deforestation has fallen, especially in the Brazilian Amazon, and energy has emerged as one of the primary drivers of emissions growth in the region.To meet the ambitious Paris agreement Latin American countries would have to build infrastructure that supports low-carbon energy systems. At the same time, they will need to increase hydropower generation to ensure more sources of baseload power and expand electrical grid integration, both domestically and regionally, to compensate for the intermittent nature of renewable energy.Enormous investments must also be made in electric vehicles and public transportation. Consumers should be encouraged to adopt these cleaner options through incentives like tax breaks, congestion charges and preferential parking and driving lanes. Capacity for electricity generation will also need to expand substantially to accommodate increased electricity demand for transportation. The low cost of renewables in Latin America could help accelerate its transition to sustainable energy.Many of the commitments that Latin American countries made under the Paris agreement include conditional pledges dependent on international finance and technology transfer. This month\u2019s climate talks are expected to clarify access to such assistance.The climate goals for the next decades will require major transformations in the way people consume energy as well as technological breakthroughs to find new energy uses and sources. In Latin America, countries will have to define their own paths, but they all need to start planning their long-term climate change strategies today.Lisa Viscidi is the director of the Energy, Climate Change and Extractive Industries Program at the Inter-American Dialogue, where Rebecca O\u2019Connor is a program assistant.Advertisement"}

Even when it seems as if there were nowhere left to go, the city, with its manifold appetites, could not be contained. Thanks to new concrete technologies, we have witnessed an eruption of very slender, very tall (some might say very crass) buildings. But for every heroic skyscraper, there are more than a few more humble, human-scale ventures \u2014 a salt shed, a library, a residential hyperbolic paraboloid (see No. 10, above).Test your New York City skyline knowledge and see how many of these buildings you recognize.Today, apart from the Empire State or Chrysler Building, there are few icons of the skyline. The buildings outlined above, however, may someday be worthy of appearing in a Times Square souvenir snow globe.

As far as a beacon, you could do far worse. It\u2019s not fake, either, but an exemplar of adaptive reuse. Most people who are visiting the Wythe, they have no use for an old barrel factory. You\u2019re not displacing people, but you do have this very industrial-ish waterfront area that is very recognizably Williamsburg. Here they maintained the old brick facade and the beautiful old wood beams, but by and large, the entire building is very new. It\u2019s elevated to a place that doesn\u2019t just feel like Brooklyn pastiche.

VIA 57 WESTManhattan, 2016Bjarke Ingels GroupThe 32-story building may resemble an off-center pyramid, but the architects prefer to describe it as a hyperbolic paraboloid. The shape developed from taking a typical apartment block and stretching out the northwestern corner to increase views of the Hudson River.\u201cMany of the new towers currently going up are those pencil shapes. The Bjarke Ingels project on the West Side is especially interesting because it is beginning to show that when there\u2019s collaboration between architects, designers, developers and the city, you can start to do different things. This mashing of the conventional skyscraper and a typical courtyard building generated this rather unique shape that\u2019s standing out in the skyline rather nicely. And it includes affordable units, as well, which is obviously important. The lesson would be to start experimenting on all levels. Our city is so interesting because of the diversity of its people and opinions, and you want to see that reflected in the built environment.\u201dDavid van der Leer, Executive director, Van Alen Institute11.

THE NEW MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ARTManhattan, 2007SanaaExquisite execution with simple materials is one of the chief attributes of Japanese design, which helps explain how Sanaa turned some offset boxes of aluminum mesh into a beloved museum. And all for a mere $50 million (the new Whitney Museum of American Art cost almost nine times that).\u201cThe jagged skyline of the building, surrounded mostly by brownstones and tenements, really creates a stunning contrast that so speaks to what it is. In that neighborhood, I think it creates a real beacon of what\u2019s new. The first band of it does still line up with the building to the north, a totally brilliant way to be a part of that neighborhood and still be totally different. And the storefront is a direct continuation, too. Instead of a gentle weave into the city, it still connects, but in a very different way. It\u2019s very simple and detailed and not at all gaudy.\u201dDavid Rockwell, Founder, Rockwell GroupAdvertisement"}

The filings do not indicate what sort of lending Credify plans to do.Mr. Laplanche led the Lending Club to prominence in the online lending industry after founding the company in 2006.The company went public in late 2014, and by the end of 2015 it had originated over $15 billion in new loans, most of them to help people refinance their credit card debt. The company\u2019s success helped spawn a whole industry, which was seen as a threat to the basic lending business of the financial industry.The company said in May that it had received a criminal subpoena from the Justice Department and it has since been questioned by other federal agencies.The scandal dented much of the enthusiasm that had surrounded the nascent online lending industry. Lending Club\u2019s stock plunged, and it was the subject of several takeover rumors, but the company has so far remained independent.Mr. Laplanche moved to incorporate his new venture less than a month after leaving Lending Club. The company is based in downtown San Francisco, just a few blocks from the Lending Club offices.According to the filings, Mr. Laplanche is working on Credify with Jeffrey Bogan, another executive who was forced out at the Lending Club.The Journal reported that the company hoped to begin lending money in 2017 and that its compliance officer was Thomas Curran, a former official from the Treasury Department.An article on Thursday about a new venture by Renaud Laplanche, former chief executive of Lending Club, referred incorrectly to disclosures about Mr. Laplanche\u2019s investments in a fund that was purchasing Lending Club loans.

{"Headline": "Mayor de Blasio Increases New York\u2019s Budget by $1.3 Billion", "Date": "2016-11-17", "News": "Supported byThe de Blasio administration announced late on Thursday that it now anticipated spending over $1.3 billion more than it had originally forecast in the current budget, part of an annual recalibration of spending and revenue in New York City that takes place each November.The new $83.5 billion plan does include new savings from city agencies of roughly half a billion dollars, and another $151 million in savings from adjustments to the projected cost of debt service. The savings were amassed through many small changes across the municipal government, including moving away from paper billing, having agencies share more vehicles to reduce the number of unused vehicles in the city\u2019s fleet, and even by better managing how New York deals with dirt.Officials found that the city spent a significant amount of money on storing dirt dug out of the ground during construction projects; now, the city is projecting savings by better matching those projects with others where the dirt is needed, said Carol Kellermann, the president of the independent Citizens Budget Commission, who was briefed on the changes on Thursday morning.But Ms. Kellermann said the biggest issue in the revised numbers was the underperformance of the city\u2019s pension accounts, which required New York to inject another $120 million to cover obligations in the next fiscal year. (At this rate, budget experts said, the city would in a few years be spending about $10 billion of its budget on pension costs.)The Council speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, celebrated the focus on savings but said in a joint statement with Councilwoman Julissa Ferreras-Copeland, a fellow Democrat who is the finance chairwoman, that they \u201cremained concerned about rising shelter costs and pension obligations.\u201dThe plan appeared to reflect an effort by Mr. de Blasio to account for headwinds in the economy and uncertainty in the city\u2019s financial future, budget experts said. That uncertainty has only grown with the election of Donald J.

{"Headline": "Narendra Modi Bans India\u2019s Largest Currency Bills in Bid to Cut Corruption", "Date": "2016-11-08", "News": "Supported byNEW DELHI \u2014 Prime Minister Narendra Modi fired a direct shot at India\u2019s endemic corruption with a surprise move on Tuesday to ban the country\u2019s largest currency bills, starting the next morning.The ban is intended both to curb the flow of counterfeit money and to take aim at terrorist organizations that rely on unaccounted-for cash. It is also expected to help the government clean up a system that has relied on cash to pay bribes and to avoid taxes.But the announcement, made on national television in both Hindi and English, led to an immediate upheaval in the country. Abolishing the current version of the 500 and 1,000 rupee notes, worth about $8 and $15, will effectively remove 80 percent of the currency in circulation.Mr. Modi said banks would be closed on Wednesday. After that, people can exchange the banned notes through the end of the year for those of smaller denominations or new bills that are being created.We want to hear from those living in India on Mr. Modi\u2019s move, and the impact it has had on you and your family.A.T.M.s around the country were overrun Tuesday night with people confused about the plan and trying to complete financial transactions before the machines closed the following day. In some places, hundreds stood in line in front of a single A.T.M.Cash is so prevalent in Indian society that the ban came with a 72-hour exception for paying for hospital bills and airline tickets. India\u2019s low-cost carrier, IndiGo Airlines, sent an email warning customers that banned notes could not be used to purchase in-flight services or to pay excess baggage charges.The decision amounted to a \u201csurgical strike\u201d on the country\u2019s vast amount of unaccounted-for cash, said Manish Kejriwal, founder of Kedaara Capital Advisors, a Mumbai private equity firm, using a military term.\u201cThis is Modi\u2019s transformational reform,\u201d said Deepak Parekh, chairman of Housing Development Finance Corporation, one of India\u2019s largest mortgage lenders.\u201cIt will be disruptive, it will be inconvenient, but in the medium term, it will be very good.\u201dMr. Modi was elected in 2014 after running on an anticorruption platform that included a pledge to fight unaccounted-for cash, also referred to as \u201cblack money.\u201d The results have been mixed.Under one tax amnesty program, Indians owned up this year to about $10 billion in income on which taxes had not been paid, the Modi administration said last month. But another effort encouraging people to declare hidden assets and income abroad met with limited success.\u201cThere\u2019s a perception that whatever he has done on the corruption front is not enough,\u201d said Harsh Pant, a professor of international relations at King\u2019s College London, noting that elections in India\u2019s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, were expected to take place early next year. \u201cPolitically he probably felt he needed to do something more visible.\u201dWhile the currency plan had been under discussion for some time, few had expected such a bold step. Mr. Modi kept the decision quiet to prevent holders of vast amounts of unaccounted-for cash from outwitting the ban.The problems run deep.Global Financial Integrity, a Washington think tank, has estimated that India lost $344 billion in illicit outflows of money in the decade leading up to 2011.But it is unclear what the full impact of the ban will be. Studies have shown that corruption can be curtailed by reducing cash transactions, but it is unlikely to be eliminated by the move.\u201cIt is regrettable this will inconvenience\u201d 1.29 billion people, said Pradip Shah, the founder and former managing director of Credit Rating Information Services of India Limited, one of India\u2019s first credit-rating agencies, without stopping \u201cthe flow of black money.\u201dEven so, the ban on large bills is very likely to hasten India\u2019s transition away from cash. About 78 percent of transactions in India last year were made in cash, compared with 20 percent to 25 percent in the United States, Britain and other countries, according to a report by Google India and the Boston Consulting Group.The new policy puts India at the \u201cleading edge of countries restricting the use of high-denomination currency notes that are now seen as mostly fueling illegal activities rather than legitimate commerce,\u201d said Eswar S. Prasad, a trade policy professor at Cornell.As the ban works its way through the system, the real estate market could face a shock.Indian politicians, among others, not only hold vast amounts of cash, but they are also heavily invested in real estate, where it has historically been easy to convert unaccounted-for money into legal currency. A large percentage of real estate deals are done in unaccounted for cash.Without that cash, real estate prices could fall sharply. And developers holding large amounts of unaccounted for cash would find it suddenly rendered virtually useless, making it hard for them to pay their bills and finish their projects.\u201cCan you imagine what\u2019s going happen in real estate tomorrow?\u201d said Mr. Kejriwal, who also anticipated a drop in the prices of gold and luxury items.The exchange process, too, could prove problematic.For the next two weeks, people will be able to exchange only 4,000 rupees a day, or about $60. People holding vast sums of unaccounted for cash will find it hard to exchange the money at banks because they will need to explain where they got it, risking tax investigations, experts said.\u201cIf I walk in with two crores,\u201d Mr. Kejriwal said, using the Indian term for 20 million rupees, or about $300,000, \u201cpeople will be worried that the government will be tracking my name and address.\u201d\u201cPeople will be scared,\u201d he added.Mr. Modi, in his speech, addressed the inconveniences the public would most likely experience in the coming days.\u201cBrothers and sisters, in spite of all these efforts, there may be temporary hardships to be faced by honest citizens,\u201d he said. \u201cExperience tells us that ordinary citizens are always ready to make the sacrifices and face difficulties for the benefit of the nation.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Taps Hollywood\u2019s Mnuchin for Treasury and Dines With Romney", "Date": "2016-11-29", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Steven Mnuchin, a financier with deep roots on Wall Street and in Hollywood but no government experience, is expected to be named Donald J. Trump\u2019s Treasury secretary as soon as Wednesday, people close to the transition say.Mr. Mnuchin, 53, was the national finance chairman for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, and his selection would elevate a wealthy loyalist to a pivotal economic post. He began his career at Goldman Sachs, where he became a partner, before creating his own hedge fund, moving to the West Coast and entering the first rank of movie financiers by bankrolling hits like the \u201cX-Men\u201d franchise and \u201cAvatar.\u201dIf confirmed, Mr. Mnuchin would play a critical role in carrying out Mr. Trump\u2019s promised economic policy changes, including the enactment of a large package of tax cuts, sweeping changes to foreign trade agreements and the fulfillment of a huge new infrastructure spending program. He could also help lead any efforts to roll back President Obama\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran and the administration\u2019s opening to Cuba by reimposing sanctions on Tehran and Havana.Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s selection fits uneasily with much of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign attacks on the financial industry. Mr. Trump, in a campaign ad intended as a closing argument, portrayed the chief executive of Goldman Sachs as the personification of a global elite that the ad said had \u201crobbed our working class.\u201dThe selection of Mr. Mnuchin (pronounced mi-NEW-chin) came as Mr. Trump moved on Tuesday to fill the ranks of his domestic policy team with seasoned Washington insiders chosen to help smooth the way in Congress for his two marquee campaign promises: the repeal of Mr. Obama\u2019s health insurance coverage law and the large package to repair infrastructure, which could reach $1 trillion.Mr. Trump also took time Tuesday night to have dinner with Mitt Romney, whose name has been mentioned as a potential secretary of state, and who has become a source of contention among members of the transition team.A list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor who called Mr. Trump a \u201cphony\u201d and a \u201cfraud\u201d during the Republican primaries, sat down for a four-course meal Tuesday night at Jean-Georges, a three-star Michelin restaurant at the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Manhattan.Mr. Romney emerged several hours later to heap compliments on the president-elect, who has bristled privately that Mr. Romney never apologized for insulting him during the race.There was no apology, but Mr. Romney said he had been impressed by Mr. Trump\u2019s victory speech on election night, his transition effort and his personnel decisions.\u201cHe did something I tried to do and was unsuccessful in accomplishing: He won the general election,\u201d Mr. Romney told reporters.And on Wednesday, Mr. Trump will announce Wilbur Ross, the billionaire investor, as his secretary of commerce, according to the transition team.The moves suggested that Mr. Trump was seeking experienced policy makers who have deep relationships in Washington to shepherd his most sweeping pledges.Ms. Chao, who was born in Taiwan, brings a third woman to cabinet-level positions in a Trump administration and an additional degree of diversity to the president-elect\u2019s team, so far filled largely with conservative white men who have scoffed at political convention.Democrats said they were cautiously optimistic about working with Ms. Chao to forge a bipartisan infrastructure deal. \u201cI hope Secretary Chao shares that ambitious goal and is willing to work with Democrats to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and create millions of good-paying jobs along the way,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, who is set to become the new minority leader.But Ms. Chao was quickly criticized by liberal groups who said she was emblematic of the very corporate-driven political establishment Mr. Trump had promised to dismantle. Some policy analysts argued that as labor secretary she had inadequately protected employee rights, and the Center for American Progress called her selection an \u201cominous sign for workers.\u201dThe selection of Mr. Price, who has served in Congress since 2005, revealed deeper partisan divisions.Representative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan and the chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, called Mr. Price \u201ca brilliant choice,\u201d adding, \u201cI\u2019m glad that we\u2019ll have a doctor who knows health care inside and out leading the way.\u201dBut Democrats and their allies voiced alarm.Richard J. Fiesta, the executive director of the Alliance for Retired Americans, which represents retired union members, said he was \u201chorrified\u201d by the selection of Mr. Price. Marcia D. Greenberger, a president of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, a research and advocacy group, said Mr. Price \u201cwould have a devastating impact on women\u2019s health.\u201dIn Mr. Mnuchin, Mr. Trump has an ally whose nomination is expected to be well received on Wall Street, a number of traders and bankers contacted on Tuesday said.Since Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, United States equity markets have hit record highs, with financial institutions leading the way. Having a Treasury secretary with broad experience as a financier is likely to sustain the view that a Trump administration will look favorably on Wall Street, not least in terms of pulling back some regulations put in place by Mr. Obama.Mr. Mnuchin was an early supporter of Mr. Trump. When Mr. Trump won New York\u2019s Republican presidential primary contest in April, Mr. Mnuchin attended the victory party. The next day, he accepted Mr. Trump\u2019s invitation to become the campaign\u2019s national finance chairman.Mr. Mnuchin, the son of a Goldman Sachs partner, joined the firm after graduating from Yale. He worked there for 17 years, rising to oversee trading in government securities and mortgage bonds.He would be the third Goldman Sachs alumnus to serve as Treasury secretary, and the announcement of his appointment drew swift condemnation from liberal groups who said he had cashed in on the country\u2019s financial collapse.\u201cHe purchased a bailed-out bank for pennies on the dollar and then aggressively foreclosed on tens of thousands of families,\u201d Jon Green, a spokesman for the Take on Wall Street campaign, said in a statement. \u201cAnyone concerned about Wall Street billionaires rigging the economy should be terrified by the prospect of a Treasury Secretary Mnuchin.\u201dThe group was apparently referring to Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s role in 2009 in a group that bought the failed California mortgage lender IndyMac from the government. He became the chairman of the company, renamed OneWest, which was ultimately sold to CIT, the nation\u2019s largest small-business lender, in 2015 for more than twice the price the group had paid.During Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s tenure, OneWest faced allegations that it had foreclosed improperly on some borrowers. Fair-housing groups also filed a complaint with the federal government, claiming that OneWest was not meeting its legal obligation to make loans in minority neighborhoods.Mr. Mnuchin has conducted past business deals with the president-elect \u2014 but not always under the best of circumstances. Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s hedge fund, Dune Capital Management, helped finance construction of a Trump project in Chicago. In 2008, Mr. Trump sued Dune and other lenders to extend the loan terms. The parties ultimately settled.The selections on Tuesday came as Mr. Trump huddled with advisers and potential cabinet officials in Trump Tower in Manhattan.Among the issues is whether Mr. Trump should name Mr. Romney as his secretary of state. After their dinner, Mr. Romney told reporters that Mr. Trump \u201ccontinues with a message of inclusion and bringing people together, and his vision is something which obviously connected with the American people in a very powerful way.\u201dHe said Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct since winning the election gives \u201cme increasing hope that President-elect Trump is the very man who can lead us to that better future.\u201dJulie Hirschfeld Davis and Binyamin Appelbaum reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.

On Wednesday night, thousands of people protested in several cities, including Chicago, Philadelphia, Seattle and New York, where demonstrators converged in Midtown Manhattan in front of Trump Tower, the home of the president-elect.With millions of other voters euphoric at the election of a true political outsider as president, the clear divide over Mr. Trump inspired pleas of unity from his two biggest opponents, President Obama and Mrs. Clinton. At separate news conferences, they urged Americans to come together for the sake of the republic, and for the good of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency.\u201cWe are all now rooting for his success,\u201d said Mr. Obama, who planned to meet with Mr. Trump at the White House on Thursday. \u201cThe peaceful transfer of power is one of the hallmarks of our democracy. And over the next few months, we are going to show that to the world.\u201dMrs. Clinton, in her first remarks to supporters after the election, said Americans owed Mr. Trump \u201can open mind and a chance to lead.\u201d Choking back tears at times, she said she was \u201csorry that we did not win this election for the values we share and the vision we hold for our country.\u201d\u201cThis is painful, and it will be for a long time,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, standing beside her husband, former President Bill Clinton, in a tableau that underscored the end of a nearly 25-year era in which the Clintons dominated American politics.The clash between excitement and dread was especially palpable over the likelihood that Mr. Trump, at the head of a unified Republican government, would try to reverse Obama administration policies and appoint a conservative Supreme Court justice. The House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, indicated on Wednesday that Republicans would try to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and Democrats privately began strategizing to thwart that agenda. Republicans also expanded their power in state capitals, and Democrats pledged resistance.Donald J. Trump made good on his strategy of stoking the enthusiasm of white voters to defeat Hillary Clinton.Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign advisers said on Wednesday that he had been fielding calls from politicians like Mr. Ryan and world leaders, while also assembling a cabinet and White House team and selecting a conservative nominee for the Supreme Court vacancy. They said Mr. Trump was inclined to roll out a few cabinet nominations at a time, rather than kicking them off with one high-profile pick for a critical department like Treasury or State.Among the candidates for cabinet secretaries and advisers are members of Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle, aides said, including Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a crucial adviser on policy issues; Steven Mnuchin, a businessman who was Mr. Trump\u2019s national finance chairman; Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former mayor of New York; Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey; and Newt Gingrich, a former speaker of the House.Advisers said Mr. Trump had also started thinking about ways to unite the country. Democratic leaders quickly embraced a policy priority that he highlighted in his victory speech: infrastructure spending.Still, more than a third of Americans said in exit polls on Tuesday that they would be frightened of a Trump presidency. Among those who voted for Mrs. Clinton, the feeling was almost unanimous: 92 percent said Mr. Trump scared them.Anxieties ran strong among Hispanics, African-Americans, Muslims, immigrants, women and others who had felt disparaged or demonized by Mr. Trump, who used harsh and racially charged language in ways that upended mainstream politics. The fact that Mr. Trump had been endorsed by a Ku Klux Klan newspaper, even if he rejected it, symbolized the sense of shock that he would now lead a vibrantly diverse democracy.Alma Guel, 59, of El Paso, let out a long sigh as she started talking through the levels of emotional distress she had felt over the last 24 hours. She felt outrage, disbelief, then suspicion that the outcome was legitimate, then ashamed. She even started looking at property to buy in Mexico. Eventually, she just felt crushed.\u201cI was just heartbroken,\u201d said Ms. Guel, who works in the safety department of her local electric company. \u201cAnd all day today, I\u2019ve been in a daze. I\u2019ve never, ever been this affected by any other election.\u201dMany conservatives felt just as strongly \u2014 but in the opposite direction. The conservative radio host Laura Ingraham was overcome with emotion on her show Wednesday. \u201cYou\u2019re bringing tears to my eyes,\u201d she told the Republican strategist Ed Rollins as she beamed over the meaning of Mr. Trump\u2019s win.Jacob Stout, 20, who owns a small contracting business in Danville, Ky., said the result thrilled him because of the promise of bold action in Washington. \u201cI\u2019m excited, man. I\u2019m not going to lie,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen, especially the last eight years, talk but not drastic change that benefits the citizens. The idea that a citizen would be taking the presidency as opposed to a politician, I think that\u2019s got people excited.\u201dHis wife, Chloe Joslin, 24, was more tempered in her expectations, even though she also voted for Mr. Trump.\u201cOh, my goodness, you see people who are disowning friends over who they are voting for,\u201d said Ms. Joslin, a communications instructor. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very heated race.\u201dMr. Ryan said that he had \u201cspoken with Donald twice in the last 18 hours.\u201d\u201cWe talked about the work ahead of us, and the importance of bringing the nation together,\u201d he said. \u201cThis needs to be a time of redemption, not a time of recrimination.\u201dMr. Ryan could have been hinting at his own fate. There are more than a few restless conservatives in his conference in the House who were agitating for his ouster before the election because of his failure to fully embrace Mr. Trump. And whether that discontent will die down is far from clear.Other Republicans who made their reservations about Mr. Trump proudly known before the election tried to be gracious, though some sounded more skeptical than optimistic.Then he promised to hold Mr. Trump to his word. \u201cStarting today, I will do everything in my power to hold the president to his promises,\u201d he said.Elsewhere, the transition of power seemed to be unfolding in an orderly fashion. Word came from the Pentagon on Wednesday morning that Mr. Trump would begin receiving the same classified intelligence briefings as the president. And the defense secretary, Ashton B. Carter, said in a statement that he was committed to a smooth passing of power to the next commander in chief.Christopher Mele contributed reporting.

Madoff\u2019s Ponzi scheme in accounts offshore.And, it turns out, the funds can stay there.The judge said foreign bankruptcy proceedings blocked the trustee from gaining access to the money.Koch Industries began investing in the Madoff fund well before its collapse and pulled out $21.5 million in 2005.The money went to a fund registered in the British Virgin Islands and then to a Koch entity in Britain.They were not alone.Several European banks also had Madoff money offshore, according to court papers, including HSBC, UBS, Credit Suisse, an international arm of Merrill Lynch and the French money manager Natixis.You\u2019ve probably read about the efforts by Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, to learn Mandarin, his visits to China and his cultivation of relationships with the country\u2019s leaders.But Facebook has made deeper efforts to get into China, as well.The social network developed software to suppress posts from appearing in people\u2019s news feeds in specific geographic areas, according to three current and former Facebook employees.The tool is one of many ideas the company has discussed and may never see the light of day.But it illustrates the extent to which Facebook may be willing to compromise one of its core mission statements, \u201cto make the world more open and connected,\u201d if there is a possibility of gaining access to a market of 1.4 billion people.\u201cIt stinks... It\u2019s part and parcel of the unsavory marketing of his brands that he also did during the campaign.\u201d\u2022 The Commerce Department will report data on durable goods order in October. The manufacturing sector has been hurt by a strong dollar, but benefited slightly from a rebound in oil prices. Economists will be examining the numbers to see which of these trends prevails.\u2022 Figures on new home sales last month will also be published. The market for new single-family homes is robust, so economists expect the sales to be about the same as September.\u2022 The Federal Reserve publishes the minutes from its last meeting, which was before the presidential election.

For Dascal, health is a way of life. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have your health, you have nothing,\u201d she says.Dascal started investing in health-and-wellness companies before most of her peers. Now, though, many of her friends are also buying wellness products, adopting healthier lifestyles and seeking rejuvenating experiences. \u201cPeople are now very interested in this,\u201d she says.The rise of small, high-end gyms supports that perception. In 2016, boutique gyms accounted for 42 percent of the total U.S. fitness-club market, double what it was in 2014. Members typically paid $80 to $140 a month for access to these gyms in 2014, significantly more than the $52 average for overall gym memberships. Organic foods and immersive wellness experiences \u2014 including healthy-eating retreats, outdoor fitness challenges and expert seminars on wellness-related topics \u2014 are also doing well. This growth is being seen in the uptick in IPOs of health and wellness companies over the past couple of years, including well-known gyms and healthy-snack makers.Investing in sustainability is another way people are putting their values to work \u2014 installing solar panels on their roofs, holding shares or making direct investments in renewable-energy technology, buying organic foods and purchasing electric cars.

From 2013 to 2015, Tesla\u2019s revenue doubled, to about $4 billion.And with individuals now building more environmentally friendly homes, interest in Tesla\u2019s forthcoming Powerwall is growing. The home battery will use electricity generated by solar panels to power the house.

Meanwhile, venture capital firms have poured more than $4 billion into wearable-technology players in the past two years, up from just $333 million in 2011.Then, of course, there\u2019s the investment that has beckoned the heart and the portfolio of the affluent from time immemorial: art.The value of the online art market is estimated to increase by 193 percent between now and 2020In 2015, financial advisors surveyed by Knight Frank\u2019s Wealth Trends reported 63 percent of their clients were becoming more interested in buying paintings and sculpture. Wilson says he\u2019s seen a rise in art collecting among the wealthy, noting that \u201cpeople buy art for the aesthetic value \u2014 they can get a personal benefit from it every day, while at the same time it\u2019s an uncorrelated asset.\u201dThe difference today is that it\u2019s so much easier for potential collectors to explore what\u2019s out there than it used to be. Galleries are everywhere \u2014 not just in major international hotspots. But perhaps even more important has been the rise of online purveyors of paintings and sculpture, all vying to disrupt the closed and secretive global network of high-end art exchange. Online art sales rose 24 percent year-over-year in 2015, and the value of the online art market is forecast to soar 193 percent by 2020.Finding the best ways to invest in your values and passions isn\u2019t easy, but a financial advisor with experience counseling the wealthy can help, says Corley. \u201cThe good ones are continuously updating their knowledge (of investment options.)\u201dMeanwhile, investors\u2019 determination to use their money to express who they really are will no doubt continue to spread and strengthen. \u201cPeople are living longer,\u201d says Argyropoulos. \u201cSo they want to make a difference while they\u2019re alive. They want to be able to realize their dreams while they can.\u201dThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "Why Washington Needs Wall Street", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byStreet SceneThe latest round of drumbeating has begun to prevent anyone with a Wall Street background from filling the top economic positions in the next administration. Not only is that not right, it hurts the American people by preventing those who have the best understanding of how financial markets work from taking a much-needed role in policing and fixing them. It is a form of discrimination. The time has come for it to stop.Not to be outdone by Mr. Reich, Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont lawmaker who gave Mrs. Clinton a run for her money during the Democratic primaries, wrote in an email to The Times, \u201cWe need a secretary of the Treasury who is prepared to take on the greed and recklessness of Wall Street, not someone who comes from Wall Street.\u201dAs I have previously written, Mr. Weiss had impeccable progressive credentials and shared many of Senator Warren\u2019s political views. But that was not good enough for her. That he had Wall Street experience meant he was unacceptable to her. And somehow, she had enough political power in Washington to block Mr. Weiss\u2019s appointment. Senator Warren wouldn\u2019t even deign to meet with Mr. Weiss. In short order, the nomination was withdrawn. (Disclosure: Mr. Weiss and I worked together for a few years as bankers at Lazard, more than 20 years ago.)But that wasn\u2019t the end of the story. For the last two years, Mr. Weiss has served as a \u201ccounselor\u201d to Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew, an appointment that does not require Senate approval. In that role, Mr. Weiss has a leading responsibility in trying to resolve the financial crisis shaking up Puerto Rico and in trying to make the capital markets operate more smoothly. He has accomplished much during his nearly two years in Washington, even without the authority he would have had as a confirmed under secretary, and he remains highly regarded for his work there.Mr. Weiss\u2019s success in Washington makes one wonder just what Senator Warren accomplished by blocking a hearing on his nomination, other than showing us all that she could. Senator Warren\u2019s demagogy is impressive. She has lots of power and is not afraid to use it. Sometimes, she almost gets it right \u2014 for instance, when she took down John G. Stumpf, the former chairman and chief executive of Wells Fargo, during his Senate hearing in September about the cross-selling scandal at the bank. She called for his resignation, and he handed it in on Oct. 12. But most of the time, she goes overboard and seems like she is receiving way too much gratification getting headlines and television time for her stern and condescending lectures.The fact is that many jobs in Washington could be filled by someone with a Wall Street background to the benefit of the American people. What better way to improve the inner workings of the capital markets than by having someone with the authority to regulate them who knows precisely how they work, or how they are manipulated?There has been a long and mutually beneficial history of Wall Street types working in Washington. For instance, Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former chief executive of Goldman Sachs, who was the Treasury secretary before, during and after the 2008 financial crisis.With help from Ben S. Bernanke, then the chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Timothy F. Geithner, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Mr. Paulson had the good sense to realize that what the big Wall Street companies needed eight years ago to prevent further disaster was an enormous infusion of capital to restore confidence to the financial markets at the moment they had stopped working.Contrary to what Senator Warren and Senator Sanders believe, not everyone who works on Wall Street is evil. Not everyone who works, or worked, on Wall Street or at a private equity firm or at a hedge fund should automatically be barred from government service.On the contrary, we need the best minds in our society working in government to solve our many problems \u2014 climate change, the rising cost of health care, our $20 trillion of federal debt and our annual budget deficits \u2014 and believe it or not, Senator Warren, some of our nation\u2019s best and brightest work in finance. If they are willing to give up their high-paying jobs to serve in government and can get through a Senate confirmation hearing, why in the world wouldn\u2019t we want them working for us in Washington?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Marijuana Plants Flourish Under Energy-Saving LED Lights", "Date": "2016-11-25", "News": "Supported byTUMWATER, Wash. \u2014 Behind the covered windows of a nondescript two-story building near the Olympia Regional Airport, hundreds of marijuana plants were flowering recently in the purple haze of 40 LED lights.It was part of a high-stakes experiment in energy conservation \u2014 an undertaking subsidized by the local electric company. With cannabis cultivation poised to become a big business in some parts of the country, power companies and government officials hope it will grow into a green industry.The plants here, destined for sale in the form of dried flowers, joints or edible items, were just a few weeks from harvest and exuding the potent aroma of a stash room for the Grateful Dead. But the energy-efficient LED lights were the focus of attention.\u201cWe wanted to find a way to save energy \u2014 that was important to us,\u201d said Rodger Rutter, a retired airline pilot who started this indoor pot-farming business, Evergrow Northwest, after Washington State legalized recreational cannabis in 2012.\u201cWe wanted to be able to offer the best product at the best price,\u201d Mr. Rutter said, \u201cand a big part of the cost is energy.\u201dAs cannabis has increasingly gone legitimate \u2014 about two dozen states had already legalized it in some form before several others eased restrictions on Election Day \u2014 electric utilities have struggled to cope with the intensive energy demands of the proliferating industry.Besides blown transformers and blackouts for utilities in some places, the ascent of Cannabis Inc. has also raised clean-air concerns in parts of the country where fossil fuels are still the main source of electric power.Even in many places where growing marijuana is legal, cultivators are required to keep their crops out of public view. And in any case, many growers prefer having the ability to control the environment by raising the plants indoors.Traditionally, indoor producers \u2014 formerly relegated to basements, garages and shadowy warehouses \u2014 relied on hot, high-intensity lights. When air-conditioning and ventilation were included, the energy used to grow a single marijuana plant would run seven refrigerators for the same period, according to one estimate.But under an incentive program with the local utility here, Evergrow was able to install more than 100 sophisticated LED grow lights, hoping to reduce costs without sacrificing quality or yield. The utility, Puget Sound Energy, which gets about a third of its electricity from hydropower and most of the rest from coal and natural gas, offers grants to help customers offset the cost of energy-efficiency upgrades.Although the LED lights are more expensive up front \u2014 they can run $1,600 each, as opposed to $350 for the high-pressure sodium lights traditionally used \u2014 their lower electricity requirements mean they can save money in the long run.It is not just that the LED lights take so much less energy to operate. They also run cooler, requiring less air-conditioning.\u201cIt\u2019s a snowball effect,\u201d Mr. Rutter said, surrounded by dozens of specimens with names like Lodi Dodi and Secret Recipe. \u201cYou just don\u2019t suck up as much energy.\u201dUtilities elsewhere have felt the energy impact of liberalized marijuana laws.For example, Pacific Power, based in Portland, Ore., traced some neighborhood power outages to clusters of residential customers who were taking advantage of state laws allowing up to four marijuana plants per household for personal use.In Denver, home to one of the largest and most advanced cannabis industries, demand for energy and water ran high enough that the city\u2019s Department of Environmental Health convened a working group to develop recommendations to help make the businesses more sustainable.The cultivation and sale of marijuana, though permitted under a patchwork of state laws, are still federal crimes. That has made it a challenge for utilities to work closely with growers and led to tensions with federal law enforcement agencies.As a result, many electric utilities have been reluctant to offer incentives or rebates to cannabis growers for energy-efficiency upgrades. That has been particularly true in the Pacific Northwest, because many of the region\u2019s energy discount programs are financed by the Bonneville Power Administration, a federal nonprofit marketer of electricity whose rules prohibit subsidizing cannabis operations.Portland General Electric, for instance, had to set up a separate billing system for home-grow operations to keep them separate from Bonneville.Evergrow\u2019s utility, Puget Sound Energy, is not a Bonneville customer, said Dave Montgomery, who leads the utility\u2019s business energy management group. \u201cIt is legal here,\u201d he said of marijuana farming, \u201cand we\u2019re obligated to provide them the same services we would with anybody else.\u201dUsing its own energy-efficiency programs for new enterprises has helped Puget Sound Energy avoid the overloaded transformers that resulted when cannabis cultivation was first catching on, Mr. Montgomery said.And yet growers, many with experience in illicit operations, have often resisted LEDs, preferring to follow their own tried-and-true methods. Many say that earlier versions of LEDs simply did not perform as well as the high-pressure sodium or metal halide lamps that growers favored, especially when the plants began producing flowers, the valued part of the yield.But as horticultural lighting companies like Heliospectra and P. L. Light Systems have turned their focus to the cannabis market with more sophisticated LEDs, interest has picked up. Lighting Science, which makes the VividGro lights that Evergrow uses, doubled sales of that line this year, the company recently announced.The newer products are able to generate not only the light intensity but also the color spectrum the plants need to thrive, without wasting energy on unnecessary parts of the spectrum.For cannabis, that means growers might use lights that appear white but have more blue for seedlings, and then shift to lighting with more intensity and more red as they mature. Later, shortening the amount of time the plants spend under illumination each day, which mimics how daylight diminishes as the seasons change, triggers flowering.At Evergrow, the company cultivates most of its plants under LEDs, but keeps one space, known as the energy-suck room, illuminated by high-pressure sodium lights as a kind of experimental control.The plants in that room, which was hovering around 88 degrees during a recent visit despite 16 fans helping to circulate cold air both from outside and from an overhead air-conditioning vent, produce slightly more flowers but with somewhat less potency.\u201cIt takes a lot of energy to keep this room functioning,\u201d said Mr. Rutter, wearing a T-shirt and jeans under the bright yellow glare, his forehead glistening as he gazed across plants lush with distinctive, hand-shaped leaves and fuzzy, bud-laden flower stalks.Mr. Rutter estimates that the energy-suck room accounts for more than half of his roughly $5,000 monthly electric bill, though it contains only about one-quarter of the building\u2019s grow lights. Mr. Rutter said that with the utility\u2019s rebates, he ended up paying about $72,000 for the LED lights, which would normally cost around $162,000.For Mr. Rutter, 62, the new business was a way to keep busy when he decided to retire from flying for Frontier Airlines. He said he had smoked marijuana in college but had long since given it up.Mr. Rutter started Evergrow with his 26-year-old son, Adam, who began growing plants at home as a teenager. Although he did not entirely approve of Adam\u2019s using the drug, Mr. Rutter condoned his son\u2019s green-thumb efforts.\u201cHe really had a passion for it,\u201d Mr. Rutter said. \u201cI saw that it was something he was good at. For a time it was awkward, but then this came along.\u201dNow that cannabis growing is legal, Mr. Rutter said, the stigma has dissipated, and the company\u2019s sales keep increasing. Through October, the company reported $513,880 in sales for this year, more than double what it sold in all of 2015.\u201cWe can\u2019t grow it fast enough,\u201d he said with a chuckle as a group of employees quickly filled and sealed plastic packages of joints and tossed them into a bin. \u201cWe\u2019d like to figure out a way to get the plants on steroids.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "My Mother Saw Danger in This Election. She Crossed State Lines to Try to Stop It.", "Date": "2016-11-15", "News": "My mother is beautiful. The woman I lay my eyes on now still feels like the same one who, 20 years ago, would pick me up and waltz around our family room as if we were at our own exclusive ball. I laugh at the life crackling in her voice every time she answers the phone with an overloud, singsong \u201cHey, Greg!\u201d But she\u2019s older now. She doesn\u2019t dance as much and a long scar runs down her spine from surgery last year. I was surprised when I heard about her day in Virginia: She\u2019s politically active and like 94 percent of black women this year, she voted for Clinton. But she has never before volunteered for a campaign. Daylong activities often leave her paying a price the following morning. When I asked her why she chose to volunteer in another state, her answer came easy and struck a familiar, maternal tone: \u201cThat\u2019s where I felt I was needed.\u201dMy mom is retired now, but when I was growing up, she made her career in finance. She woke up early and dressed: high heels, sheer stockings, dark lipstick, sometimes pants, sometimes skirts, always blazers. I remember thinking she looked almost too perfect, like the TV version of a tough black businesswoman. Then she got me and my brother ready, and we would go off to school, and she would weave through rush-hour traffic to Washington. For a while, she caught the Amtrak from Maryland to New York City and back again, every day.She was brilliant, but that was never enough on its own. She drank coffee like water. She tried to hide it from us, but the stress of her career always threatened to bow her shoulders and often brought sudden tears to her eyes. She often worked deep into the night, her desk disappearing beneath thousands of pages of documents, her face shining blue in the glow of her computer screen. After decades in heels, her ankles began to give out. Eventually, her back did, too. Bolts of pain ran down her legs, leaving her immobile and in agony for days. She was a fighter, her co-workers and my dad always said, in awe. But she was a black woman in finance and had to fight for every dollar and promotion, often against so many skeptical and perverse white men. There was a bodily toll, a price many around her didn\u2019t have to pay. A few years ago, she switched to flats and took a less stressful, lower-paying job at a black nonprofit group. But her career had already claimed its pound of flesh, and soon, she couldn\u2019t even do that.There is a real, physical tax just for being a woman or person of color in this world. My mother volunteered because she has paid this tax, in the stress of having her value constantly questioned, the physical demands of not being taken seriously as an intellectual and a leader. My mother voted for Clinton on Oct. 27, the very first day she could, and two days after that, she spent her Saturday at home, calling registered Democrats in Nevada to make sure they did the same. There was an urgency to her political activity that I\u2019d never seen. She liked Clinton and wanted to see a woman as president. But above all, she came of age during the civil rights era and was watching as the alt-right, the Klan and white masses mobilized around a candidate. She recognized danger. She\u2019d already lived through the America to which Trump promised to return.That danger is everywhere, but it\u2019s palpable in the South. When he was a kid, my dad\u2019s family moved from Lynchburg, Va., to Washington, where he grew up, just yards away from the Maryland border. When I was young, he would tell me about the times his parents would ask him and his brother to run to the country store for groceries, just on the other side of the border. Sometimes, they would run into white kids on their trip. The white kids would harass my dad and my uncle and spit on them. Sometimes, the white kids would chase them back across the border, promising violence all the while. This was the tax for entering Maryland.And yet he came to Maryland, eventually, and raised me there. I thought about his stories a lot when I was young. I took it upon myself to draw another border. Mine was the Virginia state line. Even now, Virginia occupies my mind as the gateway to \u201cthe South,\u201d that ominous place where the white people vote red, the place where the potential physical tax gets a little steeper, the place my father\u2019s family fled.But the Virginia border is just an imaginary line, demarcated by a sign on the side of the road. I\u2019ve drawn scores of other lines around myself, too, lines that are intangible but no less firm for it. They police my actions, box me in and guide me along the least taxing path. Freedom is the erasure of those imaginary lines, the lessening of the tax that awaits on the other side.No one knows quite what Donald Trump will do as president. But what my parents so intimately understood is that for many of us, there is a real and physical tax extracted simply for things like straying too far from home, raising a family or pursuing a career \u2014 for taking part in American life. That tax promises to grow steeper in this new America.When I called home to talk to my parents after the election, I felt myself beginning to panic. I\u2019d never before felt such fear for the taxes Trump\u2019s America would extract from me and my loved ones \u2014 the low, dull dread that there were just too many lines to draw. My mom and dad let me talk myself out, then calmed me down. The world feels different to me now.

{"Headline": "When Should Charities Throw In Together?", "Date": "2016-11-04", "News": "Supported byWealth MattersFOR some well-heeled donors, venturing out on their own to start a family foundation or serving on the board of a public charity is appealing. But sometimes, merging individual charitable organizations can have a greater impact on the people served.Many organizations, the report said, need to merge or consider other partnership strategies if they want \u201cto grow, improve services and become more effective \u2014 or in some cases, just remain viable.\u201d\u201cThe truly successful mergers start with a focus on the mission,\u201d said Gillian Darlow, chief executive of the Polk Brothers Foundation, which helped finance the study. \u201cIs this a good strategic choice for us? Can we increase our impact?\u201dIn 85 percent of the cases, the study found, a board member served as the main advocate for the merger. In 44 percent of the cases, donors paid for the costs of the merger. The study also found that in 88 percent of the mergers, the people involved thought that the new organization was stronger and more effective.But the study also provides ideas on how family foundations, which are generally smaller and do not have the public oversight of charities, can consider their futures, particularly when later generations lose their connection to where the foundation started or the organization\u2019s grant-making abilities dwindle.Public charities and family foundations are completely different entities. But when it comes to mergers, strategic partnerships or even dissolutions, the two share one thing: individuals, either board members or family members, will drive the big decisions.While the report found benefits for the causes served by public charities, several hurdles typically stand in the way of collaboration, let alone mergers.The top one is pride in the organization itself. \u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous sense of ownership, not just to the mission but the organization,\u201d said Eric Weinheimer, chief executive of Forefront, a nonprofit consulting group in Illinois that started a program to help organizations sustain their missions. \u201cThere\u2019s a reluctance to give up control and a sense of ownership.\u201dBut, he said, there can also be either a lack of resources to investigate partnership opportunities or too little money left by the time the group realizes it needs help.Ms. Darlow said the report found that more than half of mergers were begun during a change in an organization\u2019s leadership.\u201cNonprofits don\u2019t have the same incentives to merge that for-profits do, namely the financial incentives,\u201d she said. \u201cThe merger of two organizations can get tripped up at the leadership level if both of them aren\u2019t on board. But if they are going through some leadership change, they\u2019re more open to exploring that.\u201dK. Sujata, president and chief executive of the Chicago Foundation for Women, oversaw a merger in 2012, when her nonprofit group took over the Eleanor Foundation. The idea for the merger, Ms. Sujata said, came from a board member of the Eleanor Foundation who knew her from when she worked there. The impetus was a change in leadership.While both organizations focused on helping women, they did so in different ways. She said it took members of the two boards eight months to work out an agreement.In the end, the Eleanor Foundation agreed to make a gift of its assets in exchange for the promise that the Chicago Foundation for Women would continue to fund work on economic self-sufficiency, make at least $1 million in grants in that area over the first three years and take six board members from the Eleanor Foundation onto its board.David A. Levitt, a lawyer at Adler & Colvin in San Francisco, said active, engaged board members were crucial to smooth mergers of nonprofit organizations. But he said one big question for board members to decide was whether to go for a full merger or an acquisition of another organization\u2019s assets.With a merger, he said, board members need to be aware that the organization\u2019s liabilities come along with its assets, programs and donors.\u201cWith a merger, you need to know what you\u2019re getting,\u201d he said. \u201cWith an asset acquisition, you can get what you want and not all the other liabilities.\u201dShort of a merger, board members could suggest collaboration among organizations with a shared mission.Mr. Weinheimer at Forefront said there were opportunities for strategic alliances and joint programming when organizations had similar missions. And in those instances, he said, boards can put structures in place so that organizations can work productively together.\u201cThere are more and more nonprofits being created every day,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to be very diligent to have the systems and structures and the capacity to provide this as a nonthreatening coordinated position.\u201dLike anything involving people and organizations, not every merger or partnership goes well. Jean Butzen, president of Mission Plus Strategy Consulting, said mergers commonly become derailed or succeed for the same reason: board members.\u201cOften, board members get very inflexible about who the leader should be of the combined organization, or they can get very inflexible about the name,\u201d Ms. Butzen said. \u201cSometimes, they can\u2019t let go of that.\u201dShe said in those cases she tried to explain to board members that the environment had changed and that without merging, the organization could become less effective or cease to exist.\u201cThey insist on remaining in the past,\u201d she said. \u201cWe see that a lot. It\u2019s because they love the organization and the mission so much.\u201dMergers are not as common with family foundations. \u201cIt\u2019s deeply personal,\u201d Mr. Weinheimer said. \u201cThis is the legacy of your father, mother or grandmother. There is a great deal of pride in the name and history.\u201dYet more so than public charities, which are intended to exist beyond their founders and the current board members, family foundations demand the advice of family members, since most of the foundations do not have the resources for larger staffs.When descendants move away \u2014 or disagree with one another on the mission \u2014 there are options.Norah L. Jones, a partner at the law firm Quarles & Brady, said it was difficult to find another family foundation that shared the same goals. \u201cIt\u2019s often hard enough to balance these things within one family,\u201d she said.But she has worked with families that want to find ways to collaborate on administrative matters or share office space.She said she had also seen funding collaborations between foundations that work in a similar field. While these are often less formal than they would be between public charities, they can exist for a specific cause and then fall away.A more challenging reason for a family foundation to merge with another foundation, or even dissolve, is that descendants do not agree on what the foundation is doing \u2014 or for that matter, do not get along.In that case, Ms. Jones said a foundation can sometimes be split, giving descendants their own pot of money. Or the entire family foundation can be put into a donor-advised fund, a less costly charitable structure that allows family members to recommend grants to organizations.Ken Nopar, senior philanthropic adviser at American Endowment Foundation, a sponsor of donor-advised funds, said his parents put their family foundation into a donor-advised fund about a year ago. They had given away the bulk of the money in the foundation and the administrative costs no longer made sense, he said. So they made one last grant, to the donor-advised fund, and closed their foundation.For some, that may be an extreme step, even though family members can still propose grants.

Weinberg, a co-founder of Perella Weinberg and the head of its advisory business. \u201cIt\u2019s a significant part of the M.&A. market, and it\u2019s an important asset in the asset management business.\u201dUnder the terms of the deal, Tudor Pickering Holt will become a subsidiary of Perella Weinberg Partners, though its energy practice will continue to operate under the Tudor Pickering Holt name. Robert B. Tudor III, a founder of the smaller boutique firm, insisted that the unusual structure does not hint at any potential culture clash between the two advisory outfits.\u201cWe\u2019re going to be one firm, but we at T.P.H. do have a unique and slightly quirky culture,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Perella Weinberg guys have recognized that from the beginning, and they have no desire to change it.\u201dMr. Tudor, who is the chairman and chief executive of Tudor Pickering Holt, will join Perella Weinberg\u2019s executive committee. R. Maynard Holt will become chief executive of the Tudor Pickering Holt business, while Dan Pickering will become president and chief investment officer of the combined firm\u2019s energy asset management division.And Alexandra Pruner, Tudor Pickering Holt\u2019s chief financial officer, will take on that role at Perella Weinberg Partners.In some ways, the acquisition of Tudor Pickering Holt signifies a continued importation of former Goldman Sachs executives into Perella Weinberg. The investment bank began life with some of that firm\u2019s DNA \u2014 Mr. Weinberg is a scion of a longtime Goldman family \u2014 and it has hired other alumni like Robert K. Steel, who is now Perella Weinberg\u2019s chief executive, and Bruce Mendelsohn, who previously led restructuring at Goldman.Both Mr. Tudor and Mr. Holt previously worked at Goldman, with Mr. Tudor having worked in the Wall Street firm\u2019s London office alongside Mr. Weinberg.In interviews, executives from Perella Weinberg and Tudor Pickering Holt said that they had kept in touch since both firms were founded roughly a decade ago. (Mr. Tudor said that he had even discussed starting an energy business within what became Perella Weinberg.) But it was not until within the last two years that Mr. Tudor and Mr. Weinberg began seriously discussing whether the two should become partners.Though the acquisition is being announced as oil prices are in a slow recovery, Mr. Steel said that his firm was not simply trying to time any cycles in the energy market.Financial details of the transaction were not disclosed, though executives from the two firms said that none of Tudor Pickering Holt\u2019s executives cashed out and instead rolled over their holdings into Perella Weinberg. Some of Perella Weinberg\u2019s outside investors, including an investment arm of Qatar, helped finance Monday\u2019s transaction.For Tudor Pickering Holt, the deal will allow the business to grow outside North America, particularly given Perella Weinberg\u2019s ties to the Middle East, and expand into areas like corporate restructuring.\u201cWe view this as a natural progression as we try to grow our business,\u201d Mr. Tudor said. \u201cWe felt we needed a partner to help us grow and fill in holes.\u201dAnd for Perella Weinberg, further benefits included adding Tudor Pickering Holt\u2019s nearly $2 billion of energy assets to its own $10 billion asset management business. The energy boutique will also bring a robust research team, which produces a widely read daily analyst commentary on the energy industry, and a sales and trading arm that caters to clients. Mr. Weinberg and Mr. Steel said that they would study whether those offerings could be expanded to other industries that Perella Weinberg focused on.\u201cWhat I think we\u2019ll do is learn more about this and see if we can extend this into other aspects of what we do,\u201d Mr. Steel said.Tudor Pickering Holt is among Perella Weinberg\u2019s biggest acquisitions to date, and it could lead to yet more takeovers of other advisory or asset management businesses, Mr. Weinberg added.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Trump Is Good for China", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorSHANGHAI \u2014 Perhaps no country has taken more hits from Donald J. Trump than China. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump made it sound as if making America \u201cgreat again\u201d meant defeating China.But much of the Chinese public supported him. And President Xi Jinping was among the first world leaders to congratulate him. Mr. Xi, in his message to the president-elect, expressed hopes of building on the \u201ccommon interests\u201d between the world\u2019s two largest economies.Beijing is looking forward to change in Washington. For the Chinese, the Obama era has been the most difficult period in United States-China relations since President Richard M. Nixon renewed ties in 1971. The Obama administration, with Hillary Clinton as secretary of state, made its \u201cpivot to Asia\u201d about containing Beijing, aiming to strengthen and enlarge the American alliance system in the Asia-Pacific region while increasing America\u2019s military footprint there. The pivot was backed by an economic plan, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a now-moribund trade pact created in part to isolate Beijing.Since the end of the Cold War, from President Bill Clinton to President Obama, the United States has been trying to remake the world in its own image \u2014 building an American empire in the name of globalization. Through ever larger and more complex alliances and global institutions that the United States designed, Washington has sought the global standardization of rules in trade, finance and international relations. It has used political, economic and military might to push other countries to adopt electoral democracy and market capitalism.China has refused to yield. While the Chinese have been great beneficiaries of this era, Beijing has engaged globalization on its own terms. China\u2019s gains from globalization have helped turn the country from a poor agrarian economy into an industrial powerhouse within one generation. Yet Beijing has insisted on strengthening its one-party political system and opening its market only so much.This approach is working for China. The Chinese economy continues to advance in both size and technological sophistication, so much so that China looms in the minds of many American elites as the most potent long-term threat.But these elites fail to realize \u2014 and Mr. Trump appears to understand \u2014 that while they have been obsessed with the rise of China as a threat to the United States-led liberal order, America\u2019s domestic political foundations have been decaying. The tendency of American elites to try to mold the world to their liking created a conflict in their own country, between Americans with power and ordinary people. The American empire was built at the expense of the American nation.Globalization has benefited those Americans at the top with concentrated wealth and influence while the middle class has stagnated or shrunk. The country\u2019s industrial base, the economic bedrock of the middle class in the postwar era, has been shattered. America\u2019s infrastructure is in disrepair, its education system badly underperforming, and its social contract in shambles. It has 4.5 percent of the world\u2019s population and about 20 percent of its gross domestic product, yet accounts for nearly 40 percent of the world\u2019s military expenditures.With Mr. Trump in the Oval Office, there may be some tough days ahead between China and the United States. Relations may nose-dive in the short run over trade, for example.But in the longer term, Chinese-American relations could become healthier as the Chinese prefer a relationship with a United States that doesn\u2019t try to remake the world. The Chinese know how to compete and can deal with competitors. What the Chinese have always resented and resisted is an America that imposes its values and standards on everybody else.Mr. Trump\u2019s America is likely to break from this pattern. He has shown no desire to tell other countries how to do things. China is run by competent leaders who are strong-minded and pragmatic. Mr. Trump is a resolute businessman with little ideological underpinning. Without the shackles of ideology, even the most competitive rivals can make deals. This is a new day for the world\u2019s most consequential bilateral relationship.The Obama pivot is failing. It was unable to produce a more peaceful Asia-Pacific region, and even America\u2019s closest ally in the region, the Philippines, is abandoning it. It was a project in costly global policing at the expense of American national interests.Beijing harbors no design to rival the United States for global dominance. But it is only natural that it seeks to reclaim a leading role in its Asia-Pacific neighborhood. China desires its own space to reach its development goals. At the same time, America with Mr. Trump as president needs to turn its attention to rebuilding itself.In the long term, Mr. Trump\u2019s America and China are more likely to work with each other than in any other period in recent memory.Eric Li is a venture capitalist and political scientist.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Threat to Close Door Reopens Old Wounds in Cuba", "Date": "2016-11-28", "News": "Supported byHAVANA \u2014 It seemed like a new chapter in a long and troubled history.But President-elect Donald J. Trump warned on Monday that the push to build ties with Cuba after decades of animosity could quickly be wiped away.Mr. Trump\u2019s message threatened to end one of President Obama\u2019s signature foreign policy initiatives. Mr. Obama\u2019s moves to relax restrictions on commerce, trade and financial transactions with Cuba were never part of a single \u201cdeal,\u201d but rather a decision that engagement with the island nation would bring more change than decades of isolation.Since then, the number of American visitors to Cuba has risen quickly, with hotels in Havana sometimes being booked nearly a year in advance, often with large American tour groups. Billions of dollars in goods from American stores like Walmart and Best Buy, financed on American credit cards, make their way to Cuba every year, experts estimate. Restaurants, cellphones and the internet have changed the rhythms and expectations of Cuban life.But critics have long attacked Mr. Obama, saying he gave too much to the Cubans too soon, without first demanding that they open up their society and usher in an era of political freedom.Now, after two years of presidential directives by Mr. Obama to strengthen ties with Cuba, and millions of dollars in American investments, a question remains: Can the d\u00e9tente be rolled back?Even some Obama administration officials concede that the thaw is highly vulnerable to reversal because much of it has been accomplished through executive action. Mr. Trump could, for example, order the State Department to review its decision last year to remove Cuba from the list of state sponsors of terrorism, or suspend diplomatic relations that were resumed last summer with the opening of embassies in Havana and Washington.But Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, argued on Monday that Mr. Trump would have a hard time reversing a policy that had already yielded business deals and benefited the people of both countries. There will soon be 110 daily flights from the United States to Cuba, he noted, not to mention the investments by cruise, tour and hotel operators to prepare for those visits.\u201cUnrolling all of that is much more complicated than just the stroke of a pen,\u201d Mr. Earnest said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s just not as simple as one tweet might make it seem.\u201dThe Cuban government remained uncharacteristically silent on similar threats Mr. Trump made during the campaign, choosing instead to issue a congratulatory note after his election. But when Mr. Trump takes office, and his words become policy, \u201cthe Cuban government will have to respond, but hopefully with moderation,\u201d said Ricardo Torres, a professor of economics at the University of Havana.Professor Torres said that there was much to be lost if the concessions were reversed, and that Havana would exercise restraint in its dealings with the Trump administration. But Mr. Trump\u2019s antagonistic posture could embolden those in the Cuban government who have always been suspicious of the Americans and were against the warming relations brokered by President Ra\u00fal Castro, Fidel\u2019s brother.\u201cThere\u2019s no question this is a bad start to things,\u201d Professor Torres said as thousands of students streamed by to bid goodbye to Fidel Castro, adding that Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cbelligerent attitude and animosity gives more reasons for suspicion and confirms the belief that this warming of relations wasn\u2019t real.\u201dMr. Trump has placed Mauricio Claver-Carone, a lobbyist who has been a harsh critic of Mr. Obama\u2019s opening to Cuba, on his transition team for the Treasury Department. Under Mr. Obama, the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, which handles sanctions, has issued several rounds of regulations to remove impediments for American companies and individuals seeking to do business with Cuba and to travel there.Human rights activists have long complained that the Cuban government simply shifted its strategy regarding political prisoners after Mr. Obama\u2019s d\u00e9tente. No longer are Cuban dissidents jailed for prolonged sentences, activists say. Instead, they are now rounded up for a few hours or a few days, according to the Cuban Human Rights and National Reconciliation Commission, which logs every detention.There were 9,125 detentions from January through October this year, the commission said \u2014 more than four times as many as in all of 2010. The highest number of arrests, 1,416, occurred in March, when Mr. Obama made his historic visit to Cuba, becoming the first sitting American president to do so in 88 years.\u201cTo be clear, the president-elect wants to see freedom in Cuba for Cubans,\u201d said Jason Miller, a spokesman for Mr. Trump.Still, Elizardo S\u00e1nchez, who runs the commission, said Mr. Obama\u2019s more open policy had helped more than it had hurt. \u201cThe personal contact that comes from all the travel has a huge impact in terms of fighting propaganda,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a closed society, the door can only be opened a bit at a time. It\u2019s going very slowly, but it\u2019s happening.\u201dOthers took Mr. Trump\u2019s words as an assault that threatened to restart the kind of hostilities that the thaw was meant to end.\u201cFor a lot of people, it is an open threat to our sovereignty and history,\u201d said Juan Alejandro Triana, also a professor at the University of Havana. \u201cIf the government of the president-elect threatens these things, we will respond.\u201dAnd yet, with the loss of Mr. Castro, Cuba\u2019s response would most likely be muted, and easier for the world to ignore. Without their leader, for many, Mr. Trump\u2019s comments seemed reminiscent of the longstanding policy of confrontation between the two nations.\u201cWe don\u2019t have anyone else like him right now,\u201d Randy Calderon, a biology student at Havana University, said of Mr. Castro as he stood in a crowd of thousands paying tribute on university grounds.Inside the law school, where Mr. Castro studied, a small shrine had been set up showing him as a student leader, with posters filled with comments from students, many expressing a desire for Mr. Castro to live forever as the country\u2019s \u201ceternal comandante.\u201dEven Cubans who challenge the ideology of \u201cFidelismo\u201d express support for some of the revolution\u2019s achievements, especially universal health care, and they often call for exactly the kind of hybrid of socialism and capitalism that the recent d\u00e9tente with the United States has expanded.Carlos Alzugaray Treto, a former Cuban diplomat, said the urgency to lock those changes into place had only intensified with Mr. Trump\u2019s victory. \u201cThat type of bullying won\u2019t work with Cuba,\u201d he said. \u201cMr. Trump should remember the main reason President Obama changed the policy and made the agreement with Ra\u00fal Castro: The previous policy had failed.\u201dFinancially speaking, the biggest and most immediate impact of reversing d\u00e9tente would be in the travel and hospitality sector in Cuba. The surge in American visitors to Cuba since the easing of travel restrictions has been a boon to hotels, transportation and the restaurant scene in Havana.Reversing some of Mr. Obama\u2019s decisions could be legally difficult. Companies like JetBlue, Starwood and Airbnb have invested millions of dollars in time and resources to enter the Cuban market, and did so with the American government\u2019s blessing.\u201cIn theory, Donald Trump has the ability to reverse almost everything Obama has done,\u201d said Matthew D. Aho, an adviser on Cuba at the New York office of the Akerman law firm. \u201cIn practice, that reversal would be far more complicated from a legal process than most observers realize.\u201dIn 2015, she saw her business increase by 50 percent, she said, the largest rise since she opened in 2010. For the most part, the increase was a result of American visitors, who now make up some 85 percent of her clientele.\u201cIt would be a major blow to us,\u201d Ms. Mart\u00ednez said of Mr. Trump\u2019s threats to reverse the d\u00e9tente. \u201cStill, while we really need the American market, it won\u2019t be the end of the world. We aren\u2019t going to die.\u201dThe debate is unfolding amid a fight among influential Cuban-Americans who are vying for the president-elect\u2019s ear. On one side are hard-liners who advocate clamping down on the relationship and insisting on concessions in exchange for any United States engagement. On the other is a growing group that is pressing for further opening.\u201cHe\u2019s surrounded by people who are only giving him one point of view \u2014 a very straight, hard-line approach that says we need to go back to the old approach \u2014 and it would be wise for him to be hearing the other side and the benefits of continuing to engage Cuba,\u201d said Carlos Gutierrez, a Republican former commerce secretary who heads the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s business council on Cuba. \u201cTo just get rid of that strikes me as going well overboard.\u201dAfter Mr. Castro\u2019s death, he added, Cubans \u201cwould feel like when they needed us most, we turned our backs on them.\u201dDamien Cave and Azam Ahmed reported from Havana, and Julie Hirschfield Davis from Washington.

{"Headline": "Fannie and Freddie\u2019s Status Continues to Provoke Criticisms", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "Supported byThe presidential campaign that just ended was notable for a lack of debate about housing \u2014 in particular the uneven state of the United States mortgage market nine years since the start of the financial crisis.Neither President-elect Donald J. Trump nor Hillary Clinton spent much time discussing housing policy, even though the financial crisis in the United States began with the collapse of home prices nationally. And neither candidate laid out a plan for dealing with the two biggest engines in the mortgage market \u2014 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 which remain under a controversial federal government conservatorship.Laurie Goodman, a longtime housing industry guru on Wall Street and now with a Washington research organization, said she did not think federal legislators would make it a priority to address the fates of Fannie and Freddie \u2014 two government-sponsored entities that were rescued by the Treasury eight years ago with a $187 billion taxpayer bailout.\u201cI am very pessimistic on G.S.E. reform,\u201d said Ms. Goodman, co-director of the Housing Finance Policy Center at the Urban Institute, referring to the government-sponsored enterprises, as Fannie and Freddie are known. \u201cI don\u2019t see the impetus for change.\u201dShe is not alone.There is a growing sense among housing policy experts that it may take another crisis \u2014 a recession or more big losses at the mortgage giants \u2014 to get the new president and Congress to come up with a more permanent way to handle the responsibilities now shouldered by Fannie and Freddie. Until then, it is very likely that both agencies will go on in a state of limbo: run by their own management teams, but with strict oversight by the relatively new Federal Housing Finance Agency.A handful of plans have been proposed for reforming Fannie and Freddie, the agencies whose prime responsibilities are to effectively guarantee 30-year mortgages, which are packaged into bonds. But none of those proposals have galvanized widespread support from legislators or the financial community, so the current unpopular conservatorship has been permitted to go on and on.Some favor merging Fannie and Freddie into a single entity, while others want to turn them into a government-run housing finance corporation \u2014 a mortgage finance utility of sorts. Others want to replace them with a number of smaller independent firms that will guarantee mortgages against default and maintain hefty regulatory oversight.And still others, mainly investors owning shares in Fannie and Freddie, want to see them recapitalized, set free and returned to the public markets as independent companies with minimal government control.\u201cPeople want to preserve the 30-year mortgage, they want private capital and they want to preserve a role for the small lender,\u201d said Ms. Goodman.But there is little consensus on what kind of ownership structure should prevail to achieve those goals. Ms. Goodman said gridlock and inertia were bad because they discourage innovation in the marketplace, which could make mortgages more widely available to consumers.Also, she said, there is the potential for Fannie and Freddie to become more \u201cpoliticized\u201d the longer they remain in conservatorship and de facto agents of the Treasury.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac got into hot water because they took on too much risk in the time leading up to the financial crisis.The companies, which were chartered by the federal government, operated as independent companies and largely made their own decisions about which 30-year mortgages to buy and guarantee against default.For decades, both entities were largely conservative about which mortgages to guarantee or buy for their own investment portfolios. But over time both became more aggressive in buying loans that turned out to be risky but were not considered traditional subprime loans at the time. The companies saw the value of those investments plummet when the housing market collapsed.The bailouts of both companies in September 2008 were viewed as a critical step to prevent an even greater financial calamity. But the conservatorship has grown controversial over time, particularly given that hedge funds and other investors continue to own shares in both of them.Over the last four years, as the economy has revived and much of the housing market has recovered, Fannie and Freddie began paying dividends to the federal government, leaving little behind for the company\u2019s private shareholders.To date, Fannie and Freddie have paid more than $250 billion in dividends to the federal government. The bailout has generated a profit for the Treasury.The fiercest critics of the conservatorship want Fannie and Freddie to keep much of any additional dividend payments and return to the public markets as independent entities \u2014 much like the way they operated before.Some hedge funds and institutional investors have sued the federal government over this issue, claiming it has deprived private investors of billions of dollars in potential profit by taking all the dividends paid out by Fannie and Freddie.The hedge funds and investors contend that the federal government is effectively profiting from the conservatorship at the expense of private shareholders.\u201cIt is frustrating these entities have been in conservatorship for eight years,\u201d said Tim Pagliara, chairman and chief executive of CapWealth Advisors, who heads a coalition of investors in Fannie and Freddie called Investors Unite. \u201cIt\u2019s like a cake that\u2019s been mixed and been refined, and all you have to do is add capital and put them back out because nothing else has worked.\u201dMr. Pagliara\u2019s organization regularly sends out news alerts to the media criticizing the conservatorship and the Treasury for continuing to take in dividends from the mortgage companies.Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with the Cowen Washington Research Group, said in a research note on Wednesday that Mr. Trump\u2019s election would most likely \u201copen the door for the government to return Fannie and Freddie to private ownership.\u201d But Mr. Seiberg does not foresee the companies returning \u201cto their former selves.\u201dSome say that allowing Fannie and Freddie to operate as they did before the crisis might prompt them again to expose the government to guaranteeing too many risky mortgages. The fear is that Fannie and Freddie will return to their old ways of trying to maximize profits at the expense of prudence.\u201cIf they are public companies, that would simply return them to the need to drive profits and increase risk-taking, and that\u2019s what created the problems in the first place,\u201d said Sam Khater, deputy chief economist at CoreLogic, a business analytics company.Still, finding a permanent fix for Fannie and Freddie will not address another problem confronting the housing market after the financial crisis: a paucity of small-dollar mortgages being underwritten by banks.Besides loans guaranteed by Fannie or Freddie, big banks have focused much of their lending on what are known as jumbo mortgages, home loans issued to wealthier borrowers with pristine credit histories who are borrowing more than $400,000.Jumbo mortgages are more profitable and less risky for banks than smaller loans.But the dynamic has left a huge void in the market for borrowers with limited incomes who are looking to buy a house with a mortgage for less than $100,000.Nationwide, in 2016, financial institutions operating in the largest metropolitan areas wrote 146,039 mortgages of $100,000 or less as of the end of August, according to CoreLogic. During that same time, lenders underwrote 1,475,637 mortgages of $100,000 or greater.The percentage of small-dollar mortgages being underwritten by banks is at its lowest level in at least a decade.The lack of mortgage credit for borrowers seeking smaller loans is a big problem in a troubled city like Detroit.The Urban Institute reports that the vast majority of homes sold in 2015 in Detroit were bought in all-cash deals. For all of last year, just 653 homes were bought with a mortgage in Detroit.This lack of small mortgages is helping to fuel a postcrisis revival in Detroit and elsewhere in seller-financed home sales \u2014 arrangements known as a contract for deed or a rent-to-own deal.However, these deals often are lacking in important consumer protections and have a long history of abuse.It is not known how many lower-income consumers are buying homes through a contract for deed because in many states, such as Michigan, there is no requirement for sellers to record such deals until title to the property is ultimately transferred.But RealtyTrac, a property data service, estimates that on average 20,000 homes a year have been sold nationally through contracts for deed since 2009, and the pace of deals has quickened since the crisis.\u201cWithout these small mortgages, sales evaporate, houses go to investors who have cash on hand, or families opt to use seller financing vehicles,\u201d said the Urban Institute in a recent report penned by Ms. Goodman and others at the organization.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Painful Steps Help Egypt Secure $12 Billion I.M.F. Loan", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported byCAIRO \u2014 The International Monetary Fund approved a $12 billion loan for Egypt on Friday, in a move intended to stave off economic collapse in the Arab world\u2019s most populous nation as it grapples with a plunging currency, soaring inflation and shortages of staple foods.The monetary fund signed off on the loan at a board meeting in Washington after Egypt raised $6 billion in external financing and agreed to significant economic changes, including allowing the currency to trade freely and reducing energy subsidies. Those measures, although painful, are intended to increase confidence in the government and attract foreign investment.The first installment of the loan, $2.75 billion, was immediately disbursed. Tarek Amer, the governor of the central bank, confirmed that it had been received Friday. The rest will be paid out over three years.But some economists warned that the monetary fund\u2019s loan was only the first of several painful yet urgently needed steps to stabilize Egypt\u2019s economy, and in the short term, conditions for ordinary Egyptians may continue to deteriorate, a worrisome prospect for the country\u2019s leader, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.Mr. Sisi has relied heavily on Saudi Arabia to bolster the economy, which started to tumble in 2011 during the uprising that overthrew President Hosni Mubarak. The Saudis and, to a lesser extent, other Persian Gulf countries have given Egypt $30 billion in aid over the past three years.Saudi Arabia did not send expected shipments of discounted petroleum products for October and November, and Egypt was forced to spend precious currency reserves to buy those products from other sources.Reluctantly, Egypt turned to the monetary fund.To meet the fund\u2019s requirements, the government agreed to painful policy changes that it had long avoided. It created a value-added tax. It raised the price of gasoline, to about 21 cents from 16 cents per liter \u2014 still extremely cheap, but expensive for low-paid Egyptians. It has progressively peeled back electricity subsidies.\u201cIf you look at what\u2019s happening, they are making the right choices,\u201d Mr. Blair said. Referring to fellow bankers, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be easy, but they are pleased that there is new thinking, which is what Egypt needed.\u201dBut the loan could imperil the Egyptian authorities, who have had to take steps that have created hardship across the country.Nearly all Egyptians have been affected by the economic crisis, from wealthy students who can no longer pay the rising tuition fees at private universities to families who can no longer afford basic foods like tomatoes.But on Friday, few Egyptians turned out for protests against the rising cost of living, which were called for before the announcement about the monetary fund\u2019s loan.Security forces in armored personnel carriers, including masked men carrying assault rifles, were deployed across Cairo and other parts of the country to discourage such demonstrations. Worshipers were sparse in mosques. Roads were nearly abandoned, and shops that are normally open on Friday remained closed.Hardships are likely to worsen in the near future for Egyptians. Inflation is likely to keep rising this year as the floating currency begins to push up the price of essential goods.The government recently rolled out social service programs that it says will increase assistance for the poor, but only five million Egyptians have benefited so far. One-quarter of the more than 90 million Egyptians live under the poverty line, and many more live hand to mouth.\u201cIt\u2019s only enough for food,\u201d said Olfa el-Sellami, a media adviser for the Social Solidarity Ministry, which oversees the program. \u201cThey can buy chicken, some ducks, some vegetables to sell, some sewing thread.\u201dThe monetary fund has said that it supports food subsidies and that the Egyptian government will try to increase aid and opportunities for the poor, including efforts to build public nurseries and provide vocational training for women.Despite the new loan, some economists expressed doubts that Egypt would be able to recover. Samer Atallah, a professor of economics at the American University in Cairo, suggested that it was unrealistic to expect that Mr. Sisi\u2019s government, which had ravaged the economy, would now save it.Mr. Atallah, noting the estimated $30 billion that Saudi Arabia and other gulf states had given Egypt, asked, \u201cWhere has it gone?\u201d\u201cThe policy instability, the corruption, the bureaucracy,\u201d Mr. Attallah said. \u201cWhen domestic investors are thinking twice, why would international investors come?\u201dNour Youssef contributed reporting from Cairo, and Declan Walsh from New York.Advertisement"}

And the clause says that \u201cno person holding any office of profit or trust\u201d shall \u201caccept of any present, emolument, office or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince or foreign state\u201d unless Congress consents.Two things were clear, he wrote. The Emoluments Clause \u201csurely\u201d applied to the president, and the prize, which included a check for about $1.4 million, was the sort of thing that would be barred if it came from a foreign state. In the end, however, Mr. Barron concluded that Mr. Obama could accept the prize because the committee that chose him was independent of the Norwegian government and the prize itself was privately financed.But he said that the answer would be different if a foreign government sought to make a payment to a sitting president. In a footnote, Mr. Barron added, \u201cCorporations owned or controlled by a foreign government are presumptively foreign states under the Emoluments Clause.\u201d\u201cWhenever Mr. Trump receives anything from a foreign sovereign, to the extent that it\u2019s not an arm\u2019s-length transaction,\u201d Mr. Eisen said, \u201cevery dollar in excess that they pay over the fair market price will be a dollar paid in violation of the Emoluments Clause and will be a present to Mr. Trump.\u201d\u201cThe reason we don\u2019t really have a lot of precedent here is that presidents in the past have gone out of their way to avoid getting even close to the Emoluments Clause,\u201d she said.But if Mr. Trump takes a different approach, it is not clear that anyone would have standing to challenge him in court.\u201cThere are a lot of very smart lawyers turning that question over in their minds today,\u201d Mr. Eisen said, adding that a business competitor injured by foreign favoritism toward a Trump company might have standing.\u201cIt\u2019s not there to protect a competitor,\u201d he said of the clause. \u201cIt\u2019s there to protect the United States government.\u201dThe way to address violations of the clause, Mr. Painter said, is not a lawsuit but impeachment.Lawmakers could take steps short of impeachment, particularly because the clause itself describes a role for Congress, which can give its consent to payments that would otherwise be barred. Mr. Painter said Congress should embrace that role by passing a resolution directed at Mr. Trump.He can accomplish some of his promises entirely on his own, but others require Congress or pose other significant obstacles.\u201cIt should send a clear message to him that he should divest his assets, and that they will regard dealings with his companies that he owns abroad and any entities owned by foreign governments as a potential violation of the Emoluments Clause unless he can prove it was an arm\u2019s-length transaction,\u201d he said.Professor Teachout agreed that Congress had \u201can institutional, constitutional obligation to make sure that Trump isn\u2019t violating this clause.\u201d\u201cYou would think the responsible action \u2014 Republican, Democrat, whatever,\u201d she said, \u201cwould be for Congress to say, \u2018We want to make sure that there isn\u2019t a violation of this clause, and in order to do so, we need to look at the transactions to make sure they\u2019re fair market transactions instead of gifts.\u2019 \u201d\u201cThat isn\u2019t to say that we shouldn\u2019t be concerned as a policy matter with Trump,\u201d Mr. Tillman said. \u201cI just want to see the conversation moved away from constitutionalizing what should be an argument about good governance.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve seen over and over how parts of the Constitution that were considered vestigial or irrelevant for decades or more can suddenly resurface and take on enormous importance with a quick change of events,\u201d Professor Wexler said.\u201cThe framers were prescient men who created a government that could withstand the worst of human foibles \u2014 corruption, vindictiveness, the thirst for tyranny \u2014 and wrote a Constitution to combat those foibles in many of their forms, not all of which will always be present, but which emerge in different guises in different eras,\u201d he said.Eric Lipton contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Expected to Seek Deep Cuts in Business Regulations", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byThe unwinding of Dodd-Frank. The firing up of shuttered coal plants. The rollback of rules that increase overtime pay for low-wage workers.Hours after Donald J. Trump won the race for the White House, scores of regulations that have reshaped corporate America in the last eight years suddenly seemed vulnerable.While many questions remain about how Mr. Trump will govern, a consensus emerged Wednesday in many circles in Washington and on Wall Street about at least one aspect of his impending presidency: Mr. Trump is likely to seek vast cuts in regulations across the banking, health care and energy industries.\u201cThis is going to be a president who will be the biggest regulatory reformer since Ronald Reagan,\u201d Stephen Moore, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic advisers said in an interview on Wednesday. \u201cThere are just so many regulations that could be eased.\u201dAlthough Mr. Trump is a maverick politician, his anti-regulation stance is that of an old-school Republican. It is driven by a belief that the economy will grow faster if businesses are freed from the long arm of the federal government.Or at least that is what some analysts and economists say they think is Mr. Trump\u2019s rationale. Even after a long campaign of endless rallies and debates, Mr. Trump and his closest advisers have disclosed relatively few specific economic policy proposals.And some of what he has proposed seems contradictory. For example, he has said he would roll back the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul, while his party platform calls for breaking up the big banks.Mr. Trump will probably find common ground with many Republicans in Congress, including Speaker Paul D. Ryan, on cutting regulation. They clashed during the campaign over Mr. Trump\u2019s past conduct toward women and inflammatory statements about ethnic groups, and many Republicans do not see eye to eye with Mr. Trump on immigration and trade.\u201cBut Ryan and Trump are like-minded on regulation in a way they are not on trade and immigration,\u201d said Ted Gayer, director of the economic studies program at the Brookings Institution and a former Treasury official under President George W. Bush. \u201cThat is red meat for both of them.\u201dHere is a rundown on how Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency could gut regulations from Wall Street to Silicon Valley:A clean Republican sweep of the White House and Congress would normally be greeted by loud cheers across Wall Street.But Mr. Trump\u2019s victory is not a clear boon for bankers and financiers in the way that past Republican wins have been.On paper, many of his campaign proposals appear to favor banks and investors, including a promise to undo Dodd-Frank, which was passed after the 2008 financial crisis.Yet repealing the law and its many rules seems unlikely to gain much traction in Congress. And even many banks admit they have spent so much time and money complying with the law, they would rather keep it.Several Obama administration officials said on Wednesday that they did not expect Congress to completely repeal Dodd-Frank. Instead of undertaking such a costly and controversial effort, one likely possibility is that the Trump administration and Congress would take aim at a handful of specific rules that most irritate the banks, including what is known as the Volcker Rule, a centerpiece of Dodd-Frank that prohibits banks from placing risky bets with their own money.Otherwise, many of the expected changes would benefit small and midsize banks rather than Wall Street banks. Regulators, for example, could raise the size at which a bank is subject to Dodd-Frank\u2019s enhanced oversight.Other pieces of Dodd-Frank could be picked off, like reining in the authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a hallmark of the Obama administration.Mr. Trump could prune other low-hanging financial regulations, including a newly enacted Department of Labor rule that holds investment advisers liable for certain advice to their clients.He also promised on the campaign trail to close the so-called carried interest tax loophole that increases the wealth of private equity executives.And Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign took aim at the honey pot of global banking revenue: free trade. For decades, banks have benefited from facilitating deals and lending to companies worldwide.\u201cProbably more so than any president in modern history it will be difficult to predict what issues he latches onto,\u201d said Aaron Klein, a former Treasury official in the Obama administration, who is now a fellow at the Brookings Institution.MICHAEL CORKERY, BEN PROTESS and LESLIE PICKERIn the energy industry, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s first targets, according to Mr. Moore, an economic adviser, is President Obama\u2019s effort to limit carbon emissions at coal-fired utilities.Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters say the rule drove coal companies into bankruptcy, even though the industry says that its problems are mostly caused by waning demand.It is unclear whether the election of Mr. Trump can help struggling coal miners get back their jobs, but it will almost certainly upend the world\u2019s efforts to curb the impact of global warming.While some legal and procedural roadblocks would impede a complete dismemberment of Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change regulations, a Trump administration could significantly weaken or slow them.Mr. Trump has said that he would do everything in his power to undo Mr. Obama\u2019s ambitious domestic and international climate change policies.Under the accord, Mr. Obama promised that the United States would cut emissions up to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025, largely through the Environmental Protection Agency regulations on coal-fired power plants.Mr. Trump could not immediately block the E.P.A. rules, but over the course of his administration he could ensure that they are weakened or rolled back. The rules are facing a legal challenge by 28 states and dozens of companies, and the case is expected to go before the Supreme Court as soon as next year. By appointing an industry-friendly Supreme Court justice and not arguing for the rules, Mr. Trump could weigh the court against them. He could also direct the E.P.A. to rewrite the regulations to be far more lax.A Trump administration could weaken, or even repeal, the rules governing fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards for new cars and trucks.Oil and natural gas executives are hopeful that Mr. Trump will deliver for them, too. They want a loosening of methane emission standards for existing oil wells and the opening of the long-delayed Keystone XL pipeline.\u201cI think he\u2019s going to make a big difference,\u201d said Darlene S. Wallace, president of Columbus Oil, an Oklahoma company.CORAL DAVENPORT, CLIFFORD KRAUSS and HIROKO TABUCHIAs income inequality and stagnant wages became a major preoccupation among voters, the Obama administration brought regulations and enforcement actions intended to increase the leverage of workers. Most of these efforts are now endangered by the prospect of a Republican president and Republican Congress.In theory, the regulation could be undone by the Trump administration through a rule-making process similar to the one that produced it. But this could take months, if not years. Instead, some lobbyists expect Congress to pass a legislative compromise that would rein in the overtime rule, by phasing it in over a number of years, and by limiting or undoing the automatic upward adjustment in the salary threshold every three years.Mr. Obama enacted a number of other policies through executive order rather than a more involved rule-making process, and these could be undone by a President Trump almost immediately, with the stroke of a pen. These include rules that increased the minimum wage and granted paid sick days to workers hired by federal contractors.Trump administration appointees could quickly reject such interpretations and enforce the law differently, said Marc Freedman of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Mr. Trump\u2019s appointees to the N.L.R.B. could easily reverse such rulings.NOAM SCHEIBERThe idea of a Trump presidency triggered a sense of dread among many people in the liberal-leaning technology business.Mr. Trump is seen as less favorably disposed toward the concentration of power among the handful of large companies that dominate the internet, including Facebook, Google and Amazon, said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, an online real estate firm\u201cI think Donald Trump may be facile with Twitter but mostly feels hostility towards these companies and their size,\u201d Mr. Kelman said.During the campaign, Mr. Trump told an audience in May that \u201cwe\u2019re going get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country, instead of in other countries.\u201dMany technology executives have called that idea far-fetched since most of Apple\u2019s supply chain, including many of its parts makers, are in Asia.Mr. Trump also blasted Jeffrey P. Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, saying that he was using the political influence of The Washington Post, which Mr. Bezos owns, to discourage government action against Amazon on tax and antitrust issues.And Mr. Trump has called for the rejection of AT&T\u2019s bid for Time Warner.Still, analysts expect that he will appoint antitrust regulators at the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department who will largely follow traditional Republican approaches to the free market.Craig Berman, a spokesman for Amazon, declined to comment.Mr. Trump will be under pressure by major telecom and cable firms to roll back aspects of net neutrality. The rule inhibits how broadband providers manage traffic on their networks to ensure any website is equally accessible to consumers.Telecom and cable firms continue to challenge the rules in court and Mr. Trump, with the encouragement of Republicans in Congress, may seek to abandon the regulation.NICK WINGFIELD, VINDU GOEL and CECILIA KANG\u201cThe truth is, who knows?\u201d said Ron Cohen, chief executive of Acorda Therapeutics and the chairman of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, an industry trade group. \u201cWe still have to deal with the basic issues that are confronting us as an industry, and those have not changed just because of an election.\u201dOutrage over the rising cost of prescription drugs has spiked in recent years as Americans struggle to pay for their medicines. Egregious examples of price increases, like those on Mylan\u2019s EpiPen and older drugs sold by Valeant Pharmaceuticals, prompted congressional hearings and investigations.At the same time, the drug industry has gone to war with insurers and employers who pay for their workers\u2019 health coverage. Those dynamics, several people said, have not changed, and outrage over high drug prices is seen as a bipartisan issue.Nonetheless, Mr. Trump placed less emphasis on the issue than Mrs. Clinton did during the campaign.KATIE THOMASAdvertisement"}

There, amid exposed wiring and heating ducts, his playful nerd side (Donkey Kong Jr. arcade game) flourished amid works from his artisans (Miller\u2019s I Was Here table, plaster trees by David Wiseman) and iconic pieces by trendsetters of international design (a Moooi sofa and a Timorous Beasties carpet adorned with giant iguanas). \u201cIt was real and it was good, you know? It was me,\u201d he says.Alhadeff is both fanboy and mentor. While he\u2019s still the self-effacing motormouth who rides his bike everywhere, it can take him years to cultivate relationships with those whose work he shows and to be confident that the work will intrigue his core buyers, the architects and decorators whose rarefied clients long for the shock of the new. \u201cWe brainstorm, push and pull each other, talk constantly,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m sure I drive people a little crazy.\u201dWith his increasingly expansive vision came a change in residence as well, in June, to Manhattan. Instead of opting for one of the many amenity-rich new developments, Alhadeff and his partner, Jason Duzansky, who is the art director at the studio of the photographer Steven Meisel, gut-renovated a 1,300-square foot co-op on the Lower East Side. The architecturally undistinguished complex was built in the 1950s, financed partly by the International Ladies\u2019 Garment Workers\u2019 Union, as a middle-class cooperative, and although it\u2019s now spruced up, like much of Lower Manhattan, the buildings are still home to plenty of original tenants, now elderly, whose design ethos is more bric-a-brac than Bauhaus. \u201cAs always,\u201d says Alhadeff, \u201cit\u2019s about the mix.\u201dGone are the pink walls of Williamsburg, replaced by various shades of green, some silvery, some mossy and deep. There are vintage pieces he bought at auction, including Pierre Cardin suede sling chairs at the dining table and a Chinese Deco rug, but many of the objects in his home track the Future Perfect\u2019s evolution, and thus both the birth of Brooklyn style and the history of how America came to be taken seriously in 21st-century high design. He still has the I Was There table and Matt Gagnon\u2019s 2005 acrylic lamp made from hardboard. Above a sofa hangs the limited-edition Meissen baboon mask that once held a place of honor near the giant exposed fuse box in his Williamsburg living room. In the entryway, an iconic Cherry Bomb chandelier by Lindsey Adelman (still among his closest friends) illuminates a black-stained timber Rooms console from a recent collection. It is placed against a stretch of vividly impressionistic wall covering from Dimore.Alhadeff may have left Brooklyn as it outgrew its bohemian ethos, but you can never quite squeeze the borough out of the boy, it seems. In addition to finding a Manhattan apartment as close to Brooklyn as you can get without actually living there \u2014 right on the East River, with 180-degree views from the wraparound terrace \u2014 he can\u2019t quite let go of the Williamsburg loft. There it sits, largely unoccupied, a bubblegum-hued monument to a bygone era. \u201cI just like to know it\u2019s there,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s cheap, remember, like Brooklyn was. And so much happened there. Just thinking of all that makes me happy.\u201dTop image: David Alhadeff\u2019s living room includes a sculpture by Stan Bitters, a ceramic stool by Reinaldo Sanguino, vintage chairs by Achille Castiglioni and a Chinese Art Deco rug bought at auction.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Team Shows Few Signs of Post-Election Moderation", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported byTransition Briefing President-elect Donald J. Trump is picking up the pace with his cabinet and top White House staff choices, and despite the fervent wishes of some Democrats that views expressed during the campaign would be moderated after the election, the new administration\u2019s team is maintaining a decidedly conservative bent. Up next, secretary of defense?James N. Mattis, a retired Marine Corps general, will meet the president-elect at Mr. Trump\u2019s New Jersey country club on Saturday to discuss the post of defense secretary, according to two people close to the transition team.Conservatives this spring had wooed General Mattis to run for president as an independent as they sought an alternative to Mr. Trump. While he was receptive to the idea, he ultimately decided against running. \u201cThe thoughtfulness and patriotism \u2014 and for that matter, the modesty \u2014 Jim showed as he reflected on this decision make me more convinced than ever that he would have made a truly admirable president, and also a good candidate,\u201d William Kristol, the editor of the conservative Weekly Standard, wrote at the time.General Mattis, 66, is widely respected in the military community and could bring with him a top-notch staff of civilian experts. He was the head of the United States Central Command, which oversees all military operations in the Middle East, from 2010 to 2013 but crossed swords with President Obama over his push for a more aggressive presence in the Persian Gulf.Under federal law, a former military official must be out of uniform for seven years to become defense secretary. General Mattis retired three years ago, and Congress would have to grant him a waiver.But General Mattis is not the only candidate. Senator Tom Cotton, the hawkish military veteran from Arkansas, was in Trump Tower on Friday and is still in the hunt.On the one hand, he said: \u201cI\u2019m not a white nationalist, I\u2019m a nationalist. I\u2019m an economic nationalist.\u201dOn the other hand, Michael Wolff wrote:\u201cDarkness is good,\u201d says Bannon, who amid the suits surrounding him at Trump Tower, looks like a graduate student in his T-shirt, open button-down and tatty blue blazer \u2014 albeit a 62-year-old graduate student. \u201cDick Cheney. Darth Vader. Satan. That\u2019s power. It only helps us when they\u201d \u2014 I believe by \u201cthey\u201d he means liberals and the media, already promoting calls for his ouster \u2014 \u201cget it wrong. When they\u2019re blind to who we are and what we\u2019re doing.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s association with Mr. Bannon has been widely criticized because of racist conspiracy theories promoted on Breitbart.com, the right-wing news website that Mr. Bannon was managing before joining Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.Mr. Bannon said in the interview that he expected Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency would unsettle Republicans and Democrats alike with his aggressive and unconventional plans for rebuilding the country.\u201cI\u2019m the guy pushing a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan,\u201d Mr. Bannon said. \u201cWith negative interest rates throughout the world, it\u2019s the greatest opportunity to rebuild everything.\u201dPredicting a change that will outshine the Reagan revolution, he added: \u201cShip yards, iron works, get them all jacked up. We\u2019re just going to throw it up against the wall and see if it sticks.\u201dHe didn\u2019t get attorney general. He\u2019s still in the running for secretary of state, though the Trump team has let it be known that the former Trump nemesis Mitt Romney will be meeting with the president-elect to discuss that job.So where is Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York and stalwart Trump loyalist?Spotted in Palm Beach, where he says he needs some rest.But don\u2019t count him out. When asked whether Mr. Giuliani was a favorite to become secretary of state, Representative Devin Nunes of California, a member of the transition team\u2019s executive committee, said he did not want to speculate. But Mr. Nunes lavished praised on Mr. Giuliani.\u201cHe would absolutely be a great secretary of state \u2014 he\u2019s America\u2019s mayor, is widely respected around the world and is a fine example of the type of person we want representing us abroad,\u201d Mr. Nunes said.Senator Chuck Schumer, the incoming minority leader, announced on Friday that Mr. Van Hollen would serve as chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee for the 2018 cycle.\u201cChris Van Hollen was our first choice for D.S.C.C. chairman because of his talents, his work ethic and his experience,\u201d Mr. Schumer said in a statement. \u201cThe map is tough for Democrats, but I have no doubt that Senator-elect Van Hollen is up to the task.\u201dTough indeed: Democrats gained a mere two Senate seats on Election Day \u2014 New Hampshire and Illinois \u2014 and will be defending a daunting 23 seats in 2018, as well as two held by independents who caucus with them \u2014 Angus King of Maine and Bernie Sanders of Vermont \u2014 and roughly half of those states were won by President-elect Trump.In contrast, Democrats have one real target, Senator Dean Heller of Nevada, and maybe two with Jeff Flake of Arizona if things go south for the new president.(Of note, Mr. Van Hollen knows the highs and lows of the job, having led the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee for his party\u2019s 2008 wave, then getting washed out in the 2010 Republican deluge.)A list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.For anyone hoping for tempers to cool and partisans to moderate, welcome to the rest of 2016.Conservative groups are ecstatic. The Trump transition team hailed Mr. Sessions as a champion of civil rights.\u201cSenator Sessions is someone who\u2019s universally respected across party lines in the United States Senate,\u201d said Jason Miller, a Trump transition spokesman.The other side?Some Democrats kept their immediate challenges minimal for Mr. Pompeo.As for General Flynn?Vice President-elect Mike Pence told the news media on Friday that teams of transition staff members who will be working directly with federal agencies had arrived in Washington.\u201cThe president-elect is a man of action, and we\u2019ve got a great number of men and women with great qualifications looking forward to serving in this administration, and I am just humbled to be a part of it,\u201d Mr. Pence said.He added, \u201cI am very confident it will be a smooth transition that will serve to lead this country forward and make America great again.\u201dMr. Pence walked away as a reporter asked whether the Alt-Right was racist.Mr. Pompeo, the president-elect\u2019s pick to direct the C.I.A., may also be a way for Mr. Trump to warm relations with the Koch Industries directors Charles G. and David H. Koch.The Koch brothers \u2014 among the biggest players in financing Republican candidates nationwide \u2014 remained largely on the sidelines in this year\u2019s presidential race.Mr. Pompeo has been a staunch proponent of bringing newly captured terrorism suspects to the prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, for interrogation and open-ended detention, as President Obama has refused to do. At a 2013 congressional hearing, Mr. Pompeo called the prison operation in Cuba lawful and humane, and dismissed a hunger strike among the detainees at the time as a \u201cpolitical stunt.\u201d\u201cWe are still engaged in a counterterrorism battle all around the globe that continue to need to have a secure location in which to detain captured enemy combatants remains,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said.Mr. Pompeo has also been a defender of broad government surveillance programs and an opponent of limits the Obama administration imposed after the leaks of the former intelligence contractor Edward J. Snowden. Those included the U.S.A. Freedom Act, which ended the National Security Agency\u2019s once-secret program that collected Americans\u2019 domestic calling records in bulk and replaced it with a system in which the government has to get a court order to obtain specific records from phone companies.Mr. Pompeo was a prominent member of the special House committee that investigated the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya. Although the panel found no new evidence of wrongdoing by the Obama administration or Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Mr. Pompeo and another conservative member of the committee, Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, were convinced of a wider cover-up. When the committee released its findings in June, the two Republicans filed their own 48-page addendum that was far harsher.The addendum said that the attacks showed that the State Department was \u201cseemingly more concerned with politics and Secretary Clinton\u2019s legacy than with protecting its people in Benghazi.\u201d\u201cWith the presidential election just 56 days away, rather than tell the American people the truth and increase the risk of losing an election, the administration told one story privately and a different story publicly,\u201d they concluded.Trey Gowdy, the committee\u2019s chairman and no shrinking violet when it came to Mrs. Clinton, did not put his name on the addendum.The president-elect made quite a boast on Twitter on Thursday.Followed by:The only wrinkle: Ford was never planning to move the plant.During the campaign, Mr. Trump repeatedly criticized Ford for moving production to Mexico, and he threatened to impose a 35 percent tariff on vehicles made there.Ford makes the Lincoln MKC, a sport utility vehicle, at a factory in Louisville. Last week, Ford said it planned to move production of the vehicle elsewhere. But Ford had not planned to close the Louisville factory. Instead, it had planned to expand production of another vehicle made in Louisville, the Ford Escape. And the change had not been expected to result in any job losses.\u201cWhatever happens in Louisville, it will not lose employment,\u201d Jimmy Settles, a union official, told The Detroit Free Press. \u201cThey cannot make enough Escapes.\u201dBinyamin Appelbaum and Jennifer Steinhauer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

That\u2019s why.\u201dA Law Department spokesman declined to reply to a list of questions about the contract.Dan Levitan, a spokesman for Mr. de Blasio\u2019s 2013 and 2017 campaigns, said the mayor and his aides acted \u201cethically and appropriately at all times.\u201d Mr. Levitan said no public money had been spent to defend the 2013 campaign or the mayor\u2019s political nonprofit, Campaign for One New York, which is at the center of some of the investigations. He declined to say how much non-city money had been spent to defend them. \u201cWe hope that the investigations, which have now lasted over seven months, will draw to a close,\u201d Mr. Levitan said in an email.The costs are set out in the contract and are commensurate with rates charged by other top city firms: $850 an hour for work by partners, $650 an hour for counsel, $575 an hour for associates and $175 for paralegals and other staff. A spokesman for the comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, whose office approves most city contracts, declined to comment on whether the spending was appropriate or on other aspects of the contract, which is currently under review by his office. Of the total cost of $10 million, $2 million is for the 2016 fiscal year, with the rest to be spent in the 2017 fiscal year, the documents show.A Nov. 14 memo from the Law Department included with the contract said that because of \u201csevere time constraints,\u201d the firm had commenced work before the contract was officially registered, but that it had \u201cnot yet been paid.\u201dIn the more than 80 pages of documents in the filing, the mayor\u2019s name is not mentioned in connection with the matter. And only once is the nature of the John Doe Investigation hinted at: in a letter from the Law Department to Mr. Fishbein, which describes the inquiry as being \u201cconducted by the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the Southern District of New York, the Department of Investigation and other entities.\u201d The letter says the firm would represent city employees \u2014 and \u201cthe employees of other entities the city has agreed to represent and/or defend\u201d \u2014 in interviews or if subpoenaed to give grand jury testimony.Asked on Friday if he had been interviewed by federal authorities, Mr. de Blasio had a simple response: \u201cNo.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mary Jo White to Step Down as S.E.C. Chief", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "Supported byWall Street regulators began an exodus from Washington on Monday as Mary Jo White, the chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, announced plans to leave the agency.The decision makes Ms. White, a former federal prosecutor who has served more than two decades in the federal government, the first major Obama administration appointee to step down after Donald J. Trump\u2019s upset victory last week. Other financial regulators are expected to follow suit in the coming weeks.The election of Mr. Trump is a game-changer for the S.E.C. \u2014 and for that matter, all financial agencies.Ms. White was expected to leave no matter the outcome of the election. But many Democrats had hoped that if Hillary Clinton won, she would choose a strong proponent of regulation to succeed Ms. White, whose policies often reflected a political middle ground. Now, the agency is almost certain to be pushed to the right.Mr. Trump has vowed to dismantle Dodd-Frank, the financial regulatory overhaul Congress passed in response to the 2008 financial crisis. And although Dodd-Frank will more likely be watered down than repealed, his appointments will no doubt shift the tone and priorities across financial regulatory agencies.The president-elect\u2019s biggest move on Wall Street could be his choice for Treasury secretary. Mr. Trump\u2019s short list is said to include Steven Mnuchin, an investment manager and former Goldman Sachs partner who was Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign finance chairman, and Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.Mr. Hensarling is still being considered, in part because of pressure from Congress, but Mr. Mnuchin is the favorite of Mr. Trump\u2019s Wall Street backers, according to someone with direct knowledge but who was not authorized to speak publicly. A decision is expected within 10 days.Either way, the Trump Treasury Department might rein in the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a collection of regulators who examine financial risks and designate companies as systemically important. The Treasury secretary is chairman of the council and could effectively defang it, according to Ian Katz, a policy analyst at Capital Alpha who predicted that the council might essentially become \u201ca quarterly kaffeeklatsch.\u201dMr. Trump was elected at a pivotal time for the S.E.C., an agency that had already turned a corner under Ms. White. Unlike Mary L. Schapiro, who inherited a scandal-plagued S.E.C. after the financial crisis, Ms. White needed not to save the agency, but to modernize it, a task that the next administration also will face.Ms. White\u2019s departure, which will take effect at the end of the Obama administration in January, will set off speculation about whom Mr. Trump will select to succeed her. Though such talks have barely begun, the field of potential contenders could include Michael S. Piwowar, a Republican commissioner at the agency.Paul S. Atkins, a former S.E.C. Republican commissioner who has advocated deregulatory policies, is leading Mr. Trump\u2019s effort to select a new chair for the agency and could be a candidate. Anthony Scaramucci, a hedge fund manager who supported Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy, is also advising the transition team.\u201cAs the head of the S.E.C., you\u2019ve got to get back into reffing the game properly and end the demonization of Wall Street,\u201d Mr. Scaramucci said in an interview last week before his appointment to Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team.As other of President Obama\u2019s financial regulators step down, the firewall around his Wall Street legacy will start to crumble. Timothy Massad, the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, is expected to leave by early 2017, though he could briefly stay at the agency as a Democratic commissioner.An even bigger change could occur at the banking regulators \u2014 the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency \u2014 which became a thorn in the side of Wall Street under President Obama. Martin J. Gruenberg and Thomas Curry, the leaders of the F.D.I.C. and O.C.C., will probably leave office next year when their terms expire, or possibly even sooner.Before President Obama named Mary Jo White to run the Securities and Exchange Commission, she was the top federal prosecutor in New York City.Daniel Tarullo, the Federal Reserve governor who oversees many of the central bank\u2019s regulatory efforts, is not expected to serve out his term through early 2022. He could leave early next year, which would deliver a blow to proponents of Wall Street regulation.With turnover at the S.E.C., Ms. White\u2019s legacy could be in jeopardy as well.She oversaw a record number of enforcement actions and directed a rapid pace of rule-writing based not only on Dodd-Frank, but on regulations of her own making. Those initiatives were aimed at improving money market fund regulation and the broader asset management industry.\u201cI think what we\u2019ve done so far has been quite transformative and really modernized that core responsibility,\u201d Ms. White said in a recent interview.Yet Ms. White has not completed more than a dozen rules, nor has she formalized a plan to require that financial advisers act in their clients\u2019 best interests. Now that these initiatives will fall into the hands of a Republican chairman, they may come off the agenda.As it was, Ms. White, a political independent, drew criticism from liberal lawmakers who view her as the quintessential moderate. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who channels the populist outrage over Wall Street excess, even called on President Obama to designate a new S.E.C. leader because the agency had not required companies to disclose political contributions.In her first public remarks on the subject, Ms. White said in an interview that the criticism \u201creally does come with the territory.\u201d\u201cI think I\u2019m a very constructive recipient of constructive criticism,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s not like you like people to beat on your head, whoever they are, however baseless it is.\u201dBefore the S.E.C., Ms. White was the first woman to become United States attorney in Manhattan, one of the most apolitical jobs in government. Earning a reputation as a tenacious prosecutor with an independent streak, Ms. White embraced the joke that her office was the United States attorney for the \u201csovereign,\u201d rather than Southern, district of New York.\u201cShe\u2019s not motivated by any special interest,\u201d said Preet Bharara, a prosecutor under Ms. White who is now the United States attorney in Manhattan. \u201cPeople may disagree from time to time, and, in fact, in any high-stakes environment, it would be unnatural if there weren\u2019t disagreement from special interests and adversaries. But she\u2019s hyper smart and makes a decision immune from any political wind or political criticism, and I think that\u2019s a good way to be.\u201dMs. White\u2019s prosecutorial experience \u2014 she supervised the original investigation into Osama bin Laden \u2014 raised expectations for her enforcement agenda at the S.E.C.And in its last fiscal year, the agency brought a record 548 stand-alone enforcement actions. In conjunction with Andrew J. Ceresney, the agency\u2019s enforcement director, Ms. White reversed the S.E.C.\u2019s longstanding yet unofficial policy of allowing companies to neither admit nor deny wrongdoing. Seventy-three such admissions have been made since.Other \u201cfirsts\u201d occurred under Ms. White and Mr. Ceresney: the first action against a major ratings firm, Standard & Poor\u2019s, and the first action against a company, KBR Inc., for inserting overly restrictive confidentiality agreements that could stifle whistle-blowers. Some of the agency\u2019s most novel cases came against private equity firms that failed to disclose fees and conflicts of interest.Ms. White is known for keeping a workaholic\u2019s schedule. Colleagues said it was common for her to hold a 9 p.m. Sunday conference call, before dispatching middle-of-the night emails and placing a 5:30 a.m. call to senior staff.But she also promoted staff morale by holding coffee and doughnut sessions. Every holiday season, she would give a party for her staff at Rosa Mexicano restaurant, where she would hand out gifts to each of her aide\u2019s children.Ms. White, a partial Yankees season ticket holder whose favorite moment as S.E.C. chairwoman came when throwing out the first pitch at a Washington Nationals game, said her dream job would be the first female baseball commissioner.\u201cI really don\u2019t think about what I\u2019m doing next until I\u2019m done,\u201d she said, except, \u201cIf you have baseball commissioner to offer me, then I can tell you what my plans are.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Crowds Line Up at India\u2019s Banks to Exchange Banned Rupee Notes", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byNEW DELHI \u2014 Thousands of security forces were deployed on Thursday to keep the peace at India\u2019s banks, where crowds of people had formed jittery, snaking lines in the early morning, desperate to exchange now-useless currency notes.For the next two weeks, citizens will be able to exchange 4,000 rupees a day, or about $60. But they will have difficulty converting large cash holdings because they will have to declare them to the tax authorities. Money that cannot be exchanged will be, as officials put it, \u201cextinguished.\u201dThe plan, top secret until Mr. Modi\u2019s announcement, was hailed by financial analysts as bold and potentially transformational for India. It is also a high-stakes experiment: Though other Indian leaders have withdrawn currency notes, none have reduced the country\u2019s supply of cash so drastically or so abruptly. The two bills being withdrawn make up 80 percent of the cash in circulation.Many people on the street this week said they were stunned and angry. Brawls broke out in lines outside banks, where many had to stand for hours, uncertain whether the stockpile of bills would run out.We want to hear from those living in India on Mr. Modi\u2019s move, and the impact it has had on you and your family.\u201cI am in a very foul mood, and for business, this government is not good at all,\u201d said Ayush Singhal, 26, a trader in packing tape, whose shop was all but deserted after the currency was withdrawn. The Old Delhi wholesale market, one of the largest in Asia, operates almost entirely on a cash basis, Mr. Singhal said.\u201cWe have to figure out some other way of conducting business,\u201d Mr. Singhal said, his face grave. \u201cFor now, I am at a loss for words.\u201dPoor migrants to the city said the sudden move had stranded them without enough money to eat.Umeshwar Prasad Rao, a farmer, had traveled hundreds of miles to New Delhi so that his daughter could have an operation, carrying his life savings of 10,000 rupees in 500-rupee notes.Because he did not have a government identification card, Mr. Rao could not exchange the money for usable notes. By midday on Thursday his family had consumed nothing but tea. Scores of families sprawled on the sidewalk around the hospital, with similar complaints.\u201cI am at my wits\u2019 end,\u201d Mr. Rao said. He was hoping to get food from a charity. \u201cOtherwise, we will be fasting,\u201d he said.The people who help others unload \u201cblack money\u201d were doing a booming business. Gold merchants saw the price for 10 ounces of gold nearly double, so eager were customers to dispose of their large bills.Nishant Verma, who runs a family jewelry shop, kept his doors open until 1 a.m. two nights in a row to accommodate what he called a \u201cmad rush.\u201dBut the busiest of all were money launderers \u2014 small-timers who converted stacks of 1,000-rupee bills to 100-rupee notes for a 500-rupee fee; and larger-scale cash-on-hand firms, which provide companies with cash for undeclared payments, or bribes, registering the sum as a loan or an advance.Other businesses might backdate the receipts, suggesting that the invalid bills were exchanged before Mr. Modi\u2019s announcement, said Ajay Shah, a professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy. \u201cThere is infinite ingenuity out there,\u201d he said.Hospitals and crematories, which are exempted from the ban, may also turn a profit by exchanging large numbers of bills for a fee. Laborers also made money on Thursday by standing in lines at banks, saving the places of more wealthy people who preferred to use their time in other ways.Mr. Modi had warned that the public might suffer \u201ctemporary hardships\u201d during the period when the now-invalid bills are exchanged for new ones. Businesses likely to lose the most are real estate agencies, doctors\u2019 offices and other professionals who demand cash transactions.Experts said a period of disruption was a small price to pay to drain the informal economy. Global Financial Integrity, a Washington policy group, has estimated that India lost $344 billion in illicit outflows of money in the decade leading up to 2011.As the week progressed, though, some analysts began to express worry that the abrupt monetary shock would ripple through the economy, weakening consumer demand.Ila Patnaik, an economist, warned in an editorial in the Indian Express newspaper that payments are now likely to be held up and purchases likely to be postponed, potentially damaging the economy in 2016 and 2017.\u201cAs long as things are going fine, we tend to ignore money,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut when money is disrupted, this imposes a substantial disruption upon the working of the economy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Climate Change in Trump\u2019s Age of Ignorance", "Date": "2016-11-19", "News": "Supported byOpinionStanford, Calif. \u2014 THE good news got pretty much drowned out this month: Yes, 2016 is on track to become the hottest year on record, but thankfully also the third year in a row to see relatively flat growth in global greenhouse gas emissions. With global economic growth on the order of 3 percent a year, we may well have turned a corner toward a sustainable climate economy.The bad news, of course, is that the world\u2019s wealthiest nation, home to many of the scholars scrambling to reverse global warming, has elected a new president with little or no interest in the topic. Or an active disinterest. Donald J. Trump is surrounding himself with advisers who are likely to do little to challenge his notion of climate change as a Chinese hoax. People like to think of us as living in an age of information, but a better descriptor might be \u201cthe age of ignorance.\u201dHow did we get into this predicament? Why are we about to inaugurate the most anti-science administration in American history?As a graduate student at Harvard in the 1970s and early 1980s, I was astonished to find how little concern there was for the beliefs of ordinary Americans. I was in the history of science department, where all the talk was of Einstein and Darwin and Newton, with the occasional glance at the \u201creception\u201d of such ideas in the larger literate populace.How the president-elect deals with climate change could make him the man who shrunk America or the man who helped save the planet.I had grown up in a small town in Texas, and later in Kansas City, where the people I knew often talked about nature and God\u2019s glory and corruption and the good life. At Harvard, though, I was puzzled that my professors seemed to have little interest in people outside the vanguard, the kinds of people I had come from, many of whom were fundamentalist Christians, people of solid faith but often in desperate conditions. Why was there so little interest in what they thought or believed? That\u2019s Point 1.Point 2: Early in my career as a historian, I was further bothered by how little attention was given to science as an instrument of popular deception. We like to think of science as the opposite of ignorance, the light that washes away the darkness, but there\u2019s much more to that story.Here my Harvard years were more illuminating. I got into a crowd of appropriately radicalized students, and started to better understand the place of science in the arc of human history. I learned about how science has not always been the saving grace we like to imagine; science gives rise as easily to nuclear bombs and bioweapons as to penicillin and the iPad. I taught for several years in the biology department, where I learned that cigarette makers had been giving millions of dollars to Harvard and other elite institutions to curry favor.I also started understanding how science could be used as an instrument of deception \u2014 and to create or perpetuate ignorance. That is important, because while scholars were ignoring what Karl Marx dismissively called \u201cthe idiocy of rural life\u201d (Point 1), tobacco and soft drink and oil companies facing taxation and regulation were busily disseminating mythologies about their products, to keep potential regulators at bay (Point 2).The denialist conspiracy of the cigarette industry was crucial in this context, since science was one of the instruments used by Big Tobacco to carry out its denial (and distraction) campaign. Cigarette makers had met at the Plaza Hotel in New York City on Dec. 14, 1953, to plan a strategy to rebut the evidence that cigarettes were causing cancer and other maladies. The strategy was pure genius: The claim would be that it had not been \u201cproved\u201d that cigarettes really cause disease, so there was room for honest doubt. Cigarette makers promised to finance research to get to the truth, while privately acknowledging (in a notorious Brown & Williamson document from 1969) that \u201cDoubt is our product.\u201dFor decades thereafter, cigarette makers poured hundreds of millions of dollars into basic biomedical research, exploring things like genetic and viral or occupational causes of cancer \u2014 anything but tobacco. Research financed by the industry led to over 7,000 publications in peer-reviewed medical literature and 10 Nobel Prizes. Including consulting relationships, my research shows that at least 25 Nobel laureates have taken money from the cigarette industry over the past half-century. (Full disclosure: I\u2019ve testified against that industry in dozens of tobacco trials.)Now we know that many other industries have learned from Big Tobacco\u2019s playbook. Physicians hired by the National Football League have questioned the evidence that concussions can cause brain disease, and soda sellers have financed research to deny that sugar causes obesity. And climate deniers have conducted a kind of scavenger hunt for oddities that appear to challenge the overwhelming consensus of climate scientists.This latter fact might be little more than a historical quirk, were it not for the fact that we\u2019ll soon have a president whose understanding of science is more like that of the people in the towns where I grew up than those scholars who taught me about Darwin and Einstein at Harvard.We now live in a world where ignorance of a very dangerous sort is being deliberately manufactured, to protect certain kinds of unfettered corporate enterprise. The global climate catastrophe gets short shrift, largely because powerful fossil fuel producers still have enormous political clout, following decades-long campaigns to sow doubt about whether anthropogenic emissions are really causing planetary warming. Trust in science suffers, but also trust in government. And that is not an accident. Climate deniers are not so much anti-science as anti-regulation and anti-government.Part of the strategy, according to Mr. Nesbit, who worked for a group involved in the effort and witnessed firsthand the beginning of this devil\u2019s dance, was to sow doubt by corrupting expertise, while simultaneously capturing the high ground of open-mindedness and even caution itself, with the deceptive mantra: \u201cWe need more research.\u201d Much of the climate denial now embraced by people like Mr. Trump was first expressed in the disinformation campaigns of Big Oil \u2014 campaigns modeled closely on Big Tobacco\u2019s strategies.We sometimes hear that those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it, but a \u201crepeat\u201d is perhaps now the least of our worries. Judging purely from his transition team, Mr. Trump\u2019s administration could be more hostile to modern science \u2014 and especially earth and environmental sciences \u2014 than any we have ever had. Whole agencies could go on the chopping block or face deliberate evisceration. President Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan may be in jeopardy, along with funding for the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Grumblings can even be heard from Europe that if the Paris climate accord is abandoned, the United States may face carbon taxes on its export goods. Ignorance and its diabolic facilitator \u2014 the corruption of expertise \u2014 both have real-world costs that we ignore at our peril.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Britain\u2019s Latest Export: Uncertainty", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "Supported bySUNDERLAND, England \u2014 Among the consequences Britain unleashed in voting to abandon the European Union was making Tom Hurst\u2019s job vastly more challenging.Mr. Hurst is the chief investment officer of Make It Sunderland, a local economic development agency. He lobbies investors on the benefits of setting up factories here in this industrial city in the northeast of England.Before the referendum, that job largely involved telling the story of Nissan: How, three decades ago, the Japanese automaker established a plant here in a community hard hit by factory closings. Now that plant now employs 7,500 and makes 500,000 vehicles a year. How other companies from around the world flocked here to cash in on supplying Nissan, making things like auto parts, car seats and dashboard instruments.But since the referendum on June 23, Mr. Hurst increasingly has to explain the implications of Britain\u2019s looming exit from the European Union, known as Brexit. He must justify how this low-slung city on the North Sea can remain an important locale for global business, even as its links to Europe are suddenly uncertain. He must reassure investors who are inclined to explore other shores.\u201cThe vast majority of the meetings I have start off with a 20-minute talk about Brexit,\u201d Mr. Hurst said. \u201cWe are where we are.\u201dThe vote has effectively redrawn the geography of global trade. It raises the prospect that Britain will depart not only the European Union but also the European single market, which now enables goods made here to be sold duty-free from Ireland to Romania \u2014 a swath of the globe home to some 500 million people. The European market collectively buys nearly half of Britain\u2019s exports.No one knows what sort of trading relationship Britain will forge with Europe once the exit is completed. No one can be sure whether tariffs eventually will be attached to British-made cars and other manufactured goods.The only thing that seems certain is that uncertainty will hover over businesses here and across Europe for some time.Assuming Britain moves ahead, negotiations will begin with the 27 remaining members of the union on the terms of dissolution. Those talks would last two years, barring an extension. If no agreement results \u2014 and any deal would need to be ratified by all 27 remaining members \u2014 Britain\u2019s trade with the rest of Europe would be governed by the rules of the World Trade Organization. That would allow for the imposition of tariffs on a range of goods.Already, ambiguity over the future has diminished the appeal of Britain as a hub for regional business.\u201cThe U.K. was a fantastic springboard to Europe, and with Brexit, that no longer applies,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at the Eurasia Group, a geopolitical consulting firm.In Sunderland, a city of about 275,000 people, the news was celebrated as a sign that the apocalypse had been averted.Such a move would have eliminated thousands of jobs at Nissan and about 35,000 jobs within the companies that supply its parts.The details of the negotiations between the government and Nissan that overcame the company\u2019s doubts remain unclear.Nissan sought compensation for any tariffs it might face exporting cars from Britain as a result of Brexit, a step that might have been viewed as an illegal subsidy under trade law.Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.But the British government said that it merely promised to continue its support of the British auto industry, by training workers, financing research and courting needed suppliers.In any case, Nissan\u2019s decision to stay underscores Britain\u2019s continued industrial strengths. Yet the Brexit process is so laced with unpredictability that some investors are leery of making the next deal.Major investment banks are exploring plans to shift jobs elsewhere \u2014 to Frankfurt, Paris, New York \u2014 in anticipation that Brexit will effectively destroy their ability to operate across the single market.\u201cAlready some U.S. businesses have indicated that, without continued seamless free market access to Europe, investment and hiring decisions likely would favor other locations,\u201d the report said.Among multinational companies, London retains allure as a uniquely cosmopolitan, English-speaking city.\u201cThere is still anxiety about certain locations in continental Europe,\u201d said Stephen M. Chipman, chief executive of Radius, a Boston-based consulting firm that advises countries exploring global expansions. \u201cCompanies worry about German law. They hear nightmare stories about hiring people in France, and not being able to get rid of people. These worries weigh pretty heavily.\u201dAnd yet some of his clients are now looking around for backup plans.\u201cClients that do have inventory are much more inclined to at least ask the questions, or are thinking about alternatives,\u201d Mr. Chipman said. \u201cWe are seeing more caution, taking more time.\u201dEconomic data in Britain and Europe has held up better than many expected, with no discernible shock. But many economists and government officials assume a Brexit-related slowdown in investment is already underway.The vote has sent the value of the British pound plunging, increasing the costs Nissan and other companies must pay for imported components. Over all, some 59 percent of the components going into the average British-built car are imported, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, a leading trade group.Ryanair, a discount airline with a major presence in Britain, recently declared plans to scale back an expansion, instead shifting growth to Belgium, Italy and Germany. The company\u2019s revenue has been diminished by the drop in the value of the British pound. \u201cUntil the final outcome of Brexit has been determined, we will continue to adapt to changing circumstances,\u201d the carrier\u2019s chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, said in a written statement.In opting for Brexit, British voters were in part reflecting desires to limit immigration. But free movement of labor is a cardinal principle of the European single market. Britain could either limit European immigration, or maintain its place in the European marketplace \u2014 not both.This city voted heavily in favor of leaving the European Union, despite the warnings from Nissan that jobs here could be imperiled. Many local voters took the referendum as an opportunity to express dissatisfaction with the British elite.Yet now, as the pound drops and prices of imported goods rise, some of these voters are experiencing a new sentiment \u2014 a so-called Regrexit.\u201cPeople didn\u2019t realize we\u2019ve got two years to sort all this out,\u201d said Daniel Luke, assistant manager at the Dun Cow, a cozy downtown pub with paisley carpets and stained glass windows.At the Spice Empire, a South Asian restaurant, the owner Luk Hussain said he wished he had better understood the economic ramifications of Brexit when he voted to leave Europe.\u201cYou\u2019d see these Romanians coming here with their six or seven children, not working, just collecting the dole, and I\u2019d think, \u2018These people are stealing my children\u2019s future,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought, \u2018We\u2019re going to clean out the riffraff.\u2019\u201dNow he finds himself paying 20 and 30 percent more for onions from the Netherlands and lettuce from Spain. And he must pay more for dishwashers, because the Eastern European immigrants he used to hire have stopped arriving.\u201cWe\u2019re suffering,\u201d Mr. Hussain said. \u201cI made a heavy mistake.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Kim\u2019s appointment required parliamentary approval. He replaces Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn.Mr. Hwang has not been accused of any wrongdoing, but Ms. Park replaced him to project the image of a fresh start, analysts said.On Wednesday, she also replaced her chief economic minister and domestic safety minister. Yim Jong-yong, the minister for the Financial Services Commission, became minister of strategy and finance, the top economic policy maker. But the reshuffling did not affect the national security and foreign affairs posts in the cabinet.Ms. Choi, 60, a friend of Ms. Park\u2019s for 40 years, is widely seen here as the president\u2019s secret adviser, though she has no official government title. She was also accused of using her influence to extort $69 million from big businesses in the form of donations to two foundations she controlled.On Monday, after weeks of avoiding the news media and public scrutiny, Ms. Choi presented herself to prosecutors. She tearfully apologized before a phalanx of television cameras, while angry citizens demanded her arrest. One person was detained while trying to hurl a tub of excrement at her and the prosecutors\u2019 office, claiming that the investigation was rigged to protect Ms. Park.Prosecutors are seeking an arrest warrant for Ms. Choi.The scandal has been particularly upsetting to South Koreans because of Ms. Choi\u2019s background. Her father, a religious leader named Choi Tae-min, is said to have befriended Ms. Park in the mid-1970s by claiming that he could help her contact her dead mother, who was assassinated in 1974. Ms. Park\u2019s father, Park Chung-hee, led a military dictatorship in South Korea from 1961 until 1979, when he, too, was assassinated.Many South Koreans believed that Mr. Choi, who died in 1994, exercised a Rasputin-like power over Ms. Park and used it to collect bribes.After Ms. Park became president in early 2013, rumors persisted that Ms. Choi was meddling in government affairs, installing her associates in political posts and helping them win large government contracts. Ms. Park acknowledged last week that she had let Ms. Choi edit some of her most important speeches, seeming to vindicate those suspicions. Her approval ratings have plummeted to record lows in the past couple of weeks.Advertisement"}

Since the election, he has said that he wants to keep the part of the law that prohibits insurance companies from discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions. Without this provision, insurers can deny those customers coverage, charge them exorbitant rates or refuse to cover treatment for those conditions.But Mr. Trump and other Republicans are delusional if they think that they can preserve that provision while scrapping the rest of the health care law. Insurers are able to offer policies to people with pre-existing conditions because the law greatly expands the number of people who are insured, thus spreading the costs of treating people with chronic conditions over a larger number of paying customers.The law provides subsidies to help individuals and families buy policies on government-run online health exchanges (those who do not buy insurance are required to pay a tax penalty). Take away or greatly reduce that benefit and millions won\u2019t be able to afford the plans, and many insurers will simply stop selling policies or will charge individuals and families much higher rates. The law also expanded Medicaid by financing state programs with federal money. Take away that money, and many states will no longer be able to provide care to millions of poor families.Republicans have said that Congress could vote early next year to repeal the Affordable Care Act but delay the actual end of the law for a year or two. In theory, that would allow lawmakers to come up with a workable replacement while putting off the consequences of repeal.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Gannett Abandons Effort to Buy the Newspaper Publisher Tronc", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byFor a deal that took six months of battling back and forth, the message of its collapse was cursory.In a brief telephone conversation early Tuesday morning, Robert J. Dickey, the chief executive of the Gannett Company, told his counterpart at the company formerly known as Tribune Publishing that Gannett, the nation\u2019s largest chain of newspapers, was dropping its $680 million-plus takeover bid \u2014 weeks after a price had been agreed upon.A deal would have merged the publisher of USA Today with the owner of The Los Angeles Times and The Chicago Tribune. It was intended to build a scale large enough to cut costs and eke out profits in an industry struggling with shrinking advertising revenue and declining circulations.Over the six months when the two companies sparred over a deal, the advertising market for newspapers was deteriorating. Last week, the banks that would have financed a purchase balked.Now, the two newspaper chains will seek their own diverging paths to meeting the challenges of shrinking advertising revenue and declining circulations.Yet for the acquisitive Gannett, few other newspaper chains offer as much opportunity as the company now known as Tronc. And the former Tribune Publishing is pursuing a technology-driven approach to journalism that has led some in the industry to scratch their heads.This account of how the deal fell apart is based on interviews with a number of people close to the negotiations. They were not authorized to speak publicly about confidential discussions.The talks between Gannett and Tronc had a rocky start.Tronc rejected two bids after Gannett first approached it with an offer in April. By August, a higher price brought Tronc back to the negotiating table, but all the while its advisers were skeptical that Gannett could come up with the financing.But by mid-September the two sides shook hands on an all-cash $18.75-a-share deal.Gannett had enlisted Jefferies, SunTrust Banks and PNC Financial Services to help finance the deal. The almost $1 billion required would have been one of the most expensive leveraged loans signed this year.Then, last week, Gannett announced layoffs for 2 percent of its work force and quarterly results that showed its print advertising revenue had plummeted.The report raised concerns among both SunTrust and PNC\u2019s internal committees that financing a newspaper merger was too risky, so they balked.Representatives from Jefferies and PNC declined to comment. A SunTrust spokeswoman did not respond to requests seeking comment.In its statement Tuesday morning, Tronc said, \u201cIt is unfortunate that Gannett\u2019s lenders made their decision to terminate their role in the transaction without the benefit of Tronc\u2019s third-quarter financials or any future projections.\u201dTronc\u2019s results on Tuesday also showed declines in advertising revenue.Though two of Gannett\u2019s banks walked, a third, Jefferies, was still committed. And other potential lenders had reached out to Gannett to see if they could help get a deal done.As recently as Saturday morning, Tronc was under the impression that Gannett still wanted to pursue the combination.But when Gannett\u2019s board met Monday night, it was clear that the will to persist with a transaction had faded.Tronc had pushed Gannett to agree to a deal that was the pinnacle of what the company could pay \u2014 and as their industry deteriorated, Gannett no longer wanted to pay it.In a statement on Tuesday, Gannett said that it \u201chad a number of financing options available and determined to terminate discussions with Tronc after considering both accretion to shareholders and whether the terms make sense for the company.\u201dShares of Tronc tumbled more than 20 percent on Tuesday, before closing down more than 12 percent. Shares of Gannett declined 2.3 percent. Its stock price has declined more than 50 percent since it made its acquisition proposal public in April.For the newspaper industry broadly, the collapse of the deal was another indication of the financial uncertainty facing it.An acquisition of Tronc would have been an aggressive bet by Gannett, which has traditionally bought newspapers in small or midsize markets. A deal for the owner of newspapers like The Los Angeles Times and The Chicago Tribune could have helped Gannett attract more lucrative national advertising and achieve savings by combining some operations.Gannett\u2019s deal making has been watched closely in a media industry that is desperately trying to find new sources of revenue as print advertising income continues to decline. Part of its strategy has been to offset advertising declines by acquiring more papers and the revenue that comes with them.But as it has spread across the United States, Gannett has garnered a reputation as a brutal cost-cutter, stripping out excess and sometimes cutting to the bone in a quest for profit.Over the years, it has bought newspapers, then consolidated printing operations at regional presses and shuttered redundant facilities. It has moved newspaper production to central hubs, sold off real estate and laid off thousands of employees.When asked about Gannett\u2019s appetite for acquisitions during its earnings call last Thursday, Mr. Dickey, the chief executive of Gannett, said the company was \u201ccommitted to the strategy of building out our local footprint.\u201dThere are a dwindling number of potential targets left that could give Gannett greater scale.Lee Enterprises, which owns more than 40 daily newspapers, including The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, has a market capitalization of about $150 million, less than half the size of Tronc.Both A. H. Belo Corporation, which publishes The Dallas Morning News, and the McClatchy Company, publisher of The Miami Herald and The Fresno Bee, are even smaller.For Tronc, the collapse of the deal gives the company a chance to see through some of the investments it has made in technology.Michael W. Ferro Jr., a technology entrepreneur who in February took a $44 million stake in Tribune Publishing and became its executive chairman, has promoted a technology-driven approach with concepts like artificial intelligence and new bureaus for The Los Angeles Times in cities like Lagos, Nigeria, and Hong Kong that he has insisted will increase the value of the company beyond Gannett\u2019s offer.On Tuesday, Justin Dearborn, Tronc\u2019s chief executive, noted \u201cthe distractions\u201d the company has faced in pursuing a sale to Gannett.He added, \u201cWhile we are in the early stages of executing our strategy, we remain confident in the strength of our core brands and assets and committed to our go-forward plans.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementNovember 16, 2016Akhil Reed AmarCharles FriedWe have a direct democracy: Senators, representatives and members of the Electoral College are all elected directly by the people. They do not, however, elect the president directly. This is a feature of the kind of government we have chosen from the beginning in which the states are important subsidiary (in some instances, primary) units of government. Even after a civil war and two world wars, the states control a large measure of the laws, administration and finance that have an impact on the lives of ordinary citizens. The states have  their own political cultures, personalities and traditions which persist in spite of our far more transient population, an interconnected national economy and national news media. In order to reflect this mode of governance, the interactions between the national government and the states in important matters often utilize the local units and personnel. The notion is that the states are not simply administrative units of the national government or its local offices. In that context it is quite appropriate that the head of state is elected state-by-state, albeit by popular vote in each state. That way at the most focused democratic moment, every four years the candidates and parties must take the states into account.  And sometimes it will happen that, as this year,  there will be a significant divergence -- millions of votes -- between who is chosen by the Electoral College and the winner of the overall popular vote.  Sometimes that disparity can act as a caution to the elected president, but where the House and Senate are in the hands of the elected president's party that caution is less likely to operate.\nI prefer direct national election of our president. I take states seriously and value federalism, but in a different way than do most defenders of the status quo.  Consider the fact that each state picks its own president-equivalent \u2014 its governor \u2014 quite directly:  one person, one vote.  All votes are counted equally and in close races recounted carefully.  America should copy this state-tested model when choosing the governor of us all: the president."}

The court\u2019s suggested fix: Allow the president to fire the agency\u2019s director at will.The decision has taken on added significance with the surprise election of Donald J. Trump. If the ruling stands, the new president would have the power to dismiss the director of the bureau, Richard Cordray, and reshape the agency in his own mold.The consumer bureau\u2019s petition temporarily stops the clock on that possibility. Until the court rules on the petition, Mr. Cordray cannot be removed without cause, and if the court agrees to revisit the case, the earlier ruling will be vacated.In its petition, the consumer bureau said that the court\u2019s previous ruling \u201csets up what may be the most important separation-of-powers case in a generation.\u201d It added that it could have spillover effects on a number of other independent agencies, including the Social Security Administration and the Federal Housing Finance Agency.Legal scholars say that the case will probably end up at the Supreme Court.

{"Headline": "Trump Rides a Wave of Fury That May Damage Global Prosperity", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisA populist insurrection is gaining force in much of the world, drawing middle-class and blue-collar recruits who lament that they have been left behind by globalization. This upheaval threatens to upend the economic order that has prevailed since the end of World War II.This was evident before Donald J. Trump\u2019s triumphant rogue campaign for the American presidency. Now it is beyond argument.National leaders in Europe and North America are scrambling to placate energized, often unruly groups of people demanding change and a more generous share of the economic spoils. But the options for addressing the deficiencies of capitalism are severely constrained \u2014 both by traditional political realities and by the broader truths of the global economy.In Britain, which shocked the world in June with its so-called Brexit vote to abandon the European Union, and now in the United States, with its stunning elevation of Mr. Trump, electorates have essentially handed governments a mandate to limit free trade. Voters have unleashed this action plan in the name of lifting the fortunes of working people.But trade is such an elemental part of the modern global economy that impeding it is almost certain to produce the opposite effect. It will damage economic growth, diminishing prosperity for all.Mr. Trump has promised to slap tariffs on Chinese imports and to punish American companies that manufacture their wares in Mexico. Britain\u2019s new Conservative government has signaled that it may depart Europe\u2019s vast single market as it negotiates divorce terms.But speeches do not translate into viable job creation strategies.The American economy depends on access to a global supply chain that produces parts used by innumerable industries, along with a great range of consumer goods. Mexico and China are central actors. Disruption threatens to increase costs for American households. Tariffs on China might provoke a trade war that could slow economic growth, while most likely just shifting factory work to other low-wage nations like Vietnam and India.Britain sells half of its exports to the nations of the European Union. If the country leaves the single market, tariffs could apply to its goods, diminishing sales and costing jobs.Mr. Trump\u2019s election and Brexit together underscore a central facet of these times. The old ideological divisions of left and right have effectively been eclipsed by a new economic taxonomy \u2014 those who have benefited from globalization and those who have not.In Britain, affluent communities of professionals who hire Romanians to clean their homes and who enjoy getaways to Spain overwhelmingly voted to stay in the European Union. Industrial communities that have lost jobs as manufacturing has shifted east \u2014 to Eastern Europe, Turkey and Asia \u2014 generally voted to leave.In the United States, college-educated urbanites making a comfortable living in the quintessential trades of globalization \u2014 finance, technology and media \u2014 disdained Mr. Trump. People in the center of the country who lack degrees and have seen jobs transferred to China and Mexico played a leading role in delivering the White House to Mr. Trump.In northeastern England (something like the Rust Belt of Britain) people who voted to leave Europe speak openly about doing so to punish those who beseeched them to vote to stay \u2014 people like the exceedingly unpopular former prime minister David Cameron. The situation is so depressed, it cannot get worse, the logic runs. Any economic pain will fall on wealthy Londoners, people say.But that is almost certainly nonsense. A rupture of trade with Europe is likely to hit these industrial communities hardest. And if that happens, the people living there will be angrier than ever.Mr. Trump drew support from factory town laborers who have traditionally voted for Democrats but did not trust Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee. Many recall how her husband forged the North American Free Trade Agreement, which helped cause a shift of American manufacturing to Mexico. If Mr. Trump does not find a way to satisfy their high expectations, these people are likely to feel deceived.And any proposals need to navigate the reliably treacherous politics of Washington. The latest piece of Trump real estate, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, sits just down the street from a Capitol full of people who got themselves elected in part by railing against deficits and promising to cut federal spending.The soon-to-be President Trump has vowed to counteract the problems afflicting workers by unleashing a wave of infrastructure spending that will generate jobs for skilled hands. Perhaps he will have more luck than his predecessor, President Obama, whose own plans for infrastructure spending died time and again at the hands of Republican deficit hawks. Mr. Trump is \u2014 at least on paper \u2014 a fellow Republican.But whatever happens from here, one may assume that populist ferment is unlikely to exhaust its vast reservoir of grievances anytime soon.Eight years after the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, the people who caused it \u2014 reckless investment bankers \u2014 have bounced back almost as if it never happened, while many American homeowners and wage earners have yet to recover their lost wealth.Many of Europe\u2019s problems represent a failure to reshape its policies to spur growth. Germany is the most powerful actor in Europe, and Germany maintains an obsession with budget austerity as the response to all economic problems.Since Britain\u2019s vote to leave Europe, some regional leaders have argued that Brexit amounts to a warning for the European Union: Absent a new economic philosophy, the situation will continue to generate hostility among a populace that cannot pay its bills.\u201cIf you want to close this divide and you want to persuade your citizens that there is opportunity in the internationalization of the economy and innovation, you need to invest a lot,\u201d said the Italian minister of economic development, Carlo Calenda, during a recent interview in Rome. \u201cOtherwise populism will prevail, and this is a risk that we are seeing all around the world, also in the United States. And this will be a disaster for the economy, and for the geopolitical situation.\u201dHe said this before Mr. Trump was elected.But Germany remains implacably opposed to spending more aggressively, continuing to put stock \u2014 against all empirical evidence \u2014 into the idea that cutting spending and eliminating worker protections are the keys to prosperity.Democracy is fundamentally a means by which citizens get to tell their leaders what they want. What many now want is to banish their leaders.Either the new leaders will find a way to make global capitalism a more enriching proposition for larger numbers of people, or they, too, risk being swept aside as anger builds.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Economic Gobbledygook Divides Us", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byOn MoneyAs a rule of thumb, texts aimed at a general audience must be written at a 10th-grade level or below. This is what mass media does, and it is also what many great writers do: Emily Bront\u00eb, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, Mark Twain and Ernest Hemingway all pass the 10th-grade test with ease. That they accomplish so much with simple tools is part of what makes them great writers.The literature of finance, by contrast, uses a far more esoteric tool kit. A fascinating piece of research by an analyst at the Bank of England puts some numbers on the gap between the language of financial insiders and the rest of us. Writing for Bank Underground, the bank\u2019s staff blog, Jonathan Fullwood applies techniques of numerical analysis \u2014 the wonderfully named Fog index, the United States Navy-developed Flesch-Kincaid test and the McLaughlin \u201cSimple Measure of Gobbledygook,\u201d among others \u2014 to some financial prose. Fullwood finds that the financial sector sets the bar for comprehension absurdly high. \u201cPrivate sector bank output tends to require a reading level of Grade 12,\u201d he writes, \u201cand Bank of England writing requires a reading level of Grade 14.\u201d Fourteenth grade \u2026 who among us doesn\u2019t have happy memories of that?The retort from the world of money, when these objections are made, is that finance writing is complicated only because the subject is impossible to simplify. Fullwood refutes that with the following fact: Richard Feynman\u2019s lectures on physics, in which the Nobel Prize-winning physicist explains Heisenberg\u2019s Uncertainty Principle, have a readability level of Grade 8 on the Flesch-Kincaid scale.Ten years ago, I set out to write a novel about London, where I live. I quickly realized that the single greatest force shaping life in that place over the last 10 years has been its role as a center of international finance. To understand my hometown, I began to study how finance and economics worked. Not long into my self-education, the credit crunch hit, and then it turned into the Great Recession. More than a decade later, I\u2019m still writing about it.Language loomed large as a subject from the start. A big role in the credit crisis was played by C.D.S. of C.D.O. squared based on C.D.O. based on R.M.B.S. Being told that those abbreviations stand for credit-default swaps, collateralized debt obligations and residential mortgage-backed securities didn\u2019t help much; it just punted the explanation downfield. The language is astonishingly complex because the financial instruments themselves are, too \u2014 at least, that\u2019s what I thought at the time. It wasn\u2019t a question of deliberate obfuscation and concealment; it was just a consequence of the difficulty inherent in the subject.My view on this topic has darkened over the years, in part because several financial professionals have explained to me quite plainly how intentional their obfuscation can be. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve just invented something,\u201d a banker once told me, \u201cyou need a name that\u2019s not obvious, because the longer it\u2019s a proprietary technique, the more money you make.\u201d Esoteric language also allows bankers to hide truths from themselves. \u201cWe were in a meeting going over the numbers from a company, and we were focusing on their churn,\u201d a private equity boss told me. By \u201cchurn\u201d he meant the rate at which customers were lost and new ones had to be acquired. \u201cSo we\u2019re looking at the numbers, and then I suddenly have a moment where I think, Wait, what business is this? It\u2019s residential-care homes. The churn is people dying. And I get this wave of, What are we doing here? and I have to pause the meeting and leave the room for a few minutes. That\u2019s one of the things the language does, it helps you dissociate.\u201dHow much this language divide matters depends on how much we think the gap between insiders and outsiders matters; how much it matters if elites seem cut off from the rest of society; whether the great mass of society has a calm confidence in the judgment of its rulers or feels furious, alienated, ignored and traduced. The winners know that they\u2019re winning but have been very slow to realize that the losers know that they\u2019re losing and are enraged about the fact. This is a moment of genuine crisis, in which a huge portion of the population is deeply angry about their status and their prospects and feel that fundamentals of the social contract have broken down.The United Kingdom, where I live, has just voted to leave the European Union after a campaign on the Leave side argued that \u201cpeople in this country have had enough of experts.\u201d Language and economics were a crucial part of the Brexit divide. The economic experts were all lined up on the side of the Remain campaign, in a near-total unanimity that was signaled when President Obama visited Britain to restate and reinforce the consensus view \u2014 a highly unusual intervention in another country\u2019s democratic politics. All the insiders said very similar things in very similar language. It had no traction: the alphabet soup of I.M.F., O.E.C.D., E.C.B. and all the other experts might as well have been talking entirely to themselves. When the electorate voted the other way, it was as if the very unanimity and certainty of the expert consensus was somehow off-putting. Project Fear, as the Remain campaign was dubbed, seemed to be too certain about its predictions and projections, many of which came with suspiciously precise numbers attached, like the claim that Brexit would cost \u00a34,300 ($5,300) per household. To a lot of voters, that certainty looked fishy. If economics is so good at forecasting things, how come nobody saw the credit crunch and Great Recession coming?\u201cIt\u2019s not free trade, it\u2019s stupid trade,\u201d Donald Trump has said during his presidential campaign \u2014 a slogan that contradicts every tenet of mainstream economics, as well as a quarter of a millennium of accumulated economic data. It is also a phrase that immediately resonates with a big chunk of the electorate. They know what it means. The five million American manufacturing jobs that have vanished since 2000 aren\u2019t coming back. The idea that Nafta is \u201cthe single worst trade deal ever signed\u201d might have no expert support, but if you live in a one-industry town and the main workplace has closed, you are unlikely to agree with the professional consensus instead of your own lived reality of loss and decline. Words like \u201cstupid\u201d and \u201cworst\u201d and \u201closing\u201d \u2014 people know what they mean. They can feel it in their marrow.Research has shown that the single greatest predictor of how people voted in the Brexit referendum was their education level: the more education, the more likely to vote Remain; the less, the more likely to vote Leave. In America, Trump has newly polarized many voters along educational lines, in the same manner that Brexit did. The educated and uneducated are increasingly living in parallel societies, each with different experiences, philosophies, expectations, trajectories and language. This isn\u2019t the same as the divide between rich and poor, because in a society with shared assumptions, the poor can dream of being rich and sometimes can even manage it. Anyone can make it: That\u2019s the American dream. Today, though, to the excluded, economic success looks like a club membership, exclusive by definition and design.It would be a disaster for democracy if this divide were to become permanently entrenched. Democracy depends on an informed electorate; it depends on argument, and that in turn depends on having enough in common to be able to argue. Bankers and the financial elite can\u2019t just talk to each other as if nothing has changed; as if the little people are just going to accept that they can\u2019t follow the big words, so the rich should just keep running things in their own interest. The experts need to set terms for the debate that everyone can understand. So yes, when it comes to economics, language matters.

How much money, exactly, is subject to interpretation, but careful estimates extend from about $2.4 trillion to roughly $3 trillion.One reason is that the sums that could be made available for use by the government have become staggeringly large. Like the gravity of an outsized planet, the concentration of so much money creates a nearly irresistible force: Something needs to be done about it.An approach called deemed repatriation \u2014 in which untaxed foreign corporate profits are subject to immediate taxation \u2014 would provide a gigantic infusion to the Treasury and give corporations a significant incentive to move money home. Leading plans in Congress include this approach, Mr. Kleinbard said.Reforming the tax code is anything but simple, however. The details are crucial, and there are plenty of them, giving corporate lobbyists ample opportunity to shape eventual changes in a manner that favors the big companies.Consider the implications of that sum for a moment.On paper, if not in reality, corporations are required to pay a federal tax rate of 35 percent. If all of that money had been taxed at that rate, it would amount to $910 billion in taxes.In fact, Goldman Sachs research indicates that companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index paid a median federal effective tax rate of 28 percent, on average, over the last decade, while companies with high foreign earnings paid about 22 percent.But let\u2019s stick with the statutory 35 percent rate for a moment. My calculations show that at that rate, the lost corporate tax revenue would amount to almost two-thirds of all the money ($1.39 trillion) paid by Americans in personal income tax in 2014, according to Treasury data. And the lost tax revenue is more than 2.5 times the income tax paid annually by American corporations. Even if corporations were given a big break \u2014 which is highly likely under any tax code revision \u2014 the impact of any tax payments on those profits would still be large.Stock investors would also enjoy a windfall under earnings repatriation plans, but the lower the corporate tax rate, the greater the benefit. It\u2019s easy to see why.For one thing, studies show that in 2004 when the American Jobs Creation Act granted a \u201ctax holiday,\u201d in which companies were allowed to bring money home at a 5.25 percent tax rate, they used very little of their repatriated money to create jobs or develop new businesses or technologies. Most of the cash simply flowed to investors in the form of buybacks and dividends.That\u2019s why the details of a tax deal are so important. A tax holiday could encourage companies to stockpile earnings overseas again and defer American taxes, while enriching investors. If $1 trillion were repatriated and companies funneled nearly all of it to their shareholders, the windfall would be very large indeed: It could come close to the $975 billion in buybacks and dividends for all S.&P. 500 stocks for the 12 months through June, according to data provided by Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.For these reasons, in a recent report for clients, Goldman Sachs suggested that investors consider buying shares of companies with the biggest untaxed foreign earnings: Microsoft, General Electric, Apple and Pfizer, which also top the list of untaxed earnings giants compiled by Audit Analytics, an accounting research firm.There is a surprising degree of bipartisan consensus that the American tax system needs to be fixed and that the stranded earnings should be brought home. Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and the House speaker, and Chuck Schumer of New York, who is in line to be the Senate\u2019s Democratic leader, have favored tax changes that would encourage corporate repatriation. Mr. Schumer and Senator Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, agreed on the framework of such a plan, and President Obama did as well.A gigantic pot of money is sitting overseas. It will be up to the next president and Congress \u2014 and their counterparts abroad \u2014 to decide exactly what to do about it.Gretchen Morgenson, whose Fair Game column normally appears on this page, is away.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "City Unveils Possible Routes for Streetcar in Brooklyn and Queens", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byAs Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s administration moves forward on plans for a new streetcar line from Queens to Brooklyn, city officials on Tuesday unveiled the different routes they are considering for the project.The $2.5 billion waterfront streetcar would run on streets in some of New York City\u2019s most popular and crowded neighborhoods along the East River, including Williamsburg and Downtown Brooklyn. City officials plan to discuss the routes at community meetings over the next two months before selecting a path early next year.\u201cWe now feel that it\u2019s very important and a real inflection point in the process to lay out the options and get some feedback,\u201d Alicia Glen, the city\u2019s deputy mayor for housing and economic development, said in an interview.Berry Street in Williamsburg, for example, could become a \u201ctransitway\u201d used primarily by streetcars and pedestrians, according to a city rendering showing expanded sidewalks and a station with screens showing arrival information. The road would be closed to most vehicles with some street parking allowed, city officials said.Without their own lane, the streetcars would get stuck in traffic as buses currently do, Mr. Giambrone said.\u201cWe are strongly leaning toward doing everything that\u2019s practical to put this in a dedicated right of way,\u201d he said.This month, city officials are planning to meet with community boards in Brooklyn and Queens to discuss the streetcar routes. The city could begin the project\u2019s environmental review next year and construction in 2019.In Downtown Brooklyn, the streetcar could run along Tillary Street before traveling south on Court Street, which the report notes has \u201cexcellent connections\u201d to the subway. In Red Hook, Brooklyn, the line could run along Columbia Street or closer to the water along Van Brunt Street.After examining where people live, the location of public utilities and possible subway connections, city officials are considering moving the line farther from the waterfront than originally imagined in some locations.\u201cIt\u2019s become increasingly clear to us that there are places where moving it further inland makes sense,\u201d Ms. Glen said.But Councilman Costa Constantinides, a Democrat whose district includes Astoria, said he wanted to make sure the streetcar served people who lived in so-called transit deserts near the waterfront, like the Astoria Houses, a public housing development.\u201cIn the western part of my district, they can see Manhattan from their homes and yet it\u2019s one of the longest commutes in the city, and into Brooklyn it\u2019s even longer,\u201d he said.Mr. Constantinides said that he did not yet have a favorite route of the four proposed in Astoria, but that he was glad the mayor was thinking big on transportation.\u201cWe\u2019re going to make sure our community has a voice,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s Hard to See How", "Date": "2016-11-27", "News": "Supported byCIUDAD DEL CARMEN, Mexico \u2014 The town that oil built is emptying out.\u201cFor Sale\u201d signs are plastered on concrete-block houses and sun-bleached bungalows alike. The idled oil workers who used to cluster in the main square, hoping to pick up odd jobs, have moved on.Here in Ciudad del Carmen, on the gulf coast of Mexico, even the ironclad union positions are slipping away. Some roughnecks on the offshore rigs of the national oil company, Pemex, have not worked in months, and their voices are filled with anxiety.\u201cWhat do you think is going to happen?\u201d some ask.Now, that mammoth undertaking has become all the more critical with the United States\u2019 election of Donald J. Trump. As Mexicans steel themselves for an American president who made upending his nation\u2019s relationship with Mexico a cornerstone of his campaign, officials on this side of the border have hastened to reassure the country that Mexico\u2019s economy is sound.If Mr. Trump goes through with his promises to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, deport migrants and tax remittances to pay for his border wall, Mexico will face severe economic shocks, particularly to the vibrant manufacturing base, whose products replaced oil as the country\u2019s main export years ago.The Mexican peso remains at record lows. The central bank raised interest rates this month, citing \u201cheightened uncertainty.\u201d And last week, it cut growth forecasts for this year and next. The bank\u2019s governor, Agust\u00edn Carstens, told a local radio station that understanding the Trump administration\u2019s policies was \u201clike trying to put a jigsaw puzzle together without having all the pieces.\u201dMany are pessimistic that the government can come up with a backup plan. \u201cMexico lacks a credible Plan B to offset the anti-trade wave,\u201d analysts at Morgan Stanley warned in a recent note to investors.The damage that Mr. Trump could inflict on the busy factories that ship cars and computers to the United States has given a sharp urgency to Mexico\u2019s efforts to jump-start parts of the economy that do not rely on Nafta \u2014 particularly its dilapidated oil industry.To that end, when Jos\u00e9 Antonio Meade, the finance minister, lists the Mexican economy\u2019s strengths, he singles out the importance of the new energy laws that broke the 75-year monopoly held by Pemex.The laws, part of a package of economic overhauls that President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto pushed through Congress three years ago, allow for private investment in Mexico\u2019s oil sector for the first time since foreign companies were expelled in 1938.Only days before the American presidential election, Pemex\u2019s chief executive, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez Anaya, presented a timetable of projects he expected to offer to potential partners and promised to begin returning the national oil company to solvency.He and the finance minister met with investors in New York this month to argue that Mexico\u2019s economy was solid and that \u201cthe oil sector will continue to be an engine of national economic growth,\u201d according to a joint statement from Pemex and the Finance Ministry. The pair followed up with a visit to London.\u201cThe only way to bring back production in the next five, six years is to bring more investment to Pemex,\u201d said Juan Carlos Zepeda, the president of the National Hydrocarbons Commission, Mexico\u2019s oil regulator. \u201cThere is no other way.\u201dBut after the new energy laws were approved, the company stalled, the promised joint ventures did not happen, and oil prices plunged.Pemex reeled as its debt soared and production dropped. Falling oil revenue means oil funds less than 20 percent of the government budget, down from as much as 40 percent when prices were at their peak.\u201cThe government was never prepared for sustained low oil prices,\u201d said John Padilla, a managing director of IPD Latin America, an energy consulting firm. \u201cThey never saw a Pemex implosion in the way it occurred.\u201dThe president chose Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez Anaya, a Harvard-educated economist known for efficiency, to take over at Pemex in February. He quickly announced the first joint venture proposal: a deepwater oil field just south of United States waters.Experts believe that Mexico\u2019s untapped deepwater oil fields are its next great prize. But they are risky and expensive, a concern at a time when low oil prices have forced international oil companies to scrap many planned investments.Still, major companies like BP, Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Shell have qualified to bid in a deepwater auction in December.In an interview in his office at the top of the Pemex tower in Mexico City, Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez Anaya warned not to expect too much.\u201cSome people have said to me, \u2018Look, Pemex won\u2019t go back to producing three million barrels.\u2019 Well, no,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a shame \u2014 but no. What I can say and demonstrate is the company\u2019s solidity.\u201dNot everyone is sure that companies will jump at the chance to team up with Pemex.\u201cTwo years ago, everybody wanted to partner with Pemex,\u201d Mr. Padilla said. \u201cThey were being courted like the homecoming queen. Fast-forward two years later, and how can you go to your board and say, \u2018Pemex is good for the money\u2019?\u201dAnother question is whether the government can speed up the transformation as a defense against Mr. Trump\u2019s promised policies. Even if the government attracts private investment, the effect on production could take years to materialize.\u201cThey\u2019re not going to turn the economy around on energy reform,\u201d said Jeremy M. Martin, an energy expert at the Institute of the Americas in San Diego.In the meantime, Mexico must fix the company\u2019s many problems.Pemex\u2019s rusty refineries operate at about 60 percent capacity, forcing the country to import more than half of its gasoline. The company loses billions of dollars every quarter, and it owes almost $100 billion in debt and an additional $68 billion in pension liabilities. Budget cuts have halted exploration for next year.An explosion on a fuel tanker in September was the latest in a series of fiery and often fatal accidents. Gangs routinely tap Pemex\u2019s pipelines to steal gasoline, tipped off from inside the company.The government continues to tax Pemex heavily, and the oil workers\u2019 union \u2014 an ally of Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s Institutional Revolutionary Party \u2014 remains powerful.Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez Anaya\u2019s first action after arriving at Pemex was to slash the budget by 22 percent, halting expensive projects and cutting waste.\u201cWe haven\u2019t finished,\u201d he said. Referring to his effort to rein in overspending, he added, \u201cWe continue, continue, continue.\u201dFor decades, Pemex made many people very rich. The company granted inflated contracts to local business executives who cultivated political connections, according to interviews with contractors in Ciudad del Carmen. Mayors in oil states demanded Pemex cash for public works.\u201cThe budget has been converted into plunder,\u201d said Mariano Ruiz Funes, a former Pemex chief of staff.Analysts argue that Pemex may have to sell off parts of the company.\u201cWe will see a much smaller Pemex in the years to come,\u201d Mr. Ruiz Funes said, predicting a \u201clong and painful\u201d adjustment. \u201cPolitically it will be difficult.\u201dMr. Gonz\u00e1lez Anaya is not prepared to make that decision.Pemex \u201cis not just any company,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t ask a national oil company to be Exxon.\u201dBut in Ciudad del Carmen, the riches of that national oil company are long gone. The city has lost about 23,000 jobs since the end of 2014.\u201cWhat we\u2019re living through in Carmen, we have never lived through something like this in contemporary Mexico,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Domingo Berzunza, the economic development secretary for Campeche, the surrounding state.Advertisement"}

Victorian houses send up peaks like flares, outdoor cafes hum with gossip and baby strollers seem as plentiful as business suits. Like the Capitol dome, which has a habit of popping up when you turn a corner, government is frequently in the foreground, but coexists with a larger, more diverse landscape.Ms. Davant typifies this neighborly relationship. She and her husband, Charles, and their two children live in a 3,092-square-foot 1895 house at 606 Massachusetts Avenue NE, which they bought in 2013 for almost $1.5 million. They rent their English basement to a congressional staffer for $1,850 a month, including utilities.While the ever-growing boundaries of Capitol Hill are disputed, the historic district is clearly defined. As designated by the District of Columbia\u2019s Historic Preservation Review Board, which revised the map last year, it touches H Street NE to the north, 14th Street SE to the east, M Street SE to the south and South Capitol Street SE to the west.Lee Murphy, a saleswoman at Washington Fine Properties, said it was too soon to see ripples in the local real estate market from the changing administration; she expects robust activity by the spring. If, as seems likely, President-elect Donald J. Trump brings outsiders to Washington, Ms. Murphy predicts that the newcomers will buy homes on Capitol Hill and in other areas, given the low interest rates and the city\u2019s high rental prices. She and Mr. Dewey of Urban Pace both said they had had at least one prospective buyer who had anticipated working for a Democratic administration and had backed out of a deal after Mr. Trump\u2019s victory. Ms. Murphy was not sympathetic. \u201cReally, you do need to solidify your job before you start looking for houses,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m old-fashioned.\u201dMr. Janezich also noted that parking is a neighborhood concern, especially with 2,000 new apartments expected on the market in the larger Capitol Hill area in the next two years, many in buildings without provisions for cars.The neighborhood public schools are \u201cimproving dramatically,\u201d said Ivan Frishberg, a vice president of Amalgamated Bank, who was an advisory neighborhood commissioner on Capitol Hill from 2010 to 2014. But most of the strides are being made at the elementary school level, he added, while middle schools are lagging . \u201cWe don\u2019t have one core Capitol Hill middle school,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd because of the kind of chaotic nature of charter schools popping up all over the place, the school population after elementary school gets spread out everywhere. It is a detriment to making neighborhood schools work.\u201dCentrally situated and highly accessible, Capitol Hill is served by the Capitol South and Eastern Market Metro stations, on the orange, silver and blue lines. The Capitol South station is two stops from L\u2019Enfant Plaza, where five Metro lines meet, and a walk of about 15 minutes from Union Station.Capitol Hill evolved from Pierre Charles L\u2019Enfant\u2019s 1791 plan for a \u201cCongress House\u201d to be built on Jenkins Hill, at one of the highest points in the new federal city. Two neighborhoods sprang up in the area and gradually merged. One, a group of boardinghouses, served as temporary quarters for early members of Congress; the other was a community of shipbuilders and merchants, southeast near the Navy Yard. A building boom in the 1870s brought many Victorian houses to Capitol Hill that remain neighborhood ornaments.Advertisement"}

Many would rather not ponder critical decisions about feeding tubes, funeral homes and other end-of-life issues until the need is thrust upon them.But as our population ages and the industry gets more attention, new firms \u2014 many of them technology companies \u2014 are setting out to compete on price and convenience.A new crop of tech start-ups is hoping to capture a slice of that sector. Many are founded by millennials, who have grown up online and expect to shop for \u2014 and curate \u2014 everything there.As baby boomers become more comfortable shopping online, these start-ups are finding a highly engaged audience. And those in their 20s and 30s, hitting major life events like marriage, the birth of a child or the loss of a parent, also require planning services.The typical customer would be someone like Michelle LaBerge, a resident of Oshkosh, Wis., who recently turned 50 and helped her parents move into an assisted living community. Those events reminded her that she needed to get her own affairs in order.For $30, Ms. LaBerge created a will customized to suit her particular circumstances. \u201cIt was very easy,\u201d she said. \u201cI compared it to my parents\u2019 will, done by an attorney, and it looked the same.\u201dThe founders of Willing, Eliam Medina and Rob Dyson, wanted to create a platform that allowed users to complete their own estate planning documents like a will, power of attorney and health care directive.\u201cIf you look at what TurboTax has done for tax planning, we wanted to do the same thing for estate planning,\u201d said Mr. Medina, the company\u2019s chief executive.An early version of the platform was introduced in Florida in January 2015. Consumers were invited to try the service free and about 500 wills were created, Mr. Medina said. That summer, Willing, based in Miami, went through the start-up incubator Y Combinator, where it expanded to all 50 states. The company has raised $7 million. Mr. Medina says 25,000 wills a month are created on the platform.A team of people posing as shoppers seeks out pricing and services information from funeral homes that are unaware the information is for the site. An increasing number of funeral directors, however, are voluntarily working with Parting to put their information in the database, which now has more than 15,000 funeral homes.It is backed by an angel investor and is increasing about 27 percent a month in searches and visitors, said Tyler Yamasaki, a founder.Still, it has been an uphill battle getting these traditionally small, mom-and-pop companies to promote themselves, Mr. Yamasaki said.\u201cIt\u2019s a big, slow industry and a lot of these funeral homes aren\u2019t open to start-ups,\u201d he said. Funeral homes can get a free basic listing on Parting or pay for a premium listing, which increases their visibility. If a home gets a customer through the listing, Parting collects 12 to 15 percent of the funeral bill as its fee.\u201cLike what are the 60 things I need to do in the next three months? At Grace we say, \u2018Here are the 17 things you need to do this week\u2019 and you can check them off as you do them. Here\u2019s what you do the week before someone dies, when they die and then two weeks later.\u201dToday, most of Grace\u2019s customers call in and are helped by staff members who are also licensed funeral directors \u2014 including Mr. Kruger and his co-founders. \u201cIn some ways death is still handled by talking to other people,\u201d he said.Grace connects families with vetted providers, including estate lawyers, financial planners, funeral homes and caterers. Customers receive a list of tasks to complete before and after a death, including the necessary paperwork, but the staff can also help with funeral planning, filling out forms and other tasks.Mr. Kruger said Grace has had some unusual requests, like shipping a body to Romania and closing a deceased individual\u2019s Tinder account.The company, founded in June, has raised under $2 million in seed funding and transactions are growing about 20 percent a month. Grace\u2019s services are offered only in Southern California, but Mr. Kruger said they would be in Northern California by the end of the year and in additional states next year.Possibly the most difficult situation consumers face is to decide how to be cared for at the end of their lives, and communicating that to family members.The start-up has been self-financed until now but is now closing a seed round, said Suelin Chen, a founder and chief executive.The platform asks users a series of questions to help them determine their preferences. Their answers are used to populate their Cake profile, to which they can add notes and instructions to family members or friends.\u201cPeople get very inspired by what other people do.

{"Headline": "Yemeni Bankers Get in Trouble Over a Customer, Al Qaeda", "Date": "2016-11-15", "News": "Supported byAL SHIHR, Yemen \u2014 When fighters from Al Qaeda seized control of a stretch of southern Yemen in 2015, they looted millions of dollars from the central bank, spreading such fear that other banks shut down.But during the year Al Qaeda reigned, Al Omgy Brothers Money Exchange kept running its business here in the coastal town of Al Shihr. It held accounts for the national oil company, disbursed salaries for the Yemeni government and earned the praise of local officials for providing needed services during a tough time.And if members of Al Qaeda wanted to open accounts, too, well, the company could not really say no, according to Muhammad al-Omgy, who runs the money exchange with his brother, Said.The United States was not impressed.During an interview in his office here, Mr. Omgy acknowledged that his company had provided financial services to Al Qaeda. \u201cWe had no other option but to comply with them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were the rulers of the city.\u201dBut he denied the Treasury Department\u2019s charge that he was a Qaeda member, describing his ties to the group as a business relationship that had ended. \u201cThey withdrew their money before they left the city,\u201d he said.The case of the Omgy brothers is a small but telling account of the chaos that has engulfed Yemen, the southernmost country on the Arabian Peninsula and the Arab world\u2019s poorest state.The Houthis now control the northwest, including the capital, where they have struggled to exert authority over what remains of the government. Much of the south and east are held by forces backed by Persian Gulf nations and are nominally loyal to the exiled president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi.So much upheaval has often left struggling Yemenis to deal with whichever armed group has most recently taken control. And so it was in April 2015, when Qaeda fighters seized territory along Yemen\u2019s southern coast \u2014 and turned to the Omgy brothers for their banking needs.Mr. Omgy was so upset by the charge against him that he invited an employee of The New York Times to his office in Al Shihr to tell his side of the story.His headquarters bore testament to the business\u2019s success, with green marble floors, comfortable sofas and central air-conditioning \u2014 a luxury in a country where millions struggle to find enough food, much less power to charge their phones. Three new Lexus sport utility vehicles were parked outside.The brothers opened their first money exchange in 1990 and now have 95 offices across Yemen that work like banks, holding accounts and performing inexpensive money transfers, Mr. Omgy said.\u201cI received the news from social media and news sites,\u201d Mr. Omgy said of the Americans\u2019 designation of him as a Qaeda member. \u201cI have never financed Qaeda activities nor joined the organization.\u201dHe did, however, acknowledge doing the group\u2019s banking.After the militants seized the area, the brothers closed their offices, he said, but reopened because none of the banks would. The local branch of Yemen\u2019s national oil company maintained an account, as did the civilian council that helped run local affairs. Even the government relied on the company to get salaries to its employees, according to Yemeni officials.The United States said in its designation that a Qaeda official in charge of taxation had held an account with Al Omgy from which he sent money to militants around Yemen. It also said that early this year Al Qaeda ordered the oil company to transfer more than $1 million to Al Omgy \u201cto support terrorist activities.\u201dMr. Omgy said he had been forced to give the militants accounts. \u201cWe opened the accounts when they threatened us,\u201d he said.Then, to pay their taxes, the oil company and local businessmen would ask Al Omgy to transfer money from their accounts to those of Al Qaeda.He denied that the company had paid Al Qaeda a 10 percent commission on all transactions, as the United States also charged, but said that individual Qaeda members could have transferred money through the company.\u201cWe have branches everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could not reject their orders.\u201dHe dismissed the rest of the United States\u2019 charges, that he had smuggled arms for Al Qaeda and that his brother had raised funds for the Iraqi insurgency.\u201cI have neither political nor religious affiliations,\u201d he said.Staying open had been the only way the company could provide services for others, he said, including the Yemeni government, which the United States considers an ally against Al Qaeda.\u201cThe government asked us to turn to Al Omgy,\u201d said Saeed Bahmran, who works for the Education Ministry in Al Mukalla, a nearby city also seized by Al Qaeda. \u201cAl Omgy has branches everywhere, and we can get our salaries at anytime, even at midnight.\u201dMohammed Sharem, the director of the local branch of the national oil company during Al Qaeda\u2019s control, said, \u201cOur relationship with Al Omgy is strong and it is an excellent company.\u201dMr. Omgy is unsure how the designation, which the Americans made in cooperation with the United Arab Emirates, will affect his business, as he has no assets in either country. But he is looking for ways to challenge a decision that he says has tarnished his name.Its effects may have already hit others.A soldier with the local force supported by the United Arab Emirates in southern Yemen said that so many of his colleagues used to get their salaries through Al Omgy that the company would deliver the cash to their base to prevent backups at its branches.But last month, their pay did not come.\u201cThis is the first time they haven\u2019t paid our salaries,\u201d said the soldier, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being associated with a company associated with Al Qaeda.Saeed Al-Batati reported from Al Shihr, and Ben Hubbard from Beirut, Lebanon.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump to Accept Inauguration Funds From Corporations and Big Donors", "Date": "2016-11-23", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump will allow corporations and wealthy individuals to make large donations to fund the activities surrounding his inauguration, complicating his promise to eliminate special interests from influencing his government.Mr. Trump plans to ban money from registered lobbyists, whom he has purged from his transition team and barred from working for his administration. But the restrictions will be lighter on corporations and individuals \u2014 the groups that have traditionally provided a vast majority of funding for the festivities surrounding the transfer of power.Mr. Trump, who like Mr. Obama campaigned on reducing the influence of money in politics, appears poised to relax them further.Officials planning the inauguration said Mr. Trump would solicit corporate donations up to $1 million and allow money to be transferred from political action committees on a case-by-case basis. The inaugural committee has not reached a decision on where to cap gifts from individuals, if at all.All told, Mr. Trump hopes to raise roughly $65 million to $75 million to fund the parade, balls and other festivities surrounding his swearing-in as president, according to several people involved in the planning efforts.Such a fund-raising total, if it materializes, would easily surpass the $43 million Mr. Obama\u2019s team raised for his 2013 inauguration and the $53 million, a record, that it raised for his first inauguration in 2009.Thomas Barrack Jr., a private equity investor who is heading the committee responsible for planning the events surrounding Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration on Jan. 20, said the decision to limit donations from certain groups was \u201cin line with the president-elect\u2019s thoughts on ethics reform.\u201dBut campaign finance experts said the restrictions left much to be desired, targeting groups that traditionally provide little funding for the occasion while seemingly letting bigger donors \u2014 including corporate interests that Mr. Trump took aim at on the campaign trail \u2014 off the hook.\u201cFor the most part, they are illusory, because they are restricting money that doesn\u2019t really play any significant role in funding the inauguration,\u201d said Fred Wertheimer, a longtime advocate of campaign finance overhaul, referring to the restrictions on lobbyists and foreign interests.The corporate and individual money that does traditionally play a significant role, he added, would be allowed to flow more or less unabated, leaving the potential of undue influence in place.\u201cYou can\u2019t have a more ideal opportunity to buy influence and ingratiate yourself with a new administration than by giving a huge contribution to pay for their inauguration,\u201d Mr. Wertheimer said.Bob Biersack, a senior fellow at the Center for Responsive Politics, was more forgiving toward Mr. Trump, but he said it would take a fundamental change in the way inaugurations were funded to meaningfully root out special interests.\u201cI don\u2019t find it fundamentally inconsistent with what he is saying,\u201d he said. \u201cI just think the rhetoric and the reality are different.\u201dPresidential transition committees, which coordinate and finance most of the festivities that surround the federally funded swearing-in ceremony, face few of the fund-raising restrictions campaigns do, and their practices vary from president to president.The committee is still in the early stages of assembling what will be an operation employing hundreds of people responsible for planning dozens of events. As of Wednesday morning, the fund-raising packages that are typically used to solicit donations were still being vetted by lawyers, and subcommittees were still taking shape to handle issues like security and entertainment.\u201cIt\u2019s like putting on the Olympics in 61 days,\u201d Mr. Barrack said, adding that the committee was racing to finalize plans by the end of the week.Two people working with the committee said it planned to roll out tiered giving packages next week, most likely ranging from $25,000 to $1 million, that will reward donors with progressively more access to more intimate events with Mr. Trump and his team. The committee is planning to hold two official balls, according to two people involved in the planning. By comparison, Mr. Obama attended 10 official balls in 2009.Mr. Trump is not expected to donate to the festivities himself, as he did to the campaign, according to members of the committee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss plans that had not been finalized.Sara Armstrong, a longtime Republican National Committee official who helped plan the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this summer, has been appointed chief executive and is leading the team that Mr. Barrack said would eventually total 350 people out of an office building just off the National Mall. As of Wednesday, the committee had hired about 100 people, he said.The committee includes generous donors to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, like Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets; Gail Icahn, the wife of the investor Carl Icahn; and the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam. Several stalwart backers of Republican causes, like Stephen A. Wynn and Lewis M. Eisenberg, are on the committee, as is Brian Ballard, Mr. Trump\u2019s longtime Florida lobbyist.The overall cost of the inauguration and related festivities is likely to run to as much as $200 million. Most of that burden will fall on taxpayers, though, who fund everything from security to the swearing-in ceremony and inaugural luncheon organized by a joint committee of Congress.Mr. Trump\u2019s team said it was expecting two million to three million people to flood Washington for the ceremony, a crowd that could surpass the 1.8 million estimated to have been on hand for Mr. Obama\u2019s first inauguration, which was a record. Planners are also expecting more protesters than usual around the event.Mr. Barrack said Mr. Trump had instructed him to plan events tailored to the political moment.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the greatest opportunities that this president has to put his fingerprints on bridging the divide,\u201d Mr. Barrack said on Wednesday.Mike Litterst, a spokesman for the National Park Service, which controls the Mall and other public spaces where the inauguration will take place, said on Monday that the Park Service did not expect to meet with officials from the group until after Thanksgiving.But across Washington, the physical preparations for Jan. 20 are well underway, even as the city\u2019s political establishment is struggling to come to terms with the election outcome.Capitol architects have been hammering away since September on the more than 10,000-square-foot inaugural platform overlooking the Mall. And outside the White House, Park Service staff members are at work on the presidential reviewing stand where Mr. Trump will review his inaugural parade.Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

They Hope It Can Last.", "Date": "2016-11-28", "News": "Supported by\u201cDrugs, corruption \u2014 it\u2019s happening all around us,\u201d Mr. Mendoza said recently at his studio in Mandaluyong, a city that is part of metropolitan Manila.In the film, Rosa (Jaclyn Jose) is a working-class convenience-store owner who resorts to low-level drug dealing to support her family. After she and her husband are arrested by the corrupt local police, their four children must scramble to buy back their freedom.\u201cRosa may be a bad citizen, but she is a good person and a good parent,\u201d Mr. Mendoza said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t see this perspective.\u201dHas Mr. Duterte, the Philippines\u2019 most zealous antidrug crusader, seen the movie?\u201cI invited him to the premiere and sent him a copy of the DVD,\u201d said Mr. Mendoza, who directed the president\u2019s State of the Nation address in July. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s seen it.\u201dMr. Mendoza is part of a growing wave of moviemakers in the Philippines who are using their medium to shed light on often overlooked corners of society.Many of their films are neorealist in style, telling stories of poverty, drugs, postcolonial malaise, bureaucratic corruption, environmental ills, homosexuality and the thriving ethnic diversity found across this archipelago nation. Typically made independently, without studio backing and on shoestring budgets, the films often blur the lines between documentary and feature.Many have also found their way onto the international festival circuit \u2014 some with great success.It\u2019s been a remarkable turnaround for an industry that just 15 years ago was nearly moribund. In the early 2000s, production had dwindled to about 50 films a year, from around 150 in the 1980s.The country has experienced what are often called two golden ages of film: in the 1950s, and again in the 1970s and early 1980s (during the martial law years under President Ferdinand E. Marcos).During that second wave, directors like Lino Brocka, Ishmael Bernal and Mike de Leon, working in the face of censorship imposed by the Marcos regime, made their names with socially conscious and political films and paved the way for this generation of independent filmmakers.But the film industry as a whole struggled with piracy and competition from Hollywood. Not until the early 2000s did independent film begin to flourish again.With the introduction of digital technology, the costs of making a film dropped substantially. And with less money on the line, filmmakers and investors became more willing to experiment with different forms of storytelling.\u201cDigital technology virtually emancipated us,\u201d said Mr. Diaz, who is known for his experimental slow-cinema style. \u201cWe own the medium now.\u201dAround the same time, finding the money to make new work became easier after the advent of several Philippine independent-film festivals.\u201cBefore, it seemed like there was nothing more to learn about Filipino culture through film,\u201d said Laurice Guillen, a veteran director and a founder of Cinemalaya. \u201cBut then the submissions starting coming in, and it was amazing. Most were stories that we had never heard of before.\u201dWith Mr. Mendoza and Mr. Diaz leading the way, many say the environment for independent Filipino filmmaking has continued to improve. More festivals have sprung up, and sources of financing have proliferated. In recent years, directors like Erik Matti (already an established director of mainstream fare), Raya Martin and Jerrold Tarog have come to the fore.As a result, more independent filmmakers have turned to the international festival circuit in search of recognition. For many, it is also their best chance to find foreign distribution. After its Golden Lion win in Venice, for example, \u201cThe Woman Who Left\u201d was picked up by distributors in countries including China, France and Italy. \u201cMa\u2019 Rosa\u201d will be released in France on Wednesday.Some critics say the films favored by festivals abroad tend to cater to a widespread perception of the Philippines as a bleak, impoverished place of slums, corruption and drugs. The term \u201cpoverty porn\u201d is often tossed around, but filmmakers vehemently oppose that characterization.Mr. Mendoza turned the question around. \u201cI live in a developing country,\u201d he said, adding that a large percentage of people live below the poverty line. \u201cSo is it poverty porn when you are telling stories of society?\u201dBut with the ascension of Mr. Duterte to the presidency, whether filmmakers will now dare to touch such subjects is an open question.\u201cThere will be upheaval,\u201d said Ms. Guillen, the Cinemalaya co-founder. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure how this will be reflected in our films, if at all.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Picks Elaine Chao for Transportation Secretary", "Date": "2016-11-29", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 She is a woman and an immigrant, a fixture of the Republican establishment for two decades. She is a savvy and professional practitioner of the capital\u2019s inside game.And now she is going to work for President-elect Donald J. Trump.Mr. Trump named Elaine L. Chao on Tuesday as his choice to be the next secretary of transportation, elevating someone whose background and experience are in many respects completely at odds with the brash and disruptive tenor of his anti-Washington campaign.But her selection also signaled Mr. Trump\u2019s understanding of the need to surround himself with people who can help him accomplish the most ambitious parts of his agenda, even if they come from the political establishment he has so often scorned.His transportation secretary is likely to be one of the more essential players. Mr. Trump, a real estate magnate, has said that infrastructure redevelopment will be a priority of his first 100 days in office. And Ms. Chao has experience \u2014 politically and personally \u2014 in navigating the competing centers of power in the capital. She is married to Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader.Before that, she worked in various departments across the federal government. She was a White House fellow under President Ronald Reagan and the director of the Peace Corps under President George Bush, who also named her deputy transportation secretary.\u201cThat says something,\u201d said Richard F. Hohlt, a veteran Republican consultant and friend of Ms. Chao\u2019s. \u201cShe knows how to work a bureaucracy, and she knows how to last.\u201dThat is not her only connection to the world of Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corporation includes Fox. She sits on the company\u2019s board of directors.She adds some diversity to a cabinet that is so far heavily older, white and male. Ms. Chao, 63, was born in Taiwan and moved to the United States with her family when she was 8.A list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.Sometimes they also came for her, and she was happy to take them on as well. After a liberal Kentucky group suggested in 2013 that Ms. Chao was somehow connected to the flight of American jobs to China \u2014 a jab evidently intended to portray Mr. McConnell as too cozy with American business interests \u2014 she starred in a commercial and rushed to his defense. \u201cFar-left special interests are also attacking my ethnicity, even attacking Mitch\u2019s patriotism, because he\u2019s married to me,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s how low some people will stoop.\u201dMr. Trump was impressed by her energy and drive, a senior transition official said, speaking anonymously to reveal the private interactions between Ms. Chao and the president-elect. He also admired her no-nonsense attitude, this official said.At the time, she dismissed those concerns as \u201cpartisan.\u201dHer time out of government service is likely to be the biggest area of focus for labor and other left-leaning interests, though her confirmation in the Senate does not appear to be in any doubt. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, praised her government service on Tuesday, and said he hoped to work collaboratively with her and Mr. Trump on an infrastructure plan, which would have to make it through the Senate her husband leads.\u201cI hope Secretary Chao shares that ambitious goal and is willing to work with Democrats,\u201d Mr. Schumer said.But other private-sector work could prove to be an asset. She was a banker for Citicorp and helped close transactions that involved transportation financing.The financing issue she will confront now is altogether different, however. Despite the consensus that the nation\u2019s infrastructure is in dire need of an overhaul, Congress and the White House have been unable to agree on how to pay for it.\u201cThat\u2019s where the creative thinking takes place,\u201d said Ray LaHood, who served as transportation secretary under President Obama. He also worked with Ms. Chao when he served in Congress and she was labor secretary. Given her understanding of the complexities of the private sector and the dysfunction of Washington, Mr. LaHood added, Ms. Chao was a strong candidate.\u201cI\u2019m as optimistic as I\u2019ve been in a long time about the potential she brings to finally get something done on infrastructure,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated the sequence in which Elaine L. Chao was selected by President-elect Donald J. Trump to head the Department of Transportation. She was not the first woman chosen by Mr. Trump to join his cabinet.Jeremy W.

But when tendinitis seized his ankle and crept up his shins until they swelled, Pete Kostelnick second-guessed himself for trying to log the fastest run across America ever recorded. He was still only in Nevada.\u201cThere was pain and agony,\u201d said Kostelnick, a 29-year-old who had taken eight weeks off from his finance job in Lincoln, Neb., for the roughly 3,100-mile journey from San Francisco to New York. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t planned that way. I am very competitive, but I realized, running 80 miles a day was overkill.\u201dSo he strictly limited his daily running to 70 miles \u2014 40 beginning at 4 a.m., and then 30 more after lunch, every day. He replaced the energy by eating 13,000 calories a day. And last week, he set a record for running across the United States, in 42 days 6 hours 30 minutes. The previous record was set in 1980.Kostelnick is one of a quickly growing number of extreme American distance runners shattering a cascade of ultramarathon records that can sound less like races than log entries from an excursion by Lewis and Clark. Fastest trip around the Grand Canyon, from \u201crim to rim to rim\u201d (Jim Walmsley: 42 miles in 5 hours 55 minutes). Fastest completion of the Appalachian Trail (Karl Meltzer: 2,190 miles in 45 days). Those were in the last two months.\u201cUltras are about the allure of the impossible, like when George Mallory said he climbed Everest because it\u2019s there, but for those of us who spend our days in cubicles,\u201d said David Roche, an ultra runner and coach. And, he noted, these feats are not exactly being kept a secret. \u201cOne hundred miles is really impressive both at the water cooler and inside your own head.\u201dIn a time when marathon participation is so common it can seem ordinary, part of the appeal of events longer than 26.2 miles is that they remain relatively exotic \u2014 for now. Since 2005, finishes in North American ultra races have grown at a rate of 14.6 percent. (That figure does not include those who enter but are turned away because of race caps; last year, the probability of getting into the Western States 100-Mile Endurance Run, the sport\u2019s unofficial equivalent of the Super Bowl, was 4.7 percent.)The number of races is growing, as well; last year, there were 144 100-mile races in North America, up from 34 a decade earlier. They are typically held in the wilderness, but can take place anywhere \u2014 the longest race on a certified course is the Self-Transcendence 3,100-Mile Race, which involves 5,649 laps around a block in Queens.For many, pushing the line between thrill and danger is exactly the point.\u201cThe mind, the mental anguish, is actually even harder than the physical,\u201d said Karl Hoagland, the publisher of Ultrarunning Magazine. \u201cWith every ounce of your energy and your being, you want it to be over and to stop in the worst, most primal way. We\u2019re programmed for survival, for the mind to shut the body down when we\u2019re on empty, so you have to overcome that. Ultra runners are trained to get their body closer to empty.\u201dThe uninitiated may question the wisdom of disregarding mental cues that promote survival.\u201cMaybe it is really unhealthy, but for me, I\u2019m curious,\u201d Hoagland said. \u201cI only live once, and I want to see what it\u2019s like to go to these dark places, where we\u2019re not intended to be. At his or her core, an ultra runner is meant to go beyond what is rational. It\u2019s crazy, but that\u2019s how we are.\u201dRoche said the events were a chance to explore limits on one\u2019s own terms \u2014 like a dress rehearsal for real adversity.\u201cLife now is pretty sterile \u2014 a lot of the problems we face are manufactured,\u201d Roche said. \u201cWhen things go wrong in ultras, it\u2019s very real and visceral, and you confront it. It\u2019s life condensed down to a bite-size morsel that you can generally consume without consequence. If you don\u2019t finish, it doesn\u2019t actually matter.\u201dAs the number of races grows in pace with demand, the reclusive sport is changing. Although races generally offer little in prizes, money and sponsorship have begun to trickle in, along with some of the governance concerns that have plagued mainstream road racing. Lance Armstrong, barred from competition in many sports, won a trail race last year, driving debate around future regulation of performance-enhancing drugs in the sport.And professional runners are increasingly drawn to the longer distances. The 2008 American Olympic marathoner Magdalena Boulet won her 100-mile debut at the Western States Endurance Run last year and continues to dominate the field. The Olympic distance runner Kara Goucher, who grew up in a town near that of the champion ultra runner Scott Jurek in Minnesota, also sees a new athletic future in the sport. Although she is one of the most accomplished marathon runners in the United States, Goucher said she was daunted by the challenge of even finishing such a distance.\u201cI\u2019m attracted to the challenge, and I think the first time I do it I will be facing my fears of not finishing, and just surviving, seeing if I compete without quitting,\u201d said Goucher, 38. \u201cI was very nervous for my first marathon; I had never run that far. But I was also fearful of others\u2019 expectations of me, whereas if I do an ultra, no one\u2019s going to care.\u201cPeople run ultras because they love running. I think about what\u2019s gotten me out the door year after year, and I think, these could be my people. We\u2019re all just trying to do the best we can.\u201dAs the sport grows more and more extreme, some runners are not satisfied with going farther, faster \u2014 they have also increased frequency. This year, Michael Wardian, a former lacrosse player, hopped from a 100-kilometer race in Hong Kong (30th place) to a 100K (seventh place) in New Zealand to a marathon in Tokyo, where he ran a 2:28:14. That was just in one month.The backbone of the sport, however, remains a community founded by proud eccentrics, now warily trying to preserve its insular identity amid an influx of newcomers while maintaining that the activity is uniquely inclusive and accessible.\u201cIn the marathon, there is a time goal, but in ultramarathoning, because the distance is so great and the goal is so big, people usually focus on simply finishing, so more people can do it,\u201d Jurek said. \u201cGender and age get thrown out the window. Youth does help, but experience and wisdom and tenacity are critical. It comes down to mental fortitude. I\u2019m a believer that everyone can run an ultramarathon.\u201dUltra runners argue that despite the strength required to complete their feats of endurance, they are more easygoing than runners of shorter distances \u2014 because, by running standards, they are rarely moving very fast.\u201cI\u2019m a pretty laid-back guy to begin with; I don\u2019t get nervous before races, because you don\u2019t have to,\u201d said Meltzer, who at 48 set the Appalachian Trail record and has won more 100-mile races than anyone else. \u201cNobody takes off sprinting at the start of a 100-miler. What are you going to gain if you take off the first mile? You have 99 to go.\u201dHe said ultra racing had reconfigured his understanding of what he was capable of doing.\u201cPeople are starting to understand that if you go a lot slower, you can go a lot longer,\u201d Meltzer said. \u201cAnd you really can go longer than you ever thought possible.\u201dIn a sport founded on the principle of \u201cno limits,\u201d not everyone is looking for more.\u201cNow 200-milers are the big thing, and I think that\u2019s so crazy,\u201d said Hoagland, who has finished nine 100-mile races. \u201cWhy would you want to do that?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Definitions of America", "Date": "2016-11-26", "News": "Supported byLettersReaders discuss identity politics and how it promotes or impedes our coming together.What made America \u201cexceptional\u201d at its founding was that our ethnic identity was not what made us Americans. Rather, it was simply allegiance to the ideals of the country, even when we fall short of those ideals. In contrast, the worst moments in our history have occurred when we have focused and acted on our ethnic differences: slavery, Japanese internment, extirpation of Native Americans, hostility to the latest immigrant group. Many of world history\u2019s most tragic circumstances developed where ethnic identity superseded tolerance and unity.Pursuing collective goals of liberty and security and prosperity \u2014 and happiness \u2014 should unite us both as a people and at the voting booth. PETER COFFEYMadison, Conn.To the Editor: Mark Lilla disparaged an important element of the Democratic Party\u2019s platform, to unproductive effect. Considering the low voter turnout on the left and the fact that there have always been vocal sexists and racists in the American electorate (emboldened, not created, by the alt-right), the work of the Democratic Party in the next two years will not involve minimizing the importance of what Mr. Lilla dismissively calls \u201cidentity politics,\u201d but in fact embracing this agenda.Democrats should double down on the battles for equal rights in America, and work to clarify to the swing voters precisely what these battles consist of \u2014 for in their ideal application, equal rights do not step on the toes of any special interest group. In a November marked by the normalizing of hate speech, it would be catastrophic for liberals to shy away from the progressive agenda that has defined the party\u2019s social platform.BRITTANY K. ALLENBrooklynTo the Editor: The \u201cfixation on diversity\u201d Mark Lilla refers to is an affirmation process for those of us who are not white. That \u201claziest story in American journalism\u201d about \u201cthe first X to do Y\u201d demonstrates to women, immigrants and minority groups that we can overcome significant barriers to educational, economic and political advancement.Mr. Lilla suggests that liberals focus on commonality rather than difference. But Donald Trump succeeded by playing the identity card, too. Immigrants, Muslims and women equal bad. White men equal good. To suggest that curriculum, extracurricular activities and a national narrative that uplifts diverse identities are to blame for the failure of our presidential candidates in 2016 is a deeply flawed argument.And the Kumbaya image at the end of Mr. Lilla\u2019s article happens every day in America, most notably at naturalization ceremonies, in which new Americans from hundreds of countries pledge their allegiance to America. It is a moment that unifies, but it is preceded and followed by a constant journey for belonging in America. SAYU BHOJWANINew YorkThe writer, a former commissioner of immigrant affairs for New York City, is the president and founder of the New American Leaders Project.To the Editor: Mark Lilla\u2019s article is essential reading. Liberals should weep over the thousands of industrial-state voters who went for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 but voted for Donald Trump this time. Those who think that all Trump voters are bigots have their eyes wide shut. Republican wedge and Democrat single-issue politics are flip sides of the same coin. They worked together to encourage maximum demands by both sides, lack of compromise and divisiveness in America.More important, the inane culture wars of the last 40 years gave liberal and conservative politicians cover for not addressing structural changes in the economy beginning with wholesale closing of steel and auto plants in the early 1980s and the dominance of Big Finance later in the decade.CARLYN MEYEREnglewood, Colo.To the Editor: Mark Lilla\u2019s advocacy of a \u201cpost-identity liberalism\u201d is really a plea to the disenfranchised and discriminated against to subordinate their fight for equality to the pursuit of some common electoral denominator that won\u2019t discomfort white America. This is neither fair nor realistic.My fellow progressive Democrats surely must do a better job of weaving the aspirations of all Americans into a common narrative, but not at the expense of those whose primary political goals are merely equal treatment under the law.RORY I. LANCMANNew YorkThe writer is a member of the New York City Council.To the Editor: Thanks to Mark Lilla for his thoughtful essay. I agree that the hyphenation rhetoric is divisive and had a shock of recognition in noting that Hillary Clinton rarely included white Americans in her lists of those to be included. So this strategy of outreach will be helpful for going forward.But the hateful actions against otherness are alive, emboldened and harming people now. A friend who goes around to public schools presenting the stories of the Freedom Riders, Jackie Robinson, Emmett Till and others who have had to struggle for their civil rights reports that he has seen the white racist rhetoric spewing out of the mouths of elementary school students against their minority classmates.We thought that we had moved beyond the times of ingrained bias. Trump politics has taken us back decades. We need to demand the safety and constitutional rights for our fellow minority citizens now, without pandering. DEB BALDWINChapel Hill, N.C.To the Editor: In grammar school, I was taught that America is a melting pot. We were to mix our individual identities for the common good.

{"Headline": "Who Wins if California Voters Tax E-Cigarettes?", "Date": "2016-11-06", "News": "Supported byWearing a white lab coat, the doctor looks straight at the camera and explains why Californians should vote against higher taxes on tobacco products.\u201cI do everything in my power to stop people from smoking, but that\u2019s not what Prop 56 is really about,\u201d says Dr. Arnold Zeiderman, an obstetrician. The proposed new tax, he says, is really about lining the pockets of \u201cwealthy special interests.\u201dIn addition to placing higher taxes on cigarettes, the measure would tax electronic cigarettes just like other tobacco products for the first time.The measure is a potential boon for state coffers but is also considered a major threat by the tobacco industry, which relies increasingly on its e-cigarette business.Similar fights are playing out across the country. Cigarette companies have spent nearly $4 million to defeat a ballot measure in North Dakota on Tuesday that would also impose a tax on e-cigarettes. This year, at least 17 other states considered legislation to tax e-cigarettes, but only Pennsylvania and West Virginia actually did, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.But nowhere has the fight been more heated than in California, where progressive legislation is often seen as a bellwether for other states. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco and Philip Morris, both of which have their own e-cigarette units, have spent more than $70 million collectively on ads, mailers and other efforts to defeat the ballot measure, making it one of the industry\u2019s most expensive political campaigns.The new taxes could add up to millions of dollars for states, making up for some of the revenue lost as cigarette sales have fallen. Last year, for example, California collected about $750 million from cigarette taxes, down from more than $1 billion in 2005, according to a report from the consulting firm Orzechowski and Walker.But taxes will not affect just big tobacco companies. A number of small vape shops have closed since Pennsylvania\u2019s new 40 percent tax on the wholesale price of e-cigarettes, also called vape pens, went into effect on Oct. 1.At Vegas Vapes in Bryn Mawr, outside Philadelphia, a sign that says \u201cZero Vape Shops = Zero Tax Collected\u201d hangs in the window. The owner, Raffi Farraj, said he had to pass on some of that cost to customers, but not so much that it drives business away.\u201cIf I ate all 40 percent, I\u2019d be closed by the end of the year,\u201d Mr. Farraj said. \u201cIf I charged 40 percent, I\u2019d be closed by the end of the year.\u201dSo far, though, any potential new restrictions appear to be years away. Under the new rule, e-cigarette companies have two years to submit scientific information to the F.D.A. for approval.And the industry is trying to use that timing to its advantage. Until the agency knows more, manufacturers say, it is unfair to tax e-cigarettes the same way as cigarettes.\u201cIt could impede adult consumer interest in vapor products before F.D.A. has had the opportunity to develop a full regulatory approach,\u201d said David Sutton, a spokesman for Altria. The company owns Philip Morris, one of the world\u2019s largest tobacco companies, and the e-cigarette company Nu Mark.Still, groups like the American Lung Association have seized on the F.D.A.\u2019s decision as evidence that more restrictions on e-cigarettes are necessary.\u201cSo much of the product research on them has been limited,\u201d said Erika Sward, the assistant vice president for national advocacy at the lung association. \u201cThe comparison cannot be whether they are as lethal as cigarettes. The comparison is what their impact is on the public health.\u201dThe association has expressed particular concern about children. E-cigarettes can come in flavors like strawberry and apple. Health advocates argue that such flavors entice young people, who are then more inclined to move to cigarettes.\u201cE-cigarettes are a very important element of recruiting kids,\u201d said Mr. Glantz of the center for tobacco research.The \u201cstandard mantra\u201d on cigarette taxes, Ms. Sward said, is that every 10 percent increase yields a 3 to 4 percent decline in smoking among adults, and a 7 percent decline among young people.\u201cKids are really price sensitive,\u201d Mr. Glantz said. \u201cKeeping the price of e-cigarettes low is really important to the tobacco companies.\u201dIn a statement, Blue Shield said it was supporting Proposition 56 because raising taxes was a proven public health approach that would save its members from a \u201clifetime of addiction.\u201dIn addition, some in the vaping industry have criticized health advocates for their ties to pharmaceutical giants. The lung association, for example, has received millions of dollars from Pfizer\u2019s foundation. Pfizer makes Chantix, a drug to help people quit smoking.In a follow-up statement, Ms. Sward of the lung association said that corporate foundations were an \u201cimportant pillar in funding nonprofits.\u201d\u201cNo funder influences our position, agenda or science-based messages,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Trump\u2019s Win, an Anxious Mexico Asks: What\u2019s Next?", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "Supported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 Ever since the election of Donald J. Trump to the American presidency, Juan Pardinas, a Mexican academic, has been thinking back to his childhood.Specifically, the Cold War era, when his days as a young boy were filled with a medium-grade anxiety that the Russians might incite a nuclear war that could devastate North America.\u201cIt\u2019s the same feeling of uncertainty,\u201d said Mr. Pardinas, a graduate of the London School of Economics whose work on anti-corruption legislation has been roundly praised in Mexico. \u201cThe feeling that politics has become a source of bitterness, anguish and uncertainty is really sad.\u201d\u201cThis may not affect people on the top of our country, but it can only mean bad news for us merchants and lower, working-class people in Mexico,\u201d said Claudia Rivera, a street vendor who owns a food cart in Mexico City.Outside of concerns about the election, violence has been soaring to levels not seen since the start of the drug war a decade ago. And corruption and a loss of faith in the political leadership had already plunged the nation into a state of gloom. Now, the loss for many is external, too.\u201cA lot of people see the U.S. as a beacon of freedom, as something to aspire to,\u201d said Mr. Pardinas, who works on legislation and economic competitiveness. \u201cBut what happens when you lose a role model, the role model of a nation? Now all of us who admired the U.S. are having second thoughts.\u201d\u201cWe are really in need of some reassurance,\u201d said Mr. Pardinas, echoing the sentiment of dozens interviewed in the wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s election. \u201cBut you need political leadership for that, and we are short on those attributes.\u201dPresident Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto and his administration have adopted a diplomatic and hopeful posture toward Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency.In a statement after the election, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto said the results \u201copen a new chapter in the relationship between Mexico and the United States, which will imply a change, a challenge, but also, it\u2019s necessary to say, a big opportunity.\u201dHe was sure, he said, that the relationship would be one of \u201ctrust and mutual respect\u201d that would \u201cbuild prosperity\u201d for both countries. He also recounted that he had congratulated Mr. Trump by phone earlier and that the men had discussed the possibility of meeting again in the coming months \u201cto define, with total clarity, the course that the relationship between the two countries will have to take.\u201dHowever, behind the scenes, there was a deep worry regarding the transition, most immediately the possibility of mass deportations of Mexicans living in the United States.Armando R\u00edos Piter, an opposition senator representing the state of Guerrero, said that after enduring Mr. Trump\u2019s hostile discourse for a year and a half, Mexicans deserved a more robust response from their president.\u201cIt was a very light response to a very dangerous threat,\u201d he said.As Mr. Trump prepared to take office, he continued, Mexico needs to establish its position regarding the United States wall with \u201cfirmness, clarity and dignity.\u201dInstead, \u201cwe are left with a politically light position that doesn\u2019t say anything,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t settle for a statement that says, \u2018I spoke with Trump.\u2019\u201dIn September, in anticipation of a possible Trump victory, Mr. R\u00edos submitted bills that would strengthen Mexico\u2019s hand. The bills, which have languished in the Senate, would allow the government to penalize American investments in Mexico should Mr. Trump follow through on his promises to tax or block remittances by Mexicans in the United States to finance his proposed border wall.The legislation would also make it explicitly illegal for the Mexican federal government to finance anything that could be interpreted as a border wall, and it stipulated that if the United States decided to pull out of Nafta, as Mr. Trump has threatened, the Mexican legislature would review the dozens of agreements and treaties that govern the bilateral relationship.In truth, the Mexican government is in a difficult place. Some Mexicans say their leaders must be careful not to antagonize the new president of the United States with their own incendiary comments, given the economic importance America holds in Mexico.\u201cIt is worrying and frightening to know that the loud guy holding a stick in his hand, saying he is coming to get you, to beat you up, is actually in power to do so now,\u201d said Leticia Vega, a Mexican lawyer.Business leaders, meanwhile, have begun the process of normalizing Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency. Though most executives have adopted a wait-and-see approach, they are continuing with business as usual.\u201cSometimes the rhetoric is very different from the actual business of governing,\u201d said Alejandro Ramirez, the head of the largest business consortium in Mexico and the chief executive of Cin\u00e9polis, which runs movie theaters across the Americas. \u201cWhen you have to face the reality of governing you have to look much deeper into the facts, to see whether what you are proposing makes sense.\u201dMr. Ramirez buys $40 million worth of goods from the United States every year to run his cinemas, from popcorn and nacho cheese to audio equipment. If free trade were upended, those purchases might be made from other countries, he said.Few thought a Trump presidency was possible. Now most are banking on a stark difference between Candidate Trump and President Trump, meaning that he will not be as harsh on Mexico as promised. Business consortiums and trade interest groups have taken a proactive stance on engaging the president-elect.\u201cIf the Mexican government is smart about this, if they anticipate correctly the concerns of the incoming administration, they can build an agenda to which the Trump administration can respond,\u201d said Duncan Wood, the director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center, which promotes relations between the United States and Mexico through research. \u201cThe immediate reaction I got from board members is that this is the moment for us to actually engage.\u201dFor some, though, Mexico\u2019s own problems loomed larger than a Trump presidency.\u201cThe problems that we have generated here, in Mexico, ourselves are far more worrisome and immediate,\u201d said Juan de la Vega, 42, a lawyer who has a brother living illegally in San Francisco. \u201cThose are the ones I worry about the most because they affect my life directly, like the stagnant economy, corruption and insecurity.\u201d\u201cIn the grand scale of things, we as Mexicans know how to accept, assume and transcend this Trump thing,\u201d he added.Paulina Villegas and Kirk Semple contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The three schools that would be significantly affected by the move are at the southern end of Community School District 3, which encompasses the Upper West Side and part of Harlem. While the district is racially and economically diverse as a whole, many of its elementary schools are not.The New York City Education Department released its plan to redraw school zones in Community School District 3 in Manhattan, which encompasses the Upper West Side and part of Harlem.The department\u2019s proposal would redistribute students and move two of the schools into different buildings. In an elaborate dance, P.S. 191 would shift to a newly constructed building just over a block away from its current home, which the department hopes will give the school a fresh start. P.S. 452, which presently shares a building with two other schools, would move into P.S. 191\u2019s current building, where it could serve twice as many students as it now does. Some families currently zoned for P.S. 199 would instead be put into the P.S. 191 zone. And P.S. 452 would add some of the present zones for P.S. 191 and P.S. 199.Overall, the effect would be to put many more white, well-off students in the P.S. 191 zone, while putting more poor, minority students into the zones for P.S. 199 and P.S. 452. The changes would only affect future students; no current students would have to change schools, and children with older siblings already attending one of the affected schools would get priority at those schools.The plan is similar to one offered last month by the District 3 Community Education Council, the group that will vote on changing the lines. The department said the council would vote by the end of the month, when parents can start registering their children for kindergarten.The controversy over the zones is likely to continue beyond the council\u2019s vote. Current P.S. 452 parents who oppose the school being moved have said they would sue to halt the plan. Residents of two buildings that would be rezoned from P.S. 199 to P.S. 191 \u2014 165 and 185 West End Avenue \u2014 have hired a lawyer, though their plans are unclear.The department also said on Wednesday that it was moving to consolidate two schools in Harlem, essentially closing Public School 241, which last year had only 112 students in kindergarten through fifth grade. To do that, the department is asking the council to approve redrawing the zone lines of five other schools. Students and staff now at P.S. 241 would be moved to Public School 76, eight blocks north.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mortgage Rates\u2019 Rise Catches Home Buyers \u2014 and Lenders \u2014 Off Guard", "Date": "2016-11-23", "News": "Supported byWhen Jared Rutledge called his mortgage broker one morning last week after putting in an offer on a home in Glendale, Ariz., just west of Phoenix, he discovered that the 3.8 percent rate he had been quoted a couple of months ago had already gone up to 4.125 percent. That afternoon, it had inched up to 4.25, and by evening, when he finally called back to finalize the deal, it was 4.375 percent.\u201cI was kind of frustrated,\u201d Mr. Rutledge said. But with a third child on the way, and a buyer for their current home, he and his wife felt they had little choice. \u201cInstead of holding out and waiting, we locked it in,\u201d he said.Since the election, mortgage rates have climbed roughly half a percentage point to a 16-month high, adding hundreds, sometimes thousands, of dollars to a home buyer\u2019s yearly payments. (The annual cost of a $400,000 mortgage, for example, rose almost $700.)The speed and size of the increase took many lenders and borrowers by surprise \u2014 and the increase is expected to reverberate across the housing industry, particularly if rates continue to rise next year.\u201cDoes it give people pause? Does it raise the cost of buying a home?\u201d Mr. Cecala asked. \u201cYes and yes.\u201dFor most of this year, American home buyers have benefited from weakness in the global economy. China has been struggling to sustain the rapid growth it needs to avoid political unrest, a deep recession followed political turmoil in Brazil, and a cloud of uncertainty hangs over Europe after Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union.Those factors, on top of efforts by central banks around the world to stimulate economic activity by keeping short-term interest rates low, have increased demand for safe American assets like government bonds and mortgage-backed securities. The result: The cost for American businesses and consumers to borrow had, until recently, remained exceptionally low.The turnaround, which was driven by postelection market expectations that a President Trump would lift corporate profits, cut taxes and spend money on infrastructure and roads, caught most experts by surprise. The online real estate brokerage Redfin, for example, had initially forecast that rates for 30-year fixed mortgages would remain below 4 percent through next year, said Glenn Kelman, the company\u2019s chief executive.Redfin has now updated its forecast and is predicting the 30-year mortgage rate will pass the 4 percent threshold. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see higher rates than we otherwise would have,\u201d Mr. Kelman said, \u201cbut more economic stimulus.\u201d\u201cMost consumers don\u2019t make decisions based on a change in mortgage rates,\u201d Ms. Gudell said. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with such a tight inventory, I think they\u2019re more focused on finding a home that they can afford. If mortgage rates go up by half a percent, that\u2019s not going to make them change their minds.\u201dBack then, the average 30-year fixed rate mortgage topped 6 percent, a reminder that even with the recent rate jump, mortgages remain a bargain by historical standards. Thirty years ago, the average rate was about 10 percent.Still, for buyers who had been counting on paying less than 3.5 percent, the postelection bump represents an unwelcome added cost.In the last couple of weeks, requests for refinancing have dropped, according to Gregory Gwizdz, national sales manager of Wells Fargo Home Lending, one of the nation\u2019s largest home loan originators. He expects that trend to continue through next year as rates stay at this level or inch higher.Although he hasn\u2019t seen any impact on home buying in the last two weeks, Mr. Gwizdz said that rate increases \u201ccreate some sense of urgency.\u201d\u201cIf people believe rates are on the rise,\u201d he said, \u201cthey may try to find that home sooner rather than later.\u201dHigher rates are often followed by a burst of activity from consumers worried about further increases. But Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said he had not seen evidence of pent-up demand. He thinks housing activity is heading for a fall.Even before this latest bump in rates, he was concerned about a drop in mortgage applications. Mortgage standards have tightened this year, he said, making it more difficult for buyers to qualify despite the steady uptick in wages.\u201cEven if applications don\u2019t go down further,\u201d Mr. Shepherdson said, \u201cwe are looking at a significant drop in home sales in the first quarter of next year.\u201dFor those looking to purchase a home, different types of loans may become more appealing.Buyers of new construction, who have to wait months for their homes to be completed, may be willing to pay a little more to lock in a lower rate for an extended period of time, Mr. Gwizdz said. Those who plan to move again in the next few years might be more likely to consider an adjustable-rate mortgage than before.In Westchester County, north of New York City, J.

{"Headline": "E.U. Plans Big Increase in Military Spending", "Date": "2016-11-30", "News": "Supported byBRUSSELS \u2014 European Union officials announced plans for a big increase in military spending on Wednesday, pledging to take greater responsibility for their security at a time when the United States appears to be taking a step back in its role in the world.The bloc\u2019s top officials proposed spending 5.5 billion euros, or $5.8 billion, a year to help governments acquire hardware, including helicopters and drones, and to develop military technology.Wary of concerns about consolidation of power in Brussels as member governments are under pressure from populist forces, officials stressed that the plan was in no way a step toward creating a European Union army. Member countries would own the hardware that was purchased, and much of the money would go to European companies.\u201cIf Europe does not take care of its own security, nobody else will do it for us,\u201d said Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union. \u201cA strong, competitive and innovative defense industrial base is what will give us strategic autonomy.\u201dTotal military spending by European Union governments was about \u20ac200 billion last year, but the union does not currently have a budget for military research or procurement. The plan foresees a pilot phase of \u20ac90 million, or $95 million, up to 2020 \u2014 and \u20ac500 million, or $528 million, a year after that \u2014 for research into technologies like drones and for cybersecurity tools.A second plank of the plan foresees spending 10 times that amount to help governments develop and buy hardware. But rather than drawing on the shared European Union budget, member states would make individual contributions, and some of the money might come from project-related bonds.Obama administration officials welcomed the increased spending. \u201cIt is no secret that we\u2019ve been asking them to do this for years,\u201d said one senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss alliance relations. But the official also said it was imperative that Mr. Trump reassured allies that his administration\u2019s commitment to collective defense of NATO allies would be solid.During his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump questioned whether the United States would automatically defend NATO allies if they were attacked, and said American support would depend on the willingness of those countries to pay their fair share for military protection. But since then, a number of Republican lawmakers and foreign policy experts \u2014 including those in close contact with Mr. Trump since he won the election \u2014 have insisted that the American commitment to NATO will remain strong.European Union leaders will discuss the proposal at a summit meeting in December. The member governments still must approve it, and that could be a lengthy process given concerns about sovereignty.Britain\u2019s financial and military connections to the rest of Europe.Politicians in countries like Lithuania and Poland, for example, might question whether the additional spending might be better devoted to bolstering NATO as a resurgent Russia is raising alarms in much of Central and Eastern Europe.Britain could be an obstacle, too. It has long stood in the way of deeper European military cooperation, which London fears could undermine NATO. British voters decided in a June referendum to leave the European Union, but the lengthy process of exiting the bloc has not yet legally begun.Agreeing to the spending could help European countries get over a \u201cTrump hump\u201d created by the president-elect\u2019s demands, said Nick Witney, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.\u201cThis spending is very NATO-compatible, and even money from the European budget is a fair basis for a country to claim it\u2019s chipping more into defense,\u201d said Mr. Witney, a former chief executive of the European Defense Agency, a forum for European Union member states to cooperate on defense initiatives.\u201cOn the other hand, the commitment to spending 2 percent on defense is meant to be about the long haul, and about genuinely readjusting national budget priorities, and I don\u2019t see this plan as moving European NATO members much closer to that goal,\u201d he said, adding that much of the plan was based on debt financing.A longstanding goal was to avoid duplication of effort in military procurement, which is mostly done on a national basis, and to improve the compatibility of the various military hardware that European countries acquire, he said.One example of inefficiency in European defense was the development of the Airbus A400M military aircraft, European officials said. If the proposed plan is adopted, problems that include defining where to place doors for paratroopers \u2014 which had contributed to the development of the aircraft taking about a decade longer than necessary \u2014 could be more easily resolved, they said.The officials said more military spending could have a positive effect on the sluggish European economy.Helene Cooper contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Bleak Outlook for Trump\u2019s Promises to Coal Miners", "Date": "2016-11-19", "News": "Supported byDonald J. Trump made coal a centerpiece of his campaign, holding rousing rallies with miners in hard hats, who he said had been neglected under eight years of the Obama administration. The strategy paid off, helping him score crucial wins in Pennsylvania and Ohio.Now, though, coal may prove a different sort of symbol \u2014 that is, of the challenges that the president-elect will face delivering on his many promises to restore struggling sectors of the American economy.The United States coal industry and the jobs that support it have been in decline for decades as a result of environmental concerns, automation in mining and slowdowns in manufacturing industries that burned coal for power.And these days, no matter who is president, coal is at the mercy of market economics. Coal\u2019s No. 1 rival is cheap, cleaner-burning natural gas \u2014 which could become an even more potent competitor under the incoming administration. The probable easing of restrictions on pipeline building and loosening of rules on gas exploration and production would mean more natural gas reaching the market.Despite recent increases, coal\u2019s price has been drifting downward for years. But the price of natural gas has fallen even more sharply.\u201cI don\u2019t think the Trump presidency will have a material impact on bringing coal miners back to work,\u201d said Ted O\u2019Brien, a coal analyst at Doyle Trading Consultants, a leading energy industry research firm.\u201cHe may eliminate the regulatory overhang,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Brien said, referring to the environmental rules that have cast a shadow over coal, \u201cbut I have a hard time seeing a surge in coal demand.\u201dCoal\u2019s long decline predates President Obama\u2019s arrival in the White House in 2009. The collapse of the American steel industry in late 20th century reduced demand for the metallurgical coal that is mined most prominently in Appalachia.In addition, utilities have been slow to build new coal-fired power plants in recent decades because of air-quality concerns over the burning of the other type of coal \u2014 thermal coal \u2014 that is used for power plants and is mined across the country.Mr. Trump campaigned to help both kinds of coal recover.But natural gas may prove unbeatable. The hydraulic fracturing boom in shale fields that began a decade ago flooded the market with cheap natural gas that continues to erode coal\u2019s market share. As recently as early 2008, coal was the source of roughly half of the electricity generated in the United States. Now it is down to about 30 percent.\u201cThere\u2019s just a lot of gas in this country, and that is going to hold gas prices down,\u201d said Scott Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources, a major oil and natural gas producer, who said he voted for Mr. Trump.The bleak outlook for coal may explain why some of the industry\u2019s executives have been reluctant to comment on how the Trump presidency may help their business: They may be wary of raising false hopes among their workers. And many may be reluctant to repeat past industry arguments that climate change was a hoax. Instead, coal producers would rather have tax incentives to support environmental improvements for coal-fired plants, as a way to ensure coal\u2019s long-term viability even beyond a Trump administration.\u201cAny exuberance has to be tempered,\u201d said Richard Reavey, vice president for government and public affairs at Cloud Peak Energy, a major Western coal producer. \u201cThe view should be cautious optimism.\u201dBeyond the declining demand for coal, there has been an even more fundamental factor behind the shift in coal mining employment, which peaked decades ago. As with those in many industries, jobs in mining have fallen victim to automation. High-tech shears can now shave coal from underground seams \u2014 work that formerly required hundreds of miners. Surface mining, which has been increasing in recent years, has also replaced many workers with heavy machinery.As a result, there are now just over 50,000 jobs in the American coal mining industry, down from a peak of more than 250,000 in 1980.Most of the losses have come in Appalachian mines \u2014 which produce coal for making steel and electricity \u2014 because they are older, deeper and more expensive to operate. But automation is hitting employment in mines across the country.\u201cThe industry is simply not going to produce the number of jobs that were historically available in the coal fields,\u201d said Patrick C. McGinley, a law professor at West Virginia University, who focuses on coal issues.A few years ago coal executives hoped exports \u2014 which represent about 8 percent of national production \u2014 would boom along with the economies of China and the developing world. But exports peaked in 2012.Since then, slower economic growth in the developing world, along with climate and pollution concerns, have depressed demand for coal.The same considerations have prompted international development banks and large investment companies like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America to pull back on financing new coal-fired plants \u2014 a trend that is unlikely to change under Mr. Trump.The Trump administration could help the coal industry somewhat by unwinding President Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan, which was designed to replace coal-fired utility plants with those using natural gas and renewable energy sources. But the effects of the plan so far may be hard to reverse.The tighter air pollution regulations, which are still under challenge in court, forced utilities to choose between revamping aging coal-fired power plants to make them cleaner, or switching to natural gas or green sources like wind and solar. Utilities across the country typically decided to switch.Last year, as a result, 94 coal-fired power plants were closed across the country, and this year 40 more are expected to close by the end of December. It is most unlikely that Mr. Trump could do anything to bring those plants back online.\u201cAll the older power plants that burned Eastern coal have been basically torn down, dismantled, put in mothballs, some of them permanently,\u201d said Robert J. Zik, the now-retired former vice president for operations at TECO Coal, a subsidiary of TECO Energy that was sold to another operator last year.Other marginal measures the Trump administration might be able to take on coal\u2019s behalf, industry executives say, include rolling back the rules that protect streams from surface mining and easing those for leases and royalties on coal mined on federal lands.Industry executives say that to extend the life of at least some of the 400 or so coal-burning power plants still in use in the United States, the Trump administration and lawmakers in Congress could work with them on \u201cclean coal\u201d initiatives.Even before Mr. Trump\u2019s election, prices of some types of American coal \u2014 particularly the metallurgical variety that is mostly mined in Appalachia and is used to make steel \u2014 had been rallying.That, in turn, had sent the stock prices of some coal mining operations soaring in recent months \u2014 a huge win for hedge funds that bought up the debt and equity of the companies when they were cheap.But the big driver for coal\u2019s price run-up was the dwindling supply, as American producers cut back even as Chinese mines were curbing their own production in recent months. Those price benefits are expected to be short-lived, as demand is depressed both by China\u2019s pivot toward cleaner fuels to address the country\u2019s endemic air pollution and by its new focus on a less energy-intensive consumer economy.\u201cThere is optimism that with government support, coal is more viable,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Brien, the industry analyst. \u201cBut the same headwinds still exist that have existed over the past five years.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They apparently are meant to exploit fears among the country\u2019s majority Shiite population about the Islamic State, the Sunni extremist group ensconced in Syria and Iraq that shares antipathy for both Iran and the West.Human rights groups say the hangings in Iran on Aug. 2 put 20 to 25 prisoners to death, one of the largest mass executions ever carried out in that country.In some cases, the rights group said, the confessions covered crimes committed well after the condemned had been incarcerated.\u201cBy parading death row prisoners on national TV, the authorities are blatantly attempting to convince the public of their \u2018guilt,\u2019 but they cannot mask the disturbing truth that the executed men were convicted of vague and broadly defined offenses and sentenced to death after grossly unfair trials,\u201d said Philip Luther, Amnesty International\u2019s research and advocacy director for the Middle East and North Africa.Since the 1979 Islamic revolution, Iran has been among the world\u2019s leaders in administering the death penalty, and has applied it for a wide range of crimes beyond homicide. Many of the executed have been convicted of drug offenses or on the more vaguely defined charge of enmity against God.Use of the death penalty in the region is not limited to Iran. Saudi Arabia and Iraq, for example, also have been singled out by Amnesty International and other human rights groups.While these groups have long accused the judicial authorities in Iran of using torture and other coercive methods against suspects, the use of recorded confessions in sophisticated videos shown on national television is relatively new.\u201cIt seems Iran has joined the region\u2019s propaganda industry, producing slick videos featuring the apparently forced confessions of men they later executed as \u2018terrorists,\u2019 bizarrely interspersed with scary videos of Islamic State attacks they had nothing to do with,\u201d wrote Sarah Leah Whitson, the Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, in an emailed reaction to the Amnesty International report.Ms. Whitson also said she was troubled by the role of \u201cIranian media agencies in producing and distributing these videos, which implicate them in a rather macabre and ugly form of abuse.\u201dThe Amnesty report scrutinized the confessions shown in the videos, in which the condemned men repeatedly described themselves \u201cas \u2018terrorists\u2019 and \u2018heinous criminals\u2019 who deserve their punishment.\u201dThe Amnesty International report uncovered what it described as several inconsistencies in the videos, suggesting the confessions had been scripted. \u201cIn some cases, the men are linked to crimes that occurred months after they had been arrested or the nature of their involvement in the crimes attributed to them change massively from one video to another,\u201d the report said.There was no immediate response to the Amnesty International report from Iranian officials. While they have often ignored criticism from Amnesty International and other rights groups, they are not immune to it.\u201cThe Iranian government is sensitive to global public concern,\u201d said Sunjeev Bery, the advocacy director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International\u2019s Washington office.\u201cLike many governments, Iranian officials may attempt to portray themselves as impervious to international criticism,\u201d Mr. Bery said, \u201cbut it can lead to many costs.\u201dThomas Erdbrink contributed reporting from Tehran.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Surging Stocks May Not Mean the Economy Trusts Trump", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewThe early stock market reaction to Donald J. Trump\u2019s election victory was overwhelmingly positive. But that doesn\u2019t mean a Trump presidency will be good for the economy.Stock markets often serve as an economic scoreboard: Increasing stock prices are equated with economic victory. But these inferences are too facile, because some increases connote good news, while others do not.Reading market movements \u2014 such as the steep rise in stock prices in the early postelection days, as well as the subsequent ups and downs \u2014 requires a Rosetta stone. Constructing one takes an understanding of what drives stock prices and how that relates to the overall health of the economy.Buying stock in a company entitles the owner to a percentage of present and future profits. The share price should be equivalent to a prediction of what these future profits will be.That\u2019s the theory, anyway, and stock markets, when they work, excel because these stocks are traded assets and all traders can contribute to the market\u2019s overall prediction. If traders feel stock prices are low relative to future profits, they will bid up prices; if they feel prices are high, they will sell and drive down prices. In this way, the final price represents a collective prediction by the entire market.An increase in stock prices therefore signals an expected increase in future profits. The movement in stock prices has a direct effect: Shareholders are immediately wealthier. Anyone holding a retirement portfolio knows the all-too-familiar feeling of reading stock price movements through the narrow lens of how well you can retire. This does not benefit all people in the economy \u2014 some shares are held by citizens of other countries, and the shares held in this country are not equitably held \u2014 but at the least, a surge in stock prices equals more wealth for the citizenry.But rising stock prices can spell good news for other reasons: Even many of those who do not own stocks can expect a brighter future. This is because when companies prosper, consumers frequently also do well. This notion can be somewhat counterintuitive. After all, we often reflexively assume that when businesses make more money, they do so at our expense, that is, by overcharging us.In a well-functioning market, though, the interests of companies and consumers are aligned. Businesses profit when customers enthusiastically buy their products: Higher profits mean happier customers. The economy as a whole is doing well.By way of example, suppose Apple unveils a new iPhone that buoys its stock price. Traders are bullish about the iPhone\u2019s robust sales. They are focused on the fact that these sales add to Apple\u2019s coffers. But each sale, assuming consumers are choosing wisely, is also presumably producing joy for consumers.This example also makes clear when the stock market can be a poor scoreboard for the economy. Sometimes companies can profit without improving consumers\u2019 lives, or possibly even by worsening them.For example, part of the stock surge after the election most likely occurred because of a widely held belief that a Trump administration would slash regulations. That may be good for some companies\u2019 bottom lines, but is that good for everyone else? It depends. Do those regulations hinder only products that were profitable and good for consumers? Or do they also hinder products that are bad for consumers?Take the case of Wells Fargo, which was recently found to have created millions of accounts in customers\u2019 names without their knowledge. These accounts were profitable for Wells Fargo, but surely not good for consumers.The extent of this behavior was uncovered because of the work of a regulatory watchdog: the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Mr. Trump\u2019s election increases the possibility that the bureau will be shut down or that its powers will be curtailed. But if this prospect raises the value of bank stocks because it makes it more likely that behavior like Wells Fargo\u2019s can flourish, that\u2019s hardly cause for celebration. And it\u2019s not good news for the economy.In short, whether a rise in stock prices is good or bad for nonshareholders depends on whether the increase in profits arises because companies are serving consumers or because they are profiting at consumers\u2019 expense.There is a final factor to consider: The capacity of traders to make predictions about future profits is limited.In 1997, Michael Rashes, then a doctoral student in economics at Harvard and now a principal at Bracebridge Capital, noticed something funny about stock prices. On Oct. 1, WorldCom made a bid for MCI Communications. Shares listed under the symbol MCI went up that day. In itself, that wasn\u2019t surprising: Good news raises prices.The problem, as Mr. Rashes noted, was that the ticker symbol MCI belonged to Massmutual Corporate Investors. This fund had nothing to do with MCI Communications, which traded under the ticker symbol MCIC. His paper was published in The Journal of Finance in 2001, under the title \u201cMassively Confused Investors Making Conspicuously Ignorant Choices (MCI-MCIC)\u201d.This was not a freak event: Traders are highly fallible. On Oct. 4, 2013, for example, after Twitter announced its initial public offering, the stock price of the Boston-based consumer electronics chain Tweeter, which had filed for bankruptcy in 2007, rose to 15 cents a share from the previous day\u2019s close of less than 1 cent. Trading was eventually halted.A large body of research now emphasizes a basic fact: Despite the rise of computers and artificial intelligence, markets are, at their root, made up of human traders. Yes, the crowd is often smarter than the individual. But smarter does not mean perfect. Many of the biases of individual traders become broader market biases. In fact, some new biases are introduced when traders feed off one another and compound their mistakes.On election night, the votes at the ballot box mattered. In the financial markets, another kind of vote counting took place. Just as the presidential election tells us only who voters believe is good for the country, the market can tell us only what traders believe is good for a company\u2019s bottom line.It is an all-too-familiar adage that democracy is the weakest form of government, except for all the others. Similarly, stock markets are the weakest way to predict the future, except for all the others.An earlier version of this article misstated the rise in shares listed under the symbol MCI related to investor confusion over a similar stock symbol (MCIC). The shares in MCI rose 2.35 percent on Oct. 1, 1997, not 18.56 percent.An earlier version of this article erroneously attributed a distinction to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. While the agency discovered the extent of the fraudulent accounts at Wells Fargo, it was not the first to uncover the activity.Advertisement"}

Trump cited the issue as a top priority for his administration.\u201cWe are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none.\u201dThe sentiment was echoed across the country on Election Day as voters supported dozens of local ballot measures intended to improve public transportation. In Los Angeles, Seattle and Atlanta, voters were poised to approve spending billions of dollars on buses, rail lines and other projects.But with little support from Washington in recent years, many communities have moved forward with their own plans to improve public transportation through local ballot measures. In Los Angeles County on Tuesday, voters approved a half-cent increase in the sales tax to raise nearly $120 billion for the transportation system.In the Seattle region, voters appeared likely to have approved a $54 billion proposal that would include building 62 new miles of light rail. The proposition was winning on Wednesday with about 55 percent of the vote.\u201cLocal regions with some vision are taking matters into their own hands and going directly to the voters to try to tackle real local problems,\u201d said Peter Rogoff, the chief executive of Sound Transit, the transportation agency serving multiple counties in the Seattle region.While Mr. Trump did not specifically mention trains or buses during his brief victory speech, he said during the campaign that he supported spending money on transit. As a resident of New York City and a real estate developer, Mr. Trump appears to understand how important public transit is for cities, said Art Guzzetti, the vice president of policy for the American Public Transportation Association.\u201cThe magnitude of the need is such that you\u2019re going to need all the partners chipping in to the solution,\u201d Mr. Guzzetti said of the country\u2019s vast infrastructure needs.On Wednesday, transit supporters celebrated the success of the local ballot measures, which consoled some who were disappointed by Mrs. Clinton\u2019s loss. A proposal in Atlanta to increase the sales tax to pay for transit improvements received about 72 percent support.\u201cThe customers are telling us that they really believe in mass transit,\u201d he said.\u201cWe expected a historic year going into Election Day, and we got it in terms of the largest number of measures we\u2019ve ever tracked and the largest dollar amount invested,\u201d Mr. Jordan said.One of the country\u2019s largest infrastructure proposals is a plan supported by the Obama administration to build a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River from New Jersey to New York, part of a larger project known as the Gateway program that could cost more than $20 billion. The current century-old tunnel used by Amtrak and New Jersey Transit trains was damaged during Hurricane Sandy.On Wednesday, supporters of the project praised Mr. Trump\u2019s comments, adding that the tunnel was \u201cprecisely the kind of infrastructure program that warrants continued and increased public investment,\u201d according to John D. Porcari, the interim executive director of the Gateway Development Corporation, which is being created to oversee the project. Mr. Christie canceled an earlier plan to build a tunnel under the river, but he supports the new proposal.Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles, who supported the transportation measure, called it a \u201cnew day\u201d for his city and other American cities.

Mr. Sheikh had to cut short his family\u2019s Goa vacation and return to Mumbai on Thursday because he was carrying cash that was no longer usable and his hotel did not take credit or debit cards.He spent five hours in line at his bank branch here, only to reach a teller who had run out of the new notes. And on Sunday, when he usually has appointments all afternoon for haircuts and color treatments at Beau Monde salon in the neighborhood of Colaba, only one client showed up, the rest lacking the cash to pay.His family was surviving on 1,500 rupees in small-denomination notes that he fished out of his daughter\u2019s piggy bank, he said.\u201cI am willing to handle all of this if this will really reduce corruption,\u201d Mr. Sheikh said as he held a blow-dryer to his sole client\u2019s hair in the otherwise empty salon.A Mumbai taxi driver, Girja Prasad Goswami, 48, said his daily earnings had been cut in half, to 300 rupees, since Mr. Modi\u2019s ban went into effect. He was not sure how he would send money to his wife and three daughters in his home village in Uttar Pradesh if business did not pick up. Yet he said, \u201cIf it\u2019s going to help the nation, I am willing to continue.\u201dIn banning the two largest currency notes on Tuesday, Mr. Modi aimed to reduce the use of unaccounted-for cash in India, where experts have estimated that one-third of transactions are made this way. With the sudden ban, Mr. Modi rendered vast caches of unaccounted-for cash useless.Mr. Modi, in his Sunday speech, asked the public for 50 days of forbearance for a transition to new bills of 500 and 2,000 rupees. Complicating that transition is the fact that many of the country\u2019s approximately 200,000 A.T.M.s are not working. Those that are working are quickly running out of 100-rupee notes, and none of the machines are capable of dispensing the new 2,000-rupee notes, which are a different size from the previous notes.The finance minister, Arun Jaitley, said recalibrating the A.T.M.s to dispense the new notes would take as long as three more weeks. The machines were not recalibrated before last week\u2019s edict; by keeping the move a secret, officials prevented big holders of unaccounted-for money from outwitting the ban.The Finance Ministry said on Sunday that Indians had deposited about $45 billion in banned currency notes since the policy began. Banks and A.T.M.s had given out $7.5 billion in new currency notes during that time, the ministry said.At a State Bank of India branch in the New Ashok Nagar neighborhood in New Delhi, about 300 people had been waiting in line for two hours when the bank opened at 10 a.m. Sunday. But word immediately spread that the bank\u2019s computer server was not working and that no business could take place until it came back online.As Murli Manohar Mehta, the bank manager, frantically dialed his technology engineers, the crowd grew larger and angrier and began shouting slogans. The lone security guard cowered until two police officers showed up to help.\u201cWe are trying hard to serve the people,\u201d Mr. Mehta said in an interview. \u201cBut now I am helpless. What can I do if the server is not operating?\u201dA day earlier, the crowd grew so angry that it broke the steel grille on the bank door, he said. None of the several A.T.M.s within walking distance of the bank were dispensing cash Sunday morning.Sunil Kashyap, 35, running an electrical store in East Delhi, said his sales had fallen 50 percent. The problem was that nobody had cash to pay for purchases, he said. His customers kept trying to make him accept the banned notes, but he was refusing, he said, adding, \u201cWhat will I do with those notes?\u201dStill, Mr. Kashyap supported Mr. Modi\u2019s ban, saying: \u201cIt is like a bitter pill. It will give relief in the long term.\u201dIn line at an HSBC bank machine, two students offered scathing words about the ban\u2019s effect on poorer Indians, who were missing work because they were standing in line at A.T.M.s. \u201cThe actual black money,\u201d said Muskan Sandhu, 21, a literature student, \u201cis stashed away in Swiss bank accounts.\u201dGeeta Anand reported from Mumbai, and Hari Kumar from New Delhi.

{"Headline": "A Museum Becomes a Battlefield Over Poland\u2019s History", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byPiotr Glinski, the culture minister of Poland\u2019s conservative government, has criticized the museum\u2019s expansive approach and says it should focus more on the Polish experience. In a move that would oust the museum\u2019s director, the minister has called for the museum to merge with another museum, which exists only in name. That institution is dedicated to the Battle of Westerplatte, the first battle of the war in September 1939, when Polish forces fended off the Nazis before surrendering \u2014 an event he regards as more symbolic of heroic Polish self-defense.That merger, though harshly criticized by historians and unpopular with the public, is indicative of deeper currents coursing through Poland. Since coming to power last year, the right-wing Law and Justice Party has tapped into populist discontent by depicting the country as a noble victim, besieged by enemies both past and present \u2014 once the Soviets and the Nazis; today, the European Union, German liberalism, Russian might and immigrants.\u201cIt\u2019s a potentially catastrophic event, with much wider significance than Gdansk or one museum,\u201d Norman Davies, a pre-eminent British historian of Poland and chairman of one of the Museum of the Second World War\u2019s advisory boards, said of the proposed merger.\u201cIt\u2019s a part of the present government\u2019s attempt to rewrite history,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the pillars of every authoritarian or totalitarian regime, that they want to reorder the past to their own fantasies.\u201dThe Museum of the Second World War was created in 2008 by the government led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who is now president of the European Council. An ambitious building designed by the Polish firm Kwadrat, it has 5,000 square meters of exhibition space and a staff of 60. The original budget swelled by more than 90 million zlotys (about $22.5 million) for various reasons and after the building, on the Vistula River delta, suffered water leakage.With an emphasis on civilians, the museum has sections dedicated to the Holocaust and to the Battle of Westerplatte. Among its 41,000 objects, of which 2,000 will go in the permanent exhibition, there are coat buttons from Poles executed by Soviet NKVD agents in the infamous Katyn massacre of 1940, when the Soviets killed thousands of Poland\u2019s military elite. The museum also has sections devoted to World War II\u2019s Pacific theater and the French and Danish Resistance, and an area for children that depicts a middle-class Warsaw apartment before and during the war.\u201cThe museum is the only attempt in Europe or really in the world to actually present the war as international history,\u201d said Timothy Snyder, a historian at Yale University who serves on the museum\u2019s advisory board.\u201cPoland is overrepresented in this international museum, which is not surprising, given that the museum is in Poland,\u201d he added.Mr. Glinski, the culture minister and deputy prime minister, does not agree. In an interview in Warsaw, he said he believed that the Museum of the Second World War did not put \u201cenough stress on the Polish point of view\u201d and did not adequately focus on the Battle of Westerplatte, \u201ca symbolic place for Poles.\u201d\u201cOur obligation,\u201d Mr. Glinski added, \u201cis to maintain a conversation about our sacrifice, a conversation with world public opinion.\u201d\u201cPoland is associated mainly with the Holocaust,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe world knows about the Warsaw Ghetto uprising on April 19, 1943, but it doesn\u2019t recognize the Warsaw Rising that took a much bigger toll.\u201dThe museum does have a section dedicated to the Warsaw Rising, in which Poles, with limited aid from the Allies, fought the Nazis for 63 days in 1944 before the Soviet Army invaded. (That episode is the focus of a museum in Warsaw, the Warsaw Rising Museum, which opened in 2004.)Pawel Machcewicz, the director of the Museum of the Second World War, said that the government\u2019s move to merge it is in keeping with its efforts to discredit the previous government of Mr. Tusk and to exert control over independent institutions. Since coming to power last year, the government has replaced the heads of state media channels and combined the roles of the chief prosecutor and the justice minister.But the museum merger hasn\u2019t been so simple. The Polish Ombudsman\u2019s office, a state entity that protects civil liberties, has filed a lawsuit to block the merger, arguing that Poland\u2019s museum council, a state body, never sanctioned the move. (Mr. Glinski said the council\u2019s approval was not required.) And some families who donated heirlooms said they would withdraw them if the merger went through.\u201cThey thought they could do a blitzkrieg,\u201d Mr. Machcewicz said of government officials, \u201cbut now we have the Battle of Stalingrad.\u201dIf the merger moves forward, Mr. Machcewicz expects to be out of a job, but said he hoped that the museum could open in late January, if only briefly, with its mission uncompromised. He said that the government had committed just half of what the museum needed to cover operating and hiring costs for 2017.\u201cIt would be a huge scandal in Poland, and internationally, if politicians changed the exhibition created by renowned historians from Poland and elsewhere,\u201d he said.Mr. Glinski said that the ministry had no intention of changing the museum\u2019s contents and that it would open as planned. \u201cIt has enough for opening and for at least for six months,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter that period, we\u2019ll see.\u201dThe museum controversy is not the only sign that the Second World War remains a live issue in Poland. \u201cVolhynia,\u201d a recent critical and box-office hit film about the 1944 massacres of ethnic Poles by Ukrainian nationalists, has been embraced by the government for its depictions of Polish suffering, to the dismay of the director, Wojciech Smarzowski.At the Museum of the Second World War last week, workmen were scrambling to finish the interior and install the collections, despite the museum\u2019s possible death sentence. The institution is just blocks from the European Solidarity Center, dedicated to Solidarity, the democratic protest movement whose leader, Lech Walesa, the current government now depicts as a sellout to the Communist regime.Antoni Dudek, a historian of Polish history and a professor at Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University in Warsaw, was one of dozens of historians who signed a letter criticizing the merger, despite his support of the current government. \u201cThe controversy around the museum is emblematic of a larger problem, the way the ruling party is monopolizing the politics of memory and history,\u201d Mr. Dudek said.\u201cThe problem is that the government insists on discrediting and eliminating all other historical visions in the process,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is a line that nobody should ever cross.\u201dAn article on Thursday about uncertainty over the fate of the new Museum of the Second World War in Gdansk, Poland, using information from the museum, misstated the amount by which the original budget grew. It was by more than about 90 million zlotys (about $22.4 million at the current exchange rate) not by more than 100 million zlotys (about $24.9 million). The article also misidentified the body that has filed a lawsuit to block the merger of the museum with another that has not been built yet. It is the Polish Ombudsman\u2019s office, not the Polish branch of the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights.Joanna Berendt contributed reporting from WarsawAdvertisement"}

The company, known for its disappearing messages and its photo filters, does not face the same web of regulations that companies like Uber or Airbnb regularly contend with, which could make listing more simple.

{"Headline": "Trump Has Options for Undoing Obama\u2019s Climate Legacy", "Date": "2016-11-25", "News": "Supported byDuring the campaign, he threatened, among other things, to kill the Clean Power Plan, a set of rules to reduce emissions from power plants. He has also taken aim at new regulations to limit methane leaks from wells and pipelines. And members of his transition team have suggested that he may reduce or eliminate basic climate research at NASA or other agencies.If he follows through, most of these moves will be opposed by environmental groups, by Democrats in Congress and perhaps even by some Republicans. But Mr. Trump will have several tools to begin nullifying the Obama climate agenda.One of them is the little-known Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, a small outpost within the executive branch that has, since the Clinton administration, been the last stop for many regulations before they go into effect.Lawyers in the office pore over thousands of pages of federal regulations daily and pride themselves on meticulously reviewing the fine print, even if that takes months or years.Under the control of the new administration, the office could slow President Obama\u2019s latest regulatory initiatives by repeatedly sending them back for additional work.\u201cIt has been a brake on agency regulation throughout its lifetime,\u201d said Jody Freeman, a professor at Harvard Law School and an expert on environmental regulation. \u201cSome presidents have used it as more of a brake than others.\u201dMuch remains to be learned about the president-elect\u2019s environmental policy goals, and some of his views appear to have shifted.Other than climate change, there are numerous environmental issues that he has never talked about and that he might be content to leave untouched. And once agency heads are in place, they may choose very different tactics from those discussed during Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign or by his advisers. Two people considered to be in the running to head the Environmental Protection Agency \u2014 Jeffrey R. Holmstead, an energy lobbyist, and Robert E. Grady, a venture capitalist \u2014 also have experience in the complex machinations of the federal government.\u201cEvery new administration comes in with an overestimation of what it can accomplish and how quickly it can accomplish it,\u201d said Kevin Ewing, a partner at Bracewell, a Washington law firm.If Mr. Trump does decide to withdraw from the Paris agreement, he will find it difficult: The accord went into force this month. He would also encounter tremendous obstacles were he to try to dismantle the E.P.A., another campaign threat.But he may have an easier time abandoning other climate initiatives, including a United Nations-backed program to reduce the environmental impact of international air travel beginning in 2020. The United States has only informally committed to participate in the program, and the new administration could refuse to make that commitment legally binding.One of the most powerful methods to hobble Mr. Obama\u2019s domestic environmental initiatives would be to block financing for the E.P.A. and other agencies.\u201cCongress can always pass an appropriations rider that for one year prevents any funding for the implementation or enforcement of a particular regulation,\u201d said Scott H. Segal, a partner and director of the policy resolution group at Bracewell. Riders can be passed year after year, effectively neutering a specific regulation, Mr. Segal said.Such an approach can be \u201cstealthier\u201d than trying to undo the regulation itself, Professor Freeman said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to repeal these statutes,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just have to make it impossible to implement them.\u201dAnother opening for Mr. Trump lies in regulations that were proposed by the Obama administration but are still technically \u201cin motion.\u201d In theory, he could pull back or block these rules.But a departing administration can also use a regulation\u2019s \u201cin motion\u201d status to its own advantage. Last week, the Obama administration banned drilling in the Alaskan Arctic under the Interior Department\u2019s proposed five-year plan regulating oil and gas leases. Republicans could kill the plan. But to do so would mean crafting a replacement, a process that could take two years or more.Last week, the White House unveiled a sweeping plan to try to stiffen environmental regulations before Mr. Obama leaves office. Environmental groups can be expected to fight any efforts to undo them.\u201cDonald Trump can\u2019t just snap his fingers and change climate policy,\u201d said David Goldston, director of government affairs at the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cWe have ways to thwart him in Congress and the courts that we could employ.\u201dThe issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.The approach the Trump administration takes will depend in part on the status of specific rules and regulations.Some environmental policies \u2014 like \u201cguidance\u201d issued by the White House earlier this year, instructing agencies to consider the effects of climate change when conducting environmental reviews \u2014 do not have the force of law that agency regulations do, and can be abolished with a pen stroke. Undoing a regulation is more complicated. Some of the E.P.A.\u2019s new methane rules are completed, for example, but other rules, both at the E.P.A. and at the Interior Department, are not and can simply be abandoned.If a rule is final, the options are different. The new administration cannot just rescind these regulations, but it can order agencies to revisit them. That reopens the rule-making process, however, including the opportunity for public comment. Any revisions or replacement regulations must have a basis in facts and a cost-benefit analysis, not politics or ideology.There are other potential options for specific regulations. The Clean Power Plan, for instance, is completed but not yet in effect because of a judicial stay imposed while legal action against it plays out in a federal appeals court in Washington. If there is no ruling by Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, Mr. Trump\u2019s Justice Department can ask the court to put the case in abeyance, effectively extending the stay indefinitely.\u201cIn some respects, this is in the Department of Justice\u2019s hands,\u201d said Tom Lorenzen, a lawyer at Crowell & Moring who argued against the plan before the appeals court. \u201cThey will make a determination of how they want to proceed.\u201dMr. Segal said the Republican Congress might also be able to overturn some recently completed regulations under a law that gives both houses up to 60 legislative days to reject them. That law, the Congressional Review Act, usually comes into play only when the party of the incoming president is different from the departing one\u2019s and the same party controls both houses, as is the case now.William K. Reilly, a Republican who was E.P.A. administrator under President George Bush, said Mr. Trump needed to be careful about whom he picked for the top jobs in each department.He cited the Reagan administration\u2019s experience with Anne Gorsuch, who incurred the wrath of politicians of both parties when, as administrator of the E.P.A., she cut the agency\u2019s budget by more than 20 percent, gutting research and regulatory enforcement. She resigned under fire in 1983 in the midst of accusations that she had mismanaged a hazardous waste cleanup program.\u201cThe administration got badly burned by discounting the sensitivities and public support for what the E.P.A. protects us from,\u201d Mr. Reilly said. \u201cIt\u2019s a public health agency above all.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Furniture Makers Are Catering to Millennials", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Read an editor's letter by Jake Silverstein about the Design Issue.Burrow is on an enviable trajectory right now. The company is a graduate of the prestigious Bay Area tech accelerator Y Combinator; it also has a healthy list of pre-orders for its product\u2019s planned debut in January. But given that pedigree, the product is an unusual one: couches. Not cloud-connected couches or remote-controlled couches \u2014 just couches. Technically, the company makes a couch, singular, available in a few different colors and configurations. The one I was sitting on belonged to Jess Goodman, a friend of the founders and an early supporter. Its design was midcentury modern unexceptional, and it was perfectly nice. But the couch is not Burrow\u2019s main attraction. Burrow is selling a couch experience.When customers order a Burrow couch online, the standard model will ship to their apartments in three or four boxes. A human of average size should be able to take those boxes up the stairs (if they have stairs) and build the couch alone, without tools and within minutes.Chopra and Kuhl tell me that for urban professionals between 25 and 35, the physical process of buying a sofa and moving it into an apartment is a series of \u201cpain points.\u201d Some of these points are literally painful, like carrying a large sofa up a flight of stairs. But the term is business speak for any kind of friction, however abstract, between a customer and a new couch. Burrow doesn\u2019t claim to have improved upon the couch itself: It\u2019s a pain-management company.It helps that furniture sales in the United States are unusually fragmented. It\u2019s a $100 billion annual market, but giants like Ashley HomeStore and Ikea take less than 5 percent each, while regional chains like Rooms to Go and Havertys still account for significant sales. Unlike with, say, office supplies, the industry hasn\u2019t become concentrated in a few huge companies \u2014 the field remains competitive.All of which is to say millennial entrepreneurs could pick a worse thing to sell than a deconstructable couch. As they disrupt our living rooms, these businessmen move us one step closer to a different world. But are we sure we want to live there?As they say, however, nothing in this life is free \u2014 certainly not shipping couches. Burrow manufactures its boxed-up sofas-to-be in Mexico City, then freight-forwards them to warehouses in Cincinnati and New York. Because they\u2019re boxes, rather than constructed furniture, they can stack all the way to the ceiling. The boxes are FedEx and UPS compliant, and they ship from the warehouses like normal packages. The process is advertised as free, but the founders estimate that it will cost them $75 per sofa, or about 10 percent of the $745 purchase price for the two-seat base model. Chopra and Kuhl also figure that if they can ease all the \u201cpain\u201d around obtaining and installing a couch, customers will be happy enough with what they get to refrain from sending it back, which Burrow says it will allow them to do for 100 days. It occurs to me that the kind of person who would order a couch online to reduce logistical hassles is also the kind of person least likely to then pack up that couch and send it back. When I ask the founders about this, they offer angelic smiles. \u201cWe think our model works for almost everyone,\u201d Kuhl says, \u201cbut there are some people who like Ikea.\u201dIkea hardly dominates the market from a numbers perspective, but it\u2019s been a cultural phenomenon for as long as Burrow\u2019s target demographic has been alive, to the point that it\u2019s essentially a default furniture-acquisition source. In a case study well known to those with M.B.A.s, Youngme Moon of Harvard Business School described how the company made a home in America. From the 1985 opening of its first American store, Ikea emphasized everything except the attribute that had been the industry\u2019s sole sales strategy until that point: durability. At Ikea\u2019s prices, furniture didn\u2019t need to be seen as a future heirloom; young adults could furnish their homes with new objects, rather than trawling through thrift stores or taking hand-me-downs from upgrading relatives. Attractive Swedish particle board gave Americans an excuse to jettison their parents\u2019 commitment to lifelong furniture and go shopping more often.\u201cIkea is an amazing company,\u201d says Maxwell Ryan, the chief executive and co-founder of the influential interior-design site Apartment Therapy. \u201cThey have great designers, infrastructure, product variety. They\u2019re very hard to compete with.\u201d Ikea furniture also packs into boxes \u2014 the industry term is \u201cK.D.,\u201d or \u201cknock down\u201d \u2014 but it\u2019s based on a very different value proposition from Burrow\u2019s. By turning its stores into theme parks and fitting the warehouse right inside, Ikea bet that it could get customers to tote purchases all the way home by themselves. The pain points of couch shopping are still there, but so are the pleasures of dining out and free child care. Burrow\u2019s experience, on the other hand, is online and low-friction.Burrow isn\u2019t the only company that sees an opening here. \u201cTwenty-four-to-33-year-old career-driven, upwardly mobile people\u201d is how John Humphrey \u2014 a founder and chief executive of the furniture company Greycork \u2014 describes his customers. \u201cThey tend to be in the tech and design fields.\u201d With a Greycork living-room set, you can take a space from zero to furnished in five to 10 days, with free shipping. If a consumer\u2019s main complaint with Ikea furniture is the Allen wrenches, the trip to the store or just the fact that it\u2019s identifiably Ikea, Greycork could be a good alternative.\u201cThe way Ikea is based around the shipping container, we\u2019re based around FedEx,\u201d says Brad Sewell, the founder of the furniture maker Campaign. The ex-Apple engineer\u2019s company sells a chair, a love seat and a sofa \u2014 all the same design in varying widths. Based on the online view, they are not especially distinguishable from the Ikea Norsborg line and are a couple of hundred dollars more expensive. This next generation of couches uses web copy that\u2019s heavy in compound adjectives (\u201claser-cut, powder-coated steel frames\u201d) to project a premium feel onto goods that most buyers can\u2019t touch for themselves. The fact that the furniture folds is more than a logistical accommodation; it\u2019s a key feature.Kyle Hoff is a founder of Floyd, a furniture start-up that ships metal legs \u2014 they adjust to turn any flat surface into a desk or a table \u2014 alongside adjustable shelf brackets and frameworks for platform beds. The initial concept was \u201cjust add boards\u201d; Floyd products bind them into functional furniture. \u201cI wanted to make furniture for people like me,\u201d Hoff says. \u201cI was in my early 20s, moving from city to city, and I needed things that could move with me.\u201d Though Floyd is based in Detroit, Hoff says most of his customers are young professionals in New York, the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles. And maybe in is the wrong way to think of it; Floyd customers exist between these (and a few other) metropolitan areas. All the furniture is designed to move as part of a roving lifestyle.If a company can get to market first and establish itself as the singular way to buy a particular necessity online, it can clean up \u2014 even if it\u2019s appealing to a relatively small millennial luxury market. Most of the founders I spoke with mentioned Casper as an inspiration, and it\u2019s easy to see why. The venture-funded company was an overnight success in 2014 selling foam mattresses online and delivering them compressed into manageable boxes. Last year the company was valued at over half a billion dollars. It stands out even among Silicon Valley fairy tales, which makes \u201cCasper for couches\u201d a self-explanatory business pitch.The best thing about this whole product category is that it might represent a step away from Ikea\u2019s disposability without going all the way back to Grandma\u2019s antique sofa. If consumers are already thinking about moving, portability is at least as big an obstacle to maintaining furniture as mediocre craftsmanship and cheap materials. These companies want to make a couch that will last for 10 or 20 years, even if the buyers have no idea where they\u2019ll be or what they\u2019ll be doing that far down the line. Buying a piece of furniture that you will realistically hold onto longer is a kind of forward-thinking thrift.But this new approach also hints at something more sinister, more bad-future. Different furniture suggests different ways of being in the world: A heavy table says one thing, and a mattress on the floor beside a folding chair says another. Campaign takes its name from the furnishings that British colonial functionaries would take on assignments, ready to pack up if recalled by the Crown. It\u2019s an apt fit with one version of upwardly mobile millennial living, which involves reducing all \u201cpersonal\u201d needs to an efficient minimum. It\u2019s a style beloved by Silicon Valley \u2014 which finances accessories like the liquid food replacement Soylent \u2014 and exemplified by the Google engineer who blogged about the time he spent living in a small truck near the office.This Silicon Valley lifestyle and the Silicon Valley business model are caught in a chicken-and-egg dialectic. Each holds that whatever work can be automated, eliminated or subcontracted to others should be, thus leaving all our valuable code ninjas and management rock stars free to do more work, pursue expensive enriching experiences and watch Netflix. This is the luxury that some of the valley\u2019s most successful products are offering; there are now niche online services for doing your laundry, chopping your food, driving you around and delivering your toilet paper. The entire app-services economy can serve as a dispersed and techno-mystified mother, a caretaker who dotes on the implied bachelor user.The various furniture founders \u2014 Burrow\u2019s, Greycork\u2019s, Campaign\u2019s, Floyd\u2019s \u2014 experienced the same series of pain points when it came to couch ownership. All are city-dwelling men with at least some postgraduate education; four of them are 29, the fifth is 28. It\u2019s not surprising that they should encounter similar hassles or, because most attended business school, think of comparable entrepreneurial solutions. But given that investors and customers have encouraged them, it\u2019s worth asking exactly what kind of pain they plan to remove from our world.Maxwell Ryan, of Apartment Therapy, is not optimistic about the prospects of companies like Burrow. \u201cThere\u2019s this Silicon Valley mind-set where they solve a problem and so they think they\u2019re going to make a million dollars,\u201d he says. \u201cBut just because it\u2019s a problem for them doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a problem for everyone. I haven\u2019t seen that kind of thinking translate over well to the design space.\u201d Nor is he particularly impressed with the plain, one-size-fits-all style they tend to adopt (\u201cit\u2019s ugly\u201d). Ryan says customers want a good narrative to go with their furniture, like Crate and Barrel\u2019s origin story of a young couple\u2019s return from their honeymoon abroad with boxes of cheap imported fineries.But not everyone cares that much about expressing individual style, and Ryan could be underestimating how popular it is these days to stay inside and not talk to anyone. In our emerging economic order, the exertion of emotional energy is a kind of pain \u2014 a red entry in the accounting book of our lives \u2014 and there are new services every day to help us avoid it. Soon it will be possible to build and maintain a complete household full of goods without having to look anyone else in the eye.When my roommate and I moved to Philadelphia this year, we left our giant vintage couch in our fourth-floor Brooklyn walk-up. It was a nice piece of furniture \u2014 solid and soft, in light green floral \u2014 and we were sad to lose it. After we moved into our new place, my brother, who lives nearby, showed us to a neighborhood secondhand store called Jinxed. Inside we found a couch that looked shockingly like our old one. A little smaller, in better condition and orange instead of green, but remarkably similar. It\u2019s not what I would have picked online, but the coincidence was too striking to ignore.From a certain perspective, this was all suffering, insofar as it would have been easier not to do it. I\u2019m not unsympathetic; I\u2019m in the target demographic for a product like Burrow. I am a person who has bought flour on Amazon. But risk and hassle and pain are big parts of interacting with other people on terms that aren\u2019t yours alone. There\u2019s value in having to sustain a mind-set that accounts for other humans and their interests and needs, a value to always remembering that there are people between the apps and our fulfilled desires. If there exists a market incentive to smooth every friction a young businessman can think of \u2014 even something as mundane, low-tech and intrinsically social as a couch \u2014 we risk a very slippery world. \u2666Malcolm Harris is a freelance writer in Philadelphia.Produced by Rodrigo De Benito Sanz and Linsey FieldsAdvertisement"}

Trump named two new cabinet picks, Representative Tom Price of Georgia, for health and human services, and Elaine Chao, a former labor secretary and the wife of Senator Mitch McConnell, to head the Transportation Department. Meanwhile, ascendant conservatives have blocked women from military draft registration.President-elect Trump plans to begin a victory lap on Thursday, returning to Cincinnati for a postelection rally. The city was the site of some of his biggest rallies as a candidate, with supporters turning out by the thousands for a mid-October event at the U.S. Bank Arena.The trip Thursday will kick off what the transition is calling a \u201cthank you\u201d tour in which Mr. Trump plans to give credit for his surprise victory to supporters in critical swing states. He is tentatively scheduled to make a second stop Saturday in Des Moines.Lighters up!Mr. Trump and Mitt Romney \u2014 who called Mr. Trump a \u201cphony\u201d and a \u201cfraud\u201d during the Republican primaries \u2014 sat down for a four-course meal Tuesday night at Jean-Georges, a three-star Michelin restaurant at the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Manhattan.Mr. Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, emerged several hours later to heap compliments on the president-elect, who has bristled privately that Mr. Romney never apologized for insulting him during the race.On Tuesday, there was no apology, but Mr. Romney said he had been impressed by Mr. Trump\u2019s victory speech on election night, his transition effort, and his personnel decisions.\u201cHe did something I tried to do and was unsuccessful in accomplishing: He won the general election,\u201d Mr. Romney told reporters. \u201cHe continues with a message of inclusion and bringing people together, and his vision is something which obviously connected with the American people in a very powerful way.\u201dHe said Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct since winning the election gives him \u201cincreasing hope that President-elect Trump is the very man who can lead us to that better future.\u201dMr. Romney is said to be under consideration for secretary of state.Washington\u2019s most prominent home threw open its doors Tuesday, unveiling a vast and sparkling collection of Christmas trees, lights, ornaments and more. Take a peek at this year\u2019s gingerbread house:An advocacy group that favors strict limits on immigration called on President-elect Trump on Tuesday to erect a physical barrier on the United States-Mexico border, end funding to cities that shield undocumented immigrants from deportation, and deny citizenship to children born of undocumented parents.In other words, keep his campaign promises.Daniel Stein, the group\u2019s president, said it would present the document to the Trump transition team no later than Wednesday.President-elect Trump\u2019s decision to tap Ms. Chao to be his secretary of transportation could prove to be a deviously shrewd mobilization of domesticity as he pushes to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to rebuild the nation\u2019s highways, bridges, airports and transit systems.The biggest opposition to the plan could come from Republicans, mindful of rising budget deficits and skeptical of the economic benefits of federal jobs programs. Enter Ms. Chao, the wife of the Senate majority leader. As secretary of transportation, she would lead the infrastructure push, possibly against her husband.Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, took note.If the nomination process were high school, Ms. Chao would probably win most likely to succeed. She has already been lauded by Democrats like Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and, of course, Republicans, including her biggest fan, Mr. McConnell.\u201cI\u2019ve heard rumors that should be an outstanding appointment announced later today,\u201d Mr. McConnell said Tuesday, noting that reporters had immediately asked if he planned to recuse himself from voting for his wife. \u201cLet me be quite clear,\u201d he said, \u201cI will not be recusing myself. I think it was an outstanding choice.\u201dHistory does have a way of repeating itself. When Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, was the majority leader, his wife, Elizabeth, was nominated by President Ronald Reagan to head up the Transportation Department. At her confirmation hearings, Mr. Dole said his only regret was that he had \u201conly one wife to give for his country\u2019s infrastructure.\u201dMr. Trump may be nearly two months from the White House, but conservatives seem emboldened already: After a fierce policy debate, they yanked a requirement that young women register for the draft out of the annual defense policy bill.The United States has not used the draft since 1973 and the Vietnam War. The Senate, under the leadership of Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, passed a bill this year that would have compelled women turning 18 on or after Jan. 1, 2018, to register for Selective Service, as men must do, a move that reflected the expanding role of women in the armed services.While most Republican senators \u2014 including Mr. McConnell and the women on the Armed Services Committee \u2014 agreed with the move, it was rejected in the House version of the bill, after attack from some of Congress\u2019s most conservative members. The members of the House committee \u201cfelt strongly\u201d that the provision not be in the final bill that Congress is expected to consider next month, Mr. McCain said Tuesday, so it was removed.Hillary Clinton\u2019s popular vote lead over Mr. Trump swelled again Tuesday with a new tranche of votes from heavily Democratic Prince George\u2019s County, Md.; it now stands at 2,358,925, or 1.8 percentage points.On Monday, it was David H. Petraeus. On Tuesday night, it will be Mitt Romney.But don\u2019t forget Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, who met with Mr. Trump on Tuesday afternoon in Trump Tower.Mr. Corker is tempering expectations, noting that the competition is tough.\u201cThe secretary of state\u2019s role is so important to a president,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cHe needs to choose someone that he\u2019s very comfortable with, and he knows that there\u2019s going to be no daylight between him and them. He needs to know that the secretary of state is someone who speaks fully for the president.\u201dNine out of 10 educators said they had seen a negative impact on students\u2019 mood and behavior after the election.Eight in 10 report heightened anxiety among immigrants, Muslims, African-Americans and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students.Four in 10 have heard derogatory language directed at students of color, Muslims, immigrants and people based on gender or sexual orientation.The president-elect may still be fuming over unfounded allegations of massive voter fraud, especially in California, but his allies in Congress are ready to move on.\u201cSecretary Clinton conceded the election, and it appears to me she thinks the election\u2019s over,\u201d Mr. McConnell told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cThe American people think the election\u2019s over, and I think the election\u2019s over. So it\u2019s an interesting discussion, but it strikes me as totally irrelevant. Time to move on.\u201dOn the House side of the Capitol, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader, echoed the sentiment.\u201cI think the elections came out just fine,\u201d Mr. McCarthy told reporters on Tuesday, adding, \u201cI think now\u2019s the time to govern.\u201dSteven Mnuchin, a hedge fund financier who headed Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign finance committee, is expected to be named Treasury secretary as soon as Wednesday.Representative Lou Barletta, a Pennsylvania Republican who made his name as the anti-immigration mayor of Hazleton, emerged from Trump Tower Tuesday afternoon to say he is discussing the post of labor secretary with the president-elect.Mr. Price, who has focused much of his work in Congress on trying to insulate physicians from the dictates and price controls of agencies that would be under his control if he is confirmed, responded on Tuesday:\u201cThere is much work to be done to ensure we have a health care system that works for patients, families and doctors; that leads the world in the cure and prevention of illness; and that is based on sensible rules to protect the well-being of the country while embracing its innovative spirit.\u201dSenator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, the incoming minority leader, was not happy:\u201cCongressman Price has proven to be far out of the mainstream of what Americans want when it comes to Medicare, the Affordable Care Act and Planned Parenthood. Thanks to those three programs, millions of American seniors, families, people with disabilities and women have access to quality, affordable health care. Nominating Congressman Price to be the H.H.S. secretary is akin to asking the fox to guard the hen house.\u201dBut because Senate Democrats gutted the filibuster rule for presidential appointees, there may be little opponents can do to stop Mr. Price\u2019s confirmation.Even if Mr. Trump could persuade Congress to enact a criminal statute making such a shift in the balance between government power and individual rights, anyone convicted and sentenced under it could point to clear Supreme Court precedents to make the case that the new law violated the Constitution.Advertisement"}

Traders were allowed withdrawals of 50,000 rupees a week, allowing them to pay for labor and produce at wholesale markets.The government was also racing to calibrate ATMs with the newly issued 2,000 rupee notes and smaller currency.Mr. Modi has begun to come in for criticism, after being afforded a remarkable grace period. Politicians clashed over the move, and Parliament was adjourned amid raucous debates over the plan, which was intended to drain unaccounted cash, so-called black money, from the economy to cut down on rampant corruption and tax avoidance.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal of Delhi and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee of West Bengal joined forces in opposition to the policy on Thursday, attending a rally against the decision in New Delhi and demanding that it be rolled back in three days.In a televised interview, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley expressed regret over the inconvenience but said it was unavoidable because \u201cwe have to withdraw currency which is used for generating black money.\u201dMr. Modi announced on Nov. 8 that India\u2019s highest-value bills, the 1,000 and 500 rupee notes, worth about $15 and $7.50, would cease being legal tender the next morning. The bills represent more than 80 percent of the currency in the country. The old currency could be exchanged for new bills, but those were in short supply and no replacement bills had been printed to avoid tipping off anyone about the plan.Officials warned that while they were doing what they could, the currency shortage was not going to disappear overnight.\u201cPlease remember this dislocation is not going to get over in the 50 days the prime minister has mentioned,\u201d Arun Shourie, a former cabinet minister, said Thursday evening on NDTV, an Indian news channel, adding that experts had estimated the full adjustment could take months.\u201cThe scale of this event is so unprecedented that we are all struggling to see where the chips will fall,\u201d Pratap Bhanu Mehta, the president of the Centre for Policy Research, wrote in The Indian Express. \u201cJust as a matter of political analysis, the sheer audacity of this move is breathtaking.\u201dHari Kumar contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Move Over, Neptune. Doug Aitken Has Another Big Idea.", "Date": "2016-11-19", "News": "Supported byOFF THE COAST OF CATALINA ISLAND \u2014 At first, the fish avoided the intruder. A couple of beefy sheepshead hid in the kelp near the shore. The electric orange Garibaldi swam in the other direction. A small school of blacksmith darted away.The 12-sided structure, lined with mirrors to capture the sunlight, glowed with an otherworldly beauty as we approached it at a depth of 15 feet. This is what it must feel like to be inside a kaleidoscope, I thought as I swam through one of its open sides.I had joined Mr. Aitken on his first dive to his destination artwork on a sunny day this month, a scuba novice waddling in my fins down steps outside the grand Catalina Casino, straight into the Pacific Ocean. The project\u2019s producer, Cyrill Gutsch, and two diving instructors tagged along.Only the fish, potentially the most colorful participants, weren\u2019t biting. \u201cI think all the activity scared them away,\u201d Mr. Aitken mused when he was back on land, sounding exhilarated anyway as he recalled the play of the reflections off the mirrors. \u201cIt was just hypnotic, with this pulsing light \u2014 I could see the ocean floor above me and the sun below me,\u201d he said.An internationally celebrated video artist, Mr. Aitken, 48, has long sought collaborations with other artists, musicians and actors to help bring his work to life. In 2013, he turned a cross-country train ride from Brooklyn to Oakland, Calif., with recording and art studios on board, into what he called \u201ca nomadic happening,\u201d inviting Patti Smith, James Turrell, Alice Waters, Olafur Eliasson and Urs Fischer to participate.But making an artwork designed to be experienced at depths of 10 to 40 feet proved more challenging in some respects, with a new group of collaborators, an unpredictable setting and \u201cmore variables than anything I\u2019ve done before,\u201d Mr. Aitken said.And now the structures are subject to the elements, dramatically changing appearance with the shifting tides, waning daylight, churning water and movement of divers, not to mention the instincts of fish \u2014 which were later spotted inside the pavilions, along with a sea lion mesmerized by his own reflection. (The installation officially opens to divers Dec. 4 and is expected to remain a few months.)Interactivity is the goal, Mr. Aitken said shortly before our plunge. Dressed casually in a denim shirt and jeans, he spoke with the excitement of an entrepreneur in pitch mode, a role he often has to assume to secure financing for his projects.\u201cThe moment the first pavilion entered the water, it stopped being a sculpture for me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt became this living system \u2014 constantly in flux, constantly changing, whether that\u2019s the sea life entering it, the kelp pushing at it or swimmers interacting with it.\u201dHe described his work as a \u201clens\u201d or \u201cdoor\u201d into the ocean terrain. And, as I learned, it\u2019s a strange realm, where light travels slower, sound travels faster, and the feeling of floating underwater can flood you with sensations of deep peace and quiet.The immersion into nature is a departure for Mr. Aitken, who is best known for video art that uses multiple, fragmented or alternative screens to capture today\u2019s hyper-accelerated and technology-driven culture.It certainly seems as if Mr. Aitken is offering the Catalina project, developed to coincide with the survey, as a more meditative and less flashy experience, mirrors notwithstanding. No Hollywood names are involved and no collectors. The project began, he said, with a desire to \u201cwork with the ocean\u201d and leave his own comfort zone.A California native and longtime surfer, he has lived on the edge of Los Angeles in Venice for decades. But this time he wanted to leave the city behind. \u201cI felt strongly about not staging the piece on the mainland,\u201d he said, pointing to the urban sprawl in the distance, an hour\u2019s ferry ride away. \u201cI didn\u2019t want something you could drive to, pull into a parking lot and see. I wanted a process to take you out of the everyday.\u201d In short, he wants to dilate time.The plan was to open in warmer weather, until the project hit some snags. One week in October, the engine on the mooring barge went out. Then a patch of rough weather kept everyone home. Using local workers also meant a different pace \u2014 \u201cisland time,\u201d Mr. Aitken called it.So how do you extend the reach of such a work? Mr. Aitken\u2019s answer was cameras: He planted three close to the ocean floor and one in each of the pavilions. The Parley and Museum of Contemporary Art websites will carry video feeds starting Dec. 4. \u201cI want to know that a student in Tokyo can open a tablet and see a feed from the pavilions live,\u201d Mr. Aitken said.He is also making a short film about the pavilions \u2014 atmospheric, \u201cnot narrative,\u201d he said \u2014 that will be added to the museum\u2019s survey next month. The Los Angeles show is traveling in 2017 to the Museum of Modern Art in Fort Worth. The pavilions\u2019 trajectory is not yet firm.\u201cThe pavilions will probably go to the Maldives,\u201d Mr. Gutsch said, describing Parley\u2019s history working there. Mr. Aitken said he\u2019s curious to see how the installation might evolve in different locales and whether the now-pristine surfaces will slowly begin to host sea life, including barnacles, corals and algae.\u201cIf it ever has a permanent home,\u201d Mr. Aitken said, \u201cI can imagine it eventually becoming an artificial reef, completely overgrown.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Memories of Another Mosul", "Date": "2016-11-26", "News": "Supported byOpinionCHICAGO \u2014 The ancient Assyrians considered the Tigris River the division between East and West, and the city I come from in Iraq is called Mosul \u2014 connection point, in Arabic \u2014 because it connects these two sides. Nineveh, which lay on the eastern bank of the Tigris, was a capital of the great Assyrian empire. When Arabs arrived in the seventh century, they preferred to live at a distance from it, on the western bank, where the modern city of Mosul is today.Growing up in Mosul, we were told that with the passage of time, the two peoples came to know one another, and exchanged words, languages, customs and rituals. Assyrians came to understand and speak Arabic, Arabs began to understand Assyrian, and in times of need they united. When enemies attacked the city, the Mosul story goes, Assyrians and Arabs joined together to fight off invaders.Mosul is an extension of the Nineveh plains, and an early homeland of Christianity. Before the fall of Saddam Hussein, there were dozens of Christian villages thriving in the Nineveh plains. Christians had lived normal lives in Mosul, for the most part, and over time became prominent scholars, doctors, lawyers and writers, and respected, active figures proportionate to their number in society. They made up a little less than a quarter of the city\u2019s population, according to the oldest statistics available, from 1912. I recall that in the days after Iraq gained independence and before a 1958 coup brought Arab nationalists to power, Mosul was represented in Parliament by four Muslim representatives and one Christian.A very small portion of the population was Jewish, but what the Jews lacked in numbers they made up for in important skills. When Faisal I was crowned king and the country\u2019s first ministry was created, Sassoon Eskell, a Jew, was appointed minister of finance. He was a loyal, well-regarded expert with great love for his country, and is still remembered fondly today.That was the Mosul of my childhood. But I left the city behind in the early 1960s. First I went to Baghdad, where I began my career as a novelist. My books got me into trouble with the government, though. Eventually, I fled Iraq.I returned to Mosul for the last time in July 2011. I wandered through the city apprehensively, my heart filled with loss and longing. I walked slowly, beneath the shade of the ancient city walls to escape the sun, to reclaim the city that had not left my memory. I began at the rundown train station, once the most beautiful building in Iraq, made of brilliant white marble. It was dilapidated and in ruins. In front of the station stood a statue of Mullah Uthman al-Mosuli, the only thing gleaming, as if its newness mocked its surroundings.Mullah Uthman al-Mosuli was a consummate singer, musician and reciter of the Quran, famed across the Arab world and emulated by singers to this day. In the 1970s, the statue of him was erected near the train station, as if remembering al-Mosuli\u2019s constant travels: Istanbul, Cairo, Damascus, Aleppo, Mecca, Medina, Baghdad, the villages near Mosul and beyond.But the statue faces the city, stretching toward the Tigris and then past it, toward Mosul\u2019s most beautiful mosque, the shrine of Nabi Yunus, known in English as the Prophet Jonah. It stood on an archaeological tell, a mound-ruin of the palace that some believe once belonged to the Assyrian emperor Esarhaddon, as if the mosque were the guardian of his treasures below, which extend for miles. Here Assyrian emperors\u2019 palaces once stood, surrounded by Nineveh\u2019s fortified walls, which were destroyed by Babylonians and Medes, razed, and the kings\u2019 treasures plundered.The ruins remained, untouched by excavations thanks to the sturdy guard above: the mosque of Nabi Yunus. It was sacred; no one could destroy it or excavate beneath it until the Islamic State arrived in 2014, sowing evil and devastation.They began by destroying the statue of Mullah Uthman al-Mosuli in the west, before destroying almost every precious artifact from there to the mosque of Nabi Yunus. Dozens of mosques with archaeological value, incredible statues in Mosul\u2019s museum and everything that European explorers could not steal was destroyed. The Islamic State burned tens of thousands of precious books, including more than 8,000 rare books and manuscripts in the central library alone.But when I visited in 2011, I couldn\u2019t imagine how much destruction Mosul would see just three years later at the hands of its latest invaders. My heart blazed with a yearning to rediscover my city. Even though it was 112 degrees on that July day, I felt as if I were being reborn. I ran around like a child, and within five minutes was swimming in sweat.I arrived at the neighborhood of Bab al-Jadid and could almost hear the cannons of Nader Shah, the 18th-century Persian ruler who tried to take over Mosul. I imagined the cannons blasting a hole in the city\u2019s wall, soldiers\u2019 shouts, voices of women encouraging Mosul\u2019s defenders. The bombing stopped; the battle had ended more than two and a half centuries ago. The wall was ultimately destroyed, but through stories it lived on, and people called the hole just a \u201ccrack.\u201d Nader Shah\u2019s army would have poured through it and decimated the city, were it not for a few young men who darted in and barred the gap with their bodies and steeds.I walked through narrow alleys, as shadows of the past streamed through my head. I gazed up to where the high walls ended. When I was a child, we slept on the roof in the summer because of the heat, and in the mornings what annoyed us most was the bright sun and the assault of hungry flies.Mahmoud Saeed is the author of \u201cSaddam City,\u201d among other works of fiction.

Finds a Villain: Bill de Blasio", "Date": "2016-11-08", "News": "Supported byIf a series of political attack ads on Long Island and in the Hudson Valley are to be believed, a madman is currently running New York City.It is hardly the only assault on Mr. de Blasio, who has emerged as an all-purpose boogeyman for Republican strategists trying to maintain the party\u2019s filament-thin hold on the New York Senate. Again and again, comments from Republican leaders and officials in Albany have cited perceived shortcomings of the mayor during this election cycle, and by extension, the city\u2019s Democrats who they fear will set a left-wing agenda for the state.When Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo recently endorsed a pair of Democrats on Long Island, Scott Reif, a spokesman for Senate Republicans, lumped the governor \u2014 a centrist Democrat \u2014 in with \u201cradical New York City Democrats\u201d and suggested that one of the endorsed candidates was \u201cbought and paid for by Bill de Blasio.\u201dAnd so on.Part of the calculation of using Mr. de Blasio as a punching bag is based on his unpopularity in the suburbs as well as suburbanites\u2019 historical mistrust of the city\u2019s more liberal policies.On numbers alone, the whack-a-Bill strategy seems to be sound: A poll in May by Siena College showed the mayor was deeply disliked in counties like Nassau and Suffolk to the east, and Orange, Putnam, Rockland and Westchester to the north. Fifty-six percent of such suburban voters had an unfavorable opinion of the mayor \u2014 the highest of any region in the state \u2014 while only one in three had a favorable view.State Senator John J. Flanagan, a Long Island Republican and majority leader, has called Democratic senators \u201can appendage of Bill de Blasio and City Hall.\u201dMike Murphy, a spokesman for the Senate Democrats, said the Republicans\u2019 assertions about the mayor\u2019s influence on its slate of candidates were simply untrue.\u201cSenate Republicans clearly took their roles as Donald Trump\u2019s top cheerleaders seriously, lying about their opponents and spewing divisive and hateful rhetoric,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cWhen you have a record of corruption and blocking women\u2019s rights, I guess lying is the only option.\u201dThe level of agita over the mayor\u2019s role in campaigns outside the city underscores the uncertainty over the Senate: The Republicans, who have ruled the chamber for most of past 50 years, are clinging to power only by dint of an alliance with a Democrat, Simcha Felder of Brooklyn.But with Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential candidacy potentially alienating some moderates, the Democrats had hopes of picking up seats in perhaps as many as eight districts. (Republicans liked their chances of filling an open seat in Buffalo and defeating incumbent Democrats in several upstate and suburban districts.)Eric F. Phillips, a spokesman for the mayor, said the attacks on Mr. de Blasio were \u201cthree decades in the past.\u201d\u201cThis anti-city strategy existed long before Mayor de Blasio,\u201d Mr. Phillips said, \u201cbut it\u2019s especially misguided now, given the incomparable economic and public safety success of the city over the last few years.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Chris Christie of New Jersey, the race for the Democratic nomination has become more of a coronation than a contest, with one name emerging as the likely candidate: Philip D. Murphy.Mr. Murphy is not the boyish mayor of Jersey City with the potent urban base and compelling Marine biography. That would be Steven M. Fulop. Nor is he the wily South Jersey legislator and moderate union official with the backing of the state\u2019s most feared power broker. That would be Stephen M. Sweeney.On the surface, the parallels are inescapable. Both rocketed to the top of Wall Street, enabling them to spend millions of dollars of their own fortunes to run as novices for statewide office. And both played checkbook politics, showering thousands of dollars upon crucial Democratic organizations and candidates.But they are hardly carbon copies. While Mr. Corzine ran for United States Senate as part of a quest for redemption after being ousted at Goldman Sachs, Mr. Murphy retired on his own accord 13 years ago, and has since been involved in local charities, public policy and national politics. And while Mr. Corzine was a socially awkward mumbler who agonized over decisions, Mr. Murphy, who considered pursuing a career in musical theater, oozes affability, remembers the tiniest details about people he has met and quickly owns up to his missteps.\u201cI was very disappointed with what happened with Jon,\u201d said Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor, who was chairman of the Democratic National Committee when Mr. Murphy helped to raise $300 million as finance chairman from 2006 to 2009. \u201cPhil\u2019s very different. He is relentless and pleasant at the same time, and he doesn\u2019t have a vengeful bone in his body.\u201dThough New Jersey voters are still focused on Tuesday\u2019s election, Mr. Murphy declared his bid in May \u2014 more than a year before the primary. But the timing was no accident; for the previous three years, Mr. Murphy had immersed himself in state issues at countless barbecues, diners and meetings.After hiring some of the state\u2019s top Democratic consultants, he inundated residents with mailers, pop-up ads and automated calls focused on issues like \u201ctackling the state\u2019s lead crisis.\u201d And as part of what he called a \u201chyper-retail campaign\u201d that has already spent $1.6 million, he convened more than a dozen town-hall-style events, and hired canvassers to knock on more than 225,000 doors.\u201cThe more at-bats I get, the better,\u201d Mr. Murphy said in an interview last week after speaking to more than 200 Democratic loyalists here. \u201cThe more rooms I can be in like tonight, where people have an up-close, personal sense of who I am, the better.\u201dPolitical analysts viewed Mr. Murphy as the underdog in the race. After all, powerful county leaders and public sector unions were expected to support either Mr. Fulop or Mr. Sweeney. State Senator Raymond J. Lesniak and Assemblyman John Wisniewski loomed as well.Some people do not think that is a good thing. Brigid C. Harrison, a political-science professor at Montclair State University, said that Mr. Murphy\u2019s money spooked the other candidates. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t bode well for voters or political parties,\u201d she said, because \u201cNew Jerseyans are denied a choice.\u201dA native of Newton, Mass., Mr. Murphy grew up in a working-class Irish Catholic household that revered the Kennedys. His father, who did not graduate from high school, managed a liquor store; his mother worked as an office secretary.At Harvard, Mr. Murphy was an announcer at football games. He also served as the president of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals club, part of a group that included the current and former Massachusetts governors Charlie Baker and Deval Patrick, the conservative political advocate Grover Norquist and the comedian and New Yorker contributor Andy Borowitz, among others.Peter Rose, a senior adviser at Blackstone who worked with Mr. Murphy in Hong Kong, said Mr. Murphy was known for being \u201cpathologically punctual.\u201d But he often invited junior analysts and other staff members on outings to build morale, and embraced contrarian views by saying, \u201cTell me if I\u2019m wrong.\u201d\u201cHe was always a builder and a guy who got things done,\u201d Mr. Rose said.\u201cTo his credit, and I\u2019ve never voted for a Democrat in my life, he handled it very well, and he was professional in terms of managing things and dealing with people,\u201d Richard D. Quinn, a retired compensation and benefits executive, said. \u201cThere was no hint during the meetings of any politics.\u201d\u201cI believe that in crisis you come together,\u201d he said in an interview after the event in Edison.He is not shy about praising Republicans. At the event in Edison, he called former Gov. Thomas H. Kean of New Jersey a mentor on national security issues. He described Mr. Baker, who was his classmate at Needham High School and at Harvard, \u201ca really good guy.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a classic Bill Weld, Tom Kean Republican,\u201d Mr. Murphy continued.Still, Peter G. Sheridan Jr., executive director of the state\u2019s Republican Party, is already caricaturing Mr. Murphy as \u201ca bad sequel to the story of Jon Corzine,\u201d adding that \u201cthe last thing we need is out-of-touch Wall Street values leading our state back into fiscal oblivion.\u201dMr. Murphy says the comparison is understandable, but invalid. It is, he said, like saying \u201cA-Rod and Jeter were both Yankees.\u201dPatrick McGeehan contributed reporting, and Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Obama Exits World Stage, Angela Merkel May Be the Liberal West\u2019s Last Defender", "Date": "2016-11-12", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 And then there was one.An increasingly divided Europe is looking to Germany, its richest power, to cope with its many problems, some of them longstanding: low growth, a continuing stream of refugees, and increasingly angry and nationalistic electorates.Italy and Spain are politically fragile, Austria might elect a hard-right president next month, and Ms. Merkel faces difficult negotiations with Britain over its so-called Brexit.For the last eight years, Ms. Merkel could count on the steadfast backing of President Obama and France\u2019s \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. But with the ascent of Mr. Trump and the deep unpopularity of President Fran\u03c2ois Hollande, she has lost that vital backing.\u201cShe\u2019s the last one standing, and that makes her both strong and weak at the same time,\u201d said Stefan Kornelius, one of her biographers and a political analyst for the daily newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung. \u201cShe\u2019s a pillar of stability, the last wall, and people want to lean against it.\u201dAt the same time, he said, \u201cshe\u2019s the lightning rod for all those European populists who blame Germany for being powerful and hegemonic and setting the rules\u201d \u2014 including Alternative for Germany, the country\u2019s own rising populist party.But experience and patience count. Much like her initial response to the Brexit vote \u2014 urging calm and expressing the intent to work for a close relationship with Britain no matter what \u2014 Ms. Merkel\u2019s reaction to the election of Mr. Trump was deft.On a fateful date when Germans are usually preoccupied with remembering Kristallnacht \u2014 the Nazis\u2019 pogroms against Jews on Nov. 9, 1938 \u2014 and the joyous fall of the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9, 1989, Ms. Merkel offered Mr. Trump her close cooperation but named a price: respect for human dignity and for minorities from a man who has mocked both.Ms. Merkel had a brisk, assertive tone that was a measure of how far Germany has come since American generosity and protection enabled it to rise from Nazi defeat, first to prosper and eventually to overcome Cold War division.\u201cGermany and America are bound by common values: democracy, freedom, as well as respect for the rule of law and the dignity of each and every person regardless of their origin, skin color, creed, gender, sexual orientation or political views,\u201d she said. Cooperation with the United States, she said, must be \u201cbased on these values.\u201d\u201cIt was stunning how she publicly laid out the rules for Trump, congratulating him but laying down conditions,\u201d Mr. Kornelius said.\u201cIt would have been nice had she proposed it to other European leaders and said, \u2018Let\u2019s do this together,\u2019\u201d Ms. Balfour said. \u201cThat didn\u2019t happen.\u201dFor Ms. Merkel, the Trump victory was also a personal blow, because she has had a mutually admiring friendship with Hillary Clinton and because it will damage the legacy of Mr. Obama.This coming week, Mr. Obama will visit Germany after a stop in Greece on what is likely to be his last visit to Europe as president. It will be a bittersweet moment for two leaders who have come to rely on each other, even after Mr. Obama\u2019s strong criticism of Germany\u2019s unyielding stance on the euro, austerity and the Greek debt crisis.But Germany\u2019s strength also has fissures. Some 27 years after the Berlin Wall fell, Europe\u2019s No. 1 economy shirks any real fundamental changes. It remains dependent on American military and intelligence for its security, although it is ramping up intelligence spending. Its exporters benefit hugely from the euro single currency, but the government keeps postponing the politically costly task of strengthening the eurozone.In the past two years, Ms. Merkel has been firm in dealing with Russia, keeping Europe united on sanctions of the Kremlin for its seizure of Crimea and fighting in east Ukraine. But Ms. Merkel\u2019s admission of hundreds of thousands of mostly Muslim refugees last year weakened her at home and soured relations with Central and Eastern European countries that felt ignored.Mr. Trump\u2019s election may remove some of those difficulties. His pay-as-you-go approach to NATO, for instance, could prompt the Central and Eastern Europeans to turn toward the European Union, and Germany, as a more reliable source of protection.Eugeniusz Smolar of the Center for International Relations in Warsaw said that \u201cEuropeans need a shock,\u201d and that Mr. Trump\u2019s election \u201cis one which might be very helpful to concentrate their beautiful minds.\u201d After decades of lip service, Mr. Smolar said, Europeans may for instance finally pool arms production or indeed strengthen and expand the eurozone.But the vivid weakness of France and Mr. Hollande, and the rise of right-wing populism from Poland and Hungary to France and Germany itself, have put another burden on Ms. Merkel, Mr. Tilford said. \u201cIf Trump can win in the United States, then Le Pen can win in France,\u201d he said.If Ms. Merkel \u201cwants to prevent the worsening of the political situation in France,\u201d he said, that would mean loosening up on the eurozone \u2014 a banking union, pan-eurozone public investment, an end to austerity. \u201cAnd that would mean Merkel facing down\u201d the right in her own party, Alternative for Germany and her finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble.\u201cTo help France and prevent Le Pen is to risk increased populism in Germany,\u201d Mr. Tilford said.It is equally possible that Europe\u2019s response to Mr. Trump\u2019s election might accentuate the Continent\u2019s divisions. Mark Leonard, the director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank based in London, said it could \u201ccreate a kind of race to Washington, where everybody tries to do their own deals\u201d with the deal-making Mr. Trump.The British will be at the head of the queue, he said \u2014 something apparently confirmed by the president-elect\u2019s immediate invitation to Prime Minister Theresa May to visit Washington.Ms. Merkel\u2019s style of leadership \u2014 undramatic, which is how many voters here like it \u2014 may not cut much ice with Mr. Trump, the building magnate and reality TV star, who loves the glamour that Ms. Merkel shuns. During the campaign, he fiercely attacked her admission of migrants.And she may be able to use Mr. Trump\u2019s victory to her own electoral advantage.\u201cI was really impressed by her statement, especially her appeal below the surface\u201d to Mr. Trump to behave properly, said Daniel Mock, 23, an engineering student at Technical University of Berlin. \u201cIt could stand her in a better light.\u201dBy contrast, Vincent Szlang, 21, and Vincent Frebel, 23, both economics students, went against the generally critical German view of Mr. Trump. \u201cThe election was a repudiation of two different lifestyles: first the old liberalism and second the attempt to preserve order through pragmatism,\u201d Mr. Szlang said.Mr. Frebel saw the chance of better relations with Russia and said Mrs. Clinton would have been harsher on Germany than Mr. Trump.Such remarks underpin concerns among older generations that the lessons of Nazism and Communism are not necessarily learned, and that Germans old and young share Mr. Trump\u2019s admiration for the leader of near-neighbor Russia.Berlin\u2019s B.Z. tabloid reflected the shift since the fall of the wall. Back then, in an iconic headline, it proclaimed: \u201cBerlin is again Berlin!\u201dTwenty-seven years later, it pronounced the election of Mr. Trump \u201cthe night the West died.\u201dKatarina Johannsen contributed reporting from Berlin.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Advocates for New York\u2019s Working Poor Push for Discounted Transit Fares", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported byAt a time when New York City can seem unbearably expensive, advocates for the poor are targeting a rising cost that many people struggle to afford: a MetroCard.And with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority poised to approve its latest fare increase in January, they are pressing Mayor Bill de Blasio to finance a program that would offer half-price subway and bus fares to New Yorkers living in poverty.One of the authority board\u2019s newest members, David R. Jones, is challenging Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, to support the proposal as part of his re-election campaign. Mr. Jones, who was nominated to the board by the mayor, said Mr. de Blasio\u2019s transportation priorities, from new ferry boats to a planned streetcar line, though fine ideas, did not address income inequality.\u201cThis could have the most immediate impact to help the working poor right now rather than years in the future,\u201d said Mr. Jones, the president of the Community Service Society of New York, an antipoverty nonprofit.The de Blasio administration said it was examining the proposal, but city officials were reluctant to commit to paying for it without the help of the state and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who controls the authority. Given the tension between the mayor and Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, Mr. Jones said he hoped the city would act quickly to finance the program itself.But the idea of offering income-based fares in New York would be the biggest experiment of its kind yet. The city\u2019s subway and bus system is vast, with more than 7.5 million daily riders, and the plan would be expensive, especially at a time when the authority is financially strapped and struggling to cope with record ridership.Next week, the authority is expected to release a proposal for a 4 percent increase on fares and tolls across the agency\u2019s network of subways, buses, tunnels and bridges. The new base fare, which may rise to $3 from $2.75, is expected to take effect in March as part of regularly scheduled increases every two years.But the current fares are already too expensive for many New Yorkers. Leslie Wells, a substitute teacher who lives in Harlem, often worries about finding enough change to pay the cost of a ride. After paying for housing and food, there is little left over. She said she certainly could not afford to spend $116.50, the current price of a monthly pass.\u201cI have to think about it,\u201d said Ms. Wells, a member of the Riders Alliance. \u201cWhat if the change doesn\u2019t add up? It\u2019s extra stress added to my day.\u201dMs. Wells said she had sometimes asked her son to duck under turnstiles to avoid paying his fare, even though she knew that doing so was against the rules.\u201cI really didn\u2019t have any other choice than to do that,\u201d she said. \u201cHe thought it was an adventure. I didn\u2019t feel good about it.\u201dThe city\u2019s transportation commissioner, Polly Trottenberg, said the city and the authority had discussed discounts for low-income riders, but that the expense of such a program should not be borne by the city alone because the authority is a state agency.\u201cI do think we\u2019re ready to sit down with the M.T.A. and look at, potentially, are there creative revenue sources we can come up with here, if we all collectively agree that this is an important priority?\u201d she said.Ms. Trottenberg, who serves on the authority board, said the city also wanted to examine a potential expansion of the City Ticket program, which provides discounts to riders traveling on commuter railroads within New York City on weekends, and whether it was fair to be offering discounts only when riders put at least $5.50 on their MetroCards.The authority has been a source of tension between Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo, who feuded last year over whether the city should pay more for the transit system\u2019s long-term projects. A spokeswoman for the mayor, Freddi Goldstein, said the city already paid a hefty sum toward the authority\u2019s operations and capital budget.\u201cThis proposal will be evaluated as part of the fare-setting process for the M.T.A., as well as the state and city budgets,\u201d Ms. Goldstein said in a statement about the idea of half-price fares.A spokeswoman for the authority, Beth DeFalco, said the agency helped low-income riders in New York City by subsidizing fares for students and people 65 or older.\u201cThe M.T.A. keeps fares as low as possible while providing safe, reliable service,\u201d she said.Though riders have been frustrated by regular fare increases, officials at the authority said its policy was better than those used by other systems, like New Jersey Transit, which has less predictable increases and imposed one of 9 percent last year. The authority has said it plans to stick to a 4 percent increase across its network every two years.In the Seattle area, more than 35,600 people have enrolled in a discount fare program for low income riders that began in March 2015. Riders can qualify for what is known as an Orca Lift card if their household incomes are less than double the federal poverty level.The program addresses inequality in the Seattle area, where residents who work for companies like Microsoft and Amazon can afford to pay full fare, but others with limited education cannot, said Dow Constantine, the King County executive and chairman of Sound Transit, a transportation agency that serves multiple counties in the region.\u201cThe results we\u2019re seeing are that people are actually using transit more frequently now that they have the Orca Lift card, and that is a good thing, because mobility translates to opportunity and productivity,\u201d he said.The costs of the Seattle-area program have been relatively small compared with the projected expense in New York City: $3.4 million for operating and capital costs to start offering discounts, and about $3.9 million in lost revenue in the first year, officials said.When Jonathan Kumar moved to Seattle from Michigan recently, his rent nearly tripled. While trying to establish a start-up to help homeless people, he had little income and qualified for a discount card to ride the bus.\u201cThe savings allow me to better afford rent, to better afford utilities and groceries,\u201d he said.Now that his start-up is doing well, Mr. Kumar said he would no longer need the discount.\u201cNow I\u2019ll be able to better afford to pay a regular fare,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

At another Austin location, about 500 engineers work on the chips that will run the next round of Apple\u2019s products.The Austin campus \u2014 the company\u2019s largest outside its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. \u2014 offers plenty of perks, too. When employees are not working, they can lounge on chairs shaded from the Texas sun, dine at a two-story cafeteria that serves an abundance of food options, including barbecued ribs and banana-bread gelato, and visit a full-service medical clinic, which includes dentists, acupuncturists and a robot-assisted pharmacy.Although contractors at the Austin technical support call center earn as little as $14.50 an hour, equivalent to about $30,000 a year, many of them become permanent staff members, which means better pay, after the typical one-year contract is up. Experienced call center employees earn around $45,000 a year, plus generous benefits and small annual stock grants. Pay is even higher for more senior advisers and managers. Apple says that, excluding benefits and stock compensation, the average salary of its Austin employees, including management, is $77,000 a year.Apple declined to discuss its future expansion plans in Austin and in the United States.\u201cApple has created over two million jobs in the United States since the introduction of the iPhone nine years ago, including explosive growth in iOS developers, thousands of new supplier and manufacturing partners, and a 400 percent increase in our employee teams,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe made the unique decision to keep and expand our contact centers for customers in the Americas in the United States, and Austin is home to many of those employees. We plan to continue to invest and grow across the U.S.\u201dLast week, a reporter and photographer visited the Austin campus and interviewed more than a dozen workers, from managers to a prep cook on the kitchen staff. Apple\u2019s public relations staff monitored some of the conversations, but others were unsupervised.Genny Lopez, who went to college for two years and used to work as a bartender, joined Apple as a contractor handling tech support calls. She is now on staff, troubleshooting difficult customer problems. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a crazy technical background to do this job,\u201d Ms. Lopez said. \u201cA lot of the training is getting really good at talking to people.\u201dApple prides itself on providing top-notch phone service in 26 languages \u2014 12 are spoken at the Texas call center alone \u2014 and the people who handle the calls are expected to follow up on any problem that cannot be quickly resolved. During the recent visit, Stephanie Dumareille, a senior adviser on iOS issues who is fluent in English and Spanish, patiently answered questions from a customer who was worried about saving her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 online and did not know whether she was using a Windows or a Mac computer.Employees say that Apple encourages them to move within and across teams, and the company is instituting a formal program to allow workers to try a completely different role for six months to see it if suits them and the company. Brisa Carillo, who started out in the call center fresh out of college five years ago, now handles international payroll matters and is studying for her M.B.A. so she can move up the ranks of the finance department within Apple.The region\u2019s economy has deep roots in technology and is home to a number of big tech employers, most notably Dell. Apple\u2019s influence in the area extends beyond the people on its direct payroll. It has 350 suppliers in Texas alone.\u201cThere is a high road, and Apple followed that path,\u201d said Bo Delp, director of the Better Builder program at the Workers Defense Project. \u201cIt sent a pretty strong message to others in Austin.\u201dA mile from its Austin campus, Apple is involved in manufacturing, through Flex, a global contract manufacturer. Flex assembles Apple\u2019s Mac Pro desktop computers to meet the exact requirements of customers, who can choose among more than 4,000 combinations of features and hardware.Flex added about 2,000 jobs for the Apple project. Although Apple and Flex declined to discuss details of their arrangement, the assembly jobs start at $11 an hour and pay an average of about $30,000 a year, according to testimony by Flex officials in 2014, when they sought government aid for the expansion.Apple could in theory build more products in the United States through contractors like Flex. But the company and industrial experts say that would be very difficult and could easily add $100 to the final cost of an iPhone. China has built a whole ecosystem of suppliers for nearly every electronic part imaginable. Vast pools of trained labor make it easy to quickly scale production up or down to meet demand.Larger products, or ones that require more customizing, such as PCs, make more sense to build close to the final customer.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to ship a phone, and it\u2019s harder to ship a computer,\u201d said Andy Tsay, a professor at Santa Clara University who has studied global manufacturing patterns. \u201cAnd it\u2019s harder still for cars and refrigerators.\u201dOver time, the value of Apple\u2019s business is shifting away from hardware like the iPhone and into software such as apps and services like Apple Music, Mr. Tsay said. And those jobs can be much better for workers. \u201cThere are fewer industrial accidents working in a call center,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is probably more gender equity. And it\u2019s probably better for customers, too.\u201dAlan Marquis, a former Army officer who spent a couple of years streamlining processes on a manufacturer\u2019s assembly line before joining Apple, now manages part of the complex software that integrates Apple\u2019s suppliers into the company\u2019s production systems. \u201cHere, there\u2019s a lot more openness and creativity,\u201d he said. \u201cIn manufacturing, it\u2019s a lot more widgets dropping off the line.\u201dMayor Steve Adler of Austin, a Democrat, does not sweat the details of the jobs companies create in his city. He is more concerned that the work pays enough \u2014 at least $20 an hour \u2014 to support the city\u2019s middle class, which is being squeezed by rising home prices.Some of the new jobs, like those at the Austin chip factory owned by Samsung, Apple\u2019s biggest rival in the smartphone business, will be in manufacturing. Others, like the ones Apple brings, will be in services. \u201cThe best kind of jobs are those that allow someone to continue to grow and climb the ladder,\u201d Mr. Adler said.Asked about Apple\u2019s lack of manufacturing in the United States, Ms. Lopez said: \u201cThe product that Apple builds here is us.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the education attained by Genny Lopez. She attended college for two years; she did not receive an associate\u2019s degree.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Foreign Investor Program Funding More Luxury Projects", "Date": "2016-11-15", "News": "Supported byA federal program meant to encourage investment in the United States from wealthy foreigners is increasingly supporting large luxury real estate projects, not the development in the rural and downtrodden districts that some say were the original targets of the program.With billions of dollars flowing in, mostly from wealthy Chinese, the program faces an uncertain future. In September, Congress reset the expiration date on parts of the so-called EB-5 program to Dec. 9.The program grants permanent residency in the United States to those who are willing to immigrate and invest $500,000 in a business that creates at least 10 jobs. Many of the projects that have received money have been in real estate, though investments have also gone to charter schools, medical centers and manufacturing plants. Some $15 billion of investments have been made through the program since 2005, according to the EB-5 Coalition, an industry group in Washington.Critics have derided the program as essentially a legal way for immigrants to buy their way into the country.Donald J. Trump\u2019s election adds a new wrinkle. He campaigned heavily on immigration reform, pledging to build a wall on the Mexican border and increase the deportation of criminal noncitizens. He also said he wanted to reduce legal immigration and ensure jobs are offered to Americans first.\u201cWhether President-elect Trump will actually follow through on these pledges remains to be seen,\u201d said Stephen W. Yale-Loehr, a law professor at Cornell University and an immigration lawyer. \u201cIt is always difficult for Congress to enact significant immigration changes because immigration is so complex and controversial.\u201dThe United States is not alone in offering residence for investment. Germany, Australia and Canada have versions of the program, as do several small countries. Competition among Caribbean nations is rising for their citizenship-by-investment programs, with St. Lucia being the most recent to revamp its program.Foreign interest is growing. According to an analysis by professors at New York University, investments in the program are increasingly financing large-scale, luxury or entertainment-oriented real estate developments. Among them: nearly $1 billion gathered in the last year from 2,000 investors to build a Chinese-style casino in Las Vegas, $600 million from 1,200 investors for New York\u2019s mixed-use Hudson Yards project and $150 million from 300 investors to construct the Beverly Hills Waldorf Astoria.The program was intended to reward people for putting money into the United States. Projects that raised more than $1 billion were practically nonexistent in the program before 2010, Prof. Jeanne Calderon of New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business wrote in a March report on the program. But when banks turned off the credit spigot around the 2008 financial crisis, developers started getting more creative in finding alternative financing.Many of these projects are run by large commercial developers who could proceed without any foreign investment but are reaching out to foreign investors for cheaper financing than they would receive from banks.Reformers from both political parties are calling for a much tighter definition of the areas eligible for investment through the program to remove the tracts in prosperous urban areas and get money to underserved ones. They are also looking at raising the investment minimum to $800,000.In addition, they hope to make the projects more accountable by requiring better disclosures to protect potentially vulnerable immigrants from fraudulent schemes. Federal securities regulators have filed several enforcement actions against people committing fraud through the program in recent years.The issue has friends and foes on either side of the political aisle. Senators from rural parts of the country want more development dollars coming to their districts, while those from large cities want to maintain the status quo. As for the immigrants themselves, they are entering the program mostly in an effort to gain permanent residency in the United States, which gives project developers more power.\u201cLike so many things, there are a lot of people who are adversely affected but only by a little, and there are a very small group of developers who benefit \u2014 they win,\u201d said David North, a fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington.The Beverly Hills Waldorf Astoria is being developed by Beny Alagem, an Israeli-born American entrepreneur who also owns the Beverly Hilton. It has nine acres and 12 stories and includes a hotel and a residential condominium tower. Three hundred investors contributed $150 million to the project in the form of a loan. It is estimated to create 3,629 jobs.The Wanda Group, which is the largest commercial developer in China and is owned by the nation\u2019s richest man, is said to be seeking foreign investment program financing for its Wanda Vista Hotel in Chicago. The city approved the project last November. The Wanda Group is also developing One Beverly Hills Hotel next to the new Waldorf in that city.The Genting Group, a global development conglomerate based in Malaysia, is developing Resorts World Las Vegas with nearly $1 billion of program money. The $4 billion project includes 3,100 rooms and 100,000 square feet of gambling space, restaurants, shops, a panda habitat and a 4,000-seat theater.Jeffrey Berkowitz is developing SkyRise Miami, a 100,000-square-foot multipurpose entertainment complex and observation tower along Biscayne Bay that will be the city\u2019s highest building when completed. Foreign program investors are contributing 63 percent of the financing through a $270 million loan. About 540 investors are involved in the project, which is expected to create more than 6,000 jobs.And 350 foreign program investors put up $175 million for Empire Outlets, a mall and hotel complex planned for Staten Island. Goldman Sachs is a partner in the project, which aims to create 4,500 jobs.All of this investing has created a backlog of uncertain futures. Currently, 22,000 petitions are pending with the Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is directed under the Department of Homeland Security.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Green-Wood Cemetery, Where Presidential Aspirants Enjoy an Afterlife", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byLET us now consider a particular presidential candidate who made a fortune in business and real estate, who reveled in being famous, who had never held elective office before and who urged his supporters to cancel their subscriptions to a newspaper that had called him an idiot.And who is dead.That man \u2014 George Francis Train, who campaigned as an independent in 1872 \u2014 is one of the nine failed presidential candidates buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn. Once these men dreamed of winning the highest office in the land, of signing bills, of being remembered for foreign policy doctrines, or at least for rearranging the furniture in the White House. But they became footnotes in political history, all but forgotten, except at Green-Wood.On Sunday, the cemetery will pay tribute with a two-hour bus tour of the nine also-rans\u2019 graves. The bus, outfitted like a trolley, will wind past tall monuments and statues as well as tombs that usually go unnoticed. One presidential might-have-been is in an elaborate mausoleum with ionic columns, but the name above the entrance is not his; it is that of his wealthy father-in-law.Perhaps the best-known of the Green-Wood presidential aspirants is Horace Greeley, editor of The New York Tribune in the mid-19th century. He and Train were, strictly speaking, opponents, since both campaigned in 1872 \u2014 Train even charged admission to his rallies and posted a profit of $90,000, equivalent to $17.9 million now. (Train also has a place in literary history. He is thought to have been an inspiration for Phileas Fogg in Jules Verne\u2019s \u201cAround the World in 80 Days.\u201d)But if Train received any votes, they were write-ins. Green-Wood\u2019s historian, Jeff Richman, said that Train\u2019s disorganized campaign operation did not get his name on the ballot in a single state. Nor was defeating an incumbent any easier in those days. Train, and Greeley, lost to President Ulysses S. Grant, who claimed a second term with 56 percent of the vote.Greeley\u2019s grave is topped by a weathered statue on a tall pedestal. Imposing as it is, it is not as elaborate as the tomb of the industrialist, inventor and philanthropist Peter Cooper. He was 85 when he ran as the National Independent Party candidate in 1876, making him the oldest presidential candidate in American history. He received only 83,726 votes of 8.4 million cast, or just under 1 percent. His grave kept the stone-carvers busy: The tall monument has 30 lines of lettering.Green-Wood has a definite Clinton bias. The first stop will be the grave of DeWitt Clinton, who was lieutenant governor of New York when he ran against James Madison in 1812 (and who was not related to Bill Clinton). Lisa W. Alpert, Green-Wood\u2019s director of development, dryly noted that he \u201cwould have been the first President Clinton\u201d if he had won.Mr. Richman said that there was talk of a Clinton dynasty when the campaign began because DeWitt Clinton\u2019s Uncle George had served two terms as vice president. He was 72, and fading physically and mentally, however. He died in April 1812, seven months before the election. The Federalist nomination went to DeWitt Clinton.That Clinton presidency was not to be, either. In July 1812, the United States declared war on Britain. Though on the Federalist Party ticket, which wanted peace, Clinton realized he needed the support of Republicans, who were in favor of the war but were disenchanted with their standard-bearer, President Madison. Mr. Richman said Clinton had to say one thing to Federalist audiences and another to Republicans.Clinton lost by 39 votes in the Electoral College, receiving 89 to Madison\u2019s 128. Then as now, Pennsylvania played an important role. Its 25 votes went to Madison. \u201cBut if you subtract those 25 from Madison and give them to Clinton,\u201d Mr. Richman said, \u201cClinton becomes president.\u201d He would have won by 11 electoral votes.Clinton went on to champion the Erie Canal, the 363-mile ribbon of locks and water that opened the way to the rest of the country. When he died in 1828, he was buried near Albany \u201cin the plot of a family friend since his had no money,\u201d said Ruth Edebohls of the Green-Wood Historic Fund\u2019, who will lead the tour.Green-Wood saw an opportunity. Mr. Richman said that Green-Wood officials \u201cneeded somebody as an attraction here at the cemetery.\u201d\u201cThey decided nobody could be better than the deceased DeWitt Clinton, the most revered of all New Yorkers of the first quarter of the 19th century\u201d he said. \u201cThey contacted his son Charles and got permission to disinter him.\u201d The body was moved in 1844.But that was not all. Green-Wood raised money for a statue of Clinton that stood briefly at City Hall Park in Manhattan. \u201cThe statue was put up to get people to come to Green-Wood,\u201d Ms. Edebohls said. \u201cThey probably had a sign that said, \u2018Come and see me at Green-Wood.\u2019\u201dSo in death Clinton helped Green-Wood become the second-largest tourist attraction in New York State, after Niagara Falls. Ms. Edebohls said that was not as morbid as it might sound. Green-Wood was in operation long before the city had its own parks \u2014 Central Park opened the year Green-Wood celebrated its 20th anniversary \u2014 and the Clinton statue did its job. \u201cPeople started coming over,\u201d she said.Mr. Richman added: \u201cThe idea was people would walk the grounds or ride in carriages on the tour and then say, \u2018Do you have any graves available?\u2019 The cemetery would be off and running in terms of sales.\u201d (Eventually the statue was moved and stands atop the grave.)Other candidates buried at Green-Wood were also-rans among the also-rans. Four, all Democrats, had their Oval Office hopes dashed months before Election Day. They were not even nominated. One was the bullet-in-his-throat candidate, William J. Gaynor. As mayor of New York in 1910, he had been the target of an assassination attempt by an angry former municipal employee. Gaynor\u2019s doctors decided they could not remove the bullet. He recovered and returned to work.Mr. Richman said that there was talk of Gaynor for president in 1912, and he received one vote on each of six ballots at the Democratic convention. It took more than 40 ballots, but finally the worn-out delegates nominated Woodrow Wilson, the governor of New Jersey, who won in November.Gaynor died in 1913 on a cruise to Europe. His grave is a circular granite monument with no statue. His wife, Augusta, is buried nearby, not far from the grave of the actress Laura Keene, who starred in the play Abraham Lincoln was watching when he was shot.Train\u2019s grave is in a massive mausoleum built by his father-in-law, George Turnbull Moore Davis, who had been an aide to Gen. Winfield Scott during the Mexican-American War in the 1840s and editor of The Courier of Louisville, Ky. The path to the mausoleum is overgrown, as if no one had stopped by in quite a while to pay respects to one of the most flamboyant candidates in American history.Train had founded the Union Pacific Railroad and the Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier to finance the transcontinental railroad, and he had taken the trip that caught Verne\u2019s attention, returning home in 80 days, not counting time in a French prison. In 1873, he was jailed again, this time in New York, before a trial on an insanity charge.The authorities assigned him to the New York City prison known as the Tombs, \u201cin the vain hope,\u201d according to an 1874 history, \u201cthat the rigors of the place might terrify him into a flight from the city.\u201dTrain stayed put and became an organizer, starting the Murderers\u2019 Club. Its purpose, the 1874 history said, \u201cwas to make the place so much of a hell on earth as to invite the attention of the newspapers, and thus keep Train\u2019s name before the people.\u201dOf course the Murderers\u2019 Club followed democratic principles. Of course there was an election. Of course Train was a candidate.And that was how Train finally became a president.An article on Friday about unsuccessful presidential candidates buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn misstated the number of electoral votes by which one, DeWitt Clinton, would have won the 1812 election had Pennsylvania\u2019s 25 gone to him rather than James Madison. It is 11, not 9.The tour is $25 ($20 for members of Green-Wood Cemetery or the Brooklyn Historical Society); 500 25th Street, Brooklyn; 718-210-3080, green-wood.com.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "They\u2019re Growing Older. Their Mortgage Debt Is Growing Deeper.", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported by The New Old AgeThey took out a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage. But their son developed mental health disabilities, including a bipolar disorder. To pay for his care, and help compensate for Ms. Newman\u2019s interrupted career, the Newmans refinanced four times and took out a home-equity loan.In an earlier era, the Newmans \u2014 he\u2019s 65; she\u2019s 62 \u2014 might now be contemplating retirement in a paid-for home. Instead, they\u2019ve amassed so much mortgage debt, about $375,000, that they\u2019re reluctantly considering selling. \u201cWe tried for years to catch up,\u201d Ms. Newman said.Amid the continuing fallout from the housing boom and bust, however, a growing proportion of older homeowners now carries mortgage debt. And the average amount keeps rising, according to two recent studies, which may portend lower standards of living for many retirees.More than three-quarters of Americans over 65 remain homeowners despite housing market gyrations. Those houses usually represent their greatest single asset.But often there\u2019s little equity left, even as prices have largely recovered, because so many older homeowners have borrowed against their homes.The proportion of homeowners over 55 with housing debt has climbed, the Boston College group recently reported. Dr. Sanzenbacher provided the numbers: 50 percent still had mortgages, home equity loans or lines of credit in 2013, compared with 38 percent in 1998.Moreover, the median amount they owed nearly doubled, to $82,000 from $44,000.Tapping home equity \u201cwas an attractive opportunity,\u201d Dr. Sanzenbacher said. \u201cIf you assumed housing prices would keep going up, it didn\u2019t seem very risky.\u201dAt the same time, cultural attitudes about owing money shifted, said Barbara Butrica, an economist and co-author of the Urban Institute report. \u201cIt used to be a stigma to have debt,\u201d she said. \u201cNow everyone has debt.\u201dLet\u2019s not overlook the role of banks and other lenders, either. \u201cFinancial institutions were very opportunistic,\u201d Dr. Butrica said. \u201cThey made it easy to refinance or take out a home-equity loan or line of credit.\u201dHousing prices didn\u2019t keep rising, of course. After they plummeted, would-be retirees confronted the prospect of years during which salaries would stop, but monthly mortgage payments wouldn\u2019t.Some of these households face a precarious financial future. In 1998, less than 3 percent of homeowners over 65 were \u201cunderwater,\u201d with housing debt that exceeded the value of their homes, the Urban Institute analysis found. By 2012, that proportion topped 8 percent.The institute also looked at older homeowners with loan-to-value ratios of 80 percent or more, meaning that their debts had reached 80 percent of their home values, often a point at which banks won\u2019t approve loans, charge higher interest rates or require mortgage insurance.In 1998, 8.4 percent of older homeowners had reached an 80 percent ratio. In 2012, 19.5 percent had. \u201cIf you think of 80 percent as the threshold for being at risk of default, it\u2019s pretty dramatic,\u201d Dr. Butrica said.Her study also found that health events or work-limiting conditions, like those the Newmans experienced, correlate with higher rates of home equity borrowing.Housing debt can have the greatest impact on the middle class, Dr. Sanzenbacher said. Lower-income retirees are less likely to own homes, and the wealthy rely less on home equity.But for most retirees, even if they don\u2019t tap their equity initially, a paid-for house represents security. They can live rent free (though, of course, they still pay property taxes, utilities and maintenance), or they can sell the house to finance a move to a retirement community or a nursing home.It\u2019s always a scary number: 30 percent in 1989, rising into the 40 percent range during the boom and bust. In 2013, given longer life expectancies, historically low interest rates and lower home equity, the figure reached 52 percent.What\u2019s unclear, economists say, is whether this debt crunch will turn out to be a one-time phenomenon. Is it a consequence of an imploding housing market that will not recur, or an ongoing reality that now must be factored into most Americans\u2019 retirement planning?Dr. Butrica votes for the latter. The rise in housing debt predated the recession, she pointed out. Even if that debt levels off, as recent data suggest, she doesn\u2019t see it going away.The Newmans are likely to be among them. Mr. Newman intends to stay in his job as long as possible; he likes his work and also hopes to rebuild his employee retirement savings. \u201cWe\u2019re in better shape than a lot of people,\u201d he said.That\u2019s particularly true for black and Hispanic homeowners and those with high school diplomas. They\u2019re more apt to be overextended, at the 80 percent loan-to-value mark, than whites, the college educated or upper-income households.The Newmans, living frugally and trying everything from a mortgage modification (they didn\u2019t qualify) to an interest-only arrangement (it helped, but lasted only two years) remain stuck with an 8 percent mortgage, twice the rate many local lenders offer. But they don\u2019t want to default.\u201cThe solution would be refinancing at a reasonable rate,\u201d Mr. Newman said. \u201cBut because of our history and our credit rating, we don\u2019t qualify.\u201dSelling their house would allow them to settle their obligations, but it\u2019s not clear where they and their son would live.They have the very minor consolation of knowing that their situation is no longer unusual.\u201cWe need to recognize that people are retiring with a monthly payment that previous generations didn\u2019t have,\u201d Dr. Butrica said. \u201cAnd for a lot of people, it\u2019s a pretty large payment.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018I Love N.Y.\u2019 Signs Have a Lot to Say. The Government Says They\u2019re Illegal.", "Date": "2016-11-30", "News": "Supported byThe big blue signs \u2014 hundreds of them \u2014 crop up like crab grass along the highways and byways of New York State, enticing travelers to stop and take in the sights. The bright placards were dreamed up and placed there by the state to promote tourism, each brandishing New York\u2019s cheerful and familiar credo: \u201cI Love N.Y.\u201dBut there is one problem: The federal government says the signs are illegal.So the campaign, intended to generate love and money for New York, has instead set off an escalating feud with the government threatening fines and the potential withholding of federal financing if the state does not get rid of the signs. The signs, federal officials say, are out of compliance with signage rules because they are so big and crammed with words and information that they are dangerous distractions to drivers.The federal Department of Transportation, in fact, told the state that signs were not allowed even before the first one went up, more than five years ago. But, like a recalcitrant teenager, the state went ahead anyway, and now 514 have sprouted along the shoulders of roads across New York.The situation may soon come to a head \u2014 leaders of the state and federal transportation departments plan to meet in December to discuss a solution, or perhaps hash out potential penalties if nothing is done. The state does not seem inclined to bow to Washington\u2019s demand, believing it has done nothing wrong.\u201cThis issue has been discussed for years and involve issues like the interpretation of rules,\u201d Gary Holmes, a spokesman for the state Transportation Department, said in an email, such as what direction signs can face and whether they can include certain pieces of information, like email addresses. \u201cThis isn\u2019t high crime, but minor disagreements that we look forward to meeting with the feds in order to resolve. The \u2018I Love N.Y.\u2019 tourism program is highly successful and a big economic driver.\u201dGov. Andrew M. Cuomo himself has championed the signs, promoting them in his State of the State address in 2014, three years after federal officials first raised concerns. \u201cThe goal is to get people who are on the roads off the roads and into communities and fostering and promoting the economy of the State of New York,\u201d he said in his speech.Federal officials warn that the state\u2019s continued flouting of the rules could have dire consequences.\u201cWe have been clear with the New York State Department of Transportation that its tourism-related signs are out of compliance\u201d and need to be removed, Neil Gaffney, a spokesman for the federal transportation department, said in an email. \u201cIf it becomes clear that is not going to happen, we will make a determination about the penalty. It could be a range of things, from withholding federal approval for projects to withholding highway funding.\u201d\u201cWe hope it does not come to that,\u201d Mr. Gaffney added.Of all the things for the state and federal governments to come to loggerheads over, road signs seem a strange battleground. But the issue of distracted driving has emerged as a major problem on the country\u2019s roadways. Over 35,000 people died in car crashes in 2015, about 2,500 more than the year before, according to data compiled by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Data from the first half of 2016 shows that traffic-related fatalities are on pace to eclipse the total in 2015.The signs vary and some offer more details than others. Some advertise the \u201cI Love N.Y.\u201d app. They also feature the logos of various state tourism initiatives by Empire State Development, the state economic development agency, like Path Through History, which alerts people to historical sites, and Taste NY, which indicates purveyors of local foods.State officials have argued that the signs have been important to their efforts to increase tourism, especially to areas in upstate New York that are in economic distress. Last year, tourism generated $102 billion for the state, officials said.Beyond the federal government\u2019s objections, the signs have had a mixed reception. In North Hudson, N.Y., a buffalo farmer named Dorreen Ossenkop told a local news site that the large signs, some of which denote local attractions like her Adirondack Buffalo Company, have helped her business. Yet the sign that would mention her farm is not allowed on Interstate 87, according to federal officials, citing the bible for such rules, the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices.In Montauk, on the easternmost end of Long Island, where eight of the blue signs went up in July, many locals loathed the \u201cI Love New York\u201d signs.\u201cThey were really so out of character with the small communities and two-lane highways that they actually worked against the reason why people come to the East End to begin with,\u201d said Fred W. Thiele Jr., a New York assemblyman who represents the area and who fought to have the signs removed. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent literally a billion dollars protecting small villages and scenic vistas and all of that, and putting up eight giant billboards wasn\u2019t really promoting those very scenic features.\u201dSo not long after the signs were erected, cherry pickers showed up and took down seven of them. Mr. Thiele, a member of the Independence Party, hopes the remaining blue sign, at the intersection of West Lake Drive and Flamingo Avenue, is next.\u201cQuite frankly, we kind of felt that not only were they inappropriate,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it was really kind of a boondoggle.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified a town where the signs have had a mixed reception.

{"Headline": "Trump Diversifies Cabinet; Picks Nikki Haley and Betsy DeVos", "Date": "2016-11-23", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump moved swiftly on Wednesday to diversify his cabinet and try to heal lingering rifts in the Republican Party, reaching out to Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina and Betsy DeVos, a prominent Republican fund-raiser, both of whom opposed him during the campaign, as well as Ben Carson, who challenged Mr. Trump for the Republican nomination.Ms. Haley, who was named ambassador to the United Nations, and Ms. DeVos, who was named education secretary, would be the first women in Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet. Mr. Carson, whose selection as secretary of housing and urban development is expected to be announced on Friday, would be the first African-American.But none of these choices suggest a president-elect who is reaching beyond reliably conservative precincts to fill his administration.Ms. DeVos, 58, is one of the nation\u2019s most avid supporters of school choice, a subject she and Mr. Trump discussed last week at his country club in Bedminster, N.J. But Ms. DeVos also sharply criticized him during the campaign and spent much of the year raising money for other Republicans on the ballot.On Wednesday, Mr. Trump rolled out their appointments with unstinting praise. Ms. Haley, he said in a statement, was \u201ca proven deal maker, and we look to be making plenty of deals.\u201d Ms. DeVos, he said, was a \u201cbrilliant and passionate education advocate.\u201dFor Mr. Trump, who was spending a quiet day before Thanksgiving at Mar-a-Lago, his estate in Palm Beach, Fla., the appointments ended a breathless two-week sprint since his stunning victory. In a videotaped holiday greeting to the American people on Wednesday, he acknowledged the wounds left by a \u201clong and bruising political campaign.\u201dHis aides said he would resume meeting with potential cabinet members on Friday, when they said he would announce Mr. Carson, the retired neurosurgeon with whom Mr. Trump bitterly clashed and lavishly praised during the campaign.Soon afterward, Mr. Trump is expected to name Gen. James N. Mattis as defense secretary. But the search for a secretary of state has become less clear, people involved in the transition said. Aides are divided between Rudolph W. Giuliani, who staunchly backed Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy but whose business dealings have drawn scrutiny, and Mitt Romney, viewed by many as a safe pick but who harshly criticized Mr. Trump during the campaign.Mr. Giuliani, who has lobbied publicly for the position, confided to associates that he believed the job was his and told Mr. Trump\u2019s top advisers that it was the only post he was interested in, according to the people briefed on the discussions.But Mr. Trump grew concerned both with the attention Mr. Giuliani has been drawing to himself and the reports about potential business conflicts. Some in the president-elect\u2019s circle voiced concerns about whether Mr. Giuliani would be the subject of a messy confirmation battle.Their attention turned to an unlikely alternative: Mr. Romney. Advisers who favored Mr. Giuliani believed Mr. Trump could send a unifying message by holding a perfunctory meeting with a vocal critic like Mr. Romney. But Mr. Trump liked him and was intrigued by the prospect of a camera-ready emissary of the United States around the world.A list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.Mr. Giuliani met with Mr. Trump a day later, urging him to make a decision. Mr. Romney has not signaled to Mr. Trump directly that he would accept the job if offered, a person close to the transition said.Mr. Trump has also been warned by several advisers against choosing Mr. Romney because he might pursue his own agenda.The tension has left some on the team looking for a third choice, like Gen. John F. Kelly of the Marines, the former head of the United States Southern Command, which oversees the military prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba; David H. Petraeus, the retired Army general who was director of the C.I.A.; or, a particular long shot, former Senator Jim Webb of Virginia, who could be the lone Democrat in the cabinet after having briefly run for the party\u2019s presidential nomination last year.Choosing Mr. Petraeus, who resigned in 2012 in a scandal over his leaking of classified information, would be somewhat easier after Mr. Trump said he would not pursue a case against Hillary Clinton over her handling of classified emails on a private email server, one person close to the transition said.The debate over secretary of state is a microcosm of the balance Mr. Trump is trying to strike in all of his appointments \u2014 between loyalists who will appeal to his base and more mainstream Republicans, many of whom stridently opposed his candidacy. In Ms. DeVos, Ms. Haley and Mr. Carson, he is trying to appeal to several of these constituencies, from Midwestern ultraconservatives to the diverse society that Republicans have tried to reach, with mixed results.Mr. Trump\u2019s selections could blunt criticism that his early picks came from a homogeneous bloc of older, white men. If confirmed, Ms. Haley would step down as governor and be replaced by the state\u2019s lieutenant governor, Henry McMaster, who was an early supporter of Mr. Trump.Mr. Carson is a familiar face to Americans after a Republican primary campaign in which he briefly rose to the top of the polls.Neither he nor Ms. Haley is particularly experienced for the posts they have been offered. Mr. Carson had even seemed to take himself out of the running for a cabinet position last week, with his friends putting out word that he had concluded he was not qualified to run a vast federal bureaucracy. Some pointed to Ms. Haley\u2019s experience as a legislator and trade ambassador for South Carolina as credentials for the United Nations post.John D. Negroponte, a former ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush who opposed Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy, said Ms. Haley was an \u201cintriguing and very good choice.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s not an ideologue,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019ll quickly grasp that there are aspects of the United Nations\u2019 work that can benefit the United States.\u201dMs. DeVos, a former finance chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, won the support of Senator Lamar Alexander, the Tennessee Republican who is chairman of the Senate Education Committee. He called her an \u201cexcellent choice.\u201dShe favors charter schools, which are publicly funded but typically run independently of local school boards and teachers\u2019 unions, and school vouchers, which give students tax dollars to apply toward private-school tuition.Lily Eskelsen Garcia, president of the National Education Association, the country\u2019s largest teachers\u2019 union, criticized the nomination, saying that Ms. DeVos\u2019s efforts over the years had \u201cdone more to undermine public education than support students.\u201d\u201cShe has lobbied for failed schemes, like vouchers \u2014 which take away funding and local control from our public schools \u2014 to fund private schools at taxpayers\u2019 expense,\u201d she said. \u201cThese schemes do nothing to help our most vulnerable students while they ignore or exacerbate glaring opportunity gaps.\u201dMark Landler reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.

{"Headline": "A Rare Moment of Unity on Capitol Hill, Thanks to Trump\u2019s Taxes", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byCommon Sense\u201cI think the opportunities for significant tax reform are much better than anything I\u2019ve seen in years and years,\u201d Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon told me last week. As the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, Mr. Wyden will become chairman if Democrats gain control of the Senate next week. Whatever the outcome, he will be a crucial participant in any bipartisan tax legislation.\u201cTrump\u2019s scheming on his taxes has put a spotlight on a tale of two systems,\u201d Mr. Wyden said. \u201cThe first is compulsory. You work a shift in a factory, or you\u2019re a cop on a beat, the taxes come out of your paycheck. That\u2019s just how it works.\u201d\u201cFor the most fortunate,\u201d he added, \u201cyou hire a battery of experts, and you pay what you want when you want to, or even nothing at all. I think we can all agree the tax code is a dysfunctional mess.\u201dKevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which writes tax laws, told me much the same thing. While he didn\u2019t want to comment on Mr. Trump and his taxes, he said: \u201cAmericans are sick of this broken tax code. It\u2019s so complex. Most people view it as unfair. They\u2019re ready for someone to lead on tax reform and make it fairer and simpler.\u201dDemocrats haven\u2019t issued a similarly sweeping proposal, but in some surprising ways the Republican plan isn\u2019t all that different from earlier reform plans championed by Mr. Wyden and other centrist Democrats.House Republicans would reduce the number of tax brackets to three: 33 percent on the highest incomes, 25 percent for the middle range and 12 percent on more modest incomes. The top rate today is just over 39 percent.The plan wipes out most itemized deductions, including those for state and local taxes and interest expenses, while preserving some yet-to-be-determined form of deductions for charitable contributions and home mortgages. It taxes capital gains, interest and dividends at half the rate of ordinary income. It eliminates the reviled alternative minimum tax, which falls primarily on the upper middle class.In essence, the proposal would move the United States away from a traditional income tax and more toward a consumption tax, which is intended to encourage savings and investment.Such an approach inevitably favors the rich, since they own most financial assets and do most of the investing. The centrist Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center estimates that three-quarters of the tax cuts would benefit the top 1 percent of taxpayers, and that the highest 0.1 percent would get an average tax cut of $1.3 million.Moreover, House Republicans would abolish the estate tax, which falls almost exclusively on the wealthy.So how would that square with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s call to require the rich to pay a greater share of the tax burden?For one thing, both Democrats and Republicans want to do something to fix the much criticized corporate tax code and would like to produce an immediate revenue windfall by luring back profits now held abroad by American corporations.The House Republicans\u2019 plan cuts the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from the current 35 percent. It taxes so-called pass-through income from small businesses, partnerships and limited liability companies at a flat 25 percent, as opposed to the current top ordinary income rate of 39.6 percent.It allows immediate deductions for most business expenses and investments, eliminating the need for complicated depreciation schedules, and does away with the interest deduction.What impact all this would have on the federal deficit is a matter of continuing debate, since it depends on how much these changes would spur additional economic growth.The conservative-leaning Tax Foundation estimates that, assuming no additional growth, the plan would cost $2.4 trillion over its first decade. But it also projects the plan would stimulate the economy, generating more tax revenue and cutting the cost to a relatively modest $191 billion over 10 years.The Tax Policy Center estimated a higher cost of $3.1 trillion over the first decade. Adjusting for expected growth reduces the cost only slightly, to $3 trillion, largely because of higher interest payments on the debt needed to cover the larger deficit.\u201cIn my view, the pre-eminent problem facing the United States is low economic growth, now pegged at about 2 percent,\u201d Mr. Holtz-Eakin said. \u201cTo grow more rapidly over the long term, people need to save and invest those savings. This approach supports saving and investment.\u201dLeonard E. Burman, director of the Tax Policy Center and a professor at the Syracuse University Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, agreed that the plan \u201cis clearly designed to encourage investment,\u201d especially the provision allowing businesses to immediately deduct expenses.\u201cEven Hillary Clinton has proposed that for small businesses,\u201d Mr. Burman told me. \u201cThe primary drawback, as we\u2019ve modeled it, is that it would add trillions to the national debt over 10 years.\u201dStill, \u201cthis is genuine reform,\u201d he added, which is \u201cexactly the kind of thing we should be debating in a national election and something the public should be deciding.\u201dIf Mrs. Clinton is elected president, the Republican plan, as written, would be dead on arrival because it runs squarely into one of her main campaign themes: The rich aren\u2019t paying their fair share. But some tax experts say the Republican plan could be adjusted to include higher rates for the Americans who earn the most.\u201cIn theory it would make it easier to raise the top rates,\u201d Mr. Holtz-Eakin said. \u201cThat\u2019s the fear of some conservatives.\u201dRaising some of the rates could achieve many of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s goals, including increasing taxes on the highest earners and creating an overall increase in revenue, while still embracing the underlying simplicity and pro-growth philosophy of the House Republicans\u2019 plan.A compromise plan might raise rates for taxpayers earning more than $5 million, as Mrs. Clinton has proposed; limit the exclusion on capital gains, interest and dividends; cut the corporate rate to 25 percent rather than 20 percent; and keep the estate tax for the wealthiest taxpayers.Mr. Wyden\u2019s last stab at bipartisan tax reform, the Wyden-Coats plan of 2011, which he and Senator Dan Coats, Republican of Indiana, sponsored, had many of those elements. Like the Republican House plan, it called for just three brackets and lower rates (a top rate of 35 percent, only modestly higher than the House Republicans\u2019 33 percent). It allowed taxpayers to exclude 35 percent of their capital gains, as opposed to the Republicans\u2019 50 percent. It lowered the corporate tax rate to 24 percent and eliminated the alternative minimum tax.Today\u2019s bitterly polarized political environment, of course, makes any compromise extremely difficult. Tea Party Republicans are unlikely to support any legislation that raises rates or revenue. The Democratic left is likely to balk at cuts to capital gains and corporate taxes and more breaks for business investment.But both Mr. Wyden and Mr. Brady told me they were open to deal-making, no matter how Tuesday\u2019s election turns out.\u201cPeople recognize that the tax code has been hijacked by powerful interests, and both sides see this is so wildly inefficient,\u201d Mr. Wyden said. \u201cIf I have the opportunity to chair the Senate Finance Committee, I\u2019d like to come out of the gate on Day 1 with something that would be well received as bipartisan. It would be malpractice not to do this.\u201dMr. Brady said the Republican proposals weren\u2019t etched in stone. \u201cWe\u2019re in a very aggressive listening and outreach mode, looking for feedback from families and job creators,\u201d he said.\u201cWe\u2019re going to work with the next president to fix this broken tax code,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, we know from the Reagan-era tax reform that if we\u2019re going to simplify the tax code and grow the economy, it will require bipartisan support regardless of who is in the White House.\u201dThe Common Sense column on Friday, about prospects for an overhaul of the tax code in the next administration, misstated the year that Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon and Senator Dan Coats of Indiana sponsored a bipartisan tax reform proposal. It was 2011, not 2010.Because of an editing error, the Common Sense column on Friday, about prospects for a tax code overhaul in the next administration, misidentified the political office held by Dan Coats. He is a senator from Indiana, not a representative. The error was repeated in a correction on Saturday, which also referred to Ron Wyden of Oregon as a representative, rather than a senator.Advertisement"}

The gift stipulates that $5 million will go to the museum\u2019s endowment, $1 million toward Cuban art and $4 million to Latin-American art generally.\u201cI think if one place should have a strong Cuban collection, it should be Miami,\u201d said Mr. P\u00e9rez, 67, who is of Cuban descent, although he was raised in Argentina and Colombia.In 2011, he gave $40 million in cash and art and helped finance the construction of the museum\u2019s 2013 building, by the Swiss architecture firm Herzog & de Meuron, and its transformation from its former identity, the Miami Art Museum.\u201cJorge is the consummate civic person,\u201d said Franklin Sirmans, the museum\u2019s director. \u201cHe\u2019s from somewhere else but he has chosen to be here. He loves this place and wants to see us have a cultured life that continues to grow.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the name of a museum in Miami.

{"Headline": "Cuomo, Stung by a Scandal, Offers Ethics Reforms", "Date": "2016-11-16", "News": "Supported byGov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced on Wednesday a set of ethics reforms that would affect the State Legislature, the State University of New York, the City University of New York and his own office \u2014 all of which have been soiled within the last year by corruption scandals and allegations of slipshod management.The developers accused in the corruption scheme doubled as generous donors to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s 2014 re-election campaign, holding fund-raisers for him even as they were bidding for economic development projects. Mr. Cuomo said he would order his 2018 re-election campaign and the state Democratic Party to refuse contributions from companies vying for state-funded projects \u2014 a ban that would apply to winning bidders for six months after contracts had been awarded.\u201cI believe this public trust and integrity issue must be addressed \u2014 directly and forthrightly,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said in the statement, framing his call for reform as a response to a public clearly disgusted with government as usual. \u201cIt is time for action, not words.\u201dHe made no direct mention of the scandal, which centered on Mr. Cuomo\u2019s former top aide and close friend, Joseph Percoco. The governor\u2019s announcement \u2014 which, unusually for Mr. Cuomo, arrived in the form of a long, conversational first-person statement instead of a formal news release \u2014 offered only an oblique acknowledgment of the stain on his inner circle.\u201cPeople will commit venal and greedy acts,\u201d he said. \u201cI have seen it myself, and I have been shocked and hurt by it.\u201dMost of the ideas were resurrected from previous attempts at ethics reform. Mr. Cuomo called for a cap on outside income this year, but made little progress with the Republican-controlled State Senate.But Mr. Cuomo\u2019s reluctance to sign off on a raise for the Legislature at a meeting on Tuesday of a commission charged with studying the salary issue may complicate any effort to pass meaningful ethics reform in the upcoming 2017 session.Neither Carl Heastie, the Bronx Democrat who serves as Assembly speaker, nor John J. Flanagan, the Senate\u2019s Republican majority leader, have seemed especially enthusiastic about the governor\u2019s proposals.Michael Whyland, Mr. Heastie\u2019s spokesman, noted on Wednesday that the Assembly had already passed several ethics reforms. \u201cWe will work with anyone who is serious about restoring New Yorkers\u2019 faith in their government,\u201d he said.As they absorbed Mr. Cuomo\u2019s latest stab at ethics reform, good government groups sounded weary of promises that have been offered year after year, only to stagnate by session\u2019s end.\u201cEven his own administration has not been without corruption allegations and lived up to the principles he espouses so well,\u201d said Dick Dadey, executive director of one such group, Citizens Union. \u201cHe needs to focus seriously on preventing corruption. He needs to be willing to take stronger actions to enact laws that accomplish that goal.\u201dBlair Horner, executive director of the New York Public Interest Research Group, said the governor\u2019s idea for a procurement officer appeared likely to duplicate the role of the state comptroller, who already reviews all state contracts, but whose power to examine the kinds of development contracts at the heart of the bribery scandal was diminished by the Legislature in 2011.The governor\u2019s office already has a prototype for a procurement officer position in Bart Schwartz, a former prosecutor who was hired to lead an internal investigation into contracting practices and lobbying as the scandal grew. But the parameters of the job were not yet clear: Aides to the governor were still exploring whether the new procurement officer would have the authority to review money distributed by public authorities that operate outside of the state\u2019s Division of the Budget.A spokeswoman for Thomas DiNapoli, the state comptroller, was also unclear about how redundant the position might be.\u201cWe are reviewing the governor\u2019s proposals and look forward to seeing more specifics when they are available,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Jennifer Freeman.Advertisement"}

Putin, was one of several foreign politicians and specialists who were brought to Ukraine after the 2014 pro-Western revolution to start a broad modernization of the country.Taming corruption was widely seen as crucial for proving the legitimacy of Ukraine\u2019s pro-Western leadership, especially in contrast with Mr. Putin\u2019s Russia.In October, Mr. Saakashvili\u2019s political party in Georgia suffered a painful defeat in parliamentary elections, ending the prospect of his return to that country, where he faces multiple charges that he says are politically motivated.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misidentified the country whose president Mikheil Saakashvili accused of supporting corruption.

{"Headline": "Taking Out a Highway That Hemmed Rochester In", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported bySquare FeetROCHESTER \u2014 Almost 60 years ago, this upstate city finished digging a deep trench for a highway bypass, a lauded effort to help speed residents out of the central city and into its suburbs.Today, Rochester is effectively burying that 20th-century devotion to vehicle efficiency and committing the old highway\u2019s right of way to the city\u2019s recovery.Rochester is completing a $23.6 million project that fills in almost a third of the 2.7-mile sunken highway and replaces it with an at-grade boulevard and nearly six acres of prime land for development.\u201cWe had a moat that separated the East Side neighborhood from downtown,\u201d said Lovely A. Warren, Rochester\u2019s mayor, referring to the East Inner Loop. \u201cFilling in the Inner Loop gives people the ability to more easily get around. It gives us more space to develop. Before this, businesses had to stop development. They had nowhere to go because of that highway.\u201dConstruction on the project \u2014 paid for by federal, state and city money \u2014 began two years ago, and now the East Inner Loop is gone. The space is a 3,500-foot long slash of construction to prepare parcels for development and to turn Union Street into a two-way boulevard. Completion is scheduled for 2017.The highway removal has already produced results for Rochester\u2019s real estate market. This month, Home Leasing, a local developer, is scheduled to complete about 70 market-rate apartments on a long-vacant four-acre lot on the west side of the old loop, near the Eastman School of Music of the University of Rochester. The one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments will rent for $1,450 to $2,780 a month and are the first phase of the company\u2019s Charlotte Square project. The $35 million development includes 10 townhouses, for sale at roughly $385,000 each, and 49 mixed-income affordable apartments.\u201cWe\u2019re tickled to have these uses integrated within this project,\u201d said Nelson Leenhouts, chief executive of Home Leasing. \u201cWe know we are creating a big impact for a diverse group of people with high incomes and people with more modest incomes. That\u2019s good for the city.\u201dIn September, Ms. Warren recommended that the City Council sell two Inner Loop parcels, amounting to three acres, to the Strong National Museum of Play, Indus Hospitality Group and Konar Properties. The developers have proposed a $105 million project that encompasses a 100,000-square-foot addition to the museum, a 17,000-square-foot retail building, a 120-room hotel, a 1,200-car garage and about 200 housing units.The local companies Christa Development and Morgan Development were chosen to build a $27 million mixed-use development next door with 117 residences, 20,000 square feet of retail and office space, and underground parking. Christa also plans to move its headquarters to downtown Rochester from suburban Victor.To some extent, the history of Rochester is the story of a city accustomed to pivoting on changes to its transport infrastructure. Anticipating lucrative commerce along the Erie Canal, the city was founded in 1817, the same year canal construction started. Parts of the original canal route were filled in for Interstate 490, which traverses Rochester. A subway and trolley line that opened in 1927 was filled in 1956 to build the Interstate.The Inner Loop opened in 1965, and by the time the East Side stretch closed in 2014, it was used by just 6,000 vehicles a day, partly because of a decline in Rochester\u2019s population and the number of downtown jobs. Traffic counts on reconstructed Union Street are almost certain to be higher as businesses open on the East Side, and developments are completed on the old highway corridor and downtown.A few blocks from the Inner Loop, Rochester\u2019s midtown is quickly evolving to a mixed-use housing, office and education district from a retail and office center. The construction is primarily a result of Rochester\u2019s decision to remove another piece of urban infrastructure, the underperforming Midtown Plaza, the country\u2019s first urban indoor shopping mall. The mall was hailed as a retail marvel when it opened in 1962, but it began to weaken in the 1980s as suburban malls were built, and the city\u2019s population fell to less than 240,000, from its 1950 peak of 332,000.Roughly 33,000 more people left in the 1990s and early 2000s as local employment by the city\u2019s three biggest companies \u2014 Eastman Kodak, Xerox Corporation and Bausch & Lomb \u2014 fell to just fewer than 9,000 jobs today from a peak of about 80,000.Since Midtown Plaza closed in 2008, Rochester\u2019s population has increased to about 210,000 from 207,000. Almost all of the gain has been because of the 46 commercial buildings here that have been converted to lofts and apartments since 2000, according to figures from the Rochester Downtown Development Corporation. About 6,500 people live downtown, and 18 new residential projects have been approved that will house 2,650 more people by 2019.New York State has helped the city\u2019s recovery. The Upstate Revitalization Initiative, announced last year by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, directed $500 million to the Finger Lakes region, which includes Rochester. In September, the governor participated in the opening of the $18 million AMPrint Center, a 3-D printing technology research center at the Rochester Institute of Technology, which was paid for with help from a $9.2 million state grant. Also that month, Mr. Cuomo announced that the state is helping finance the modernization of Rochester International Airport.Ms. Warren said that business interest in the East Inner Loop parcels, and in center city housing and retail projects, has been so keen that she has pushed the City Council and residents to start the next big downtown development project: filling in the mile-long section of the Inner Loop through the north side, where much of Rochester\u2019s concentrated poverty lies.\u201cConnecting the northern part of the city with downtown creates opportunity,\u201d said Ms. Warren, who is in her first term. \u201cEvery city is competing for the ability to take care of itself. If you play it safe you get left behind.\u201dAlong with the new parcels that replaced the East Inner Loop, the old mall\u2019s eight-acre site and the large commercial buildings that surround it are where much of the development is occurring. In February, Morgan Management and Buckingham Properties opened Tower280, formerly an office building that was part of Midtown Plaza. The $60 million project has 181 apartments with monthly rents of $1,450 to $4,099. Almost 90 percent of the apartments are leased, said Allie Sebastian, the property manager for Tower280. The project includes 50,000 square feet of ground-floor retail space and 80,000 square feet of office space.Around the corner, Gallina Development paid $5.4 million last year for the 26-story Chase Tower and is spending $30 million to convert the 43-year-old former office building into the Metropolitan, a mixed-use project. The upper half of the building will be rental apartments and condominiums; the lower half will be offices. And the lobby will have retail and restaurant space.The third big midtown project is WinnDevelopment\u2019s renovation of the 1.1-million-square-foot Sibley Building into homes, offices and retail uses. The 111-year-old building, distinguished by its East Main Street address and clock tower, for generations housed the principal department store in Rochester\u2019s central shopping and entertainment district. The $200 million project is supported by local, state and federal loans, tax abatements, and tax credits for historic buildings.The 70,000 square feet on the ground floor of newly named Sibley Square are reserved for restaurants, medical clinics, day care centers for adults and children, and retail. The next five floors are being renovated for offices and the University of Rochester\u2019s technology business incubator, and the upper six floors are reserved for housing.\u201cThe Sibley is the most important, most famous and most beloved building in Rochester,\u201d said Gilbert J. Winn, chief executive of the developer, which is based in Boston. \u201cIt\u2019s the best of old Rochester and the best of the new.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Big Oil Slowly Adapts to a Warming World", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byIn a warming world, Big Oil doesn\u2019t look quite so big anymore.A global glut of oil and natural gas has sent prices tumbling over the last two years, and profits are evaporating. Improving auto fuel efficiency standards threaten to depress oil consumption eventually, and fleets of electric vehicles are gradually emerging in China and a few other important markets.The oil industry has experienced global crises, booms and busts for over a century, and few energy experts think it faces an existential threat in the immediate future. The world will still need oil and gas for decades, and normal declines in existing fields oblige further drilling. But change is almost certainly coming.\u201cAny energy company in the world that makes its strategy without considering climate change policies is making a major mistake,\u201d Mr. Birol said in an interview, \u201cnot only a major mistake for the climate but also for their own profits and for their own shareholders, because climate change policies represent a fundamental challenge to business as usual.\u201dThe International Energy Agency\u2019s projections of future global oil demand include one possibility in which demand could drop more than 20 percent from today\u2019s levels, to 74 million barrels a day by 2040, if measures are put in place to keep global warming at levels proposed at the Paris conference. As coal burning declines precipitously and renewable energy grows steadily, natural gas demand will rise only modestly by 2040 even as the global population grows, if the world truly wants to come to grips with climate change.At the same time, Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell and many other companies are investing heavily in natural gas as a lower-carbon answer to growing global energy needs. They view gas as a clean fuel of the future.\u201cWe continue to believe fossil fuels will have a significant and important role to play for as far as we can see,\u201d Exxon Mobil\u2019s chief executive, Rex W. Tillerson, said at the company\u2019s annual shareholders meeting in May.Which way the world will turn is still in doubt. Most oil executives and independent experts agree that the ambitious Paris target will be challenging to reach, and that reduced burning of fossil fuels will require big technological and policy shifts.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.Governments will probably need to be more proactive in deploying nuclear power, which is virtually carbon-free, many experts say.Coal-fired power plants will need to be equipped with costly carbon capture and sequestration systems. Higher prices for carbon-based fuels are needed in countries like the United States to depress demand and encourage investments in nuclear power and carbon capture and sequestration.Advanced biofuels must be developed to produce renewable fuels without competing with food supplies. Better and cheaper batteries are needed to make electric cars affordable, while recharging stations need to be deployed far more widely.All of those strategies are costly, politically charged or technically challenging. Big scientific breakthroughs will be needed.Oil companies have tried to offer solutions to remain relevant. Exxon Mobil, for instance, has financed research into carbon capture and sequestration and lobbied for a carbon tax. Shell has been a big investor in Brazilian biofuels, while Chevron has long been one of the biggest investors in geothermal energy. The French oil company Total is making a major effort in solar power.Some of the world\u2019s largest oil companies, including Royal Dutch Shell, BP and Saudi Aramco, pledged last week to jointly invest $1 billion over the next decade to develop systems to capture and store emissions of greenhouse gases and improve energy efficiency.Several oil and gas companies have already moved quickly to reduce emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, from their exploration and transmission operations. Some farsighted executives have even suggested that their natural gas production could eventually be a major source of hydrogen for fuel cells because methane is hydrogen-rich.But it\u2019s just a start. With their scientific and engineering prowess and capital muscle, many oil companies have the capacity to retrofit their business plans if and when they are forced to.Jeremy Bentham, Royal Dutch Shell\u2019s vice president for global business environment, said Shell and other oil companies could adapt and prosper to meet the world\u2019s energy needs, which should continue to grow.\u201cOur portfolio mix would adjust over time,\u201d he said, \u201csuch that the level of the demand for oil would be met and the level of demand for overall energy would be met.\u201dMr. Bentham acknowledged that the world must leave some fossil fuels in the ground, but that the global community and not just oil companies must take action to reduce demand for carbon-based fuels.\u201cTo have a demand at a much lower level you need a significant restructuring of mobility systems with more compact cities and with more public transport that can be electrified,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles that can take a longer range \u2014 a whole restructuring that isn\u2019t driven by energy production.\u201dThe restructuring of a new energy system is years if not decades away, and signs that important change is coming have been uneven.The electric car market is growing slowly in the United States and most of Europe because of high costs and range limitations, although it is advancing faster in China. Toyota, Hyundai and Honda already offer hydrogen fuel-cell cars in select markets, and other companies are testing models that would emit nothing but water from the tailpipe, but major market penetration could be decades away.Automobiles are becoming far more efficient, although cheap gasoline is causing a surge in consumer demand in the United States for pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles.In this new world, European companies have been relatively more responsive to change. Many have embraced shareholder proposals to acknowledge the need to limit the rise in global temperatures and to test operations to see how they would perform in a carbon-constrained world. Such proposals have mostly been rejected by the American majors.Independent energy experts are either skeptical of or only cautiously optimistic about the will of the oil companies to change.\u201cOil companies are moving slowly but surely,\u201d Mr. Birol of the International Energy Agency said. \u201cSome are moving faster, and some are moving much, much slower, if at all.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And because he knows that I know.\u201dWith dark hair, an easy smile and the trim physique of a man who exercises 90 minutes a day, Mr. Dahlan exuded vigor and charm in a recent interview here.

I\u2019m ready to be a soldier. I\u2019m ready to be anything. But with vision and plans and real leadership.\u201dStill, that does not mean Mr. Kidwa or a similar figure would accept such a deal. In a separate interview, Mr. Kidwa, who has served in a variety of diplomatic positions, including foreign minister, dismissed Mr. Dahlan. \u201cI think the possibility of him returning is not that high, at least in the current stage,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen bridges are burned, it\u2019s probably hard to be rebuilt.\u201d\u201cAbbas has such an iron grip that none of his rivals really stands a chance against him right now,\u201d said Grant Rumley, a fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, based in Washington, and co-author of a forthcoming biography of Mr. Abbas. \u201cHere he is in the twilight years of his reign, and he is easily one of the most cunning politicians in the region in terms of cutting the knees out from his opponents.\u201dMr. Abbas has in recent weeks expelled rivals from his Fatah party and arrested others. On Tuesday, he announced a party conference later this month in a move interpreted as an effort to push out Dahlan allies.The tension has turned violent at times. Last month, unknown gunmen shot up the family house of Fadi Elsalameen, a critic, with 60 bullets. Mr. Elsalameen, who maintains a Facebook page highly critical of Mr. Abbas, said he worked with Mr. Dahlan on an international initiative but did not belong to his coterie. \u201cI\u2019m not part of Dahlan\u2019s work in Palestine at all,\u201d he said. But Mr. Abbas \u201cis calling all opposition \u2018Dahlan.\u2019 \u201dThat does not mean Mr. Dahlan can rally Palestinians. Yousef Munayyer, executive director of the U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights, said Mr. Dahlan had little street credibility. \u201cThis guy is a shady character who foreign governments have looked to to do dirty work quietly, and he has often been willing,\u201d he said.Mr. Dahlan was born in a Gaza refugee camp and joined the violent fight against Israel as a teenager. Arrested 11 times, he learned Hebrew during five years in Israeli prison and later became Palestinian security chief in Gaza.But Martin S. Indyk, the vice president of the Brookings Institution and a diplomat who worked for Mr. Clinton, said Mr. Dahlan played the Americans off Mr. Abbas to marginalize him. \u201cHe\u2019s charismatic, smart, manipulative and a clear threat to the old Fatah guard in Ramallah,\u201d he said.Israeli officials refuse to discuss Mr. Dahlan, knowing any positive comments would discredit him among Palestinians. But Amos Yadlin, the director of the Institute for National Security Studies and a former Israeli military intelligence chief, said the government was watching Mr. Dahlan\u2019s maneuvering.\u201cAs we look into the time after Abu Mazen, he seems like an interesting option,\u201d Mr. Yadlin said, \u201cnot so much because of himself but because of the very good connections he has in the Arab world.\u201dMr. Dahlan said he had never even met Mr. Lieberman and rejected accusations of corruption, though he did not deny using brutal tactics in Gaza.\u201cI wasn\u2019t head of the Red Cross,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one was killed, no one lost his life. But of course there were mistakes.\u201dHe also admitted to making money. \u201cTwo things that I\u2019m not denying,\u201d he said. \u201cThat I\u2019m rich, I will not deny it. Ever. And that I\u2019m strong, I will not deny.\u201d He added, \u201cBut I work hard to increase my level of life.\u201dHe has used some of his money, and funds from his Arab patrons, to finance charitable activities in Gaza and the West Bank. Some Gazans have used the hashtag #Dahlan in Twitter messages seeking help for sick relatives.Married and a father of four, Mr. Dahlan describes himself as a workaholic who never vacations; he showed me the backyard garden, where he says he never spends time except to show it off to guests.\u201cI love achievement,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s my addiction.\u201dAdvertisement"}

This is because your feelings often dictate your short-term decision making.Lerner\u2019s conclusions suggest key insights into how emotions affect our financial decisions. Her anecdotal accounts of the experiments reveal something else, too. It\u2019s perhaps not only the emotion itself that leads toward poor decision making, but our inability to recognize how those emotions affect us.Lerner\u2019s conclusions suggest key insights into how emotions affect our financial decisions. Her anecdotal accounts of the experiments reveal something else, too. It\u2019s perhaps not only the emotion itself that leads toward poor decision making, but our inability to recognize how those emotions affect us.\u201cWe\u2019ll ask participants afterward, \u2018Is it possible that your feelings from that movie influenced how much you paid for this coffee mug?\u2019\u201d Lerner says. \u201cThey say, \u2018No. Don\u2019t be silly. That would be irrational.\u2019 They absolutely, firmly deny \u2014 and are even offended \u2014 that we ask about any kind of carryover (of their emotions from the video). In general, people have very little awareness of how emotions affect their decisions.\u201dWhen it comes to long-term investing, where emotions are proven to have a very real impact on our financial health, that can be a disquieting thought. To address these conflicting forces of emotion \u2014 the way we think we feel versus what we actually feel below the surface \u2014 OppenheimerFunds embarked on an unprecedented study, the Optimist Index, to use biometrics not only to identify this disparity but to demonstrate how remaining optimistic (and being aware of it) is often a safer path to financial stability in the long run.So what\u2019s your level of optimism? And more importantly, does it match your level of emotion? The behavioral experience below analyzes your emotions based on the science of colors, shapes and sound. To answer the questions, adjust the image so that it matches most closely with how optimistic you feel. Don\u2019t think about it too much; there is no wrong way to answer. Your answers will produce an individualized output of animation and music, reflecting your level of optimism and how you might approach long-term investing.In your lifetime, how do you think your health will be impacted by the cost of care?In recent years, the topic of decision making has been one of great interest for those working in and crossing over among a variety of fields of academic study: economics, neuroscience, psychology, biology and now biometrics. Known as behavioral economics or neuroeconomics, scientists are gaining greater and more profound insights into how emotions function in determining our courses of action and, more specifically, what we do with our money. While individual conclusions may differ, most agree on a simple premise: There\u2019s no escaping our emotions \u2014 sooner or later they will affect how our brains and bodies make decisions.\u201cYou can\u2019t make a decision without first experiencing some kind of emotional impulse in your brain,\u201d says Dr. Lisa Kramer, who specializes in behavioral finance at the University of California San Diego, Rady School of Management, and at the University of Toronto, Rotman School of Management. \u201cWe need to step back from the idea that we can even make decisions in the absence of emotion. I think it\u2019s more important to try to understand the way in which emotions do influence decisions, and then try to put in safeguards to prevent our emotions from causing us to make a catastrophic mistake in our portfolios.\u201d\u201cI saw that I was down a couple hundred dollars and automatically started having bad feelings about my financial advisor \u2014 should I stop listening to him?\u201d Brafman says. He had to remind himself that this was a long-term investment, not a one-off bet. \u201cI had to say to myself, \u2018Rom, you have to understand that over the long haul it\u2019s probably a good investment. You shouldn\u2019t be judging this on a day-by-day basis.\u2019\u201dIndeed, humans have evolved to think and see patterns more in the short term than the long term. We feel losses much more profoundly than we feel gains. In fact, the emotional impacts of a loss are felt, on average, two and half times more profoundly than the same quantity of gains, says Brafman.That\u2019s why maintaining an optimistic outlook could be the difference between making a rash financial decision (that may be costly in the long run) and remaining confident in your original plan, which could likely deliver the gains you expected in the first place.\u201cInstead of recognizing an overall pattern, and knowing that you need to stay the course on certain investments, people who are too emotionally reactive will instead constantly react to subtle changes in the market,\u201d says Lerner. \u201cThe reason is that the emotion system is doing exactly what it has evolved to do \u2014 interrupt us and call our attention to potential threats and opportunities. If you don\u2019t have the kind of expertise that says, \u2018OK, I'm alerted \u2014 a market fluctuation happened today, but we don't necessarily need to abandon our long-term investment,\u2019 then you can get into trouble.\u201dThroughout the course of long-term investments, conditions, outlooks and even our very emotions are bound to change. Fostering an optimistic outlook is one way to stay steady during trying times. As Dr. Kramer puts it, being aware of our emotions and avoiding the urge to make decisions during emotionally charged moments can contribute toward a more balanced approach to financial health.\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a set of risk preferences that vary less over time,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019ll be more consistent in the kind of decisions that you\u2019re making for your portfolio.\u201dThrough the Optimist Index research, OppenheimerFunds used biometric technology \u2014 sensor-based measurements of subtle physical activity such as facial expression, pulse and skin moisture that change with emotional state \u2014 to assess the disparity between how we say we feel and the physical cues our bodies exhibit when experiencing different emotions. The study looked at how investors of all demographics reacted to three key investment themes relevant to long-term investing, Aging, Emerging Markets and Innovation, and asked investors how they thought these themes will impact the long-term global economy.The study found that not only do risk appetites vary between demographics, but also there\u2019s a difference between how optimistic participants said they were versus how they measured using biometric technology.As people age, their risk appetites can shift, especially in a world that\u2019s changing so rapidly in population, technology and other factors.\u201cThe fact is that as people get older, they\u2019re approaching \u2014 and eventually passing \u2014 their retirement age. They worry about having enough money to be able to continue to pay the bills,\u201d says Dr. Kramer. \u201cThe stakes become even higher, as do the emotional reactions to blips in the market. The market crashes; my nest egg is now half the size it was. The reaction becomes that much more drastic.\u201dInterestingly, this bias was represented most profoundly in those approaching retirement, who measured having higher levels of optimism than self-reported, perhaps due to uncertainty regarding the political climate, according to the OppenheimerFunds study.Across a number of factors concerning aging, respondents were surprisingly more optimistic about retirement than expected given the projected higher costs associated with health care. When asked about the cost of health care and its impact on the global economy, those approaching retirement age at 55 measured far higher levels of optimism than reported, perhaps indicating that retiree fears are exaggerated. This was further corroborated by a subsequent spike in optimism at 65, an age when many have already entered retirement. Put another way, most pre-retirees have faith that their investments will serve them well into retirement despite current concerns about rising costs and an aging population.For instance, health care spending by those aged 60 and older is projected to grow by $1.4 trillion by 2030.\u00b9George Evans, CIO, Equities and portfolio manager of Oppenheimer International Growth Fund understands these concerns. He also sees opportunity. His investment strategy is to \u201cignore the short term noise, because when you invest for the long term you see it through.\u201dDespite representing lucrative and reliable investment opportunities, people often let their bias get in the way of making more rational decisions about diversifying their portfolios with foreign investments.\u201cOur gut instinct drives us to be very nervous about investing abroad,\u201d says Dr. Kramer. \u201cPeople tend to invest in what they know, and most people actually have way too much invested in their home country. We need to try to overcome that sense of comfort that\u2019s driven by our emotions, to seek exposure to the risks and the opportunities that are outside of our comfort zones. That includes emerging markets. Lacking that exposure in the portfolio can be very harmful in the long run.\u201dThis bias was most palpably seen in an older demographic of investors, compared to millennials who, despite having an optimistic outlook about emerging markets to begin with, were measured as having an even more positive outlook on emerging markets with biometrics, the OppenheimerFunds study found.When asked about the impact emerging markets will have on the world economy and their long-term investment potential, millennials were shown to be particularly optimistic. Perhaps due to cultivating a more global perspective as the first generation native to the Internet, millennials measured much more optimism than reported compared to non-millennials. Non-millennials, however, may still harbor feelings of skepticism toward globalized commerce despite being aware of its apparent economic benefits. This may suggest that deep-seeded anxieties over the unknown can be mitigated through facts \u2014 such as the growth of global markets \u2014 but never entirely leave us.For instance, over the last 50-plus years, global gross domestic product, or GDP, has exploded from $1.3 trillion to $70 trillion, with the United States making up a smaller share of the world\u2019s economic activity.\u00b2That\u2019s just one indication that it\u2019s time to take a global perspective, says Heidi Heikenfeld, portfolio manager of Oppenheimer Emerging Markets Innovators Fund. \u201cYou have to learn from the companies themselves,\u201d she says. \u201cYou need to be immersed in the culture ... to put it in the context of their local market.\u201dImprovements in technology can be a double-edged sword for long-term investors. On the one hand, they now have up-to-the-minute information on how markets and investments are performing. On the other hand, too much information can lead to panicked and premature decision making.\u201cNow, we\u2019ve got information coming from an uncountable number of sources. It\u2019s just beyond our brain\u2019s wiring to process this information. That\u2019s a real downside of technology,\u201d says Dr. Kramer. \u201cBut technology also offers some remedies. Now we\u2019ve got technology that allows us to delegate decision making at a low cost.\u201dFor those with greater assets, the additional savings afforded by technology innovations may do less to counterbalance the potential rewards, the OppenheimerFunds study found.That\u2019s just one indication that it\u2019s time to take a global perspective, says Heidi Heikenfeld, portfolio manager of Oppenheimer Emerging Markets Innovators Fund. \u201cYou have to learn from the companies themselves,\u201d she says. \u201cYou need to be immersed in the culture ... to put it in the context of their local market.\u201dTechnological innovation goes beyond the chips and software that drive the multi-trillion dollar Internet economy. It\u2019s also the force that powers ocean drilling, with rigs reaching depths of 10,000 feet today, a 10-fold increase over 1975.\u00b3That\u2019s the kind of progress that interests Michelle Borr\u00e9, portfolio manager of Oppenheimer Fundamental Alternatives Fund: \u201cThe things that we\u2019re investing around have not happened yet. Investors have never seen a period like this before, and that\u2019s what excites me.\u201dOppenheimerFunds is not affiliated with The New York Times.The news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}

But they have been on the up since election results came in, so does that mean we are in for more of the same this week and in the long term?And then there are the campaign promises that could promote growth and corporate profits. (Some of them could do the opposite, too.)Even if we knew how all of them were going to be enforced, it would be hard to know exactly what the result would be.And markets have historically been bad at pricing in hard-to-predict seismic events. So what do we do?While this plays out, here are some of the battlegrounds that lie ahead.Mr. Trump has said he was determined to get multinational companies to pay their American tax bills every year. The sting would not be as great if he also cut corporate rates and allowed credits for foreign taxes paid.House Republicans have been pushing for a territorial system, in which businesses are taxed solely on goods and services sold in the United States. But that encourages businesses to shop around for lower tax rates, ultimately shifting profits and jobs overseas \u2014 not ideal for a president who wants more jobs in the United States.Mr. Trump is expected to insist on a deduction for interest paid on debt-financed projects, a provision dear to real estate developers. But otherwise, he may keep his ideas broad, leaving Congress to pin down the details.Mr. Trump has embraced criticism that the Federal Reserve is creating more problems than it is solving, and his advisers would like to rein in the institution. Mr. Trump could overhaul its leadership, filling a majority of the Fed\u2019s seven-seat board with his nominees over the next 18 months, even replacing Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman, in February 2018.\u201cTrump made Carrier the poster child and said he would hold Carrier accountable. Well, we\u2019re going to hold him to it.\u201dIt said it would buy Harman International Industries, an American automotive technology company, in a deal that would combine its display and semiconductor operations with a business that already builds sound and smart components for digitally connected cars. The company wants to be part of the supply chain for technology that it says will transform cars in the way that smartphone have transformed mobile devices.The deal comes after a wave of consolidation in the chip industry. Semiconductor companies have been vying to make chips for cars as companies seek to improve autonomous driving technology, which requires more sophisticated semiconductors. Qualcomm recently bought NXP Semiconductors, which produces chips for cars, for $38.5 billion.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Consumer Protection Bureau Chief Braces for a Reckoning", "Date": "2016-11-24", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Mild-mannered, lawyerly and with a genius for trivia, Richard Cordray is not the sort of guy you picture at the center of Washington\u2019s bitter partisan wars over regulation and consumer safeguards.And with a Republican sweep of Congress and the White House, they may get some or all of what they wish.Mr. Cordray, a reluctant Washingtonian who has commuted here for six years from Grove City, Ohio, where his wife and twin children live, is the first director of the consumer watchdog agency, which was created in 2010 after Wall Street\u2019s meltdown. By aggressively deploying his small army of workers \u2014 he has 1,600 of them \u2014 Mr. Cordray has turned the fledgling agency into one of Washington\u2019s most powerful and pugnacious regulators.And, according to Mr. Cordray, he and his team have barely scratched the surface of combating consumer abuse.\u201cWe overcame momentous challenges \u2014 just building an agency from scratch, let alone one that deals with such a large sector of the economy,\u201d Mr. Cordray said in an interview at his agency\u2019s office here. \u201cI\u2019m satisfied with the progress we have made, but I\u2019m not satisfied in the sense that there\u2019s a lot more progress to be made. There\u2019s still a lot to be done.\u201dMr. Cordray, who also battled on behalf of consumers in his previous jobs as Ohio\u2019s attorney general and, before that, its treasurer, is praised in some circles as enormously effective, wielding the bureau\u2019s power to restructure some industries and terrify others.The bureau has \u201chelped save countless people across the country from abusive financial practices,\u201d said Hilary O. Shelton, the N.A.A.C.P.\u2019s senior vice president for advocacy and policy.\u201cI\u2019ve been practicing law in this area for well over 40 years, and there\u2019s nothing that compares to it,\u201d Mr. Kaplinsky said. \u201cEvery company in the consumer financial services market has felt the effects.\u201dMr. Cordray said that as attorney general of Ohio, he had a front-row seat to the suffering that people endured during the last financial collapse. He was elected to the office in 2008 \u2014 the peak of the mortgage crisis.\u201cI had seen the foreclosure crisis up close,\u201d Mr. Cordray said. \u201cI had seen all the struggles people had with student loans. These were all things we wanted to prioritize.\u201dMr. Cordray said workers at the bureau were often drawn there because they felt the pain of the consumers they tried to help.\u201cMany people here, if you ask them why they came, they\u2019ll give you one or more personal stories\u201d of hardship at the hands of rapacious companies, he said, adding that workers at the bureau had learned how to speak publicly and effectively about \u201chow these issues affect people\u2019s lives. I think we\u2019ve gotten more and more systematic about doing that,\u201d he said, especially with consumers\u2019 stories submitted to the agency\u2019s complaint portal.Ralph Liberatoscioli of Mineola, N.Y., turned to the agency this year during a wrangle with Citibank over rewards points he said his wife was owed on her checking account. After several months of fruitlessly working through layers of customer service representatives, he gave up on talks with the bank and filed a consumer bureau complaint on his wife\u2019s behalf.Within a week, Citibank sent an apology letter and credited her account with the disputed points.\u201cThey have clout, and the banks recognize that,\u201d Mr. Liberatoscioli said.Because the appeals court\u2019s ruling is delayed until the challenge process plays out, Mr. Cordray still cannot be quickly removed from office by the president.Nor would it be easy or quick for the Trump administration to dismantle or weaken the bureau \u2014 and, after all the attention Wells Fargo stirred up, it might be politically unpopular.But Donald J. Trump\u2019s election revived calls from critics of the bureau to eliminate Mr. Cordray\u2019s position and replace the agency\u2019s leadership with a five-member, bipartisan commission. The critics say the move would temper the bureau\u2019s more radical impulses; supporters say it would hamstring the agency and prevent it from doing virtually anything.For now, the main obstacle for Republicans who want to gut the bureau, or steer it in a very different direction, is Mr. Cordray, whose term runs through July 2018.He took office in the shadow of Ms. Warren, but his fans and critics say \u2014 or complain \u2014 that he has proved to be every bit as fierce in carving out the agency\u2019s turf and using its regulatory and enforcement powers.\u201cThey don\u2019t fine-tune,\u201d said Craig Nazzaro, a lawyer in Atlanta who specializes in consumer-finance law and represents debt collectors. \u201cThey take a sledgehammer to the existing rules and redefine industry standards.\u201dThe housing crisis dominated the bureau\u2019s early days. When Congress created the new overseer, it also dictated its first priority: making mortgages safer. The deadline was tight. If the bureau did not introduce new rules within 18 months, a congressionally mandated set of lending guidelines would automatically take effect.The bureau made it with one day to spare.\u201cIt seems like the financial services industry has figured out how to adapt to this new regulatory regime,\u201d said David Reiss, a professor at Brooklyn Law School who studied the effects of the bureau\u2019s rule-making. \u201cWe\u2019ve moved from the fox-in-the-henhouse market in the early 2000s, where you could get away with nearly anything, to this new model, where someone is looking over your shoulder.\u201dSo the bureau has relied heavily in the last few years on one of its other powers: enforcement. By suing and fining companies when they stray out of bounds, the agency has been able to reshape the playing field years before any new regulations are completed.\u201cTheir method is to regulate through enforcement,\u201d Mr. Kaplinsky said, echoing a common criticism of the bureau\u2019s approach. \u201cThey\u2019ve entered into more than 150 separate consent orders touching literally every kind of consumer finance product, and Director Cordray has indicated to the industry that you\u2019d better read the consent orders and follow them \u2014 even if you\u2019re not a party.\u201dAsk Mr. Cordray about that charge, and he grins a little.\u201cWhat that really boils down to is a criticism that we\u2019re enforcing the law too vigorously,\u201d he said.Whether the consumer bureau is enforcing the law or using stealth maneuvers to expand it is a source of fierce debate, and Mr. Cordray is regularly called on the carpet on Capitol Hill to defend his agency\u2019s actions. He has testified before Congress 27 times.Ms. Warren said she was delighted with what the bureau had achieved under Mr. Cordray\u2019s leadership.\u201cThe C.F.P.B. has exceeded my highest expectations,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of tools lying around at various regulatory agencies that never get used. But the bureau is using all of its tools, and is out there making a difference.\u201dAsked if trying to police the entire field of consumer finance is like trying to boil the ocean, Mr. Cordray grinned again. \u201cGet a big enough boiler, and you can do it,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Howard Ruff, Quirky Conservative Economist and Author, Dies at 85", "Date": "2016-11-16", "News": "Supported byHoward Ruff, an idiosyncratic economist, best-selling author and political conservative best known for being bullish on gold and silver and gloomy about the economy, died on Nov. 12 in Lehi, Utah. He was 85.The cause was complications of Parkinson\u2019s disease, his assistant, Joann Allen, said.Mr. Ruff, a college dropout, had a roller-coaster career, starting out as a stockbroker. For a time he also supported himself as a singer. (One gig was at a synagogue, as what he described as the only practicing Mormon cantor in San Francisco.)Rather than defeating him, however, the setback led to an epiphany, he said: It inspired him to plunge into business-cycle research and forge a career as a faddish investment adviser, which made him a millionaire for a second time. But that enterprise, too, went belly up.\u201cSome people say that I couldn\u2019t succeed at anything, so I became a prophet of doom,\u201d he told Time magazine in 1979.That turned out to be another successful calling. In 1975 he started publishing a newsletter called Ruff Times, which mixed financial counsel (predicting inflation and recommending investment in gold) with conservative commentary. It drew more than 175,000 subscribers.He began a syndicated weekly television program called \u201cRuff House\u201d; organized forums that offered, for a fee, more or less conventional investment advice; and established companies that distributed natural vitamins and coins, as well as other for-profit and self-promotional ventures.Again he prospered, as reflected by a 20,000-square-foot home in Utah with an indoor pool.Mr. Ruff drew his widest attention in 1979 with his book \u201cHow to Prosper During the Coming Bad Years.\u201d It recommended survivalist strategies, like stocking a year\u2019s supply of food, and directed readers to other books including \u201cSafe Places East of the Mississippi\u201d and \u201cEating Weeds for Fun and Freedom.\u201d The book sold millions of copies and was a New York Times best seller for more than a year.Until about 1981, his followers reaped large capital gains by investing in precious metals. But by several measures his portfolios later underperformed market indexes and even Treasury bills, and some of his apocalyptic predictions did not come to pass, as inflation subsided and interest rates declined during the Reagan administration, and when the economy rebounded after the 2008 financial crisis.\u201cHoward was a pioneer in the financial world when brokers encouraged investors to buy blue-chip stocks and bonds and charged high fixed commissions,\u201d Mark Skousen, the editor of Forecasts & Strategies, an investment newsletter, said in an email on Tuesday. \u201cRuff argued that Wall Street was hazardous to your wealth, especially investing in bonds that were big losers during the inflationary \u201970s.\u201dMr. Ruff became bullish on the bond and stock markets in the early 1980s, changing the name of his newsletter to Howard Ruff\u2019s Financial Success Report. But it reverted to Ruff Times in the mid-80s, and in 2008 he updated his book on the coming bad years, warning that whoever won the presidency in 2008 would be doomed by rising oil and gas prices and spiraling monetary inflation to become \u201cthe Hoover of the 2000s.\u201dAmong his other books were \u201cFamine and Survival in America\u201d (1974) and \u201cHow to Prosper in the Age of Obamanomics: A Ruff Plan for Hard Times Ahead\u201d (2009).Unlike some of his doomsaying colleagues, though, Mr. Ruff maintained a following through an engaging wit and a general willingness to admit mistakes.Urging investors to be mavericks, he compared the breed to \u201ca bovine that\u2019s left the herd,\u201d adding, \u201cAnd I feel the majority of the herd is going to be turned into hamburger.\u201dIn recommending readiness for economic collapse, he reminded his disciples, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t raining when Noah built the ark.\u201dHe co-founded a conservative lobbying group called Free the Eagle, and in 2000 he fought, unsuccessfully, to prevent Hillary Clinton, who had transplanted herself from Arkansas and Washington, from winning a Senate seat from New York.His Ruffpac political action committee prepared a television commercial that benignly featured babies and puppies playing in Central Park. It asked rhetorically what they had in common, responding: \u201cThey have all lived in New York longer than Hillary Rodham Clinton.\u201dHoward Joseph Ruff was born on Dec. 27, 1930, in Berkeley, Calif., the son of the former Rena Maxberry, a seamstress, and Wilson Ruff, who killed himself when Howard was 6 months old.\u201cI grew up broke,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe were too poor to afford a father.\u201dHe had wanted to be a singer since the age of 9, but, at his mother\u2019s insistence, instead of accepting a scholarship to the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, he served a two-year mission in the eastern United States for the Mormon Church. He later majored in music education at Brigham Young University in Utah with a minor in economics.But by his senior year, he told The New York Times in 1979, \u201cI ran out of money and got out of college before it did me any personal harm, like ending up teaching high school music courses.\u201dInstead, after joining the Air Force, he toured with its symphony as a baritone soloist and also performed with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.Mr. Ruff released an album, \u201cHoward Ruff Sings,\u201d in 1982 on his own label, Target Records, featuring songs like \u201cI Walked Today Where Jesus Walked,\u201d \u201cIf I Were a Rich Man,\u201d \u201cClimb Every Mountain\u201d and \u201cMy Way.\u201d\u201cI did it for the shock value,\u201d Mr. Ruff said. \u201cI also did it to change my image. I have always been painted as a cardboard figure of doom.\u201dMr. Ruff is survived by his wife, the former Kay Felt; 13 of their 14 children (some of whom were adopted) \u2014 Larry, Eric, David, Megan and Timothy Ruff, Anthony Ramon, David Steinberg, Pamela Patterson, Sharon Slater, Patty Simpson, Liza Spencer, Debbie Rasmussen and Terri Lynn Bond \u2014 79 grandchildren; and 48 great-grandchildren.By 2002, Mr. Ruff\u2019s fortunes had slipped again.

{"Headline": "Wall Street Bonuses Are Expected to Sink for 3rd Straight Year", "Date": "2016-11-06", "News": "Supported byWall Street bonuses are expected to decline for the third consecutive year, reflecting a period of busted mergers, limited trading activity and muted hedge fund returns.While mergers and acquisitions have been active (and even hit record levels in 2015), the bankers who advise on the deals get paid largely when the deals are completed. This year, antitrust officials thwarted a number of large mergers, including Halliburton\u2019s $35 billion bid for Baker Hughes, as well as the consolidations of the health insurance companies Anthem and Cigna, and Aetna and Humana.In addition, choppy markets damped stock trading activity and prevented skittish companies from making their debuts as public companies, except for a few prominent offerings. Investors dumped hedge fund holdings because of poor returns and high fees.Alan Johnson, the founder of Johnson Associates, describes this pattern as a \u201cmalaise,\u201d and one that is unlikely to reverse itself anytime soon.\u201cI don\u2019t see it changing for the next year or two, either,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cThe pressures in the industry on profit and fees are going to continue, and I think pay will likely continue to decline in 2017.\u201dEven more than in past years, competitors and clients pressured banks to reduce fees, as there was more disclosure around what companies can and do charge clients, Mr. Johnson said.In March, the state comptroller\u2019s office said that the average bonus for securities industry employees in the New York City area in 2015 was $146,200, while the average salary was $388,000. Both figures declined from 2014, but the compensation was still far higher than in any other industry in the area.According to the Johnson Associates report, some of the deepest cuts in bonuses this year will be among investment banking underwriting, hedge fund and equities professionals.Equity underwriting bonuses could be more than 20 percent lower compared with 2015.Within sales and trading, Johnson Associates said that there were lower levels of client activity, especially in equities, meaning bonuses could be from 5 percent to 15 percent lower than last year.Johnson Associates expects merger advisory bonuses to be about 10 percent lower.Nevertheless, there are more deals in the wings. Research by PitchBook found that through the third quarter of 2016, there was a record number of transactions valued at $10 billion or more. During the first nine months of the year, 31 such deals were signed, compared with 23 in all of 2015 and 16 in 2014. If this year\u2019s deals have better luck with regulators, banks could enjoy a payout later this year or next.Private equity bonuses will be little changed this year, according to the report, as firms were able to increase their assets under management but experienced \u201cmediocre returns.\u201dRetail and consumer banking was not quite as bleak. There, bonuses could actually gain as much as 5 percent over the previous year. That area of finance has benefited from deposit and loan growth as the economy recovers.Johnson Associates has been publishing its report annually for about 15 years. The consultants pore through public filings and interview from 30 to 50 clients to produce the results.Some of the challenges facing banks could soon reverse if interest rates go up meaningfully. With near-zero rates for almost a decade, banks have been able to lend money inexpensively but with lower returns than they received historically. If that dynamic reverses, it could be a boon to the industry, as long as the broader economy remains intact.\u201cIt could be water on the fields for many of these businesses in isolation,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cNow the caveat is, what happens to the economy when rates go up?\u201dEconomic challenges are the reason European bank employees are worse off than American ones. And Britain\u2019s vote over the summer to leave the European Union, known as \u201cBrexit,\u201d did not help European bank employees\u2019 situation, Mr. Johnson said.A portion of a banker\u2019s total compensation is based on how well his or her company has been doing in the stock market. The stock prices of some European banks, such as Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse, have declined about 50 percent each over the last year as they have grappled with government fines, increasing competition and greater regulation.Executives at those banks and others are talking about how to refocus their businesses to become more profitable.In New York, profit was not an issue. The securities industry generated $9.3 billion in profit during the first half of 2016, the comptroller\u2019s report showed, on track to surpass the $14.3 billion made in all of last year.But with thousands of job cuts and lower compensation for those in securities, it has become clear that the focus of those profits is primarily preservation, rather than making bankers wealthier.Advertisement"}

It has also highlighted some fundamental truths about the United States circa 2016, lessons that political leaders should heed beyond Tuesday\u2019s elections.But Mr. Trump has outdone even Bernie Sanders in tapping this anxiety. While economic worries cut across all demographic lines, he has gotten away with exploiting the real concerns by attacking immigrants and trade agreements, but offering no cogent policies for creating good jobs and lifting wages. His economic and tax proposals would hurt ordinary workers and blow a hole through the federal budget.

{"Headline": "Trump-Clinton? Charter Schools Are the Big Issue on Massachusetts\u2019 Ballot", "Date": "2016-11-05", "News": "Supported byBOSTON \u2014 The television ads are relentless, fueled by a historic surge of campaign spending. Fliers are clogging mailboxes. Both sides are knocking on doors across the state.The pitched battle in this state, known as a bellwether on education policy, reflects the passions that charter schools arouse nationwide, particularly regarding a central part of the debate: If they offer children in lagging traditional public schools an alternative path to a quality education, do they also undermine those schools and the children in them?But opponents say a no vote would show that even in a state where charter schools have been successful, most voters believe the schools \u2014 privately run but publicly financed \u2014 undermine traditional public schools, drain resources and perpetuate inequities, and should be curtailed.\u201cWhat happens in Massachusetts will send shock waves throughout the United States either way,\u201d said Parag Pathak, a professor at M.I.T.\u2019s Department of Economics, who studies education.\u201cIf the voters reject more urban charters here,\u201d he said, \u201cthen it\u2019s not clear what more the charter movement can do to convince opponents and skeptics.\u201dQuestion 2 on the ballot asks whether the state should be allowed to approve up to 12 new charter schools or larger enrollments at existing charters each year, not to exceed 1 percent of the statewide public school enrollment.The measure would affect nine communities that have either reached their caps on charter enrollment or have room for only one more charter school: Boston, Chelsea, Everett, Fall River, Holyoke, Lawrence, Lowell, Springfield and Worcester. All have long waiting lists.It would not affect 96 percent of the state\u2019s school districts, yet strategists say voters in those districts \u2014 largely in suburbs with good public schools \u2014 could determine the outcome Tuesday.Earlier this year, the charter proposal appeared to be nonpartisan and headed for passage. But in recent weeks, as the ad war has heated up, the campaign has taken on a partisan edge, with Republicans generally favoring charter expansion and Democrats generally opposing it, with the no side gaining steam.The money raised so far \u2014 more than $34 million \u2014 exceeds the amount raised for any other ballot question in state history, and makes the campaign one of the most expensive in the country this year. The yes side has raised almost $22 million, much of it from out-of-state groups that do not have to identify their individual donors; the no side has raised more than $12 million, most of it from teachers\u2019 unions.What has really inflamed the argument is the question of equality, which has persisted since the inception of charter schools here 20 years ago: Do they exacerbate inequality? Or do they ease it?Voters can be forgiven for being at sea in this debate as the spin machines on both sides have gone into overdrive and prominent political leaders have diverged.\u201cThis is an issue about social justice,\u201d Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican leader of the yes side, said recently as he campaigned for the measure in Dorchester, a heavily minority section of Boston. \u201cThis is an opportunity to give every kid in Massachusetts the same opportunity my kids have.\u201d\u201cI am very concerned about what this specific proposal means for hundreds of thousands of children across our Commonwealth,\u201d Ms. Warren wrote, \u201cespecially those living in districts with tight budgets where every dime matters. Education is about creating opportunity for all our children, not about leaving many behind.\u201dStill, one thing is indisputable: The charter schools here \u2014 which, like those around the country, operate independently from school committees, are rarely unionized and have more flexibility in matters like hiring, termination, curriculum and length of the school day \u2014 have performed well. The urban charter schools, in particular, have produced better academic results than the district schools have.Voters in cities like Boston who otherwise have much in common can differ on charters.Claudia Rodriguez, 50, a social worker who lives in Hyde Park, a Boston neighborhood, and has two children in a charter school, voted yes in early voting, hoping to expand her options.\u201cTo me, it\u2019s about choice,\u201d said Ms. Rodriguez, an immigrant from Guatemala. \u201cWhy we cannot have the choice?\u201dBut Irlande Plancher, 51, a Haitian immigrant in Hyde Park who sent three children to district schools and one to a charter, is voting no.Ms. Plancher, a registered nurse, was glad her youngest child had the charter option. But with four charter schools in her area, she has seen two public schools close. She said she worried that adding more charters would further crimp the traditional schools.\u201cI think whatever we have is enough,\u201d she said. \u201cWe cannot pick and choose which kids we educate and leave the rest out.\u201dThe opponents\u2019 chief message has been that charter schools drain money from district schools.\u201cThis year alone,\u201d one piece of campaign literature claims, \u201ccharter schools will drain more than $400 million that would otherwise stay in neighborhood public schools to help all students.\u201dOpponents also cast the ballot measure as a goal of \u201cout-of-state billionaires,\u201d including the brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch and members of the Walton family, which controls Walmart. Their real intent, Question 2 opponents say, is to bust teachers\u2019 unions and privatize public schools.\u201cWe can\u2019t let people demonize our schools, particularly those who never have and never will set foot in any of our schools in the city of Boston,\u201d Mayor Walsh declared Tuesday at a raucous rally.Opponents counter that when students leave, public schools still have to pay overhead, teacher salaries and other costs, which can lead to closings.Maurice T. Cunningham, a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts Boston, said he was shocked at how big this ballot fight had become. Mr. Cunningham, a member of a teachers\u2019 union who said he had not taken a position on the ballot question or on charters, noted that the labor movement had turned the campaign into \u201ca good old-fashioned union brawl,\u201d which escalated the spending on both sides.An article last Sunday about a ballot question in Massachusetts on charter schools misstated the academic affiliation for Prof. Parag Pathak, who discussed the issue.

{"Headline": "A Family Affair: McGonigle Watches", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byJohn and Stephen McGonigle\u2019s house was full of clocks when they were growing up in rural Ireland. Their father, a compositor at the Irish Times, had a gift for fixing timepieces and word spread. \u201cEvery flat surface had a clock on it,\u201d John recalled. \u201cAnd instead of pictures, we had other people\u2019s clocks on the walls.\u201dWhen John finished school in 1986, the McGonigles\u2019 father recommended that he enter the Irish-Swiss Institute of Horology in Dublin, a school partly supported by the Swiss in an effort to create a European network of watchmakers (it closed in 2004). Most of the graduates became jewelers; some entered industries like microchip manufacturing, where dexterity was paramount.But Mr. McGonigle wanted his son to make airplane instrument dials for Aer Lingus \u2014 what he called a \u201cgood\u201d job, his son recalled.\u201cInstead,\u201d John continued with a laugh, \u201cI got bitten by the watch bug.\u201dIn 1994 Stephen also went to the institute: \u201cIt was a very good grounding.\u201d And after they both had graduated, the brothers moved to Switzerland and spent about seven years working for prestigious houses including Breguet, Ulysse Nardin, Girard-Perregaux and Christophe Claret.The McGonigles\u2019 first watch was a tourbillon, made of German silver, sapphire crystal and gold, which International Watch Magazine called \u201cabsolutely sublime.\u201d The second was the 10-piece Tuscar, the Irish name for the Tuskar rocks east of Ireland that can be a sailor\u2019s first view of the country. That limited edition sold out. A further series, Tuscar Banu, Irish for dawn, followed, offered in white or rose gold.In addition to their names, the watches\u2019 decoration, inside and out, was inspired by Celtic influences. \u201cThe engraving is designed by our sister, Frances McGonigle, an artist,\u201d Stephen said. \u201cIt\u2019s not O.T.T. stuff \u2014 shamrocks and leprechauns, but if you picked up one of our watches you could tell we were from Ireland.\u201dTheir newest watch, the Ceol Minute Repeater, uses the Gaelic word for music. Two watches in the six-piece collection have sold, each for more than 200,000 euros, or $220,000.\u201cA minute repeater,\u201d Stephen explained, \u201ctells the time without you having to look at the hands. Pull the slide along the side of the case and it will ring out, in different pitches, two different tones, the hour, the quarter and the minute.\u201d Such watches initially were designed so wealthy customers could tell time at night without having to light a candle.The Ceol\u2019s relief engraving incorporates animal motifs from the Book of Kells, the ornately decorated volume created around 800 A.D. and now displayed in Dublin, and takes a week to complete. One of Switzerland\u2019s most accomplished engravers, Michele Rothen Rebetez, does the work.\u201cWe spend a lot of time making each piece look good,\u201d John said, \u201ceven though most will never be seen by the customer.\u201dHis brother added: \u201cA spring will work without decoration but we decorate it anyway. Every screw is mirror polished. We want the watch to be perfect.\u201dThe Ceol was commissioned by a client, an American, who helped finance its creation. The design \u2014 the watch\u2019s aesthetics and the initial 3-D drawings \u2014 took 18 months to develop and another six months to prepare parts and build the first model.Modern watchmaking is a marriage of old and new, the brothers maintained. \u201cSome parts were sourced from Switzerland,\u201d Stephen said, \u201cothers designed by us then produced by computer numeric control, as this is the most accurate and efficient way of making parts.\u201dEach watch is customized. One client \u201calways asks for a white gold finish because it looks like steel,\u201d Stephen said. \u201cAlthough he ruins the modesty thing when he steps out of his Rolls.\u201dWhat McGonigles\u2019 clients have in common \u2014 apart from wealth \u2014 is a fascination with things mechanical. \u201cOne is a rocket engineer, another a nuclear scientist,\u201d John said. A few are Irish; most come from other countries and many of them enjoy traveling to Ireland to discuss watches in the workshop and over a few pints in the local pub.The McGonigles often deliver finished watches in person. \u201cSome clients slap it on their wrist immediately; others will put it in a safe,\u201d Stephen said. \u201cMost don\u2019t buy the watch for show but for love of the work.\u201dThe brothers say they are too busy making watches to do much marketing. \u201cCollectors are fantastic researchers; they seek us out,\u201d says John. \u201cThey\u2019ve heard our craftsmanship is the best.\u201dAnd have watches made them rich? The brothers burst out laughing.Like many independents, McGonigles Watches has yet to make a profit. And until two years ago, the brothers were moonlighting for some big Swiss watchmakers to pay the bills. \u201cIf the passion wasn\u2019t there,\u201d Stephen said, \u201cit wouldn\u2019t be worth it. But it\u2019s a privilege to make a watch.\u201dAs for the future, the McGonigles would like to hire a few skilled watchmakers for future projects. \u201cWe\u2019ve found our design language,\u201d John said. \u201cIt was a very long and difficult gestation, but the ideas are coming thick and fast now. We\u2019ve found our way; we know where we\u2019re going.\u201dThe brothers rarely wear watches themselves. \u201cIt\u2019s the most tragic thing, neither John or I will ever be able to afford one of our own watches,\u201d Stephen lamented. \u201cBut the greatest pleasure is actually making them.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The confidential investigation done by the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers showed that much of the loan was missing and was not properly accounted for on AIBA\u2019s financial ledgers.In one letter from August 2010, two months before the loan was secured, Mr. Wu wrote to Kamaladdin Heydarov, a high-ranking government official and the president of the Boxing Federation of Azerbaijan. Mr. Wu referred to a meeting with Mr. Heydarov in Baku one month earlier and said that \u201cwe have been waiting to receive any feedback from your banker located in Switzerland to finalize the investment agreement as soon as we can.\u201dIn an email from March 2010, Ho Kim, a South Korean who is the executive director of AIBA, told Mr. Wu that he had met with Mr. Heydarov, who would approve the loan, but that he \u201cwants to do a big favor to you which later he will ask for repay back.\u201d Mr. Kim added, \u201cThis is very obvious.\u201dMr. Kim, in an email to The Times, suggested his involvement in the loan derived from following Mr. Wu\u2019s orders.\u201cHe is not the person to sign any contract without understanding the terms and conditions,\u201d Mr. Kim said. \u201cWhen the investment funds were sent to the U.S.A., he approved all transfers. He does not trust no one in regard to the finance matters.\u201dIn a statement, a federation spokesman, Nicolas Jomard, said that Mr. Wu \u201chad a certain form of involvement\u201d in the loan, but he did not elaborate. He said there was nothing unusual in Mr. Wu\u2019s having discussions with Mr. Heydarov because he \u201cnecessarily has contacts with all the heads of national federations.\u201dAlthough Mr. Jomard did not challenge the authenticity of the Aug. 10, 2010, letter, his statement said the federation was looking into whether it was sent without Mr. Wu\u2019s authority.Still, there was another indication Mr. Wu was aware of the loan and the financial chaos it fed into.The loan was used to develop a set of matches run by an organization called the World Series of Boxing in North America. But by February 2012, the venture had lost millions of dollars, apparently consuming the $10 million that had been lent. Mr. Wu received a letter from Abe Lin, a longtime friend whom he hired to keep track of the finances at the venture, saying additional money, about $1.35 million, was needed to keep it afloat.\u201cBeing the main financial person in charge, I attach all necessary documents for you to review,\u201d Mr. Lin wrote. He signed off, \u201cIt would be much appreciated if the confirmation of these figures can be received at your earliest convenience.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of a spokesman for boxing\u2019s international federation.

{"Headline": "Trump, Though Critical of Nuclear Deal, Could Offer Opportunities for Iran", "Date": "2016-11-20", "News": "Supported byMemo From TehranTEHRAN \u2014 At first blush, the election of Donald J. Trump would seem to be bad news for Iran. But there is a chance that on balance, things could work out surprisingly well for the clerics.Publicly, Iran\u2019s leaders stress that they pay little heed to what happens in the United States, that they pride themselves on their independence. \u201cIt makes no difference for Iran who the next U.S. president is,\u201d the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said in a speech last week.Yet he could hardly miss Mr. Trump\u2019s promises on the campaign trail to \u201ctear up\u201d the landmark nuclear agreement reached last year, which he frequently described as the worst deal ever. In response, Ayatollah Khamenei said recently that if Mr. Trump tore it up, \u201cwe will set fire to it.\u201dBut Mr. Trump also presents new opportunities for Iran, many analysts say. While he has criticized the nuclear deal, he has also said that the United States should stop backing rebels in Syria and focus on the Islamic State militant group \u2014 effectively shifting its support to Iran\u2019s ally in Syria, President Bashar al-Assad.If that happens, said Mohammad Marandi, an associate professor of North American studies at the University of Tehran, \u201cit will be good for Iran, the region and the world.\u201dWith its Lebanese ally Hezbollah, Tehran has supported Mr. Assad throughout the uprising, which started in 2011, morally and, later, financially and militarily. Over 400 Iranian and Shiite Afghan soldiers have died in the conflict, according to official statistics.\u201cIf such a change would come from Trump, of all people, it would be remarkable,\u201d Professor Marandi said.In the larger context, Iran is waiting and hoping for the day the United States packs up and leaves the Middle East, closing its military bases in the region and moving its aircraft carriers out of the Persian Gulf. While that seems far-fetched, Mr. Trump has demonstrated an isolationist streak in questioning the value of NATO and the nuclear umbrella over South Korea and Japan.\u201cThey should stop threatening us,\u201d Professor Marandi said. \u201cIf the United States under Trump is more constructive, he will find that Iran will respond in kind.\u201dThe one area where both Iran and the United States stand to lose ground is in personal diplomacy, something that was virtually nonexistent after the 1979 Islamic Revolution.During the two years of negotiations on the nuclear deal, Secretary of State John Kerry and the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, developed a strong personal relationship. In front of the cameras at least, they slapped each other\u2019s backs, joked and seemed to get along very well, a breakthrough for two countries that do not even have embassies in each other\u2019s capitals.Mr. Trump has not yet decided on his secretary of state, but with people like Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former mayor of New York, and John R. Bolton, a former United Nations ambassador, being mentioned, it seems unlikely that the same level of personal rapport will be matched.\u201cLet\u2019s face it: The honeymoon is over,\u201d said Saeed Laylaz, an economist close to President Hassan Rouhani. \u201cThese two guys and their teams have talked for hundreds of hours, in a period of two years. Who can replace that?\u201dNader Karimi Joni, an analyst close to the reformist movement of Mr. Rouhani, said: \u201cMr. Kerry and Mr. Zarif knew each other for years. Mr. Kerry\u2019s son-in-law is of Iranian descent. Mr. Zarif has hosted Mr. Kerry in his home in New York when he was an ambassador to the United Nations. You can be sure such relations are now a thing of the past with the names that are being mentioned out there.\u201dAt the same time, large international banks are still not providing any line of credit to Iran-related projects, nor are they allowing bank transfers out of fear of trespassing unilateral American sanctions on Iran. Although the Obama administration is working to clear up ambiguities that are holding back financing, a Republican administration is likely to halt those efforts.Some analysts adhere to the traditional view, saying that America\u2019s enmity toward Iran has never diminished, only the conditions surrounding the relationship.\u201cThe difference is now that because of all the regional crisis, there are chances for both of us for cooperation, in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Yemen, for instance,\u201d said Hossein Royvaran, a political analyst. \u201cThis means that because of our influence, any U.S. president has to keep dealing with Iran, be it Obama, Clinton or, now, Trump.\u201dNormal Iranians have their own ideas about Mr. Trump, many seeing him as a harbinger of chaos. The worldview of countries that have suffered at the machinations of colonialism and Western power plays is conducive to grand policies and conspiracy theories.\u201cThose in power behind the scenes have brought this Trump to solve the world\u2019s greatest problem: overpopulation,\u201d said Hossein Darbani, a wealthy farmer. \u201cWe will see bloodshed and chaos with this man at the helm, mark my words.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Art of the Protest", "Date": "2016-11-21", "News": "Supported byFixesPoland has one of the strictest abortion laws in Europe. Recently, a government-backed bill sought to go further, punishing women who had abortions with up to five years in prison. Last month, Polish women responded with a one-day strike. On Oct. 3, tens of thousands of people, most of them women dressed in black, protested in major cities.Poland is run by a nationalist, right-wing Roman Catholic party that controls Parliament, has taken over independent media, is disregarding rulings of the Constitutional Court and now proposes creating a militia outside the command of the armed forces.It would not seem to be a government that would listen to such a protest. But three days later, its legislators voted down the abortion bill. Why? The government saw the size and speed of the mobilization, and its high concentration of young people, as a threat \u2014 one it worried could grow.The current relevance of this to America, which enshrines in its Constitution the right to peacefully voice protest to check government power, will escape no one. The Republican Party will soon control the presidency, Congress, most governorships and state legislatures; in all probability, there will be a conservative majority on the Supreme Court. Given Donald J. Trump\u2019s approval of advisers from the white nationalist far right, following his vitriolic attacks on the policies of the Obama administration, Democrats, independents and even some Republicans are bracing for assaults on \u2014 everything.Yet they are not powerless. Seldom, in fact, has an out-of-power opposition been able to count on more resources \u2014 in broad support, political clout and moral authority.But how these resources are used is what matters.If the purpose is to allow despondent or angry people to vent and show solidarity, then the anti-Trump protests going on in major cities already do that. But they will not reverse the election results, or alter what President-elect Trump seeks to do.Protests can change policies, however \u2014 and often have. In other countries and throughout American history, ordinary citizens banding together have triumphed over governments, even when a single party holds sweeping control. Many of those protests used resources that the opposition to President-elect Trump enjoys today. They can learn from how those victories were won.The movement won by making a strong moral appeal to public opinion. It showed protesters making sacrifices for their cause. It lured opponents into violence that finally swayed the views of whites \u2014 a tactic similar to the playbook of Mahatma Gandhi in India, of forcing an oppressor to show his ugliest face. When that sight tips public opinion, government often listens.No group more proudly claimed the title of \u201coutsider\u201d than Act Up, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, founded in March 1987 in New York. Many of its members were dying. They were despised and reviled.The Englers call Act Up an example of the power of the extreme outsider strategy: change through confrontation. It was noisy and angry. It was the first group ever to close down the New York Stock Exchange. Members scattered the ashes of loved ones on the White House lawn. They held a \u201cStop the Church\u201d demonstration in front of St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral.Act Up\u2019s polarizing language, actions and style put off even some influential gay men, who told the group it was hurting the cause. (The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had heard the same criticisms.) But even many who were repelled by Act Up\u2019s approach still heard its message.Although people condemn your tactics, they can still support your issue, the Englers wrote.By pulling from one extreme, Act Up shifted broad public opinion. The group started a global AIDS activist movement. It played a major role in changing the rules to expedite new AIDS medicines \u2014 and then it helped to bring down their cost. It forced insurance companies to cover treatment. It procured a patient voice in treatment. It was a major force behind the Ryan White CARE Act, a federal program for uninsured and underinsured people with AIDS.Senior citizens and his police were two of Milosevic\u2019s most important pillars. Otpor members worked on both whenever they were arrested (which was quite often). Grandparents got angry when high-school students were repeatedly arrested or accused of terrorism.This strategy also works for policy change. Advocates for gay marriage won early victories among many churches, the American Bar Association and child development experts. This helped transform influential opponents of gay marriage into influential allies.The most important pillar on policy matters is Congress: Presidents need to pass their bills. Both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush failed to pass signal legislative priorities, despite controlling Congress. This was not because of grass-roots activism, but because of lobbying and spending by powerful and wealthy groups.Under Mr. Clinton, health care reform fell victim to, among other things, \u201cHarry and Louise\u201d ads featuring a fictional couple, financed by the health insurance industry.The Clamshell Alliance failed to stop Seabrook\u2019s construction, but it gave rise to a grass-roots antinuclear movement. Groups around the country staged protests and sit-ins that slowed the pace of new reactor construction.Then on March 28, 1979, Reactor Number 2 at the Three Mile Island station lost coolant and suffered a partial meltdown. The nuclear reactor industry never recovered.Three Mile Island came 13 years after another partial meltdown, at the Fermi 1 reactor outside Detroit. Haven\u2019t heard of it? One reason is that at the time, there was no movement ready to respond.Events that galvanize public attention occur frequently. Most lead to nothing. But a few become sparks for sweeping change. What makes the difference is the existence of a prepared movement.Thankfully, a galvanizing event need not be a nuclear meltdown. It does need to be an attention-grabbing drama where one side holds the moral advantage. When activists don\u2019t have one, they have sometimes created one: think Bull Connor\u2019s dogs, or Gandhi\u2019s Salt March.President-elect Trump has no popular mandate (Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by a margin larger than John F. Kennedy in 1960, Richard M. Nixon in 1968, or Al Gore in 2000). Even many who voted for him do not endorse some of what he advocates or represents. Many traditional pillars of Republican administrations are less than firm in their support, beginning with the wary Republicans in Congress \u2014 and some are starting out opposed, notably much of the foreign policy establishment. The president-elect, as Mrs. Clinton said, can be \u201cprovoked by a tweet.\u201d He is impulsive. His campaign set a new standard for what Galston called a \u201cbitter, divisive tone.\u201d He and his advisers hold bigoted views that overwhelming majorities of the American people reject as immoral.What terrifies many people about a President Trump, in other words, is also what makes, for civil resistance, a uniquely promising moment.Advertisement"}

Coico, the former City College president who resigned amid investigations of her use of university funds to pay personal expenses, blames top CUNY administrators for her woes. The letter was addressed to James B. Milliken, the CUNY chancellor who, along with Frederick P. Schaffer, CUNY\u2019s general counsel and senior vice chancellor for legal affairs, was criticized in the inspector general\u2019s report.Mr. Cuomo \u201cplays a long-term game, and what he does, in case after case, is use scandal to centralize power in the name of good government,\u201d Kenneth Sherrill, a professor emeritus of political science at CUNY\u2019s Hunter College, said. \u201cSo I could almost see his reaction to CUNY being, \u2018Ah, this was what I was waiting for.\u2019\u201dThe budget fight this year should be viewed as one of numerous \u201ctactical moves within a larger strategy\u201d of Mr. Cuomo wanting to revamp CUNY, Professor Sherrill said.Just as significantly, Mr. Cuomo named new members \u2014 including several to whom he has long been close \u2014 to the CUNY board, including a new chairman, William C.

{"Headline": "Retired Coal Miners Losing Their Safety Net", "Date": "2016-11-28", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe troubled coal industry, which stirred such great political concern during the presidential campaign, is about to take on a decidedly human dimension in the Senate. A bipartisan push is underway there to rescue the failing pension and health benefits of thousands of retired union coal miners. Their benefit plans have become severely underfunded during the industry\u2019s downturn, as coal companies declare bankruptcy and renege on obligations to workers at a time when there are fewer young miners to contribute support.The plan, called the Miners Protection Act, was sent for floor action by a bipartisan 18-to-8 vote of the Senate Finance Committee in September. But it has run into trouble with the Republican majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. He questions why the bill would protect only members of the United Mine Workers of America, which has an estimated 89,000 pensioned miners and family members and 22,000 workers vested for the future.The senator\u2019s concern for nonunion miners seems a classic example of a hackneyed legislative tactic \u2014 arguing for the perfect to block the good. He should drop it and help retirees who worked in a dangerous industry and deserve what was promised by contract in the halcyon days of Big Coal.Mr. McConnell blames the Obama administration for the industry\u2019s troubles, insisting that its \u201cideological\u201d regulatory policies have hurt miners more than they have helped the environment. It\u2019s true that clean air rules (many predating Mr. Obama) have required costly investments in pollution controls and helped drive some old coal-fired power plants out of business. But a far greater factor in coal\u2019s demise has been the boom in cheaper, cleaner natural gas. Coal once generated more than half the electricity in the United States. Its share is now closer to 30 percent.Mr. McConnell ignores more than market forces in opposing the bill. He seems blind as well to a federal commitment to miners that dates back 70 years to the bare-knuckle unionism of the miners\u2019 John L. Lewis.The plan has firm support from Democratic senators, but its success is in serious doubt, given Mr. McConnell\u2019s stance. (He insists that the United Mine Workers\u2019s endorsement of his opponent two years ago in a re-election race is \u201cirrelevant\u201d to his views.) He says he hopes \u201cwe can find a way forward\u201d on the issue. Fast floor action to help thousands of coal miners is the obvious way forward.Advertisement"}

The engagement with Exxon itself has been more gradual; members of the family tried for more than a decade, through conversations with company executives and through proxy measures, to get Exxon to take a stronger stance in favor of clean energy and, in the days when the company was expressing doubts in paid advertisements in The New York Times about climate science, to get it to stop.\u201cWe\u2019ve clearly hit a nerve, haven\u2019t we?\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Trump has made an illogically logical choice for his Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin.Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s Wall Street past will rankle Democrats. But unlike many people whom Mr. Trump has put on his team, he is neither an ideologue nor a populist. He is also well qualified for the job, bipartisan and relatively reserved.Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s career as a financier will not make for a smooth ride though confirmation hearings. He spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs, working in mortgage securities before becoming chief information officer. He left in 2002 to set up his own hedge fund, Dune Capital, which helped finance hit movies like \u201cAvatar.\u201d And he and fellow investors made a 150 percent profit in five years turning around the defunct mortgage lender IndyMac Bank, which they bought in 2009 and renamed OneWest Bank.Lobbying groups are already coming out against his nomination, in part because of accusations that OneWest Bank\u2019s foreclosure policies were too aggressive. People \u201cshould be terrified by the prospect of a Treasury Secretary Mnuchin,\u201d the Take on Wall Street campaign said on Tuesday.Republicans, though, have the majority needed to confirm him. He is not a Republican through and through. He has given money multiple times to Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, who will be the next Senate leader for the Democrats. He donated to President Obama\u2019s first presidential campaign and raised money this year for Kamala Harris, a Democrat who won a California Senate seat in this month\u2019s election.He even recently floated the idea of creating an infrastructure bank, a plan pitched earlier by Hillary Clinton. That suggests a more pragmatic approach to the job than, say the attorney general nominee, Jeff Sessions, or the health and human services appointee, Tom Price.Such an approach could help him balance competing views while pushing for some of Mr. Trump\u2019s major first-year goals, like a tax code overhaul, infrastructure spending and a government budget that could substantially increase the national debt.In a rare quality for Washington insiders, Mr. Mnuchin also does not seek the limelight, which could appeal to lawmakers who are eager to take credit for policy victories.

{"Headline": "James Simons\u2019s Foundation Starts New Institute for Computing, Big Data", "Date": "2016-11-22", "News": "Supported byA new private research institute financed by the billionaire James H. Simons in New York will develop software tools and apply cutting edge computing techniques to science often not possible in academia and industry.Mr. Simons, a mathematician turned wealthy hedge fund manager and now philanthropist, and his wife, Marilyn, the foundation president, hope the new institute will fill an overlooked niche.Computers have been a fixture for decades in astrophysics and many other fields of science. But typically, the computer programs are written by graduate students, often abandoned after they finish their programs. \u201cThose people aren\u2019t great coders, for the most part,\u201d Mr. Simons said.At the Flatiron Institute, a good fraction of the staff will be professional computer programmers, producing software not only for the in-house scientists but also available for anyone else who needs it.\u201cThe computational motif that runs through the organization, there really isn\u2019t anything quite like that,\u201d Mr. Simons said. \u201cA university department cannot hire programmers.\u201dMs. Simons said the impetus for the institute evolved from a brainstorming workshop about \u201cwhat we might do to help move the needle in science.\u201d A Belgian physicist and mathematician, Ingrid Daubechies, suggested an effort to develop better computational tools.\u201cShe said there is a real need for analyzing big data,\u201d Ms. Simons said. \u201cShe felt these kinds of technologies and approaches would be really helpful in addressing some of the scientific problems we had now.\u201dThe first area of focus was computational biology.\u201cJim said, \u2018Let\u2019s have lunch tomorrow,\u2019 \u201d Dr. Greengard said. \u201cThen, \u2018Why don\u2019t you come and start this?\u2019 \u201dThat was three years ago, and Dr. Greengard accepted. Most of the work of the Simons Foundation goes to grants to scientists around the country; this was its first foray into hiring its own scientists and embarking on its own research.One project is developing software for collecting and analyzing the electrical pulses recorded from electrodes implanted in animal brains. Originally, it was just a few electrodes. Now it is hundreds and soon it will be thousands, Dr. Greengard said.From the voltages, scientists need to identify which neurons are firing when, and that is complex computational challenge. Currently, different research groups use their own custom-written computer programs, making it difficult for scientists to compare their results with others, or to reproduce them.The Flatiron software will be available for all scientists.\u201cWe can build teams where methodology development is not sort of secondary to asking the science question,\u201d Dr. Greengard said. \u201cIt\u2019s critical to asking the science question.\u201dDr. Greengard\u2019s efforts, until now housed in the foundation offices, proved successful, so his group and three other centers will be working at the institute.The foundation also hopes to remove institute scientists from the typical academic pressures of churning out journal articles in the chase of tenure and scrambling for the next grant to finance their work.Because of the competition for grants, scientists often propose projects that they know will work rather than on ideas that are more adventurous with potentially greater payoffs.\u201cThese are really interesting questions, and we can think longer than the three-year grant cycle,\u201d Marilyn Simons said. \u201cThey can tackle tough questions and put the time in that\u2019s necessary.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "C.E.O.s Ponder a New Game, With Trump\u2019s Rules", "Date": "2016-11-15", "News": "Supported byDealBook\u201cIf you were to look at our game board of all the possible outcomes of the election, this one wasn\u2019t even on the sheet.\u201dThat was how Mark T. Bertolini, chief executive of the large health insurer Aetna, described the election of Donald J. Trump as the next president. He was speaking with me last Thursday on stage at The New York Times\u2019s annual conference, DealBook: Playing for the Long Term.\u201cWe started with a fresh piece of paper yesterday. We had no idea how to approach it,\u201d Mr. Bertolini said.Business executives across the nation and the world have been whipping out fresh pieces of paper to map how Mr. Trump\u2019s election and Republican control of the White House, Senate and House \u2014 which may make Washington\u2019s notorious gridlock a memory \u2014 will reshape economic policy.The stock market has jumped, taking many prognosticators by surprise, in anticipation of the seismic changes Mr. Trump has promised: a repeal or refashioning of the Affordable Care Act, a dismantling of the Dodd-Frank regulations for Wall Street, a substantial haircut for corporate and personal income tax rates, and a major infrastructure spending program, among other things.While the new conventional wisdom may be that the nation is about to see comprehensive change, the truth is that it is likely to be more incremental than across the board.Take, for instance, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. While you would think much of the finance industry would salivate at the chance to rid itself of the law, its view is more nuanced. Most companies have made large investments and changes in their business practices to comply with the law. So it\u2019s hard to see how even the law\u2019s die-hard opponents in the industry would press for the full repeal that Mr. Trump said he would pursue.\u201cThat omelet has been made; that toothpaste is out of the tube,\u201d Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, said at the conference.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want regulation to be repealed in toto,\u201d he added. \u201cIf you want to be good for bankers, you have to have policies that would be good for economic growth.\u201d\u201cThe C.F.P.B. probably won\u2019t be eliminated,\u201d Ian Katz, a research analyst at Capital Alpha Partners in Washington, wrote in a note to clients. \u201cIt would be horrible politics and optics to get rid of an agency that was established to protect the little guy.\u201dMr. Katz predicted that the Trump administration would be able to push through a switch that critics of the agency have long lobbied for: a shift in control of the consumer bureau from a single director to a bipartisan commission.Mr. Trump might also focus on changing a rule for small banks that grow to more than $10 billion in assets. Currently, such growth catapults a bank into a new regulatory category, one that comes with much stricter scrutiny and more elaborate reporting requirements. This rule has been criticized by the banking industry as an impediment to growth and competition.As for the return of Glass-Steagall \u2014 something Mr. Trump has talked about \u2014 don\u2019t bet on it. \u201cThe Republican Party\u2019s call for a return to a division of commercial and investment banking shouldn\u2019t be taken seriously,\u201d Mr. Katz wrote. \u201cThat was part of a campaign document. Big banks are useful as a populist scapegoat, and Trump may continue to use them in that way. But neither he or his top aides are interested in Glass-Steagall 2.0.\u201dPiecemeal change may also be true of Mr. Trump\u2019s pledge to undo Obamacare, which was one of his bedrock campaign promises.Mr. Bertolini of Aetna predicted: \u201cThere will be a repeal first, and I think the repeal will be at a minimum in name.\u201dIt\u2019s nearly impossible for the law to be replaced with the flip of a switch. \u201cBecause what\u2019s going to happen in the next year?\u201d he said. \u201cWe have people signed up; we have to honor that through 2017. We\u2019ll have to work quickly to have something for 2018.\u201dMr. Bertolini said that whatever replacement plan might materialize, the government was not going to just stop insuring the 20 million or so people who are covered under the Affordable Care Act. \u201cYou can\u2019t put them out on the street without insurance,\u201d he said. His expectation is that Medicare Advantage will be expanded.Of course, the biggest question is how Mr. Trump is going to create a new manufacturing class in America. He has suggested that he is going to renegotiate trade agreements, increase tariffs on goods and deport illegal immigrants \u2014 both for security reasons, he contends, and because they take jobs from Americans. How those ambitions ultimately play out is anyone\u2019s guess.One issue that Mr. Trump has seemingly avoided is that of how new technologies are steadily taking American jobs.\u201cThe jobs that are routine are going to be replaced by technology,\u201d Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, said at the conference.That\u2019s a truth that may be at odds with Mr. Trump\u2019s ambitions.Still, Mr. Schmidt had an optimistic outlook about how technology already provides unappreciated benefits.\u201cManufacturing jobs are infinitely safer today because robots do the dangerous work,\u201d he said. \u201cWe take that for granted.\u201dDespite all of the hand-wringing among C.E.O.s surprised about the outcome of the election, there was a sense of optimism \u2014 or at least a sense of hope \u2014 that pervaded their words.\u201cWe all know a lot about Trump the campaigner \u2014 now we have to find out about the Trump who needs to get things done,\u201d Mr. Blankfein said.\u201cHe will start to think not about getting elected but about what his legacy is going to be,\u201d he continued. \u201cI assume you go into that office and you think about your place in history and things change.\u201dMr. Blankfein added, \u201cI\u2019m going to see how it goes before I become mournful.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Money Management Gospel of Yale\u2019s Endowment Guru", "Date": "2016-11-05", "News": "Supported byAs he has done for decades, once a week David F. Swensen convenes his staff \u2014 including his cadre of apprentices \u2014 for a morning-long meeting among the Gothic revival flourishes and crenelations of the Yale University campus to debate investment ideas.Mr. Swensen, 62, runs the school\u2019s $25.4 billion endowment, one of the largest in the country. Usually he is joined by his intellectual sparring partner, Dean Takahashi, his senior director. It amounts to an internship in the world of managing a university\u2019s billions \u2014 and the young analysts have a front-row seat.\u201cIt was like watching a 70-year-old married couple go at it in full force,\u201d recalled Andrew Golden, who was one of those Swensen acolytes in the 1980s.But forget what you think about internships and fetching doughnuts for the bosses. The meetings are supposed to be a crucible of ideas, and the analysts \u2014 some of whom stay in the positions for years \u2014 recalled bringing their own proposals in the early days, and having to defend them or face the music. \u201cIt could be jarring to have your own view shredded by them,\u201d Mr. Golden said.As for Mr. Swensen, it\u2019s an environment that brings together two things he loves: thinking about investments and teaching other people how to think about them. \u201cThey are twin passions of mine,\u201d he said during a recent interview in his sun-filled corner office at the endowment\u2019s headquarters on Yale\u2019s New Haven campus. Certainly no school has incubated as many endowment managers as Yale.Mr. Swensen is legendary in the rarefied world of endowment management. He has pioneered an investment strategy that expanded Yale\u2019s portfolio from a plain-vanilla mix of stocks and bonds to substantial holdings in real estate, private equity and venture capital, along with other alternatives. Until then, the typical endowment was far more conservative.And through his graduates, his investment style has spread to the nation\u2019s prominent schools and foundations. Today, Mr. Swensen and former prot\u00e9g\u00e9s oversee nearly $100 billion in endowment money for schools including M.I.T., Stanford, the University of Pennsylvania, Bowdoin, Wesleyan and Princeton (which Mr. Golden manages). Other alumni are running the Rockefeller Foundation and the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation and working at the YMCA Retirement Fund and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.In an era when it is routine for money managers to elbow their way into the public consciousness \u2014 populating the news channels, burnishing their images \u2014 Mr. Swensen has largely stayed away from the spotlight, aside from writing a book, \u201cPioneering Portfolio Management.\u201d Yet he is one of the most influential people in a generation that has seen endowments grow tremendously in importance at premier institutions. Yale\u2019s endowment now provides 33 percent of the school\u2019s budget, compared with 10 percent in 1985.In a series of extended interviews, he and more than a half-dozen of his investment-office veterans discussed his management style \u2014 where they agree and disagree. Along the way Mr. Swensen gave his views on things as diverse as the pharmaceutical company Valeant \u2014 which \u201cdidn\u2019t even have the fig leaf of R.&D. expenditures,\u201d he said, to justify increasing its drug prices dramatically \u2014 to his toughest year, fiscal 2009, when his fund plummeted 24.6 percent during the economic meltdown.In the aftermath, he got hurt in a particularly bad real estate investment. \u201cThis is one of my biggest mistakes in the past 30 years,\u201d Mr. Swensen said.Mr. Swensen, a lanky, soft-spoken native of River Falls, Wis., initially planned to become a teacher before going into the world of finance, where he understood it wasn\u2019t just about the numbers. \u201cIn poker, you can play the cards or you can play the people,\u201d said Randy Kim, who worked in the endowment office for a decade and went on to run the investment department of the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation. \u201cDave could do both.\u201dMr. Swensen\u2019s route to the endowment world was circuitous, though. \u201cMy father and my grandfather were both chemistry professors,\u201d he said. After earning a doctorate in economics from Yale in 1980, he considered teaching that subject. But while he was researching bond prices at Salomon Brothers for his Ph.D. dissertation, \u201cthey offered me a job,\u201d he said.Salomon was, of course, a Wall Street bond titan at the time and would eventually help define the go-go 1980s \u201cBarbarians at the Gate\u201d era of leveraged buyouts. All of that was still a few years in the future, though, and anyway, Mr. Swensen said, \u201cI missed Yale so much that I went back to teach one class every semester.\u201dIn 1985, the Yale provost, William C. Brainard, plucked him from Wall Street and asked him to take over the school\u2019s $1 billion endowment.His acceptance meant an 80 percent pay cut. But Mr. Swensen says he never regretted returning to work for an academic mission. \u201cI am in the fortunate position of making very good money,\u201d he said, for something he loves doing. He made $5.1 million in 2014, the latest numbers available.From the beginning, he brought in analysts and interns to work on the portfolio. Part of that process soon included the weekly meeting to debate investment ideas. \u201cSeeing that there was a debate, even at the most senior level, taught everyone to have their own view,\u201d Mr. Golden said.He recalled proposing at the time that Yale place some of its money with several money managers he had identified as promising. \u201cThey had good track records,\u201d he said. However, the debate centered on something different: \u201cHow good they would be going forward.\u201dIn some cases, Yale selected a manager with little or no track record. That was the case with the Hillhouse Capital Group, an investment fund focused on Chinese stocks that was begun in 2005 by Lei Zhang \u2014 himself a former underling of Mr. Swensen.That Hillhouse investment ended up taking Yale on a wild ride during the 2008 financial crisis. The value of the school\u2019s investment in Hillhouse fell nearly 44 percent, peak to trough. But instead of taking money out, Yale actually invested more in Hillhouse, convinced that Mr. Zhang\u2019s investment approach remained solid.For Mr. Swensen, the decision to stay in was logical. \u201cWho cares about the trailing numbers if the fundamentals of the portfolio are good?\u201d he said. That long-term mind-set paid off. Hillhouse has generated more than a 20 percent average annual return since the endowment first invested in 2005.Explaining his investment strategies and other issues is onerous work. Mr. Swensen said his team worked on long quarterly reports that go to the endowment\u2019s investment committee. \u201cI edit every single memo,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that if you write your argument down, you might recognize flaws in it.\u201dReturns are central, of course, but a manager\u2019s track record \u2014 even if good on the bottom line \u2014 must be balanced against whether that money manager\u2019s goals work in Yale\u2019s interest. The university has \u201cclose to 100 active relationships\u201d with money-management firms, Mr. Swensen said. \u201cThe average length of a relationship is 13 years. That is a long time. It is all about being partners and who you choose.\u201dThere are some categories of manager that turn Mr. Swensen off, like the \u201casset gatherers,\u201d as he calls them, often famed for building mammoth investment funds by attracting scores of individual investors. \u201cThe Bill Grosses and Peter Lynches are about asset gathering\u201d he said, referring to one of the founders of Pimco and to the former manager of Fidelity Investments\u2019 Magellan Fund. \u201cMore assets produce more fees, but they force managers to add more positions, not just Grade A ideas,\u201d he said.A Fidelity spokesman said Mr. Lynch\u2019s record spoke for itself. A representative for Mr. Gross declined to comment.Nor does leverage \u2014 the use of borrowed money to try to amplify returns \u2014 appeal to the Yale team. \u201cWe want managers who are interested in improving operations as a way to create value, as opposed to financial engineering,\u201d he said. The team applies a simple test when considering putting money with an investor who specializes in corporate buyouts: Add up the leverage in the investor\u2019s portfolio, and compare it with the leverage in the stock market (meaning the borrowing conducted by publicly traded companies).Leverage, after all, can become a millstone if things start to go wrong. \u201cDebt restricts your ability to do things,\u201d Mr. Takahashi said.Mr. Swensen also has little patience for some activist investors like William A. Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management, who has mounted public battles aimed at spurring target companies to revamp. \u201cThe drill is that they want return of capital, whether it comes from cash distributions or stock buybacks. That is an extraordinarily short-term orientation,\u201d Mr. Swensen said. \u201cBy and large, American companies are underinvesting for the future, and a lot of that has to do with either implicit or explicit pressure from activists.\u201dMr. Swensen has been particularly critical of Mr. Ackman\u2019s highly publicized investment in Valeant, which in recent years stirred national controversy after it dramatically raised the prices on drugs that it had bought the right to sell. \u201cThe excessive price increases abuse market power and create great profits, while burdening our health care system,\u201d he said. \u201cThe business model is at odds with sensible public policy. When Congress and the regulatory authorities catch on, the companies suffer,\u201d he said.A spokesman for Pershing Square, Francis McGill, said: \u201cPershing Square is a long-term investor which has improved the operations and performance of more than 30 corporations. It has never advocated short-term financial engineering techniques.\u201dFormer analysts describe how they learned to be careful observers of personality and engagement when vetting prospective money managers. \u201cWe learned to look for managers who know their portfolios well,\u201d said Paula J. Volent, senior vice president for investments at Bowdoin College. \u201cIf they have to look at a piece of paper in a meeting, then they don\u2019t really know.\u201dAnne Martin, a former Swensen intern who manages Wesleyan\u2019s endowment, described vetting one private equity fund. \u201cWe were near the end of the process. I worried that some of the terms were not fair, so I called the manager,\u201d she said, who adopted a dismissive tone. \u201cI am not adjusting the terms this time, and I am not going to talk to you about it,\u201d she recalled him saying.\u201cSo I thought: This is a partnership, and there will be tough times, so how will it be then?\u201d she said. Wesleyan didn\u2019t give him the money.Mr. Swensen\u2019s analysts have seen his standards prove costly to Yale. For instance, the endowment long had money with Michael Steinhardt, a well-known Wall Street trader, and it had been one of the school\u2019s most profitable investments. But in 1991, Mr. Steinhardt\u2019s firm was swept up in accusations of cornering the two-year Treasury market.The Steinhardt firm later settled, agreeing to pay $40 million without admitting wrongdoing. But Mr. Swensen had already taken Yale\u2019s money out that firm.That decision impressed D. Ellen Shuman, who worked at Yale from 1986 to 1998 and now runs Edgehill Endowment Partners, which manages $650 million for smaller endowments. \u201cDavid put the reputation of the institution ahead of profits,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really affected me in my career.\u201dNewcomers often arrive at the investment office from the Yale School of Management, as did Peter H. Ammon, now manager of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s endowment. But they take many routes. Seth Alexander, now head of M.I.T.\u2019s endowment, taught at the business school, but did not attend. Robert F. Wallace, who runs the Stanford endowment, was a ballet dancer before going to Yale to study economics. Ms. Volent, who oversees the Bowdoin endowment, planned to be a museum director.And Mr. Golden, head of Princeton\u2019s endowment, had an \u201cunsatisfying job at a small money management firm,\u201d he recalled. When he met Mr. Takahashi, Mr. Swensen\u2019s associate, Mr. Takahashi told him, \u201cIf you want to do good, we are looking for an intern.\u201d So Mr. Golden joined.Mr. Swensen says he is pleased when his analysts go to the nonprofit world. He never considered leaving Yale and was disappointed when, in 2007, Mohamed El-Erian quit as head of the Harvard endowment, after less than two years, to return to Pimco. \u201cManaging an endowment is a position of trust, not a steppingstone,\u201d Mr. Swensen said.Mr. El-Erian did not respond to a request for comment.Many Yale office graduates remain close, and they share investment ideas. Mr. Golden of Princeton said that when he finds good money managers, he prefers that they have other investors like Yale and Bowdoin, because they have similarly long time horizons.And when they do invest together, \u201cYale negotiates for everyone,\u201d said Ms. Volent. \u201cWe sit back and we let Yale do the hard work if the funds are too expensive.\u201dMs. Shuman said in real estate investments, Mr. Swensen required a fee structure \u201cwhere managers did not get any of the profits until there was a 6 percent hard return, or whatever number an investor could get from a passive investment at that time.\u201d The money managers objected \u2014 they wanted 20 percent on the entire profit \u2014 but lost. \u201cDavid\u2019s way is fairer,\u201d she said.Mr. Swensen likes teaming up to invest with his former analysts. For one thing, it can reduce the risk of panicky withdrawals. \u201cWe were talking to a manager who just had capital taken away because the fund had a bad year,\u201d Mr. Swensen recalled. \u201cThe investor said, \u2018Your five-year numbers are not so good, so we are firing you.\u2019 That sounds like the stupidest thing I ever heard,\u201d Mr. Swensen said.\u201cWhen managers have to deal with stupid limited partners, they are not spending their time picking stocks,\u201d he said.There have been mistakes. Yale and schools that embraced its model stumbled when the market plummeted in 2008 because they had so much of their portfolios tied up in hard-to-sell assets.Mr. Swensen acknowledges that, going into 2008, \u201cWe were too illiquid, and now we are not as illiquid. We want 50 percent of our assets in liquid investments,\u201d he said.The real estate meltdown took a toll. Yale, along with a host of universities, put money into real estate funds run by Lubert-Adler \u2014 the judgment call Mr. Swensen referred to as his \u201cbiggest mistake.\u201d When one of the funds suffered steep losses as a result of investments in troubled golf resort projects, many schools were hurt, including Yale.Not every Yale-trained manager agrees with Mr. Swensen\u2019s investment parameters. Bowdoin has nearly twice as much in absolute return funds (which focus on asset appreciation, as opposed to performance against an index or benchmark) because the hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller is on the Bowdoin investment committee and plays a role in picking managers.Ms. Volent of Bowdoin, whose returns have well outpaced the averages, pointed out that she has \u201ca lot of money in global macroeconomic funds.\u201d She added, \u201cThey have been great for us, but David hates that area. He thinks no one can anticipate changes in currencies and interest rates.\u201dOne might wonder about the value of Yale\u2019s investment philosophy when looking at the last year\u2019s performance. For the year ended June 30, a plain-vanilla portfolio of 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds outperformed more diversified portfolios (like those of endowments). However, over a 20-year run, Yale\u2019s average annual return has been 12.6 percent compared with 7.4 percent for the 60-40 portfolio.Mr. Swenson has no plans to alter his investment strategy, or to slow down. (He has been fighting cancer for four years, he said, and his condition is stable.) He remains convinced that diversification over the long term is crucial. \u201cThis is not a sprint,\u201d he said. \u201cI am pretty happy with the numbers.\u201dAn article last Sunday about David F. Swensen, who manages Yale University\u2019s endowment, misstated the role of a former colleague, Randy Kim, at the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation. Mr. Kim ran the investment department, not the foundation itself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Has Declared Climate War. But My Generation Will Win.", "Date": "2016-11-15", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorVANCOUVER, British Columbia \u2014 Donald J. Trump\u2019s positions on climate change amount to a declaration of war on young people like me. But millennials have a stronger position in this fight than it may first appear.There is no way to sugarcoat the consequences of what happened on Election Day. Mr. Trump is a disaster for the planet. His plan to \u201ccancel\u201d America\u2019s adherence to the Paris climate agreement and accelerate fossil fuel production threatens to destroy global momentum on climate change. At the international climate talks now taking place in Marrakesh, Morocco, American environmentalists cried upon learning of Mr. Trump\u2019s victory.I turned 30 a few months ago. I was in Paris last year for the historic climate agreement Mr. Trump now wants to abrogate. As I watched Mr. Trump win the presidency, I was tempted to abandon all the hope I\u2019d felt in France. He is ready to sacrifice my generation and all the others that will follow it for the limited, short-term economic payoff that comes with burning more fossil fuels.But I know something Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t, which lets me feel a glimmer of hope: People my age may be able to prevent him from making us pay for his mistakes. We have more power to stall, and perhaps defeat, his climate plan than our elders seem to be aware of.That\u2019s why Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to lift restrictions on oil, gas and coal production within his first 100 days in office may not accomplish much. North America\u2019s oil and gas companies do need people to work for them, but not the aging workers of coal country Mr. Trump made central to his campaign. Those companies need young people.Many of the industry\u2019s skilled workers are reaching retirement, and millennials have no interest in replacing them. Industry research suggests that less than 20 percent of the workers in the oil and gas industry in the United States are young people.This includes an acceleration of fossil-fuel divestment, a campaign that began in 2012 on several dozen college campuses in the United States and has continued to gain steam since. Major financial players are paying attention. The Swiss banking giant UBS calls the movement a \u201ccatalyst for change.\u201dFor Mr. Trump to succeed with his destructive environmental policies \u2014 and endanger my generation\u2019s future \u2014 he will have to reckon with this profound generational shift. If millennials continue to reject careers in oil and gas, swell the ranks of the divestment movement and do everything we can to keep fossil fuels in the ground, Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to repudiate the Paris agreement and expand drilling in the United States will become unfeasible.We are entering dark times, but with hope, creativity and effort, we don\u2019t have to let them define us.Geoff Dembicki is the author of the forthcoming \u201cAre We Screwed?

{"Headline": "These Officials Help Write Ballot Questions. Companies Write Them Checks.", "Date": "2016-11-04", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Big-money corporate lobbying has reached into one of the most obscure corners of state government: the offices of secretaries of state, the people charged with running elections impartially.The targeting of secretaries of state with campaign donations, corporate-funded weekend outings and secret meetings with industry lobbyists reflects an intense focus on often overlooked ballot questions, which the secretaries frequently help write.The ballot initiatives are meant to give voters a direct voice on policy issues such as the minimum wage and the environment. But corporate and other special interests are doing their best to build close ties with the secretaries because a difference of even a few words on a ballot measure can have an enormous impact on the outcome.The influence campaign has intensified, with more citizen-driven ballot initiatives to be decided on Election Day this year than at any time in the past decade.At a weekend retreat last month at a hunting lodge in Kansas, Republican secretaries of state mingled with donors, including a representative from Koch Industries, as they shot pheasant and clay pigeons. The owners of Koch Industries \u2014 Charles G. and David H. Koch \u2014 have funded groups involved in several ballot initiative fights this year, including over a solar energy measure in Florida.\u201cThe Koch brothers out with the Republican secretaries of state \u2014 that\u2019s a news story I don\u2019t need,\u201d Allen Richardson, a Koch lobbyist, joked, unaware that a reporter was in attendance.Groups aligned with Democrats have also targeted secretaries of state, mobilizing during the 2014 campaign to try to elect more officials sympathetic to their causes.The May meetings between industry officials and the Republican Secretaries of State Committee, a fund-raising group, were set up to give the industry players a chance to weigh in on ballot initiatives that the secretaries were overseeing, emails show.In 2015, the Republican State Leadership Committee \u2014 which includes secretaries of state, who are charged with ensuring fair and accurate elections \u2014 began a program to defeat liberal ballot initiatives on topics like the minimum wage, and to raise money from corporations that also wanted to kill these efforts. Here is a look at the push.She assured Ms. Cegavske that the meetings would be kept confidential.Some former secretaries of state said the new fund-raising tactics could hurt the image of the offices as impartial referees of state elections.\u201cIt is extremely important that the public trust their elections and have confidence they are going to be handled in a fair and impartial way,\u201d said Sam Reed, a former Republican secretary of state in Washington. \u201cAnd ballot issues in particular are very sensitive.\u201dWith billions at stake, major corporations routinely hire consulting firms to help them influence ballot initiatives.Another Lincoln executive, Ulrico Izaguirre, told attendees, as he ran through a long list of Election Day items before voters this year: \u201cThe clouds of ballot measures threaten business on a daily basis. Thunderous clouds.\u201dRepublicans have turned to initiatives to push their agenda as a counter to liberal activists, according to an internal party memo.The Republican organization that hosted the closed-door meetings in Washington is an arm of the Republican State Leadership Committee, a political group dedicated to electing candidates to state government posts.Ellie Hockenbury, a spokeswoman for the Republican State Leadership Committee, said the meetings and other conversations with donors were simply informational.And secretaries of state said their efforts to raise money had no impact on their actions as government officials.\u201cWhen you are trying to raise money, you try to work with people who have an interest in the subjects,\u201d said Wayne Williams, the Colorado secretary of state. He added, \u201cI will meet with anybody on any side of the subject at any time.\u201dBut Christin Fernandez, a spokeswoman for the restaurant association, acknowledged that the organization, at its headquarters in Washington, had expressed concerns to the secretaries of state about the minimum-wage ballot initiatives.\u201cAs a membership organization, the National Restaurant Association and our state partners meet with many different organizations on both sides of the aisle to voice the concerns,\u201d she said in a statement.Email records from Nevada show that the Republican fund-raising efforts are linked to ballot initiatives. A spreadsheet obtained from Ms. Cegavske includes a \u201ccontact list\u201d prepared by Ms. Keech, the Republican Secretaries of State Committee\u2019s executive director.Another target for a solicitation was NV Energy, which is facing a proposed constitutional amendment, requiring voter approval, to end the company\u2019s monopoly over much of the state\u2019s electricity market.Ms. Cegavske\u2019s executive assistant wrote back to Ms. Keech, reporting that the effort had generated some cash return.\u201cWhat great news!!!!\u201d Ms. Keech wrote back. \u201cThe Secretaries\u2019 contacts are ALWAYS better than ours.\u201dIn a statement, Ms. Cegavske said the suggestion that she had sought money from NV Energy because of the pending ballot initiative was \u201ccategorically false.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg said the donation was not related to any effort to influence future ballot measures.Labor union and abortion rights groups, however, were more explicit. The confidential memo drafted by veteran labor union organizers before the 2014 election \u2014 published last month by WikiLeaks as part of the cache of emails stolen from Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta \u2014 said those groups were prepared to support the effort.\u201cThe office of Secretary of State is playing an increasingly important role for progressives,\u201d the memo said, noting its \u201cpivotal roles in the ballot initiative process.\u201dThe impact of these donations and private gatherings on actions by secretaries of state is difficult to gauge, given the dozens of small language changes as the ballot measures are being prepared for Election Day. But there are hints of possible benefits.For example, a gun control initiative on the Nevada ballot next week was framed by the secretary of state as a measure that would \u201cprohibit\u201d firearm transfers without background checks, rather than as a required additional step before a gun sale could take place.This is a seemingly small but important difference that gun control supporters say makes the ballot item less palatable to voters.\u201cThere was no input from the gun industry in the writing of the ballot question,\u201d Gail J. Anderson, the deputy secretary for Southern Nevada, said in a statement.After a minimum-wage campaign accelerated last year in Ohio, emails show, Jon A. Husted, the secretary of state, communicated with an Ohio Chamber of Commerce affiliate as the business group discussed plans with the restaurant industry to \u201cmeet and strategize\u201d about its opposition effort.A spokesman for Mr. Husted said that \u201cthe amendment and referendum processes can be cumbersome\u201d and that \u201cthe secretary is often asked to come explain precisely how it works.\u201dAt the three-day hunt \u2014 where corporate donors and secretaries of state from Kansas, Mississippi, Georgia and Arkansas shared a one-story, wood-frame hunting lodge, with stuffed deer and elk antlers mounted on the walls \u2014 there was little discussion of formal election matters.Instead, it was an opportunity for the corporate executives to cement personal connections. Together, they set loose Labrador retrievers on acres of prime high-grass hunting grounds, flushing pheasants and quail from their hiding spots.\u201cI was 60 yards away,\u201d Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, said as he showed off two prairie chickens he had shot earlier in the day.After a dinner of shredded beef, the state officials and political contributors, some in pajamas, drank beers. The only apparent disappointment the next morning, after their first hunting outing together as a group, was that they had bagged only 58 birds, two short of their legal limit.\u201cThe two that got away,\u201d Mr. Kobach said.\u201cWe\u2019ll get \u2019em tomorrow,\u201d said one of the corporate executives.Eric Lipton reported from Washington, and Robert Faturechi from Downs, Kan., and New York.

{"Headline": "Volkswagen Parts Ways With the Historian Who Chronicled Its Nazi Past", "Date": "2016-11-02", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 Volkswagen has been struggling for a year to repair the damage caused by a scandal over its cover-up of diesel emissions, promising honesty and transparency. Now historians are accusing the company of reverting to secretive ways on a different subject: the Nazi past of German automakers.Over the past 18 years, Volkswagen became something of a pioneer in revealing the company\u2019s employment of thousands of forced laborers during World War II. But it has abruptly parted ways with the company historian who helped make that possible.When the historian\u2019s contract abruptly ended this week, an angry open letter signed by 75 prominent German academics accused Volkswagen of a vindictive punishment. The historian, Manfred Grieger, and the company have declined to comment on the circumstances behind his departure, citing a mutual agreement to end his contract.But the mystery over precisely why Mr. Grieger left \u2014 and whether he was dismissed \u2014 has complicated Volkswagen\u2019s effort to regain public trust, and risks stirring up a dark chapter in company history.The apparent catalyst for Mr. Grieger\u2019s departure was his critical review almost a year ago of a 518-page study of the World War II labor practices of Audi, a VW subsidiary. The review \u2014 and the study, published in 2014 \u2014 gained scant attention until a leading German business weekly, Wirtschaftswoche, mentioned both in late August.\u201cJust this brief discussion in an academic journal then led to talk that Grieger be put on a short leash and limited in his academic freedom, which in turn led the prominent historian to leave,\u201d according to the open letter from the historians. It expressed doubt that the company would continue to pursue other inquiries into its past, in particular over allegations of collaboration with the military leaders of Brazil in the 1970s.In a statement issued on Tuesday, Volkswagen strongly denied that Mr. Grieger had been dismissed, or that his separation signaled a changing approach.\u201cThe fact is that Volkswagen continues to recognize the achievements of Dr. Grieger and to thank him for the work performed,\u201d the statement read. \u201cFurthermore, the fact is that Volkswagen has examined its history as an enterprise consistently, honestly and strongly, and will continue to do so.\u201dMr. Grieger was a co-author of an exhaustive study published in 1996 that exposed how Volkswagen had made extensive use of forced labor during World War II, when its factory in Wolfsburg, Germany, produced an array of weapons and military equipment.The book, more than 1,000 pages by Mr. Grieger and another historian, Hans Mommsen, was financed by Volkswagen at a time when many German companies were coming to terms with their roles during the Nazi era.But Volkswagen may have gotten more truth than it had anticipated. The book also uncovered embarrassing information about the Porsche and Pi\u00ebch families, who since 2012 have owned a majority of the carmaker\u2019s voting stock.The Wolfsburg factory, still Volkswagen\u2019s main manufacturing center, was originally a Nazi prestige project built under the supervision of Ferdinand Porsche, designer of the car that later became famous as the Beetle. The factory produced military goods including land mines, parts for rockets fired at British cities, hand-held anti-tank weapons and a Jeep-like vehicle known as the K\u00fcbelwagen.Volkswagen was especially dependent on workers press-ganged from occupied countries or borrowed from concentration camps, including Auschwitz, because it was a new company with a limited work force of its own.While conditions at the factory were slightly better than in the concentration camps, inmates were overseen by SS guards and were poorly fed and frequently beaten or shot for minor infractions. Children born to forced laborers were taken away and housed in a squalid nursery overseen by an SS doctor, where 365 of the infants died.Hartmut Berghoff, a professor at the Institute of Economic and Social History at the Georg-August University in G\u00f6ttingen, was the driving force behind the open letter challenging Volkswagen over Mr. Grieger\u2019s departure. He said it showed a tone-deafness similar to the company\u2019s initial approach to the emissions scandal. \u201cTransparency in reacting to the public is not really the strength of VW,\u201d Mr. Berghoff said in a telephone interview.In its statement, Volkswagen said the company regretted that Mr. Berghoff had not responded to its offer of talks on the matter, which a spokesman, Eric Felber, said had been made last week.Mr. Berghoff said an email from Volkswagen had gone into his spam folder, so he learned of the offer too late before the academics\u2019 letter appeared.He questioned whether Volkswagen officials respected Mr. Grieger\u2019s work. \u201cWhy then did they part with him?\u201d he asked.The 75 historians are not the only people upset by Mr. Grieger\u2019s departure. Last week, a former Volkswagen board member and workers\u2019 representative, Walter Hiller, described it as \u201ca scandal.\u201dAnd on Tuesday, two more historians specializing in the behavior of German companies during the Nazi era issued a sharp rebuke on the website of Wirtschaftswoche, the business weekly. By parting with Mr. Grieger, they said, Volkswagen was \u201cdisposing of an enlightener.\u201dVolkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.It all shows \u201cclearly how communication has gone awry at the top of VW,\u201d said the historians, Lutz Budrass of Ruhr-University Bochum and Mark Spoerer from the University of Regensburg.In his review of the study of Audi\u2019s past, Mr. Grieger criticized the authors as having played down the company\u2019s cooperation with the Nazis and its employment of forced laborers.After publication of his landmark book, \u201cDas Volkswagenwerk und seine Arbeiter im Dritten Reich\u201d (The Volkswagen Works and Its Workers During the Third Reich), Mr. Grieger oversaw the Volkswagen company archives. He made them freely available to researchers and journalists \u2014 a surprising decision at a company long known for caution about what information it makes public.During World War II, Mr. Porsche oversaw construction and management of the factory with help from his son-in-law, Anton Pi\u00ebch. Mr. Pi\u00ebch\u2019s son Hans Michel Pi\u00ebch is currently a member of the Volkswagen supervisory board. Another son, Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch, is a former Volkswagen chief executive who remains a major shareholder.At the end of World War II, according to Mr. Mommsen and Mr. Grieger, Anton Pi\u00ebch commanded a unit of the so-called Volkssturm, a poorly armed citizens\u2019 militia ordered to make a last-ditch defense against invading Allies.After leading his Volkssturm troops to the front, according to Mr. Grieger\u2019s and Mr. Mommsen\u2019s book, Mr. Pi\u00ebch retreated to the Porsche family estate in Austria. He took about 10 million Reichsmarks of company funds, worth about $1 million at the time, according to the book.The family used the money to revive the family engineering bureau, which later evolved into Porsche, the sports car maker, according to the book. The family said that Volkswagen had owed the bureau the funds for work that had been performed.Ferdinand Porsche and Anton Pi\u00ebch were held by the Allies for nearly two years after the German surrender, but were never charged with war crimes. Mr. Porsche died in 1951 and Mr. Pi\u00ebch in 1952.Alison Smale reported from Berlin, and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Dwayne O. Andreas, Who Turned Archer Daniels Midland Into Food Giant, Dies at 98", "Date": "2016-11-16", "News": "Supported byThe company confirmed his death.No farm industrialist of the 20th century navigated the world\u2019s seats of power as easily as Mr. Andreas. He was as familiar to heads of state in Washington, Moscow and London as almost any top American diplomat. Slim and slight as a jockey, he achieved outsize stature in the White House, in Congress and among the agencies and councils of influence that are critical to an industry so mightily swayed by government authority.Sometimes he and his company ran afoul of those authorities. One federal investigation led to a $100 million fine in 1996 for fixing prices, a record penalty in a criminal antitrust case at the time.But more often he courted and was courted by some of the world\u2019s most powerful political figures. During the nearly 30 years he controlled the company, he and A.D.M. were among the most generous financiers of congressional and presidential campaigns, Democratic and Republican alike.At the same time, the company, based in Decatur, was helping to feed nearly every American and billions more people around the world. Archer Daniels Midland\u2019s high-fructose corn syrup sweetened soft drinks. Its soybeans and feed additives increased milk production and fattened hogs, cattle and chickens. It manufactured cocoa and cocoa butter for chocolates and cakes. Its corn ethanol fueled vehicles.The scale of the global enterprise that Mr. Andreas built had few equals. In 1970, when he was named chairman and chief executive, Archer Daniels Midland\u2019s soybean exports totaled $1.5 billion. By 1999, when he retired as chairman, the figure was $7 billion, and the company was the biggest processor in the industry.The company, founded in 1902 by George A. Archer and John W. Daniels as a linseed-crushing business (it acquired the Midland Linseed Products Company in 1923), grew almost tenfold under Mr. Andreas\u2019s watch. In 1999, it employed more than 23,000 people and operated in 50 countries.Today, A.D.M. controls much of the world\u2019s cocoa, wheat, corn, soybean and oil seed production.\u201cThe food business is far and away the most important business in the world,\u201d Mr. Andreas once said. \u201cEverything else is a luxury.\u201dFor viewers of American public affairs television, the company under Mr. Andreas became a household name. Calling itself \u201cthe supermarket to the world,\u201d it was a prominent advertiser on ABC\u2019s Sunday morning political talk show \u201cThis Week With David Brinkley\u201d and a leading underwriter of \u201cThe MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour\u201d on PBS.Mr. Andreas often said that the central objective of his life was to provide food for the world\u2019s hungry. In the 1950s he pressed members of Congress to support the Food for Peace grain-export program; President John F. Kennedy appointed him to the American Food for Peace Council. (In 1978, the company was convicted of fixing prices on grain sold to the program, though Mr. Andreas was not charged.)Mr. Andreas counted among his friends Presidents Richard M. Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, as well as the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. He worked with all of them to open and expand farm export markets, particularly for soybeans. He was largely responsible for making soybeans a top American agricultural export.As he cultivated political connections, Mr. Andreas was courted in return. In 1984, while seeking re-election, Reagan visited the company\u2019s headquarters in Decatur. Mr. Andreas commissioned a seven-foot bronze statue of the president to commemorate the event.Several members of Mr. Andreas\u2019s family held senior positions at the company or served on its board, and he and they controlled nearly 8 percent of its publicly traded shares, ranking them among the wealthiest families in the United States.Mr. Andreas kept a low public profile, rarely giving interviews. His circumspection was appreciated by the many heads of state with whom he met on overseas trips; they sometimes relied on him to carry out diplomatic missions discreetly. In 1985 he helped arrange the first meeting between Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev.He was particularly close to Nixon, who opened China\u2019s markets to A.D.M.\u2019s grain. In 1972, an anonymous $25,000 cash gift from Mr. Andreas to Nixon\u2019s campaign ended up in the bank account of Bernard Barker, a Watergate burglar. According to the sworn testimony of Rosemary Woods, the president\u2019s secretary, an additional $100,000 cash contribution that Mr. Andreas had made to the president was found unspent in a White House safe and returned to him.Mr. Andreas\u2019s lavish campaign spending attracted powerful adversaries. The Justice Department investigated him and A.D.M. four times in the 1970s. In 1974, he was acquitted of federal charges of making an illegal $100,000 contribution to Hubert H. Humphrey\u2019s 1968 presidential campaign. The acquittal came the same year that the Senate Watergate committee criticized the handling of a $362,000 donation of Archer Daniels Midland stock that Mr. Andreas had made to Humphrey\u2019s 1972 primary campaign.Another federal investigation, in the 1990s, led to the company\u2019s record $100 million fine in a global price-fixing conspiracy. Three top executives \u2014 one of them Mr. Andreas\u2019s only son, Michael, the vice chairman \u2014 were convicted in 1998 and sentenced to prison. Mr. Andreas had been granted immunity from prosecution.Mr. Andreas was also a significant contributor to the senatorial and presidential campaigns of Senator Bob Dole, the Kansas Republican. Mr. Dole was the architect and primary supporter of the federally subsidized ethanol fuel market and the federal price-support program for sugar. Both government efforts heavily influenced the corn and high-fructose corn syrup processing business, which earned A.D.M. billions in revenue each year.Fred Wertheimer, the former director of Common Cause, the public interest advocacy group, called Mr. Andreas\u2019s political activities \u201ca classic example of how the corporate welfare game in Washington works.\u201d\u201cHe provides huge amounts of political influence money,\u201d Mr. Wertheimer told The Washington Post in 1995, \u201cand his company receives huge economic benefits, courtesy of the American taxpayer.\u201dMr. Andreas defended his political contributions as a necessary investment in business. He referred to the practice as \u201ctithing,\u201d likening it to his family\u2019s donations to their Mennonite church when he was growing up in Iowa.\u201cI was raised to believe you\u2019re supposed to support your mayor and your congressman and your politicians,\u201d he told The New York Times in 1990. Five years later, in testimony before a Senate Agriculture subcommittee, he said, \u201cWhen it comes to agriculture, there is no such thing as the free market.\u201dDwayne Orville Andreas was born in Worthington, Minn., on March 4, 1918, the fifth of six children of Reuben and Lydia Andreas. His father moved the family to Lisbon, Iowa, where he purchased a grain elevator and raised livestock on a small farm. Dwayne began working at the elevator when he was 9.The family changed the name of the business from Reuben & Sons to Honeymead Products in 1936. Three years later they moved it to Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where they built a processing plant to manufacture soybean meal for feed. By this time Mr. Andreas had briefly attended Wheaton College in Illinois, and his younger brother Lowell had become active in the business. (Lowell Andreas was later president of Archer Daniels Midland. He died in 2009.)Honeymead became one of the largest soybean processors in the country. In 1945, after Reuben Andreas suffered several strokes, the family sold the plant, but not the Honeymead name, to the private Minnesota-based grain company Cargill.Dwayne Andreas went to work for Cargill as a vice president. That year he met and befriended Humphrey, who had just been elected mayor of Minneapolis. Humphrey became a political mentor to Mr. Andreas and the godfather of his son, Michael; Mr. Andreas became a major donor to Humphrey\u2019s Senate and presidential campaigns.In 1947, Dwayne and Lowell Andreas bought a soybean plant in Mankato, Minn., and named it the Honeymead Products Company. That same year, Dwayne married Dorothy Inez, a single mother of a little girl.Mr. Andreas\u2019s wife died a few years ago. He is survived by his son; two daughters, Terry Andreas and Sandra McMurtrie; nine grandchildren; and 23 great-grandchildren.By 1952, Mr. Andreas had resigned from Cargill to help his brother run Honeymead. They turned it into the largest soybean processor in the nation.In 1960 a larger company, Farmers Union Grain Terminal Association, bought out the brothers for a sum large enough to enable them to start a banking company, which became National City Bank. Farmers Union then hired Dwayne as executive vice president, while Lowell managed the banking business.Dwayne Andreas was 48 in 1966 and already a well-known Minnesota grain merchant when the Archer and Daniels families asked him and his brother to become executives and minority shareholders in their midsize farm products company. Lowell became president in 1967; Dwayne became chief executive in 1970 and then chairman. He stepped down as chief executive in 1997; two years later he also stepped down as chairman, succeeded by a nephew, G. Allen Andreas.Though much of Mr. Andreas\u2019s access to power stemmed from his political contributions, another source of influence was in Bal Harbour, Fla., where in the early 1950s he helped found the Sea View Hotel, a cooperative.Having bought an apartment there (he also continued to live in Decatur), he recruited others to do the same, among them Senator Dole; Thomas P. O\u2019Neill, the House speaker; Howard H. Baker Jr., the Senate Republican leader; Robert S. Strauss, the Democratic power broker and at one point an Archer Daniels Midland board member; Thomas E. Dewey, the former governor of New York; and David Brinkley, a close friend, who, after retiring from ABC, was criticized for doing television commercials for the company.In January 1994, Senator Dole, while being interviewed by Mr. Brinkley for \u201cThis Week\u201d from his Sea View apartment, invited Mr. Brinkley to \u201ccome on down.\u201d In an odd bit of serendipity, the interview was followed by a commercial for Archer Daniels Midland.Daniel E.

{"Headline": "Trump and Congress Both Want Tax Cuts. The Question Is Which Ones.", "Date": "2016-11-12", "News": "Supported bySeveral economic issues divide many Republicans in Congress from Donald J. Trump, the Republican president-elect. Free trade versus tariffs to limit imports. Immigration reform versus a border wall. Cutting Social Security and other benefit programs versus protecting them.But one economic matter unites just about every member of the Republican party: support for tax cuts, particularly for those at the top of the income ladder.\u201cTax reform is the thing that always unites Republicans,\u201d said William Gale, a co-director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and a former economic adviser to President George H.W. Bush. \u201cI would guess that that\u2019s Item 1 on the congressional agenda.\u201dHouse Republicans already have a fairly detailed blueprint for Congress and the White House to follow.\u201cMy sense is that Trump doesn\u2019t really have the details of a tax reform package that he wants,\u201d Mr. Gale said. \u201cHe has broad ideas, and then the Congress will go at it and pin down the details. The House blueprint seems like the place to start and may be fairly close to where they finish.\u201dThat does not mean Mr. Trump will not have his own ideas. Mr. Gale expects a Trump White House to insist on continuing a deduction for interest paid on debt-financed projects, a provision dear to real estate developers. (The House plan proposes ending the deduction, instead allowing businesses to immediately deduct expenses and investments.)While sweeping tax cuts were never a crusading theme of Mr. Trump\u2019s, they have long been near the top of Mr. Ryan\u2019s agenda. And Mr. Trump has suggested he would be happy to let Congress take the lead.There is certainly a significant overlap. Both would cut income tax rates across the board and keep rates low on income from investments, an approach intended to spur savings that effectively guarantees the juiciest cuts for the wealthy.Lowering the tax on capital gains \u2014 which also benefits the wealthy the most \u2014 draws wide support among the leadership headed for both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue in 2017 as well.Republicans say they also want to provide some tax cuts for those lower on the income ladder. Senator Marco Rubio, who was re-elected to represent Florida after his failed presidential bid, favors increasing the child tax credit; Mr. Ryan, who is working closely with Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, supports expanding the earned-income tax credit to poor working families without children. Mr. Trump has suggested he wants to provide tax cuts to two-income families with children as well.For all the similarities, there are important differences as well. The biggest contrast between Mr. Trump\u2019s and Mr. Ryan\u2019s tax approaches can be seen on the corporate side, where they differ on how to tax capital investment and debt. They also differ on the proposed tax rate for most small businesses.The most compelling target for business tax reform is the roughly $2.6 trillion that American corporations like Apple, General Electric, Microsoft and Pfizer have kept abroad on an extended tax holiday, out of the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s reach.\u201cEveryone agrees that the foreign tax situation is ludicrous because it doesn\u2019t raise any revenue and keeps several trillion dollars abroad,\u201d said Robert Pozen, a senior lecturer at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management.Mr. Trump has said he was determined to get multinational companies to pay their American tax bills every year, although the sting would not be as great since he would also cut corporate rates and allow credits for foreign taxes paid.By contrast, the House Republicans have been pushing for what is known as a territorial system, which would tax all businesses solely on what goods and services they sold in the United States.The flaw in a territorial approach, Mr. Pozen and other economists have pointed out, is that it encourages businesses to shop the world for lower tax rates, ultimately shifting even more profits and jobs overseas.\u201cWhy is that good for a president who wants to have more jobs and more facilities in the U.S.?\u201d Mr. Pozen asked. \u201cI don\u2019t see how you can reconcile those goals under a territorial system.\u201dMr. Pozen favors a global minimum tax that every American business would have to pay. Companies that shift their tax home or try to funnel more profits through low-tax nations would nonetheless be required to make up the difference between that rate and the minimum by paying the United States Treasury.However part of that stash is recaptured, there is a broad consensus in Congress that some of the new revenue should be used to invest in repairing and improving public infrastructure. Mr. Trump spoke of spending $1 trillion over 10 years on roads, bridges, waterways and airports, although he said he planned to rely primarily on tax credits for private companies, equity investments and privately raised debt.Linking international reform to infrastructure funding could work, said Janice Mays, a former staff director of the Ways and Means Committee who is now a managing director at the tax and accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. \u201cI do think Trump wants to do infrastructure, to help people get jobs and stimulate the economy.\u201dBut as a longtime veteran of budget and tax battles on Capitol Hill, Ms. Mays warned that obstacles continually pop up in both expected and unexpected places. The size of the projected deficit from the various tax-cutting plans \u2014 as much as $7 trillion over a decade \u2014 could set off an internal war among Republicans who favor restraining spending on Social Security, Medicare and benefit programs for the poor and those, like Mr. Trump, who say they want to prevent the blue-collar families who flocked to his campaign from losing government programs that help keep them above water.\u201cI just think they may be a little optimistic at the moment,\u201d Ms. Mays said.Follow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "David Chang Bets Big, Using Silicon Valley Money", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byBut Mr. Chang says Ando is part of a larger plan: to create a more sustainable model for restaurants in a time of rising costs and slim profit margins, and to pay workers well in an industry known for low wages. He says he plans to expand beyond New York, building a business to dwarf all of his previous accomplishments.In Silicon Valley, where most venture investors are, that kind of money signals an intention to create a mass-market business, an ambition that statistically is more likely to end in failure than in the next Facebook. There\u2019s a reason venture money is called risk capital.The move is a big departure for a man who has famously eschewed outside money from anyone but friends and family.\u201cI got into the restaurant business not to make money on other people\u2019s terms,\u201d Mr. Chang, 39, said in a recent interview in San Francisco.It also shows how start-ups are seen as this era\u2019s path to riches. In 2000, with the stock market surging, cabdrivers offered up hot technology stock tips. In 2007, when real estate was booming, civilians became property developers and home flippers. And in 2016, with venture money flooding into young tech start-ups, everyone has an app and harbors Uber-style ambitions. Even Mr. Chang.Last year, venture investors poured more than $4 billion into food delivery start-ups globally, according to the reseach firm CB Insights. Several delivery-only restaurants sprouted in American cities with the promise of saving owners money by requiring less square footage and removing the need for waiters. Mr. Chang said he could use those savings to pay his cooks more. But some start-ups have struggled. A San Francisco service called SpoonRocket went out of business last spring. Others, like Munchery in New York, San Francisco and other cities, have slowed.Ms. Green made early investments in Dollar Shave Club, which was sold to Unilever for $1 billion in July, and in Jet.com, which was sold to Walmart for $3.3 billion in August. She said she hoped for nothing less from Ando.\u201cHopefully we\u2019ll make a big successful business, and then we\u2019ll look for a liquidity event,\u201d Ms. Green said. A \u201cliquidity event\u201d is Silicon Valley parlance for one of three outcomes: listing the company on the stock market, selling the business or letting a private equity firm buy out early investors.Mr. Chang has expressed some ambivalence about the possibility of cashing out. \u201cThere have been numerous occasions where we\u2019ve turned down lucrative offers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t after the almighty dollar. We were on our own path.\u201dBy now many Americans know the legend of Mr. Chang, the enfant terrible who transformed from ramen purveyor to Michelin-starred chef in just five years.Even as he enjoyed unusually quick success, he remained obsessed with the specter of failure. Each endeavor was born of an impetuous desire to start something new, followed by months of anxiety and painstaking sweating over every detail.Mr. Chang has a voracious appetite for growth. He sees it as the answer to many of the restaurant industry\u2019s most intractable challenges, including the stratospheric cost of real estate and the struggle to pay talented chefs a living wage in expensive cities.But it\u2019s hard for star chefs to grow without losing their excellence, edge or attention to detail.But Mr. Chang said he realizes that he will always have critics, even within his own organization. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve not come to grips with is, there\u2019s no more decisions to be made where everyone wins,\u201d he said.Ando is a simple concept, the kind that tends to underpin businesses that deliver big wins for venture investors. Mr. Chang founded it last fall to create dishes like fried chicken or cold spicy noodles with pork that can stand up, and even improve, under the logistical constraints of delivery.He began with one kitchen, in Midtown, and delivers only to that part of New York. He said it was unclear when and how Ando would expand.Also, Ando has not embraced Silicon Valley\u2019s \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d ethos. Take, for example, cheese sauce, a single component of the restaurant\u2019s NYC Cheesesteak.\u201cWe saw the cheese started sogging up the bread and we had to change the recipe,\u201d Mr. Basil said. \u201cThen we thought, let\u2019s put hozon in it\u201d \u2014 Momofuku\u2019s chickpea sauce. \u201cThis is great,\u201d he added. \u201cBut the hozon affected the pH of the cheese sauce and made it looser, a soggier sandwich.\u201cThen we had to figure out how to thicken it up. Then we added calcium to bring the pH up and a little bit of carrageenan. Now it travels extremely well. But it took us four months to work on this one component.\u201dThe Ando menu is still growing, and it\u2019s likely that the items at any future location will vary, adding another layer of complexity. And there is the push and pull between venture capital\u2019s data-driven culture and the instinctive way that chefs work.\u201cDave has an ability to zero in on things that people really love, not because he\u2019s got a huge computer,\u201d said Andrew Salmon, Mr. Chang\u2019s business partner in Momofuku.He said they were wary of outside money until they were introduced to Expa, which ultimately co-founded Ando and put seed money into it. \u201cDave and I were always convinced that if anything was worth doing, we\u2019d have to do it with the money we had in the bank,\u201d he said.But left to their own devices, he said, they could never have built Ando without Silicon Valley-style money and expertise.Ms. Green, of Forerunner Ventures, said she has faith in Mr. Chang, calling him the sort of formidable entrepreneur who has all of the traits for breakout success: a record of accomplishments, paranoia, expertise and grit.She is not daunted by his creative temperament. \u201cWe think about scaling a business over the course of many years,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have time to evaluate customer data and understand how to drive repeat business.\u201d There\u2019s a reason venture money is also called patient capital.Mr. Chang said that he was not sure what Ando may look like in a year or two, but that he was certain \u201ca sea change is going to happen in the food world.\u201d\u201cHow the restaurant industry at large has operated will not work moving forward,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cost structure just doesn\u2019t work. I don\u2019t know what the answers will be, but I\u2019m not going to stand idle.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Donald Trump Likely to End Aid for Rebels Fighting Syrian Government", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump said Friday that he was likely to abandon the American effort to support \u201cmoderate\u201d opposition groups in Syria who are battling the government of President Bashar al-Assad, saying \u201cwe have no idea who these people are.\u201dIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal that dealt largely with economic issues, including his willingness to retain parts of the Affordable Care Act, he repeated a position he took often during his campaign: that the United States should focus on defeating the Islamic State, and find common ground with the Syrians and their Russian backers.\u201cI\u2019ve had an opposite view of many people regarding Syria,\u201d Mr. Trump told The Journal. \u201cMy attitude was you\u2019re fighting Syria, Syria is fighting ISIS, and you have to get rid of ISIS. Russia is now totally aligned with Syria, and now you have Iran, which is becoming powerful, because of us, is aligned with Syria.\u201dHis comments suggest that once Mr. Trump begins overseeing both the public support for the opposition groups, and a far larger covert effort run by the Central Intelligence Agency, he may wind down or abandon the effort. But there are in fact two wars going on simultaneously in Syria.One is against the Islamic State, in which the United States is supporting 30,000 Syrian-Kurdish and Syrian-Arab fighters, who last weekend announced they were opening a new phase of the battle, beginning to encircle the ISIS capital in Raqqa. There are roughly 300 United States Special Operations forces on the ground assisting these militia.The second effort is in support of rebels fighting Mr. Assad. The C.I.A. covert program is by far the largest conduit of support, providing antitank missiles to rebels fighting the government. That is the program that Mr. Trump seems most intent on ending. If the United States pursues that line, \u201cWe end up fighting Russia, fighting Syria,\u201d Mr. Trump told The Journal.The argument for ending the support may be bolstered by the fact that, as a matter of survival, those opposition groups have entered into battlefield alliances with the affiliate of Al Qaeda in Syria, formerly known as Al Nusra. This has had the effect of allowing Mr. Assad and Russia to argue that they are attacking Al Qaeda, and the United States should aid them in that effort. Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged that argument during his ultimately failed effort to reach a deal for a cease-fire and an ultimate settlement.Mr. Trump\u2019s the-enemy-of-my-enemy-is-my-friend logic is consistent with what he said during the campaign. \u201cI\u2019m not saying Assad is a good man, \u2018cause he\u2019s not,\u201d he told The New York Times in an interview in March, \u201cbut our far greater problem is not Assad, it\u2019s ISIS.\u201dBut it also takes a position that will gratify President Vladimir V. Putin, because it suggests that rather than pressure Russia to end its support of Mr. Assad, a Trump administration will get out of Mr. Putin\u2019s way.In another hint of a major change in policy, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s primary national security advisers, Lt. General Michael T. Flynn, the retired head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, wrote in The Hill newspaper this week that the United States should extradite Fethullah Gulen who Turkey has demanded should be sent back from his exile in Pennsylvania. The Turkish government of Recep Tayyip Erdogan has blamed him for a coup attempt over the summer.The Justice Department has not yet concluded that there is any convincing evidence that Mr. Gulen should be sent back to almost certain confinement or execution under an extradition treaty with the United States. They see the request as part of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s effort to eliminate all opposition.Mr. Flynn adopted many of Turkey\u2019s arguments about Mr. Gulen, arguing that \u201cAmerican taxpayers are helping finance Gulen\u2019s 160 charter schools\u201d in the United States, and that it is more important to support Turkey than be \u201choodwinked by this masked source of terror and instability nestled comfortably in our own backyard.\u201dEric Schmitt contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump-Size Idea for a New President: Build Something Inspiring", "Date": "2016-11-17", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseHere\u2019s how President-elect Trump could unify a bitterly divided America, provide well-paying jobs to many of the millions of disaffected workers who voted for him, and lift the economy, stock market and tax rolls.All he needs to do is what he presumably does best: build something.And I don\u2019t mean a few miles of asphalt or a paint job on a rusting bridge.Build something awe-inspiring. Something Americans can be proud of. Something that will repay the investment many times over for generations to come.All of these are Depression-era public works projects that are still in use.In fairness to Mr. Obama, Republicans in Congress bitterly opposed his public works spending plans, and he lamented there were too few \u201cshovel ready\u201d projects.That didn\u2019t stop Franklin Delano Roosevelt. His Public Works Administration and Works Progress Administration, using combinations of public and private money, solicited proposals from states and cities, hired millions of workers and eventually built 78,000 bridges, 650,000 miles of roads, 700 miles of airport runways, 13,000 playgrounds and 125,000 military and civilian buildings, including more than 40,000 schools \u2014 in most cases to high standards of quality and design.The federal government built the La Guardia, Ronald Reagan Washington National and Los Angeles International airports, the Upper Mississippi locks and dams, the Bonneville power project on the Columbia River, the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge in New York, and the Florida Keys Overseas Highway. Most are still in use today. To a large degree, this is the infrastructure that made America great, to borrow Mr. Trump\u2019s catchphrase.What Roosevelt accomplished \u201cis astounding,\u201d said Scott Myers-Lipton, a sociology professor at San Jose State University and author of the books \u201cRebuild America: Solving the Economic Crisis Through Civic Works\u201d and \u201cEnding Extreme Inequality.\u201dBut it\u2019s not so much the numbers people remember today. \u201cMost people just know there was an alphabet soup of organizations,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat they see and remember are the landmarks: the Bay Bridge, Reagan National Airport or the baseball stadium in San Jose. We\u2019re living on that legacy today.\u201dRepealing Obamacare, lowering taxes for businesses and mostly wealthy people, overhauling the immigration system and privatizing Medicare \u2014 what congressional Republicans have cited as their top legislative priorities \u2014 would be divisive in a nation bitterly split along partisan and geographic lines. But nearly everyone agrees that America has grossly neglected its infrastructure even as the rest of the world, notably China, has raced ahead.Who could disagree? Hillary Clinton also called for a big increase in infrastructure spending.\u201cThe single best thing the federal government can do to promote economic growth is to repair and build the transportation network, the highways, railroads and airports,\u201d said Roger Noll, an emeritus professor of economics at Stanford and a senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research. \u201cIt\u2019s been neglected for 30 years.\u201d\u201cI was trying to see if this was really a crisis or a media sensation,\u201d he told me this week from California, where he\u2019s working on the state\u2019s high-speed rail project. \u201cI found out it\u2019s pretty dire in terms of total infrastructure. For a nation that leads the world in global trade, our systems are failing.\u201dPulling off something on the scale of the Depression-era public works programs would be no small feat. Recent federal infrastructure efforts, including reconstruction after Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, as well as the Obama stimulus program, hardly inspire confidence.Alan Brinkley, a professor of history at Columbia, said he doubted Mr. Trump could replicate Roosevelt\u2019s achievements. \u201cRoosevelt had a coherent mission, if not always a consistent way to address the Depression and the economic crisis,\u201d Mr. Brinkley said. \u201cHe was eclectic in his approach because he was pragmatic.\u201dEven more important, \u201cRoosevelt was informed, surrounded himself with informed people, and was prepared on Day 1 to begin. I\u2019m not sure that Trump\u2019s policies go beyond his electioneering slogans,\u201d Mr. Brinkley said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid a new P.W.A.,\u201d he added, referring to the Public Works Administration, \u201cwill stand for Promises Without Actions.\u201dBut in the spirit of magnanimity, let\u2019s give Mr. Trump the benefit of the doubt, as Mr. Obama has suggested. He\u2019ll need his own versions of Harold L. Ickes, Roosevelt\u2019s interior secretary, who ran the P.W.A., and his close adviser Harry L. Hopkins, who ran the W.P.A.So where should President Trump start?For a sense of what might be possible, I asked Mr. McNichol to pretend he had just been tapped as Mr. Trump\u2019s new infrastructure czar and to come up with a list of his top 10 infrastructure projects, balanced between red and blue states. Most are shovel-ready, or close to it. Here\u2019s what he suggested, along with estimated costs:Cost: $23.9 billionCost: $65 billionAmerica\u2019s first modern high-speed rail project would connect San Francisco and Los Angeles, about 400 miles apart, in under three hours.Cost: $2.1 billionA rebounding Detroit needs another link to Canada. The privately owned Ambassador Bridge, which connects Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, serves over three million vehicles a year and is one of the busiest border crossings in North America.Cost: $3 billionSeven new sewage and water tunnels would rescue Cleveland\u2019s antiquated lines, which are overwhelmed by even moderate rainfall and feed contaminated water into Lake Erie. Picture pristine beaches and fishing, swimming and kayaking along a rejuvenated North Coast.Cost: $100 billionTraveling at 300 miles per hour on a cushion of air, magnetically levitated trains could cut the commute from New York to Washington to an hour and render the painfully slow Acela obsolete.Cost: $20 billionCost: $1.17 billionCost: $5.6 billionThe Washington metro area suffers from some of the worst traffic congestion in the country. Maryland wants to build more than 16 miles of light rail to link its suburbs to Washington\u2019s existing Metro system (which needs extensive repairs) and Amtrak. Supporters say it would remove 17,000 cars each day from area roads.Cost: $685 millionCost: $10 billionEven without a federal program, Texans are actively looking for private investors for a high-speed rail link between Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston. Passengers would make the 240-mile, one-stop trip in 90 minutes. If successful, the line could be extended to San Antonio and Austin, covering the so-called Texaplex, which includes 75 percent of the state\u2019s population and is home to 52 Fortune 500 companies.The Common Sense column on Friday, about major public works projects that President-elect Donald J. Trump might consider, erroneously included one project among those started under the New Deal. While the Hoover Dam became part of the Depression-era public works undertaking, it was not started under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. It was planned, and site preparation had begun, before the New Deal.The Common Sense column on Friday, about major public works projects that President-elect Donald J. Trump might consider, referred imprecisely to the Golden Gate Bridge. While the Works Progress Administration did site work and lighting and built approaches and ramps, the bridge itself was not a project of the New Deal.Advertisement"}

But he now has an ally in President-elect Donald J. Trump, who has repeatedly called for taking apart Dodd-Frank, and he has Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress.\u201cThere has been a fairly constant dialogue with the Trump transition team about the Choice Act,\u201d he said on Wednesday during a lunch meeting of the Exchequer Club in Washington. \u201cThere\u2019s also been dialogue with our speaker and our leader in the House.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s transition team has said on its website that it \u201cwill be working to dismantle the Dodd-Frank Act and replace it with new policies to encourage growth and job creation.\u201dMr. Hensarling\u2019s bill seeks to revamp the oversight of financial institutions and how big banks are wound down in times of trouble, as well as make structural changes to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the broader rule-making process. It would also repeal the Volcker Rule, which is intended to stop banks from making risky bets with their own money, and call for stronger penalties for bankers who break the law, among other provisions.Mr. Hensarling introduced the plan in June, and the Financial Services Committee approved it in September with a vote largely along party lines.\u201cEven though Republicans will be nominally in charge of both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue soon, I remain painfully aware of the Senate\u2019s cloture rules,\u201d Mr. Hensarling said. \u201cThat means there will continue to be a need to work with members of the other party.\u201dHe added that his team was \u201cre-examining our legislation\u201d since the committee approved it and that he was \u201cinterested in working on a 2.0 version.\u201dBut whether Democrats will offer support is another matter.Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, one of the most outspoken supporters of Dodd-Frank, has already vowed to protect core tenets of the law, including her brainchild, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.This week, she warned lawmakers on Twitter that any votes to weaken the consumer agency, from either side of the aisle, \u201cwill declare loud & clear they represent giant banks, not working families.\u201dMr. Hensarling was rumored to be on the shortlist for Treasury secretary in the days after the election, though he has said he is not seeking a cabinet position. Instead, it appears he hopes to make inroads in Congress.\u201cA hard-fought election may be over, but our work is just beginning,\u201d he said during his remarks.In addition to undoing large parts of Dodd-Frank, Mr. Hensarling noted that he planned to pursue reforms to the Federal Reserve and an overhaul of the housing finance system, including the unwinding of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Those efforts would most likely build on previously introduced legislation.\u201cIt\u2019s not easy \u2014 it\u2019s the very definition of a \u2018heavy lift,\u2019 but our committee looks forward to working with the Trump administration, to finally build a housing finance system that is sustainable for homeowners, for hard-working taxpayers and for our economy,\u201d he said.Of the Federal Reserve, the chairman added, \u201cour economy would be healthier \u2014 and more Americans would have the opportunity to achieve success \u2014 if our Federal Reserve did not wander into fiscal policy and if our Federal Reserve conducted monetary policy in a more transparent, rule-like fashion.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Donald Trump Used Legally Dubious Method to Avoid Paying Taxes", "Date": "2016-10-31", "News": "Supported byBut newly obtained documents show that in the early 1990s, as he scrambled to stave off financial ruin, Mr. Trump avoided reporting hundreds of millions of dollars in taxable income by using a tax avoidance maneuver so legally dubious his own lawyers advised him that the Internal Revenue Service would most likely declare it improper if he were audited.Thanks to this one maneuver, which was later outlawed by Congress, Mr. Trump potentially escaped paying tens of millions of dollars in federal personal income taxes. It is impossible to know for sure because Mr. Trump has declined to release his tax returns, or even a summary of his returns, breaking a practice followed by every Republican and Democratic presidential candidate for more than four decades.Tax experts who reviewed the newly obtained documents for The New York Times said Mr. Trump\u2019s tax avoidance maneuver, conjured from ambiguous provisions of highly technical tax court rulings, clearly pushed the edge of the envelope of what tax laws permitted at the time. \u201cWhatever loophole existed was not \u2018exploited\u2019 here, but stretched beyond any recognition,\u201d said Steven M. Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center who helped draft tax legislation in the early 1990s.Mr. Trump managed to save millions in personal taxes by borrowing \u2013 then losing \u2013 other people\u2019s money.Moreover, the tax experts said the maneuver trampled a core tenet of American tax policy by conferring enormous tax benefits on Mr. Trump for losing vast amounts of other people\u2019s money \u2014 in this case, money investors and banks had entrusted to him to build a casino empire in Atlantic City.As that empire floundered in the early 1990s, Mr. Trump pressured his financial backers to forgive hundreds of millions of dollars in debt he could not repay. While the cancellation of so much debt gave new life to Mr. Trump\u2019s casinos, it created a potentially crippling problem with the Internal Revenue Service. In the eyes of the I.R.S., a dollar of canceled debt is the same as a dollar of taxable income. This meant Mr. Trump faced the painful prospect of having to report the hundreds of millions of dollars of canceled debt as if it were hundreds of millions of dollars of taxable income.But Mr. Trump\u2019s audacious tax-avoidance maneuver gave him a way to simply avoid reporting any of that canceled debt to the I.R.S. \u201cHe\u2019s getting something for absolutely nothing,\u201d John L. Buckley, who served as the chief of staff for Congress\u2019s Joint Committee on Taxation in 1993 and 1994, said in an interview.United States tax laws allowed Mr. Trump to use that $916 million loss to cancel out an equivalent amount of taxable income. But tax experts have been debating how Mr. Trump could have legally declared a deduction of that magnitude at all. Among other things, they have noted that Mr. Trump\u2019s huge casino losses should have been offset by the hundreds of millions of dollars in taxable income he surely must have reported to the I.R.S. in the form of canceled casino debt.By avoiding reporting his canceled casino debt in the first place, however, Mr. Trump\u2019s $916 million deduction would not have been reduced by hundreds of millions of dollars. He could have preserved the deduction and used it instead to avoid paying income taxes he might otherwise have owed on books, TV shows or branding deals. Under the rules in effect in 1995, the $916 million loss could have been used to wipe out more than $50 million a year in taxable income for 18 years.Mr. Trump declined to comment for this article.\u201cYour email suggests either a fundamental misunderstanding or an intentional misreading of the law,\u201d Hope Hicks, Mr. Trump\u2019s spokeswoman, said in a statement. \u201cYour thesis is a criticism, not just of Mr. Trump, but of all taxpayers who take the time and spend the money to try to comply with the dizzyingly complex and ambiguous tax laws without paying more tax than they owe. Mr. Trump does not think that taxpayers should file returns that resolve all doubt in favor of the I.R.S. And any tax experts that you have consulted are engaged in pure speculation. There is no news here.\u201dMr. Trump financed his three Atlantic City gambling resorts with $1.3 billion in debt, most of it in the form of high interest junk bonds. By late 1990, after months of escalating operating losses, New Jersey casino regulators were warning that \u201ca complete financial collapse of the Trump Organization was not out of the question.\u201d By 1992, all three casinos had filed for bankruptcy, and bondholders were ultimately forced to forgive hundreds of millions of dollars in debt to salvage at least part of their investment.The story of how Mr. Trump sidestepped a potentially ruinous tax bill from that forgiven debt emerged from documents recently discovered by The Times during a search of the casino bankruptcy filings. The documents offer only a partial description of events, and none of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax lawyers agreed to be interviewed for this article.At the time, Mr. Trump would have been hard-pressed to pay tens of millions of dollars in taxes. According to assessments of his financial stability by New Jersey casino regulators, there were times in the early 1990s when Mr. Trump had no more than a few million dollars in his various bank accounts. He was so strapped for cash that his creditors were apoplectic when they learned that Mr. Trump had bought Marla Maples an engagement ring estimated to be worth $250,000.It is unclear who first glimpsed a way for Mr. Trump to dodge a huge tax bill. But the basic maneuver he used was essentially a new twist on a contentious strategy corporations had been using for years to avoid taxes created by canceled debt.The strategy, known among tax practitioners as a \u201cstock-for-debt swap,\u201d relies on mathematical sleight of hand. Say a company can repay only $60 million of a $100 million bank loan. If the bank forgives the remaining $40 million, the company faces a large tax bill because it will have to report that canceled $40 million debt as taxable income.Clever tax lawyers found a way around this inconvenience. The company would simply swap stock for the $40 million in debt it could not repay. This way, it would look as if the entire $100 million loan had been repaid, and presto: There would be no tax bill due for $40 million in canceled debt.Best of all, it did not matter if the actual market value of the stock was considerably less than the $40 million in canceled debt. (Stock in an effectively insolvent company could easily be next to worthless.) Even in the opaque, rarefied world of gaming impenetrable tax regulations, this particular maneuver was about as close as a company could get to waving a magic wand and making taxes disappear.Alarmed by the obvious potential for abuse, Congress and the I.R.S. made repeated efforts during the 1980s to curb this brand of tax wizardry before banning its use by corporations altogether in 1993. But while policy makers were busy trying to stop corporations from using this particular ploy, the endlessly creative club of elite tax advisers was inventing a new way to circumvent the ban, this time through the use of partnerships.This was the twist that was especially beneficial to Mr. Trump. Wealthy families like the Trumps often own real estate and other assets through partnerships rather than corporations. Mr. Trump, for example, owned all three of his Atlantic City casinos through partnerships, an arrangement that allowed casino profits to flow directly to his personal tax returns when times were good.But what if times were bad? What if Mr. Trump\u2019s casino partnerships could not repay hundreds of millions of dollars they owed to bondholders? And what if the bondholders were persuaded to forgive this debt? Wouldn\u2019t that force the partnerships \u2014 i.e., Mr. Trump \u2014 to report hundreds of millions of dollars of taxable income in the form of canceled debt?Enter the tax advisers with their audacious plan: Why not eliminate all that taxable income from canceled debt by swapping \u201cpartnership equity\u201d for debt in exactly the same way corporations had been swapping company stock for debt?True enough, the I.R.S. and Congress had clearly signaled their disapproval of the basic concept. Fred T. Goldberg, who was the I.R.S. commissioner under George Bush, recalled in an interview that the I.R.S. frowned on partnership equity-for-debt swaps for the same reason it objected to corporate stock-for-debt swaps. \u201cThe fiction is that the partnership interest has the same value as the debt,\u201d he said. Lee A. Sheppard, a contributing editor to Tax Notes, wrote in 1991 that trying to find a legal justification for this tactic was akin to proving \u201cthe existence of the Loch Ness monster.\u201dOn the campaign trail, Mr. Trump boasts of his mastery of tax loopholes and claims no other candidate for the White House has ever known more about the tax code. This background, he argues with evident disgust, gives him special insight into the way wealthy elites buy off politicians and hire high-priced lawyers and accountants to rig the tax system \u2014 just as, he claims, they rig elections.That insight was on display in 1991 and 1992 when he was laying the groundwork to make a multimillion-dollar tax bill disappear.Before proceeding with his plan, Mr. Trump did what most prudent taxpayers do: He sought a formal tax opinion letter. Such letters, typically written by highly paid lawyers who spend entire careers mastering the roughly 10,000 pages of ever-changing statutes that make up the United States tax code, can provide important protection to taxpayers. As long as a tax adviser blesses a particular tax strategy in a formal opinion letter, the taxpayer most likely will not face penalties even if the I.R.S. ultimately rules the strategy was improper.The language used in tax opinion letters has a specialized meaning understood by all tax professionals. So, for example, when a tax lawyer writes that a shelter is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d going to be approved by the I.R.S., this means there is at least a 51 percent chance the shelter will withstand scrutiny. (This is known as an \u201cM.L.T.N.\u201d letter in the vernacular of tax lawyers.) A \u201cshould\u201d letter means there is about a 75 percent chance the I.R.S. will not object. The gold standard, a \u201cwill\u201d letter, means the I.R.S. is all but certain to bless the tax avoidance strategy.But the opinion letters Mr. Trump received from his tax lawyers at Willkie Farr & Gallagher were far from the gold standard. The letters bluntly warned that there was no statute, regulation or judicial opinion that explicitly permitted Mr. Trump\u2019s tax gambit. \u201cDue to the lack of definitive judicial or administrative authority,\u201d his lawyers wrote, \u201csubstantial uncertainties exist with respect to many of the tax consequences of the plan.\u201dMr. Trump's own lawyers at Willkie Farr & Gallagher cautioned him about using a a tax avoidance maneuver in the 1990s.One letter, 25 pages long, analyzed seven distinct components of Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed tax maneuver. It found only \u201csubstantial authority\u201d for six of the components. In the stilted language of tax opinion letters, the phrase \u201csubstantial authority\u201d is a red flag that the lawyers believe the I.R.S. can be expected to rule against the taxpayer roughly two-thirds of the time. In other words, Mr. Trump\u2019s tax lawyers were telling him there were at least six different reasons the I.R.S. would probably cry foul if he were audited. In anticipation of that possibility, the lawyers even laid out a fallback plan that would have allowed Mr. Trump to spread the pain of a large tax hit over many years if the I.R.S. ultimately balked.It is unclear whether the I.R.S. ever challenged Mr. Trump\u2019s use of this specific tax maneuver. According to a financial disclosure statement prepared by Mr. Trump\u2019s accountants, he was under audit by the tax authorities as of 1993, only a year after he avoided reporting hundreds of millions of dollars in taxable income because of this legally suspect tactic. But the results of that audit are unknown, and the agency declined to comment on Monday.Regardless of whether the I.R.S. objected, Mr. Trump\u2019s tax avoidance in this case violated a central principle of American tax law, said Mr. Buckley, the former chief of staff for Congress\u2019s Joint Committee on Taxation, who later served as chief tax counsel for Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee.\u201cHe deducted somebody else\u2019s losses,\u201d Mr. Buckley said. By that, Mr. Buckley meant that only the bondholders who forgave Mr. Trump\u2019s unpaid casino debts should have been allowed to use those losses to offset future income and reduce their taxes. That Mr. Trump used the same losses to reduce his taxes ultimately increases the tax burden on everyone else, Mr. Buckley explained. \u201cHe is double dipping big time.\u201dIn any event, Mr. Trump can no longer benefit from the same maneuver. Just as Congress acted in 1993 to ban stock-for-debt swaps by corporations, it acted in 2004 to ban equity-for-debt swaps by partnerships.Among the members of Congress who voted to finally close the loophole: Senator Hillary Clinton of New York.Megan Twohey contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Big Question on Climate Crisis: How to Inspire Innovation", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byAround the world, energy innovation seems to be speeding up. Large historical forces are converging to create unprecedented turmoil and opportunity in what had long been one of the most hidebound industries.The changes are coming just as governments have finally resolved, after two decades of failed efforts, to tackle the global climate crisis. The emissions that cause global warming have already fallen in some of the biggest countries, including the United States.Yet none of it is happening fast enough.Experts say that to forestall the worst effects of global warming, emissions need to drop by 80 percent or more globally by 2050, a mere 34 years from now. But at a global scale they are not falling at all, and the promises countries have made about the energy transition, even if kept, would get the world nowhere close to where it needs to be.The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.That means, experts say, that innovation in the field of energy will have to accelerate if governments hope to stave off catastrophe.While the cost of renewable energy sources has plunged, it is still not low enough in most places to drive dirty energy out of the market. And while renewables have shown that they can replace large amounts of fossil fuels, many experts say they believe they cannot do the whole job and new technologies will be needed in coming decades to get greenhouse emissions to zero.Progress on those new approaches has been halting, at best. So the future habitability of the Earth might depend on the answer to this question: How can innovation in the energy business be pushed into overdrive?Many people have a pretty clear idea about how innovation works \u2014 or at least they think they do.After all, millions of people have one of the most dazzling fruits of modern technology, the smartphone, in their pockets. At the root of innovations like the smartphone and the flat-screen television are microchips that get ever faster, reducing the cost of gadgets even as their capabilities mushroom.Now that almost everyone accepts that dirty energy is a problem, could it not be fixed with that same kind of innovation? It is a rational question, and only a few years ago some of the brightest minds in Silicon Valley were asking it, too.Billions of dollars poured into \u201cclean-tech\u201d investments. Most of them failed, and within a few years, investors were acknowledging they had misjudged the difficulty of the problem.\u201cThey ran up against the hard realities of the energy sector,\u201d which does not remotely work the same way as most of the technologies emerging from Silicon Valley, Mr. Norris said.To understand why, start with this: Though energy may appear to be a free market, with prices rising and falling as traders buy and sell oil and electricity, appearances are deceiving.The most obvious example is electricity. Because the delivery of electricity is a natural monopoly \u2014 multiple sets of wires would be a chaotic mess \u2014 state governments essentially took control of the electricity business a century ago.They dictated what companies were allowed to build and set the prices they were allowed to charge, usually by lumbering, bureaucratic procedures that took years. The focus was on forcing the utilities to keep prices low while eking out modest returns on their investments.Not surprisingly, electric utilities were among the least innovative businesses in the entire economy, spending next to nothing on research and development. Some aspects of the business have been reformed in recent years, but progress has been halting.That means governments exercise a huge influence over supply; they can and do manipulate it for reasons having nothing to do with business principles.On top of that, the oil industry benefited for decades from government favoritism, including big tax breaks in the United States and big consumer subsidies in other countries, that helped lock in a global dependency on oil.As it became clear late in the 20th century that the emissions from coal, oil and natural gas threatened the world\u2019s climate, a cry for change arose.But the tight linkages between energy companies and governments meant that if change was to come, it would only come as a result of strong public policies.That, in turn, set off a debate that is still underway: What, exactly, should those policies be?For two decades, Europe has been the world\u2019s hothouse of experimentation in energy policy. Along the way, European governments have learned painful, expensive lessons.The governments saw promise in technologies like wind turbines and solar panels, but realized these would never be able to compete with entrenched utilities unless the market for them grew large enough that manufacturers could benefit from economies of scale. They tackled that head-on, creating subsidies funded from the pockets of electricity consumers.It worked, driving down the cost of renewables at a precipitous pace in recent years. Germany has pushed hardest among the large European countries and now gets a third of its power from various forms of renewable energy.State governments in the United States also adopted renewable targets, though the United States is behind Germany, with about 13 percent renewable electricity, counting power from dams.Despite their success in building the market, European governments were slow to adjust their subsidies, even as renewable power grew cheaper. Over time, the cost ballooned. The average German family is paying close to $300 a year on its electricity bill to support the green-energy push.Among environmental groups, the subsidies and mandates are largely seen as a success.That view is supported by a powerful argument: Economists have recognized that the falling cost of green energy is directly related to the size of the market. Every time the market for solar panels doubles, for instance, their cost falls by nearly 20 percent, according to research from a consultancy, Bloomberg New Energy Finance.So the preferred energy policy of the green groups is basically a more ambitious version of this established approach. If governments keep using subsidies and mandates to push for scale, they say they believe green energy will eventually be able to compete on economic grounds, giving society the tools it needs to reach low emissions by the middle of this century.But many energy experts say they believe this will not be enough, and see an urgent need to speed the pace of research and development. Their concerns center on the limitations of renewable power. Because the sun does not always shine and the wind does not always blow, solar panels and wind turbines are not entirely reliable sources of electricity.Now, they are finding a better way.Recently, instead of handing out fixed subsidies, they have been running \u201creverse auctions\u201d for new wind projects. The company that asks for the lowest subsidy on a particular project gets the deal, and the subsidy.The results have been startling, awakening fierce price competition among the developers of wind projects.Offshore wind farms have been installed only in shallow water, but Statoil, the Norwegian oil company, and other companies are pursuing floating turbines that could work in many parts of the world where the sea floor drops off steeply. Statoil will soon start building the first commercial project of this type, a pilot off the coast of Scotland.On the outskirts of this city, it is testing a method in which surplus electricity would be used to heat up rocks, with the heat recovered later and used to generate power when renewable output is low. The energy could potentially be stored for days or weeks. The company will begin a much larger test next year.\u201cWe already know it works,\u201d said Till Barmeier, the Siemens project manager, as he offered a tour of the hot rocks one recent afternoon. \u201cThe question is, does it work well enough?\u201dEven with all the recent progress, it is still unclear just how far renewable energy can go.A few experts argue that the electricity system could go 100 percent renewable. But others reject that because of the intermittency problem, arguing that in the 2030s and beyond, society will need new huge power plants that can run most of the time without generating greenhouse emissions.If they are correct, only a handful of options are on the horizon.They could include new types of nuclear power plants, designed so that it is physically impossible for them to explode or leak radiation. Another possibility is to burn fossil fuels, but to capture the emissions.With big ideas like this, the basic problem is that building a large prototype plant can easily cost $1 billion or more, and private financiers are often reluctant to take the risk on unproven technology.One solution, of course, is for governments to spend money to subsidize big demonstration projects. Many Americans probably imagine that quite a bit is being spent already. But the numbers are actually low. The federal budget devoted to new energy technology is on the order of $6 billion a year, less money than American consumers spend on potato chips.It is not yet clear, though, whether Congress will honor President Obama\u2019s pledge.Speaking recently in New York, the secretary of energy, Ernest J. Moniz, sounded optimistic. He said he believed the political parties could find common ground by focusing on energy innovation, and if they did so, \u201cthe American approach\u201d would prevail.What is that approach?\u201cWe\u2019ve got a problem,\u201d Dr. Moniz explained. \u201cWe recognize it. We solve it.\u201dFollow Justin Gillis on Twitter @JustinHGillisLike the Science Times page on Facebook.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Under Donald Trump, Harsh Critic of V.A. May Become Its Leader", "Date": "2016-11-15", "News": "Supported byOn the campaign trail, Donald J. Trump savaged the Department of Veterans Affairs, calling it a \u201cdisaster\u201d and \u201cthe most corrupt agency in the United States.\u201d He vowed to fire many workers at the department in an effort to fix a health care system fraught with delays.As he transitions to the White House, he has tapped the agency\u2019s harshest critics to advise him.Mr. Trump has said he is considering Representative Jeff Miller, Republican of Florida, to run the agency. As the chairman of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs, Mr. Miller has hounded the agency for failing to enact meaningful changes to cut wait times and fire workers who hid delays. If selected, he will be the first secretary of veterans affairs who has never served in the military.Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team did not respond on Tuesday to a request for comment.For years, Concerned Veterans for America, based in Washington, was on the fringe of the veteran world, generally shunned by traditional veterans organizations.During the campaign, though, Mr. Trump echoed privatization policies put out by the group, telling crowds he would give all veterans a card to use with any private doctor who accepted Medicare.\u201cThis is a big, big deal,\u201d Pete Hegseth, a former chief executive of Concerned Veterans for America, said in an interview. \u201cIf we keep our pedal to the metal, we can get major reform done in the first six months.\u201dMr. Hegseth said the first priority would be making it easier to fire workers. The next would be increasing the use of private doctors, which he said was \u201cnot privatization, but choice.\u201d He said Mr. Miller\u2019s skeptical view of the management of the veterans\u2019 health care system made him the perfect selection to push through the changes.The organization declined to say whether it was financed by the Koch brothers.Mr. Miller, a former real estate agent and television weatherman, and one of the most conservative members of Congress, declined to comment, other than to issue a statement lauding Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism of the agency.\u201cInstead of trying to sugarcoat the problems at the Department of Veterans Affairs,\u201d the statement said, \u201che has a plan to fix them that includes common-sense solutions such as protections for V.A. whistle-blowers, accountability for bad employees and providing veterans with more health care options.\u201dIn an interview on Friday with Fox News, Mr. Miller said the agency \u2014 the second largest in the federal government, with nearly 350,000 employees \u2014 was \u201cmired in a bureaucracy that just doesn\u2019t want to move in the right direction.\u201d He added, \u201cYou can\u2019t have a World Series-winning team if you are not willing to get rid of those who can\u2019t or won\u2019t play their positions.\u201dMr. Miller has long pushed for veterans to have a card that would allow them to see a private doctor if they could not get a timely appointment with the V.A.A private insurance option would cost between $50 billion and $100 billion, Garry Augustine, the executive director of Disabled American Veterans, said in an interview.\u201cWhere would that money come from?\u201d Mr. Augustine asked. \u201cWe would hate to see the V.A. wither on the vine because resources are taken from it for private health care options.\u201dOthers worry that Concerned Veterans for America may be less interested in improving health care than in proving a political point.\u201cThis is an ideological organization pushing an ideological point,\u201d said Representative Mark Takano, Democrat of California, the acting ranking member of the House veterans committee. \u201cNo one else really agrees that privatization is the right way to go. I hope Mr. Trump is a pragmatist and sees that.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s criticism of the health care system for veterans is driven in large part by problems at the agency and the slow pace of change under the Obama administration.In President Obama\u2019s first term, the hospital system, which treats about six million veterans annually, faced rapidly rising demand as Vietnam War veterans began using more services and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan made millions of new veterans eligible. Long waits increased as some hospitals were unable to meet the demand.Leading the House veterans committee, Mr. Miller has pounded on the department, holding many more hearings than his Senate counterpart and accusing the agency of a \u201crampant lack of accountability.\u201dHis sometimes tense hearings have focused on failings of the agency\u2019s 1,200 health care facilities, including long wait times, overuse of opiates, unsanitary conditions, and executives who dodged discipline and collected bonuses even as scandals unfolded.Many V.A. employees and veterans acknowledged the system\u2019s problems, but they said critics were cherry-picking negative stories that mischaracterized a health care system that studies had shown was as good as or better than private care.\u201cThe rhetoric does not match up with the reality,\u201d said Dr. Kenneth Kizer, a former under secretary for health at the V.A. who now works for the University of California, Davis, Health System. \u201cThere are problems, and you can\u2019t ignore that, but most people really like the V.A. The care is very good.\u201dMr. Miller introduced bills making it easier to fire executives, but the measures languished in the Senate after being passed by the House. Disheartened by a lack of progress in Washington, Mr. Miller, 57, announced last spring that he would not seek re-election in his solidly Republican district in the Florida panhandle.In April, he became one of the first members of Congress to support Mr. Trump, calling him \u201cthe only person who has what it takes to shake up the status quo and entrenched bureaucrats in Washington.\u201d He added, \u201cI am more and more convinced that he has the ability to reach in and right the wrongs in the Department of Veterans Affairs once and for all.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Is It So Hard to Make a Website for the Government?", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Read an editor's letter by Jake Silverstein about the Design Issue.O\u2019Farrell, who has been involved with government food programs since graduating from college nearly three decades ago, understood why his office would be a promising target for this kind of tech push. California\u2019s food-stamp participation rate, roughly 50 percent of eligible residents, was one of the lowest in the country, and the bureaucratic friction in the application process deserved at least some of the blame. Enlisting technology\u2019s aid made a lot of sense: More than three-quarters of Americans who earn less than $30,000 a year now use the internet, and Obamacare has ushered in a new generation of social-service clients who grew up on their smartphones and expect to interact with government the same way they do everything else. Yet CalFresh \u2014 in contrast to the Silicon Valley companies in the neighborhood, where teams of designers, product managers and data scientists cater to their online users with intense precision \u2014 offered a poor \u201cuser experience\u201d for clients on its digital channels. It lacked text or email support; its website didn\u2019t work well on mobile devices. These were just the sorts of problems that Code for America fellows figured they knew how to solve.The fellows soon discovered that an external vendor, Hewlett-Packard, had been contracted for years to maintain the site. A bigger obstacle to remaking MyBenefits CalWin would have been negotiating the cooperation of all 18 counties that used it. But one fellow, Jake Solomon, had an idea. The only information legally needed to submit a complete food-stamp application, he had learned, was a name, an address and a signature. Code for America could work around MyBenefits CalWin and build its own simple website just for CalFresh applicants. At the very least, this would make for a good proof of concept, a way to show various government officials that social-service delivery could be, in Solomon\u2019s words, \u201cdead simple.\u201d In 2014, after his fellowship had ended \u2014 he was still affiliated with Code for America \u2014 Solomon pitched this idea to his colleague Dave Guarino one afternoon, and they coded a prototype over the next few days.The following week, Solomon and Guarino gave a demonstration at O\u2019Farrell\u2019s office. Guarino handed a phone with the prototype on it to O\u2019Farrell, who filled out an application in a few minutes. With its clear language and big buttons, it felt slick, like Twitter or Facebook, not kludgy, like most .gov sites. O\u2019Farrell was impressed. \u201cThis could be a game changer,\u201d he said. \u201cGo for it. We like it.\u201d\u201cMy biggest lesson this year was that local governments are constrained,\u201d Solomon wrote in a blog post. \u201cThey\u2019re constrained by a complex web of local politics, state legislation and federal laws. The constraints cascade downhill, as does the responsibility.\u201dIn 2013, Code for America had nearly 30 fellows \u2014 selected by competitive application \u2014 working on behalf of 10 partner cities. Its annual operating budget was $7 million, more than half of which came from private grants. Pahlka often found herself on the road, giving talks and courting donors. Her pitch was simple: Use technology to make government better. What exactly she meant by that could be hard to parse, but the apps she cited and the anecdotes she shared were compelling, with a folksy, community-driven appeal. (Take care of your neighborhood storm drain!)Solomon, Guarino and Williams, part of the 2013 class of fellows, were initially assigned to different cities and themes. Solomon went to the Human Services Agency of San Francisco. Before Code for America, he worked for the RAND Corporation on health policy; before that he was at Palantir, a Silicon Valley data-analytics start-up that created software for intelligence services and other clients. Guarino, a software developer and policy wonk who had spent time at the California Health Benefits Review Program, devoted his fellowship year to building an app that allowed residents in South Bend, Ind., to report on the conditions of vacant and abandoned properties. Williams, a designer, built digital trail maps for parks in northeast Ohio. As a junior at Tulane during Hurricane Katrina, he had seen the storm sweep across Lake Pontchartrain and then flood much of New Orleans. \u201cI watched government fail on so many levels,\u201d Williams says. \u201cIn this very visible, physical way, where levees failed, but also the soul-crushing process that people went through afterward to get FEMA support.\u201dThe three young men had an easy rapport from the start. None of them fit the stereotype of the Silicon Valley engineer. Each majored in a social science \u2014 Solomon in economics, Guarino in political economy, Williams in English and political science. I saw them at their most animated in long conversations over Mexican takeout, talking about John Rawls and social contracts and the unfortunate amount of discretionary power wielded by street-level bureaucrats. For them, and for many of their Code for America colleagues, technology was a means more than an end, a lever with which they could move people\u2019s lives toward the good. While their peers in Silicon Valley wanted to play with cool new programming languages for the sake of playing with cool new programming languages, Solomon, Guarino and Williams, it seemed, found their motivations elsewhere. \u201cI care about helping people, period,\u201d Guarino told me.The normal process worked like this: Once an application was received \u2014 whether delivered in person, online or via fax \u2014 and entered into the database, the CalFresh office in the applicant\u2019s county would schedule an interview, to be held either over the phone or in person. At these sessions, eligibility workers, whose job is to determine whether clients qualify for social services, review documents like pay stubs, utility bills and identity cards. Eligibility is set at 200 percent of the poverty line, or roughly $41,000 in gross income for a family of three, but subject to a host of caveats; in granting exceptions to these caveats, eligibility workers exercise a great deal of discretion. They can choose to overlook missing documentation or demand additional receipts. They can verbally elicit information omitted from the application.The Code for America team\u2019s plan had always been to leave the scarier stuff off the website \u2014 questions like, \u201cHave you ever traded food stamps for explosives?\u201d or \u201cHave you ever committed a felony?\u201d Those questions could be answered during the live interview. The key was to settle on how much information to ask for at the start. Require too much, and users would be put off and give up; too little, and the eligibility workers, who preferred more details rather than fewer, would complain. In the end, the team settled on a compromise. After the user submitted a name and an address, two choices would present themselves: to continue filling out the rest of the application or to \u201cStop working and submit application now.\u201d Clicking the second option would lead to another page and the warning: \u201cAre you sure you want to submit right now? Since we only know your name and address, it will be hard to process your application. Instead of finishing it on the phone, we will have to send you paperwork in the mail.\u201dThe main technical challenge confronting the team followed directly from Solomon\u2019s initial flash of insight to create an independent site. Because GetCalFresh wasn\u2019t actually replacing MyBenefits CalWin, but was instead just offering an alternative point of access, they still needed to work with its existing infrastructure, which lacked an A.P.I., or application programming interface. Modern websites consist of a front end, or web page (what a user sees on the computer screen); a back end (a database and a server that hosts it); and usually an A.P.I. that sends data between them. We all regularly rely on things that function like A.P.I.s in the physical world. Say, for instance, you want to get takeout from your favorite Chinese restaurant. In this analogy, the front end would be your phone, the back end is the kitchen and the A.P.I. is whichever restaurant employee relays your order to the cooks. She\u2019s how you place an order of dumplings, cancel that order or modify it to include sweet-and-sour soup.In software development, A.P.I.s allow coders to change front-end or back-end components easily, while leaving the core of a program intact. The lack of an A.P.I. for MyBenefits CalWin meant that GetCalFresh, however great it looked, couldn\u2019t actually put any information into the earlier site\u2019s database. The state would not officially know about any of the applications it received; it wouldn\u2019t even know where to send a check. So the Code for America team\u2019s members, when they received an application through GetCalFresh, needed to figure out a way to get that information into the MyBenefits CalWin system.In April 2015, Guarino, while on a trip to Utah with Solomon and Williams, finally came up with a workaround. If the problem they faced was relying on people to manually enter information into the database, why not just write some code to take care of that part? Guarino used a technology called Selenium WebDriver that mimicked a user\u2019s activity on a website. Playing the role of the applicant, the webdriver would go to MyBenefits CalWin\u2019s front end and fill in each question using the information collected through GetCalFresh, then click \u201cnext.\u201d This was not exactly best practice when it came to coding: Webdrivers are used primarily in testing web applications, not in their actual operation. Because the webdriver couldn\u2019t catch all errors, when someone mistakenly submitted an impossible birth date, for example, or a nonexistent ZIP code, that information would trigger an error when it was entered into the legacy system. A human being would then have to correct the information from that faulty entry by hand.Williams worried, when giving demonstrations to county representatives, that the whole process would seem amateurish to them, the way it sometimes did to him. But he came to realize that the existing systems used by CalFresh staff members tended to be far more cumbersome and time-intensive than his inelegant webdriver. They didn\u2019t see the absence of tests and logs, the redundant code, the inability to deal with errors like missing information gracefully. He recalled a presentation at which the projector was broken, so the audience gathered around his computer. When he ran the webdriver, a new browser window opened up straight away to the legacy website, and the applicant\u2019s data automatically appeared, as if typed in by unseen fingers. Williams describes it as \u201ca magical moment.\u201d The genius of the webdriver was that it didn\u2019t require clerical workers to do anything different: no encryptions, no new data entry or software systems to deal with. It did exactly what workers at food banks and community-based organizations already did \u2014 fill out the legacy application on behalf of clients \u2014 except faster. It reinforced technology\u2019s most basic power: the ability of automation to eliminate boring and repetitive tasks.No one had a good answer, including the executives at Code for America. By many measures, GetCalFresh had surpassed all of the nonprofit\u2019s previous projects, and Code for America now found itself in unfamiliar territory. It had typically presented its projects as proofs of concept, but many of them, as one of the organization\u2019s officials later admitted in a blog post, lacked \u201cconsistent paths to sustainability.\u201d By that fall, out of the many dozens of apps created by Code for America fellows, fewer than 10 had found enough support to justify being spun off into start-ups. Many of them had not been updated on Github, the website where most collaborative coding projects are hosted, in months.As Solomon, Guarino and Williams saw it, a couple of obvious paths lay before them. The first was to solicit funds from traditional philanthropic sources. The second was to become a government I.T. vendor and sell to other counties and states. Neither path appealed to them. Donor funding, while probably necessary in the short term, seemed unsustainable in the long term \u2014 especially because, under the reigning Silicon Valley ethos, even philanthropic tech projects are expected to present a business model. Government I.T. vending work, on the other hand, was self-sufficient but uninspired. It was limited, by definition, to what was imagined under any given contract. \u201cIt abdicated responsibility for anything outside the software,\u201d Williams says. And for all of Code for America\u2019s beliefs that tech could serve as a lever for good, the bad code plaguing the public sector was rarely the only problem with a particular program; it would be a hollow improvement to give CalFresh a better application site without, say, making sure that reminder letters were sent out before an appointment or that the customer-support lines were adequately staffed.As the months passed and the financing remained unresolved, the team submitted proposals to several organizations \u2014 including Molina Healthcare in Long Beach, Calif., from which they sought $3 million over three years, characterizing their project as a preventive-health measure. But their reluctance to work for the government seemed to come from some deeper motivating force. In the beginning, I wondered whether it had to do with prestige. Public employees can get stuck working in rooms with ugly linoleum floors writing memos that may never be read; I.T. vendors, meanwhile, are the equivalent of enterprise software sales. Perhaps either fate seemed at odds with the team\u2019s self-image.But in talking to them, I found that their worries seemed to revolve less around social standing than around effectiveness. Having been exposed to the way government operated, they saw a decision-making system in which the status quo always wins. The lengths to which the team would have had to go to modify the legacy site, MyBenefits CalWin, was one example. The process to amend a notice of action \u2014 a letter informing CalFresh clients of changes in their eligibility, for example \u2014 was another. \u201cWhen you work for the government, ties go to the county, ties go to the state,\u201d Solomon told me. At the moment, the Code for America team controlled almost every aspect of GetCalFresh: If they wanted to, say, experiment with live chat for customer support, they could. That freedom would be curbed if they began collecting paychecks from the state.\u201cYou don\u2019t speak Cantonese, do you?\u201d he asked me as soon as I entered. I did not, alas. Many of the clients of the San Francisco-Marin Food Bank were non-English speakers, and among them Cantonese was the most common native tongue. But the Cantonese-speaking employee who was supposed to be on duty that morning had called in sick. Liliana Sandoval, the food bank\u2019s senior program manager, was scrambling to find a replacement.A half-hour later, Sandoval and the replacement arrived, dragging a large file folder between them. His name was Calvin Yan, he worked for the San Francisco-Marin Food Bank and, thankfully, he spoke Cantonese. They pulled out a pair of Microsoft Surface tablets. \u201cGo to demo.GetCalFresh.org,\u201d Solomon instructed. The landing page for GetCalFresh showed a glossy image of an Asian woman holding a toddler and standing in front of the produce aisle in an unidentifiable grocery store. At the top, it read: \u201cGet extra money for groceries every month. Take the first step. Apply for CalFresh in 10 minutes.\u201d In the footer: \u201cGetCalFresh.org is a service delivered by Code for America on behalf of the people of California.\u201d The favicon, the tiny image that appeared in the browser tab space when you navigated to the site, was a federal building with Corinthian columns and the symbol for Wi-Fi overlaid on the roof.Yan flipped through the screens. \u201cOh, this is really short,\u201d he said.\u201cYup,\u201d Solomon said, satisfied.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve done this,\u201d Yan said, before asking if eligibility was still at $1,900 per month.\u201cNo,\u201d Sandoval chided. She tossed him a San Francisco-Marin Food Bank resource guide. \u201cYou should be fine. The only thing might be sponsors.\u201d Sponsors backed immigrants, making them financially responsible for the new arrivals, but in practice they could be difficult to track down. Sometimes food-stamp applicants said they hadn\u2019t had contact with their official sponsors in years.At 10 a.m., the doors opened, and the first clients arrived: an attractive young couple, the man blond and beefy, the woman dark and wide-eyed. Each wore a backpack. Sandoval began speaking to the woman in Spanish. What was her monthly income? How many people in her household did she regularly shop for groceries with? Were any of them students? The woman reached out and touched her boyfriend\u2019s arm. Sandoval switched to English. How many classes was he taking at city college? Three, he said. Did he know how many credits that was? He didn\u2019t. There was a meek, quiet pause. \u201cWould it be helpful if I found out?\u201d he asked.The issue, Sandoval told him, was that full-time students were ineligible for CalFresh, although there was a long list of exceptions \u2014 he could be eligible, for instance, if he had kids. He shook his head. No kids. Then he should probably go to the registrar and confirm his status, Sandoval said. Meanwhile, she would submit a CalFresh application for his girlfriend and refer them to a food pantry in their neighborhood.Sandoval turned to Yan. \u201cCan you pull up the food-pantry locator?\u201d she asked. Another in-house civic-tech team had put together a search tool for food pantries.\u201cWhich neighborhood?\u201d Yan replied, typing on the Surface.\u201cNorth Beach,\u201d the woman answered.Yan flashed her a smile. \u201cMy neighborhood. O.K., the bad news is that there aren\u2019t too many options. But the good news is that there is a food bank just around the corner from your building. It\u2019s not in the search tool.\u201d He tapped his temple. \u201cBut I know it because it\u2019s just down the street from me. I\u2019ll write down the address for you.\u201dSandoval continued: \u201cOnce a week, you can go and pick up a bag of groceries.\u201d\u201cYou can pick what you want?\u201d the woman asked.\u201cYes, it\u2019s a 30-pound bag, more than 15 pounds of which is fresh produce, and then the rest, staples.\u201d She said they would hear back about their application in a few weeks. The couple shrugged on their backpacks. They thanked Sandoval.After the couple left, everyone waited. A good 45 minutes went by. No one else showed up. After noon, Solomon and I went to grab lunch. In all of our previous meetings, Solomon had projected an unrelenting positivity bordering on pretense. Today he seemed tired, less guarded. \u201cJust think about if every person from all those organizations \u2014 their energy were redirected toward software development,\u201d he said. I pointed out that not everyone had the skills for software development. And in any case, the event suggested the limits of technology. Sandoval\u2019s Spanish skills, Yan\u2019s local knowledge \u2014 these were the things that the technology, at least as of now, had yet to replace, and their softening effect called to a mind an earlier line from Solomon himself, that \u201cstigma was created or eroded at the point of service delivery.\u201dAs we waited for our sandwiches, Solomon got some bad news he\u2019d begun to expect: The $3 million they were seeking from Molina Healthcare \u2014 which could have kept their effort to expand GetCalFresh going \u2014 had been rejected because of restrictions on what the company could support.\u201cWhat else do you have in the pipeline?\u201d I asked.\u201cRight now, nothing,\u201d Solomon said. \u201cC.F.A. has been extremely generous, but they can\u2019t just let us carry on without strategic funding and strategic partners.\u201d He continued: \u201cWe need to figure out whether this model\u201d \u2014 digital nonprofits in the social-services sector \u2014 \u201cactually works or not.\u201dAs in the private sector, the GetCalFresh team\u2019s work would apparently be judged by people\u2019s willingness to pay for it. To me, this seemed absurd: Wasn\u2019t the whole purpose of government to fund collective projects that are irrational for individuals to take on alone? But Solomon and his team seemed to be caught between a public sector unwilling to finance them and a private philanthropic culture that didn\u2019t see enough value in what they did.Williams and Jaime-Alexis Fowler, then director of marketing at Code for America, joined Solomon for lunch. The waiter who came up to take the orders greeted them like old regulars. \u201cHey! I thought one of you guys was done.\u201d\u201cThis is his new office,\u201d Fowler quipped.\u201cMy new H.Q.,\u201d Solomon said.Fowler told me that in the last couple of weeks, a few significant individuals and foundations in Silicon Valley had come forward as sources of funding for GetCalFresh. The money wasn\u2019t in the bank yet, but things were looking promising, despite all the stresses and doubts of the previous months. Some people still believed in improving digital delivery by government \u2014 \u201cpeople who are saying what you are doing is really important and it\u2019s O.K. that you haven\u2019t figured out all the ins and outs of it.\u201dAfter the kale salads arrived, I asked Solomon what he was going to do now. GetCalFresh was his brainchild, and this creation process, he had told me before, represented the best job he ever had.His plan was to dream up similar projects, he said, but as a kind of social entrepreneur. \u201cIt just became increasingly apparent that moving forward we were going to be working for the government, which is great. There\u2019s a lot that can be done there. But I think my interests are closer to advocacy work than enterprise software. I need to set up a situation where I\u2019m working for my clients, my users.\u201d He paused. \u201cOne of the first things I\u2019m going to do is figure out whether there\u2019s a market for an intermediary in food stamps, the way that people are willing to pay $50 not to deal with the I.R.S.\u201d At the high end, these intermediaries were attorneys and financial advisers. In the middle, they were TurboTax, travel agencies, real-estate brokers. At the low end, of course, there was nothing.If government interactions are so unpleasant that intercessors are necessary, I suggested, then perhaps we should reform government instead of creating another go-between.\u201cBut I think intermediation is often \u2014\u201d Solomon began.Williams threw up his hands. \u201cYes!\u201d he said. \u201cThe answer is yes!\u201d\u201cIn many cases it is those intermediaries who are the strongest pressure for reform,\u201d Solomon said.\u201cThey\u2019re also the strongest opponents of reform in some cases.\u201d\u201cSure,\u201d Solomon admitted. \u201cIntuit is a great example.\u201d Several years ago, California proposed simplifying tax returns for some taxpayers, but it was opposed by Intuit lobbying.Williams prodded his food with his fork. \u201cSo who\u2019s the most powerful actor?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s the intermediaries oftentimes. And that can be a force for good, or a force for self-serving interest.\u201dAs lunch wound down, I asked where Dave Guarino was. I hadn\u2019t seen him in a while. \u201cDave is coding,\u201d Williams said.Now that things on the funding side were looking up, feature development could begin again. The GetCalFresh team was replacing Solomon with an engineer, Andrew Hyder, who was a Code for America fellow with Solomon, Guarino and Williams in 2013. And once the money arrived, there would be resources for hiring more people too. Williams looked meaningfully at Solomon when he said that.As it happened, the money would come in, and then some. In April, California declared its intent to award GetCalFresh a two-year \u201coutreach\u201d contract, federal money designed to reimburse nonprofits that helped clients through the application process for social services. It would be the first time California had made an award for web-based application assistance. \u201cWe see this as a major first piece of a client-based revenue model \u2014 since we will receive reimbursement based on the number of people we help,\u201d Williams told me. He credited, above all, the support of people like Leo O\u2019Farrell and Kim McCoy Wade, who became the state\u2019s new head of CalFresh in 2015. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones who really pulled for us,\u201d Williams said. The team\u2019s immediate financial future secured, its members \u2014 Williams, Guarino and Hyder (three new hires were planned) \u2014 steeled themselves for a long summer leading up to a Code for America summit meeting in Oakland, where they hoped to persuade the various CalFresh directors to try them out.In my last conversations with Williams, the tone was one of cautious optimism. While the California contract kept GetCalFresh going for another two years and gave the team a sense of momentum, it hardly solved all their problems. A real A.P.I. needed to be built and additional county CalFresh directors won over. Above all, the team needed to show impact \u2014 in terms of numbers of users, applications and food-stamp approvals \u2014 on the scale that everyone had come to expect from tech ventures. Everything they had done until now \u2014 all the prototyping, hand-holding, cajoling, fund-raising \u2014 was just preparation. Now the work would really begin.It\u2019s hard to predict whether GetCalFresh will become the vanguard of a new movement in social services or a forlorn entry in the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine. But GetCalFresh has made it further than the vast majority of civic-tech projects. It has overcome every kind of crisis \u2014 technical, financial, existential \u2014 while exposing the distance between the current fetishization of innovation and the reality of implementing even the best ideas within intransigent organizations. Perhaps most important, its team has demonstrated a commitment that goes beyond Silicon Valley opportunism.\u201cFor the longest time, if someone asked me what I did at a party or something,\u201d Williams told me, \u201cI would say, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m a product designer,\u2019 or \u2018I work in tech.\u2019 Now I say I work in social services.\u201d Even Solomon, the prodigal son, hasn\u2019t strayed far. Back at the lunch at Citizen\u2019s Band, it occurred to me that despite his qualms, the public sector built so little of its own software that even so-called in-house projects were often procured from vendors. So in the end, you could either pay $30 to have someone outside the government handle the food-stamp application process for you, which is what Solomon wanted, or the government would pay a contractor $30 per successful food-stamp application, which is what Williams and the team wanted: a system in which government contracting outside the I.T. world could align with users\u2019 interests. This seemed a distinction without a difference \u2014 maybe they\u2019d all work together again at some point.Solomon smiled at that. \u201cI think over the next year, he\u2019s going to continue to try to recruit me, and I\u2019m going to continue to try to recruit him, and we\u2019ll probably meet somewhere in the middle.\u201d \u2666Yiren Lu is a writer and software engineer based in New York.Produced by Rodrigo De Benito Sanz and Linsey FieldsAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What It\u2019s Like to Make It in Showbiz With Your Best Friend", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Meet the songwriters Benj Pasek and Justin Paul of \u201cDear Evan Hansen\u201d and \u201cLa La Land.\u201dSupported byThey met at 18, the worst dancers in a college ballet class, and sought refuge in a basement practice room, taking a first stab at songwriting with a tune about adolescents playing hooky and footsie at a suburban diner.Now, at the age of 31, after a decade of being touted as promising, up-and-coming, and ones-to-watch, Pasek and Paul have arrived.\u201cI love them,\u201d said Robert Greenblatt, the chairman of NBC Entertainment, who hired the pair to write three songs for the television show \u201cSmash,\u201d and became so enamored that he is now a co-producer on \u201cDear Evan Hansen.\u201d \u201cTo me, they\u2019re the future of the musical, on stage or screen.\u201dThey are handsome and charming, quick-witted and exuberant, observant, obsessive, and, of course, neurotic. Mr. Pasek writes words, and Mr. Paul writes music, but they have opted, right from the beginning, to share credit for both elements of their songs.They estimate that they spend 350 days a year together, for six to 12 hours at a stretch, sending texts and video clips back and forth when they are not in the same room, and even sometimes when they are.\u201cEverything that we\u2019ve studied and loved has all built to get to be in a moment like this,\u201d Mr. Paul said during a joint interview at Sardi\u2019s, surrounded by caricatures of the industry\u2019s greatest talents. \u201cOur goal was always, if we could just write songs and tell stories, and get to do that every day, that\u2019s our dream.\u201dAlthough their sensibility is contemporary, they are deeply rooted in the musical theater tradition, and their sound is somewhere on the border between show tunes and pop \u2014 they are not part of the hip-hop revolution on Broadway.\u201cI think we\u2019re attracted to material that\u2019s hopeful and messy, and in that mess, there\u2019s an attempt at getting at truth,\u201d Mr. Pasek said.They are, on the surface, quite different from each other. Mr. Paul, who lives in Harlem, is a churchgoing Christian from Westport, Conn.; straight; married; and the father of a 7-month-old daughter. Mr. Pasek, who grew up in Ardmore, Pa., and now lives on the Upper West Side, is gay, Jewish and single.But they both began as little boys who loved to sing.Mr. Paul, a talented pianist, started early. At age 3, he was singing gospel music with his father, a pastor, in church. Later, he sang and danced at senior centers with Music Theater of Connecticut; and then, at Staples High School, he performed in \u201cInto the Woods,\u201d conducted the orchestra in \u201cHello, Dolly!\u201d and spent his free time poring over Broadway \u201cfake books,\u201d which help pianists master melodies.Mr. Pasek also sang with a parent: His mother is a developmental psychologist and professor with a propensity for bursting into song. (\u201cShe\u2019s like a real-life musical theater character, in the best possible way,\u201d he said.) She wrote and performed songs from a child\u2019s point of view (\u201cThey were a big hit on the synagogue circuit,\u201d he said), and he remembers guest starring with her at about age 7.Mr. Pasek sang and traveled with the Philadelphia Boys Choir & Chorale, and then, as a student at Friends Central School, performed in musicals including \u201cBye Bye Birdie\u201d and \u201c42nd Street.\u201dThey compare themselves to brothers, who bicker and bond, knowing their relationship will endure. A recent fight, over whose bad habits were to blame for their difficulty replacing the final first act song in \u201cDear Evan Hansen,\u201d sent Mr. Pasek stalking out of their Columbus Circle studio into the street, but then, 10 minutes later, calling Mr. Paul for a lengthy air-clearing that prompted the pair to ditch the disputed number and start over.Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul met the summer before college, at a freshman orientation weekend, and connected over a shared sense of humor, a passion for the work of Jason Robert Brown and an obsession with \u201cMerrily We Roll Along.\u201d (The title \u201cEdges\u201d alludes to a \u201cMerrily\u201d lyric.) Mr. Pasek wanted to record some songs he had written as a high school senior, and he recruited Mr. Paul as an arranger and accompanist; with that, their collaboration began.They mined their own experiences, and those of their friends, for material, acting out songs as they wrote. \u201cI kept watching them observe the social experiment of college and find ways to articulate it,\u201d said Nick Blaemire, a fellow Michigan student who is now an actor in New York, recalling a night when he told Mr. Pasek about his difficulty expressing love to a girlfriend, and seeing that become \u201cI Hmm You.\u201dRaised in the digital age, and aware of the role social media played in fueling their popularity, they have demonstrated an ease promoting their work \u2014 at first with CDs and a homespun tour of \u201cEdges,\u201d and more recently with producers, performers and journalists \u2014 that has served them well. \u201cThey\u2019re salesmen, and always have been \u2014 they know how to explain what they\u2019re doing and why they\u2019re doing it,\u201d Mr. Blaemire said.Michael Gracey, the director of \u201cThe Greatest Showman,\u201d had imagined asking a number of songwriters to contribute songs to his film, but, as he talked with Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul about the movie, abandoned that plan to give them all the work. He even videotaped their songwriting sessions, convinced that they would be of significance for posterity. \u201cI can\u2019t even begin to describe the enormous impact those two have had on this film,\u201d he said.The director of \u201cLa La Land,\u201d Damien Chazelle, had a similar experience: He was looking for seasoned lyricists who could write words for songs composed by Justin Hurwitz when Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul, seeking the gig, gave him proposed lyrics for a song called \u201cCity of Stars.\u201d That became a signature number. \u201cIt was screamingly obvious that we had stumbled onto a gold mine with these guys, and we brought them on right away,\u201d Mr. Chazelle said.Their promise was evident as soon as they started writing together. Brent Wagner, the emeritus chairman of the musical theater program at the University of Michigan, still remembers the night in 2005 when Mr. Blaemire, then a junior, persuaded him to stop by the Kerrytown Concert House in Ann Arbor to see \u201cEdges.\u201d\u201cIt was a youthful work, and it wasn\u2019t completely advanced \u2014 there wasn\u2019t even music written down \u2014 but it was marvelous, and at that moment, you knew you were in the midst of real talent and real understanding of theater craft,\u201d Mr. Wagner said. \u201cBy the time they left school,\u201d he said, \u201cwe knew it would just be a matter of time.\u201dJeff Marx, the Tony Award-winning co-creator of \u201cAvenue Q,\u201d was equally convinced \u2014 so sure that he placed a bet on them. A Michigan alumnus, he had taken on Mr. Pasek as an assistant in the summer of 2005. (\u201cI looked at his Friendster profile and he seemed like a nice kid.\u201d) The next year, when Mr. Pasek asked to return, Mr. Marx told him he needed to stop interning and focus on writing shows with Mr. Paul.Mr. Paul couldn\u2019t afford to write full time \u2014 he needed to earn money for school \u2014 but Mr. Marx was so intent that he offered to give Mr. Paul money in lieu of what he would have earned from a summer job. Then, when Mr. Paul said he was unwilling to accept charity, Mr. Marx repositioned his offer as a wager, staking him $7,000, to be repaid only if Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul made it to Broadway within the next decade.It happened, but in an unexpected way.They had a frustrating experience adapting the Roald Dahl children\u2019s book \u201cJames and the Giant Peach,\u201d which was mounted at Goodspeed Musicals in 2010, and has been revised since. They remain proud of their songs, and the show is still being produced at small theaters, but the Dahl estate has decided to restrict professional productions to make room for a different adaptation.Six years after Mr. Marx\u2019s bet, Mr. Paul handed him a check at the opening night party. \u201cMy money was safe,\u201d Mr. Marx said.Other mentors have stepped in, too. Stephen Schwartz, the writer of \u201cPippin\u201d and \u201cWicked,\u201d has been advising them since Mr. Paul met him as an undergraduate. Mr. Schwartz recommended them to Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty (\u201cRagtime\u201d), who admitted them to a Dramatists Guild fellowship. Ms. Ahrens and Mr. Flaherty assigned them to observe the development of \u201cNext to Normal,\u201d where they met the director Michael Greif (best known for \u201cRent\u201d), who is now directing \u201cDear Evan Hansen.\u201dThe new show was borne from an observation Mr. Pasek had about how his own high school community reacted when a former student died unexpectedly; he noted the desire of many, including himself, to be counted among the bereaved for someone they did not know well.Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul had talked about the idea for years when a producer, Stacey Mindich, who had helped commission \u201cDogfight,\u201d offered to finance their dream project. She introduced them to the work of a playwright, Steven Levenson, who became the \u201cDear Evan Hansen\u201d book writer, turning their musings into a narrative.The duo\u2019s work demonstrates an understanding of the contemporary lives of teenagers, but several of their collaborators have also been struck by their empathy for parents. \u201cThe insight they seem to have into the heart of a middle-aged mother has been there as long as I\u2019ve known them,\u201d said Ms. Jones, who has played Pasek and Paul mothers in \u201cA Christmas Story\u201d and \u201cDear Evan Hansen.\u201d\u201cThey use these tiny moments to describe enormous feelings that have no words \u2014 a lyric about a Ninja Turtle night-light, or glow stars on the ceiling,\u201d she said, referring to a song that was used during the early stages of \u201cDear Evan Hansen.\u201dBoth Ms. Jones and Mr. Platt distinctly remember the day Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul brought in a new song, \u201cSo Big/So Small,\u201d in which her character describes the impact of the breakup of her marriage on his character\u2019s childhood. \u201cIt makes you die inside because it\u2019s so real,\u201d she said. Mr. Platt agreed. \u201cEverybody was a big wreck.\u201dAs they now prepare for the openings of the musical and movie, Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul describe what looks like sudden success as largely a coincidence. They have been working on \u201cDear Evan Hansen\u201d for six years, they finished writing songs for \u201cTrolls\u201d and \u201cLa La Land\u201d more than a year ago, and they haven\u2019t yet begun work on \u201cSnow White.\u201dBut still \u2014 on one particularly busy recent day, they started in Dumbo, Brooklyn, at 8:30 a.m. for a \u201cGreatest Showman\u201d script meeting; traveled to Midtown to tweak \u201cDear Evan Hansen\u201d arrangements with their orchestrator, Alex Lacamoire; split up so Mr. Paul could go to a Chelsea studio to record tracks for \u201cShowman\u201d while Mr. Pasek sat in on auditions for Mr. Platt\u2019s understudy; went to MoMA for a screening of \u201cLa La Land\u201d hosted by Jennifer Lawrence; and then to an after-party at the Rainbow Room\u2019s Bar SixtyFive.Most days aren\u2019t nearly that varied or that glamorous. And at the start of each project, it is still the two of them, trying to figure out how to tell a story through music.\u201cNothing changes \u2014 the next time we have to write a song we\u2019re going to sit down at a piano and bang our heads against it for a long time and talk ourselves blue in the face about what it should be,\u201d Mr. Paul said.Mr. Pasek jumped in, finishing the thought: \u201cFacing the blank page doesn\u2019t get any easier.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seeds of a Fintech Start-Up Sometimes Come From the Trenches", "Date": "2016-11-23", "News": "Supported byEntrepreneurshipWho says the most useful start-up ideas come from millennials fresh from dropping out of Stanford?Some recent tech-based financial innovations haven\u2019t come from venture capitalists or young hotshots but rather from professionals who have toiled away in their industry for decades.Sheryl Rowling, 60, is a financial planner in San Diego who was constantly overwhelmed by the complexity of rebalancing her clients\u2019 portfolios. In portfolio management, rebalancing requires periodic adjustment of client holdings to a preset target of stocks, bonds and cash assembled to meet their goals while minimizing taxes.Although advisers need to keep clients on track with investment goals, rebalancing is often tedious and complex. The process was even more demanding because Ms. Rowling placed high priority on incorporating tax-saving strategies as well. Over the years, she realized that portfolio rebalancing could be automated with the right software.About 10 years ago, her firm was one of the first to put in place one of the early rebalancing software solutions. The software cost $50,000 a year and it took two people 20 hours a week for six months to gear up.When the future of that program became uncertain, Ms. Rowling decided there had to be a better way. She figured if she could design a simpler, more affordable, tax-savvy solution for her own firm, it would also be useful to others.\u201cMost bread-and-butter advisers couldn\u2019t afford six months and $50,000 a year to automate rebalancing,\u201d Ms. Rowling said. \u201cI thought there could be a better, more affordable solution.\u201dAlthough Ms. Rowling had no experience in software coding, she assembled a team to create a program. She financed the development using revenue from her advisory practice, which now has $270 million in assets under management.In 2007, the product that emerged was Total Rebalance Expert, or TRX, which automates the rebalancing process for advisory firms and saves clients money on taxes.Ms. Rowling epitomizes the model of the internal start-up. Unlike the typical profile of a tech-oriented millennial, some entrepreneurs are middle-age, have been in a profession for decades and never thought they would be creating in-demand software.Companies like these eschew the traditional route of angel and venture-capital investing after running businesses for years.David Lyon, 41, who was a Chicago-based registered investment adviser, followed a similar path. A few years ago, he realized that he needed a simple way of effectively communicating with clients about changes in their portfolios or financial plans.To address that, Mr. Lyon started building his own software in 2012. He had a workable package a year later.What emerged was Oranj, a cloud-based platform that \u201callows advisers to maximize time and provide the same level of service across account size.\u201dLike many professionals engaged in their own start-ups, Mr. Lyon also self-financed, or \u201cbootstrapped,\u201d the development of Oranj. He eventually sold his advisory practice to focus on Oranj.He would not disclose revenue for his platform, but said his sales growth was 225 percent year-to-date since 2015. He has hired 47 employees and serves 400 advisory firms.Oranj has plenty of competition: There are dozens of advisory platforms on the market, but Oranj helps advisers avoid conflicts of interest, Mr. Lyon said.The platform lets advisers track every client email, call and portfolio change on one \u201cdashboard\u201d page. And clients receive investment advice that\u2019s \u201cagnostic,\u201d that is, not wedded to one investment manager.More opportunities may lay, at least according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, in the area of asset and wealth management, an industry slow to change.Some overhauls are coming about as a result of the Labor Department\u2019s recent rule mandating that financial advisers offering retirement advice act in the best interests of clients.It has been widely speculated that the Republican-dominated Congress and White House will challenge it or roll back the rules. But until that happens, millions of financial advisers, brokers and agents are setting out to meet the conditions of the rule.As a practical matter, this means that advisers must also be able to prove to a regulator that an investment is in the best financial interests of their client and not done just to generate a commission for the adviser.Despite the intense competition to provide financial advice, these start-ups have many opportunities to tap. For example, most of the new \u201crobo-advisers\u201d that provide automated advice on investments are not set up for customized advice on portfolio, tax, estate and post-retirement planning.And older clients need to optimize Social Security benefits, manage retirement withdrawals, monitor tax efficiency and keep up with their investments. Those create openings for advisers who can come up with practical solutions in-house, a growing trend in recent years.For professionals seeking to start a business, getting off the ground can be the most difficult part.Ms. Rowling said she went into her start-up \u201cna\u00efvely and didn\u2019t realize the extent to which technology had to change.\u201d She also realized that her project took more capital and time than she imagined. In addition, after feedback from customers, she had to make adjustments.Ultimately, though, sometimes solving everyday problems left her feeling at the forefront of entrepreneurship.\u201cIt requires a lot of capital to create something there\u2019s a wide need for,\u201d Ms. Rowling added. \u201cAlways be on the cutting edge.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When A.I. Matures, It May Call J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber \u2018Dad\u2019", "Date": "2016-11-27", "News": "Supported byIn a visit with him in this idyllic Swiss city in the mountains near the Italian border, it is easy to understand why he believes that his pioneering work in the field often, as the comedian liked to say, gets no respect.Far away in Silicon Valley, on the other side of the world, the tech industry is building cars that drive themselves and household appliances that respond to your voice commands and even try to predict what you will do next.In certain circles, the people who did the early work that made this technology possible are stars. There is Sebastian Thrun, a roboticist who did groundbreaking research on self-driving cars at Google. Adam Cheyer and Tom Gruber worked on the A.I. program Siri, later acquired by Apple. And Facebook hired Yann LeCun, an expert in \u201cneural networks\u201d who left New York University to start a research program at the social media giant.On a recent train ride to Zurich, Dr. Schmidhuber, an athletic 53-year-old who is co-director of the Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research here, reflected on how he believed his early research was often overlooked or ignored. \u201cIt\u2019s like much of the rest of society,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s postfactual.\u201dDr. Schmidhuber\u2019s complaints are well known within the fraternity of researchers who have turned what until a half-decade ago was an academic backwater into a multibillion-dollar industry. He has been accused of taking credit for other people\u2019s research and even using multiple aliases on Wikipedia to make it look as if people are agreeing with his posts.\u201cJ\u00fcrgen is manically obsessed with recognition and keeps claiming credit he doesn\u2019t deserve for many, many things,\u201d Dr. LeCun said in an email. \u201cIt causes him to systematically stand up at the end of every talk and claim credit for what was just presented, generally not in a justified manner.\u201dDr. Schmidhuber counters that criticism with a bigger point: He is not the only one who is not getting due credit among A.I. researchers. In fact, he says work going all the way back to the 1960s is regularly ignored by today\u2019s research luminaries.Although he insists he doesn\u2019t harbor ill will toward those better-known researchers, it grates on him that history hasn\u2019t been kinder. \u201cCertain researchers in my field have acted as if they invented something, although it was invented by other people whom they did not even mention,\u201d Dr. Schmidhuber said.But understanding the disconnect between his early work and his lack of celebrity isn\u2019t easy \u2014 and cannot be entirely explained by the fact that he lives thousands of miles from the tech industry\u2019s center of gravity.The dispute is about the roots of neural networks, which allow machines to learn by recognizing patterns that can then be applied generally. Applications include recognizing speech and language, visually identifying objects, navigating in self-driving cars and making robot hands grasp more deftly. As a scientific field, it dates to the 1940s. But only in recent years have researchers in this area made striking progress.For decades, neural networks were laboratory curiosities, often met with skepticism. But in the 1990s, with faster and cheaper computers as well as new ideas about how to design neural nets, there was finally progress.Just as humans do not restart learning from scratch every second, a certain type of neural network adds loops or memory that interpret each new word or observation in light of what has been previously observed. LSTM strikingly improved these networks, leading to huge jumps in accuracy.It may be that Dr. Schmidhuber\u2019s misfortune is that he was simply too early \u2014 a few years ahead of the powerful and more affordable computers we have today. It was not until recently that his concepts started to pan out.But between Dr. Schmidhuber\u2019s and Dr. Hochreiter\u2019s research and today\u2019s progress there was a big gap \u2014 and that\u2019s the rub. Other researchers say it took many contributors to get from Point A to Point B, where we are today.\u201cHe\u2019s done a lot of seminal stuff,\u201d said Gary Bradski, an A.I. scientist who created a popular computer vision system known as OpenCV. \u201cBut he wasn\u2019t the one who made it popular. It\u2019s kind of like the Vikings discovering America; Columbus made it real.\u201dDr. Schmidhuber also has a grand vision for A.I. \u2014 that self-aware or \u201cconscious machines\u201d are just around the corner \u2014 that causes eyes to roll among some of his peers. To put a fine point on the debate: Is artificial intelligence an engineering discipline, or a godlike field on the cusp of creating a new superintelligent species?Dr. Schmidhuber is firmly in the god camp. He maintains that the basic concepts for such technologies already exist, and that there is nothing magical about human consciousness. \u201cGenerally speaking, consciousness and self-awareness are overrated,\u201d he said, arguing that machine consciousness will emerge from more powerful computers and software algorithms much like those he has already designed.It\u2019s been an obsession since he was a teenager in Germany reading science fiction.\u201cAs I grew up I kept asking myself, \u2018What\u2019s the maximum impact I could have?\u2019\u201d Dr. Schmidhuber recalled. \u201cAnd it became clear to me that it\u2019s to build something smarter than myself, which will build something even smarter, et cetera, et cetera, and eventually colonize and transform the universe, and make it intelligent.\u201dToday, he will not be pinned down on when such thinking machines might arrive, saying only that given the vast improvements in computing power it will be soon.In 2014, he and others founded a company to commercialize some of the technology that he helped create and to work on \u201cgeneral purpose\u201d artificial intelligence.Nnaisense\u2019s chief executive is an American computer scientist, Faustino Gomez, who has been Dr. Schmidhuber\u2019s research collaborator for many years. He defends both his partner\u2019s claims of having done pioneering work and his optimism about the field that has begun shaking up industries and economies around the world.\u201cWe are at the beginning of the end of the beginning in A.I.,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Betsy DeVos Won\u2019t Be Able to Privatize U.S. Education", "Date": "2016-11-23", "News": "Supported bySchool ChoiceMarket-based school reforms generally come in two flavors: vouchers and charter schools. They differ in both structure and political orientation. Charter schools are public schools, open to all, accountable in varying degrees to public authorities, and usually run by nonprofit organizations. Vouchers, by contrast, allow students to attend any school, public or private, including those run by religious organizations and for-profit companies.While charters enjoy support from most Republicans and some Democrats, vouchers have a narrower political base, those who tend to favor free markets to replace many government responsibilities.That support made Ms. Devos a natural choice for Mr. Trump, who proposed a $20 billion federal voucher program on the campaign trail, and has likened the public school system to a monopoly business that needs to be broken up.But any effort to promote vouchers from Washington will run up against the basic structures of American education.The United States spends over $600 billion a year on public K-12 schools. Less than 9 percent of that money comes from the federal government, and it is almost exclusively dedicated to specific populations of children, most notably students with disabilities and students in low-income communities. There are no existing federal funds that can easily be turned into vouchers large enough to pay for school tuition on the open market.Mr. Trump\u2019s $20 billion proposal would be, by itself, very expensive. It may be hard to fit into a budget passed by a Republican Congress that has pledged to enact large tax cuts for corporations and citizens, expand the military and eliminate the budget deficit, all at the same time. Yet $20 billion isn\u2019t nearly enough to finance vouchers nationwide, which is why Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal assumes that states will kick in another $110 billion.States don\u2019t have that kind of money lying around. The only plausible source is existing school funding. But even if Ms. DeVos were to find a willing governor and state legislature, it\u2019s not that easy. Roughly half of all nonfederal education funding comes from local property taxes raised by over 13,000 local school districts. They and their elected representatives will have a say, too.This is where the intersection of geography and politics makes any national voucher plan much more difficult to enact. The practicality of school choice is highly related to population density. Children need to be able to get from home to school and back again every day. In a large metropolis with public transportation, there could be dozens of schools within reasonable travel distance of most families. In a small city, town or rural area, there will be few or none.And population density, as Americans saw in the last election, is increasingly the dividing line of the nation\u2019s politics. A significant number of Mr. Trump\u2019s most ardent supporters live in sparsely populated areas where school choice is logistically unlikely. At the same time, many of the municipalities where market reforms are theoretically much easier to put in voted overwhelmingly against the president-elect.In theory, information technology offers a way around the population density problem. Virtual schools can be attended from anywhere with an internet connection. For-profit colleges that have pocketed billions of dollars by offering low-quality online courses are poised to make a comeback under the Trump administration, which is likely to roll back President Obama\u2019s efforts to regulate them.But the federal government is a much larger financial contributor to colleges and universities than to K-12 schools, and college students don\u2019t need an adult looking after them all day. Ms. DeVos will probably be a boon to the relatively small, growing population of families that home-school their children. But most parents will still want their children in a school building during the day, taught by a teacher, not by a computer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Campaign\u2019s Easy Answers Confront Hard Reality", "Date": "2016-11-15", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneThe harvest had just begun when agents from the Immigration and Naturalization Service stormed across the onion fields of Vidalia, Ga., in 1998, sweeping up 21 immigrants who were trudging behind tractors without legal authorization to work in the United States, pulling onions out of the ground for 75 cents per 50-pound bag.And immigration enforcement caved: Shortly after the raid, onion growers in 19 counties were granted a temporary amnesty to keep their workers as long as their paperwork looked legitimate.Welcome to reality.Last week, Donald J. Trump was elected president based on a straightforward promise to make the United States great again. He aimed his message primarily at tens of millions of white working-class Americans who feel left behind in the growing economic prosperity, undercut by the advancement of minorities and women, competition from illegal immigrants at home and cheap workers in other countries.This week, Mr. Trump is being forced to acknowledge that his straightforward solutions are, in fact, much less straightforward than he promised they would be.Mr. Trump has not yet clarified his promises on trade, but most experts say it will be very hard to simply walk away from Nafta and impose a 45 percent tariff against imports from China. \u201cIn an age of global supply chains,\u201d said Dani Rodrik of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, \u201cyou cannot take a chain saw to trade agreements and not end up cutting your foot off.\u201dSure. But where does that leave Donald Trump\u2019s supporters? To Larry Bartels, the political scientist at Vanderbilt University, the apparent shift in Mr. Trump\u2019s position is unsurprising. Politicians don\u2019t follow the interests of average voters, he argues, they hew to the interests of the rich.\u201cTrump\u2019s \u2018populist\u2019 instincts on economic policy seem to have fallen by the wayside over the course of the campaign,\u201d Mr. Bartels told me. \u201cAnd the need to work with Republicans in Congress will probably reinforce that shift.\u201dIn his book \u201cUnequal Democracy,\u201d published this year, Mr. Bartels offered a snapshot of voter preferences in 2006, before the onset of the financial crisis. On the bottom of the income scale, most voters supported policies to provide jobs and equalize incomes. But at the top, most opposed them. The picture was reversed when voters were asked about cuts to government spending. The rich were much more supportive than the poor.And what did voters get? After a brief flurry of fiscal stimulus to stop the economy from careening into the abyss, they got a round of automatic budget cuts called the sequester.\u201cWhat is going to happen is unclear,\u201d said Jacob Hacker, a Yale political scientist. \u201cBut what Paul Ryan will want to do is quite clear.\u201dFinally, while Mr. Trump has pitched deregulation \u2014 notably the repeal of President Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan \u2014 as an engine for job growth in the nation\u2019s Rust Belt, he is also set to deliver enormous gains to Wall Street by undoing core provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, which was established to hem in the financial sector and prevent a repeat of the crisis of 2008.There is definitely a silver lining if Mr. Trump is really letting go of the most extreme elements of his agenda. The economic and social dislocation that would be caused by deporting 5 percent of American workers would be immense.But the only real sliver of good news for blue-collar workers, is in Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal for infrastructure spending on a yet unspecified but surely huge scale. But how will Mr. Trump\u2019s base respond if that program is financed largely by temporarily cutting corporate taxes to 10 percent or so to encourage businesses with profits parked abroad to bring them home? And would it be enough to restore prosperity to the working class?For decades, political analysts on the left have been perplexed by working-class Americans who give their vote to a Republican Party whose motivating principle revolves around delivering tax cuts to the rich. This time around, however, they delivered their vote to a Republican who promised to directly address their plight.He has already come up short. Oxford Economics, under its most upbeat assumptions \u2014 a big tax cut and infrastructure spending delivering a lot of economic stimulus while new trade barriers are limited \u2014 foresees growth picking up for a while before falling back to the rate of roughly 2 percent a year that the United States has been living with for the last seven years. If Mr. Trump pursues all-out protectionism, however, Oxford Economics predicts the American economy will plunge into recession.Under either situation, the frustrated working-class voters who cast their vote for Mr. Trump are likely to remain as frustrated as ever: stuck with insufficient education in a world of low growth and diminishing opportunity. Maybe they will figure out that most of the industrial jobs they lost are gone for good, that protectionism can\u2019t bring them back, and that the main driver of their plight is technological change.The critical question then is not so much how Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters will respond politically but how Mr. Trump will react to their inevitable disappointment.Mr. Rodrik \u2014 who is generally sympathetic to the notion that globalization has gone overboard, imposing opaque global rules on democratic governance \u2014 still worries about Mr. Trump\u2019s response.\u201cWhat happens when Trump realizes he cannot adequately respond to the expectations he has raised?\u201d he asked. \u201cDoes he respond to economic failure like all populists around the world do \u2014 by further polarizing the nation and deepening divisions based on identity? And what does that do the quality of our democracy?\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this column misstated when the person shown was arrested. It was October 2015, not last month.Advertisement"}

Were you in leadership roles early on?I was playing trumpet, and it was a 200-piece marching band, exactly like in \u201cFriday Night Lights.\u201d I became a section leader, and we would get up at 6:30 in the morning and do all our drills when it was still dark.Then I went to Stanford, where I had a lot of great leadership opportunities. As a sophomore, I ran the kitchen for our dormitory. Another guy and I had a budget of about $300,000 a year and we were responsible for feeding 80 people and hiring staff.When you were younger, did you mind moving so often?I don\u2019t remember kicking or screaming. I always just thought it was a pretty good adventure. I\u2019m pretty adaptable. I\u2019m good at packing and unpacking.Tell me more about your parents.They both have a good sense of humor and like jokes, and humor\u2019s a big part of what I value and how I lead. And they\u2019re both analytical. Mom\u2019s an accountant. Dad was a physics major but then became an engineer.I remember when I was in second grade, we needed a new TV. All my friends would just go to the store and buy one, but my dad bought a Heathkit, and we had to put together the parts. I remember being mortified and saying, \u201cDad, why can\u2019t we go buy a TV like everybody else?\u201dBut in retrospect, it taught me that everything is made by people. We look at our technology now, like iPhones, and I think a lot of people see them as magical obelisks from the mountains that Steve Jobs bestows on us.Early leadership lessons for you?I didn\u2019t understand the role of simplicity and messaging early on. One of the things that happened at one of my start-ups was that I would get bored saying the same thing every day. So I decided to change it up a little bit. But then everybody had a different idea of what I thought because I was mixing it up.So my big lesson was the importance of a simple message, and saying it the same way over and over. If you\u2019re going to change it, change it in a big way, and make sure everyone knows it\u2019s a change. Otherwise keep it static.You spend a lot of your time meeting with C.E.O.s to decide whether to invest in their companies. How do you assess them?One is sort of a context-free assessment, which is, who is this person and how do they behave? The other is a contextual assessment, which is, am I any good for this person? There are some amazing C.E.O.s who I just don\u2019t know how to interact with because of stylistic differences.You have to have both because you want to make good investments, but you also want to make good investments where you can work with the person. I ask a lot of questions, but I almost don\u2019t care what the questions are. When people start talking about their business plan, I\u2019ll say, \u201cWhat about this, what about this, what about this?\u201dYou start to expand the scope of the questions to try to see two things. One is the quality of their thought process. And the other is how they interact with you. Do they become defensive? Do they become aggressive? Are they listening?You\u2019re trying to get a sense of whether, in a complicated situation with a lot of things going on, can they be honest and candid and still get to a productive place. Sometimes you get honest and candid, and sometimes you get antagonistic or defensive.As a V.C., I\u2019ll meet with probably 400 companies a year and I\u2019ll invest in two of them. The context of those meetings is highly variable, and the power dynamics are all bizarre because you come into this 60-minute crucible moment. You have to go out of your way to make sure that your questioning is understood.When I was a V.C. at first, I would just ask my questions and kind of poke, poke, poke, poke. And now I\u2019ll say: \u201cLook, I\u2019m going to ask some things, and this might be kind of awkward, but I\u2019m just going to say it, and let\u2019s work our way through it. And it doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t believe in you and your company. I just want to understand where you are and what you think. I\u2019m going to ask some things and they might be wrong, but let\u2019s figure some things out together.\u201dThe one thing that\u2019s profoundly different about being a V.C. compared to an operator is that V.C.s talk a lot about FOMO \u2014 fear of missing out. You turn things down all the time, and you worry, what did I miss and what did I get wrong? As an operator, you focus 100 percent on what you\u2019re doing. As a V.C., you wonder what you\u2019re not doing. It\u2019s a difference in perspective.What career and life advice do you give to new college grads?The other thing I would say is to stay close to professions that create and make things, and stay away from derivative professions like finance. I think makers increasingly have the power in our society.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mike Pompeo, Sharp Critic of Hillary Clinton, Is Trump\u2019s Pick to Lead C.I.A.", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Representative Mike Pompeo was once pointedly asked why his committee\u2019s inquiry into the 2012 attacks on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, had dragged on longer than the Watergate investigation. He did not flinch.\u201cThis is worse, in some ways,\u201d he said, during an appearance on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in late 2015.A sharp, pugnacious Kansas congressman and former Army tank officer with degrees from West Point and Harvard, Mr. Pompeo was often an unyielding critic of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton \u2014 accusing her of orchestrating a wide-ranging cover-up of the Benghazi attacks.On Friday, President-elect Donald J. Trump, who defeated Mrs. Clinton after a bitter campaign, selected Mr. Pompeo to run the Central Intelligence Agency.If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Pompeo would become one of the most overtly partisan figures to take over the C.I.A. \u2014 a spy agency that, at least publicly, is supposed to operate above politics and avoid a direct role in policy making.At the same time, the C.I.A. has been central to America\u2019s secret wars waged in the years since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, giving the agency a shadow role in the counterterrorism policy of the past two presidents.As a member of the House Intelligence Committee, Mr. Pompeo (pronounced Pom-PAY-oh) has used his platform to denounce efforts in recent years to rein in some of the most polarizing counterterrorism programs of the post-Sept. 11 era.He has advocated a return to the bulk collection of Americans\u2019 domestic calling records \u2014 which Congress restricted though legislation last year \u2014 and he has denounced President Obama\u2019s decision in 2009 to close C.I.A. black-site prisons and also to require government interrogators to strictly adhere to the rules of the Army Field Manual.After a visit to the military prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, in 2013, he told a congressional committee that a hunger strike by detainees was a \u201cpolitical stunt.\u201dA list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.On Friday, some lawmakers \u2014 even Democrats \u2014 complimented Mr. Pompeo\u2019s work ethic and grasp of policy details. Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, praised Mr. Pompeo as \u201cbright and hard-working.\u201d\u201cWhile we have had our share of strong differences \u2014 principally on the politicization of the tragedy in Benghazi \u2014 I know that he is someone who is willing to listen and engage, both key qualities in a C.I.A. director,\u201d Mr. Schiff said.It appears that Mr. Pompeo\u2019s role in the Benghazi inquiry was a significant factor in Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to select him to lead the C.I.A. Some members of the president-elect\u2019s transition team viewed a competing candidate for the position, former Representative Mike Rogers of Michigan, as \u201csoft\u201d on Benghazi because Mr. Rogers, as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, oversaw a report that they believed was not tough enough on Mrs. Clinton.By contrast, Mr. Pompeo\u2019s relentless questioning of Mrs. Clinton during her October 2015 appearance before the House Select Committee on Benghazi raised his profile in Republican circles. When the committee concluded its work this year, Mr. Pompeo\u2019s position on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s role was an outlier even from most of his Republican colleagues.The chairman of the select committee, Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, did not put his name on the addendum.After graduating first in his class at West Point, Mr. Pompeo served as an armored Cavalry officer and was deployed in Germany during the final years of the Cold War. After leaving the Army, he attended Harvard Law School and was an editor of the Harvard Law Review.He arrived in Congress in 2011, after a sometimes bitter campaign against Raj Goyle, a Democratic state representative. During the campaign, one of Mr. Pompeo\u2019s aides promoted an article on Twitter that referred to Mr. Goyle, an Indian-American, as a \u201cTurban Topper.\u201dIn an interview Friday, Mr. Goyle said that Mr. Pompeo personally apologized to him for the incident, but that the campaign staff member was never fired.A view of two imaginary nations created by slicing the country along the sharp divide between Republican and Democratic Americas.\u201cAs we are entering an era where relations with Muslim and minority communities in America are extremely sensitive, his record and his approach should be scrutinized during the confirmation hearing,\u201d Mr. Goyle said.Mr. Pompeo has close ties to Charles G. and David H. Koch, the billionaire conservatives who are among the most significant activists in financing Republican candidates nationwide. Their company, Koch Industries, and its employees have contributed $357,000 to Mr. Pompeo since 2009.He has common cause with many senior Republican lawmakers on a range of issues, including a distaste for the agreement the United States and five world powers struck with Iran in 2015 to significantly limit Tehran\u2019s nuclear ability for more than a decade in return for lifting international oil and financial sanctions.Indeed, some members of the transition team pushed for Mr. Pompeo because they believe that picking an incumbent lawmaker would help foster better relations between Congress and the intelligence agencies. Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California and now the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement Friday that Mr. Pompeo \u201cwill undoubtedly develop a close working relationship with Congress in his new post.\u201dBut some Senate Democrats indicated that Mr. Pompeo could face a difficult confirmation hearing, citing some of his past comments, particularly his praise for the C.I.A.\u2019s former detention and interrogation program.That program \u201cwas ineffective, it was brutal and it stands in direct violation of American values,\u201d Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said in a statement. \u201cWe can never return to that dark time.\u201dMs. Feinstein, a member of the Intelligence Committee, led an investigation into the C.I.A.\u2019s program that produced a voluminous report \u2014 most of which remains classified.In her statement, she said she planned \u201cto speak with Congressman Pompeo about this issue during his confirmation process.\u201dReporting was contributed by Charlie Savage and Michael S.

{"Headline": "On Street Where U.S. Soldiers Died, Afghans Say: Taliban? What Taliban?", "Date": "2016-11-05", "News": "Supported byThe dead-end street is so narrow, 10 feet across and hemmed in by the high mud walls around homes on either side, that the answer was obvious: The gunfire that killed two American Special Forces soldiers could have come only from their street.The narrative by now is a familiar one. American ground forces get into trouble, and they respond by calling for airstrikes, which often kill civilians. According to the latest figures for Thursday\u2019s clash, 36 civilians were killed, along with 14 Taliban fighters and at least five coalition soldiers.In such cases, the Taliban quickly issue a social media bulletin blaming the Americans and their Afghan allies for any civilian deaths, survivors and relatives of the victims denounce the episode as an atrocity, the American military promises an investigation, and human rights groups deplore the senseless loss of civilian life.On the ground, as Thursday\u2019s events demonstrated, the reality is sometimes less straightforward.There is no doubt that many civilians died on this street, including 25 relatives of Allahdad, 70, who works as a teacher trainer for a Western-financed aid group and who, like many Afghans, has only one name.Allahdad lost a brother, four sisters-in-law, a cousin, three of his own children and 16 other relatives, mostly children 10 or younger. Three of his relatives\u2019 houses, all on the same block of the street on which the Americans died, were heavily bombed and severely damaged. Nearby homes were untouched.What Allahdad apparently did not lose were any fighting-age male relatives, and among the rest of the civilian dead there were only a handful; most were children, women and old people. Residents said their young men had all emigrated to Iran for work, but there were plenty of young men in the village on Friday, many of them heavily armed.Around the corner from the scene, two armed Taliban fighters were guarding a compound where a captured Afghan Army Humvee was parked. The vehicle, too, had been bombed. They shooed away a reporter.Funerals were taking place throughout the neighborhood on Friday, and at least 40 young men, apparently members of the Taliban, were visible. Most were not armed, but they carried walkie-talkies, and many wore heavy boots and combat fatigues.Graffiti painted on the mud walls declared an \u201cIslamic Emirate of Afghanistan\u201d and listed the names of those newly martyred.Yet Allahdad insisted that the airstrikes on his neighborhood had nothing to do with the Taliban.\u201cI am demanding that the government avenge this incident, arrest those who were involved and punish them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should also rebuild our houses destroyed in the airstrikes. If the government does not heed our demands we will do whatever we need to do, and we are ready to die in this way.\u201dMr. Ayub, the village elder, was similarly adamant that the villagers\u2019 human rights had, as he put it, been destroyed. \u201cThere were no Taliban in our houses when they bombed them,\u201d he said.\u201cAmericans are here to help us, they are not here to kill us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want them to be tried in international court. If the government does not accept our demands, we will block all routes, we will end our relations with the government, and we will stand with the Taliban.\u201dIt was clear that many in the neighborhood already did stand with the insurgents. Abdul Basit, 25, who said the airstrikes had wounded two sisters, two uncles and many other relatives, guided a reporter to the scene.Mr. Basit\u2019s clothes were splattered with blood, which he said was from helping his wounded relatives. He himself had nothing to do with the Taliban, he said, although he also warned the reporter exactly where to walk to avoid hidden explosive devices on the street leading to where the Americans had been killed.\u201cIf the Americans are trying to kill the Taliban, they shouldn\u2019t come to my home,\u201d Mr. Basit said. \u201cThey should go to where they are.\u201d Later, apparently unaware of the contradiction, he pointed out the home of one of the Taliban fighters who he said an American soldier had killed.Thursday\u2019s events started when Afghan and American Special Forces troops received intelligence about a planned attack on Kunduz that was to be launched from Boz Qandahari. Militants were meeting to plan the attack in a house on the stretch of street here, and the troops decided to carry out a night raid on it, said Ahmad Jawed Salim, the spokesman for the Afghan Special Forces in the region.Mr. Salim said 14 American Special Forces soldiers had quickly found themselves trapped on the dead-end street, taking small-arms fire from several of the houses.\u201cIf there were no Taliban militants in the area, why did we suffer so many casualties?\u201d he asked. In addition to the two American Special Forces soldiers who were killed, three Afghan Special Forces soldiers died in the fighting and seven other soldiers of both nationalities were wounded, he said.The trapped soldiers called in airstrikes, which continued from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m., according to residents, and the soldiers evacuated wounded and pursued Taliban leaders in the area. On the street where the Americans died, three houses were destroyed, but others close by were untouched by the bombing.Afghan military officials said the raid had targeted the homes of two Taliban commanders, Mullah Zia al-Rahman Mutaqi, who was planning the attack on the city, and Mullah Zamir, a subordinate. The civilian dead, said Gen. Dawlat Waziri, the Afghan military spokesman, included four members of Mr. Zamir\u2019s family and seven members of Mr. Mutaqi\u2019s family.At a news conference on Saturday, Brig. Gen. Charles H. Cleveland, the spokesman for the American military in Afghanistan, said, \u201cEvery aspect of this is clear that this was an effort to defend these troops who were down there trying to protect the people of Kunduz.\u201dHaroon Chakhansuri, the spokesman for President Ashraf Ghani, said: \u201cThe enemies of Afghanistan used the homes of civilians as shields in Boz Qandahari area. They did not care about their own families, which resulted in martyring of children and women.\u201dNajim Rahim reported from Boz Qandahari, and Rod Nordland from Kabul, Afghanistan.

{"Headline": "Our New Urban Oases", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Read an editor's letter by Jake Silverstein about the Design Issue.A former conduit for coal and other freight, the viaduct exudes the late-capitalist poetry of urban neglect. You can follow a path through waist-high weeds hacked by enterprising city explorers, who cut holes in fences emblazoned with NO TRESPASSING notices to gaze nostalgically at ghostly ironworks signage, or at the reddish girders of a defunct energy-transfer station. Paulownia trees dot the viaduct, another relic of long-gone global commerce: The tree\u2019s pistachio-shell-shaped seeds were used as packing material for Chinese porcelain in the 19th century, falling out of crates to seed and sprout along railways around the world.Soon this sprawling postindustrial vision, too, will be part of the past. Ground was broken last month on the Rail Park, a rehabilitation project to turn the Reading Viaduct into an elevated park. It follows a recent flurry of similar parks: the Bloomingdale Trail in Chicago, the Atlanta BeltLine and, of course, the wildly successful High Line in Chelsea in Manhattan. All drew inspiration from the Promenade Plant\u00e9e in Paris, completed in 1993, the first conversion of an elevated railway into a pedestrian park.If the new railway parks have revitalized the infrastructure of the early-20th-century industrial economy, the process of \u201ccapping,\u201d building green spaces over freeways, turns urban expressways, the hallmark of midcentury planning, into vital links among communities. In 2012, Klyde Warren Park capped the Woodall Rodgers freeway in Dallas, bringing together northern and southern parts of the city, while Boston\u2019s notorious Big Dig project was covered by the Rose Kennedy Greenway in 2008. Monuments to ways of life and work that we no longer require are being converted, one by one, into promenades and playgrounds, changing what we think cities are for and how they ought to be used.This model of urban design has come to be known as landscape urbanism. One of its primary theoreticians, Charles Waldheim, a professor at Harvard\u2019s Graduate School of Design, traces its roots to Frederick Law Olmsted. In his book \u201cLandscape as Urbanism,\u201d Waldheim notes that Olmsted was one of the earliest figures to call himself a landscape architect (though it was a term that Olmsted considered inadequate), and that he was full of visions for integrating landscape and urban life. But Olmsted\u2019s Central Park, for example, is a classic instance of placing nature in opposition to the city: it\u2019s meant to be a balm, an oasis; in rocky, deliberately overgrown sections like the Ramble it mimics the wilderness a city must exorcise and destroy.The landscape urbanist, by contrast, sees the decline of the industrial city as prompting a variety of opportunities for naturalism. In cities dominated by service economies, Waldheim argues, landscape urbanism can clean up the industrial economy by reintegrating it with the natural world. In so doing, it creates entirely new urban experiences: The High Line makes it possible to saunter in the air, among apartments and offices, at a much slower pace than at street level. As James Corner, a designer of the High Line, once wrote, \u201cThe visitor becomes as much a performer as viewer, more deeply engaged in participating in the theatricality of urban life \u2014 the promenade as elevated catwalk, urban stage and social condenser.\u201d The experience is nonetheless limited and directed, a kind of soft coercion. You aren\u2019t encouraged to linger on the High Line: with its crush of tourists, it\u2019s more a Manhattan-themed ride than a park.The new parks aren\u2019t just oases, then; they emphasize the intertwining of landscape and industry. It\u2019s no coincidence that landscape urbanists are beguiled by Detroit, a crumbling monument to what is sometimes called Fordism \u2014 after Henry Ford\u2019s mass-production-mass-consumption model \u2014 a paradise of dereliction reclaimed by nature. A \u201cformerly urban\u201d space, in the terminology of Waldheim and his peers, it offers little for traditional architecture but everything for an urbanist trained to see value in rescuing the decaying built environment. Detroit, for a landscape urbanist, is a symbol for processes taking place in cities everywhere: once-bustling ports shrunk by the advent of the shipping container, hulking buildings abandoned as low-wage economies replace high-wage ones. In the Qianhai area of Shenzhen, China, Corner designed a new district that reclaims industrial land, repurposing the tributaries of several channels recently used for drainage as \u201cwaterfront.\u201dSimilarly, defunct rail lines are sometimes meant not to be repurposed but to be re-embraced. Both the Atlanta BeltLine and Chicago\u2019s Bloomingdale Trail take transportation infrastructure and turn it into newer transportation infrastructure. The BeltLine connects disparate neighborhoods by bike (and soon, streetcar) in a city that is a byword for sprawl, while the Bloomingdale Trail becomes a raised express lane for cyclists and walkers. Klyde Warren \u2014 a well used if anodyne public park, filled routinely with yoga classes \u2014 connects Dallas\u2019s Uptown and Downtown neighborhoods, previously walled off by the freeway. It\u2019s now become possible, as I discovered, to walk through a generous portion of Dallas, something unimaginable just a few years ago. It\u2019s post-post-industrial planning \u2014 trying to make whole the freeway-carved cities that date from an era when car-centric planning was in vogue.Yet for all its power to bring communities together, repurposing freeways and old industry can go hand in hand with gentrification, increasing inequality and displacement. The effect has been profound in formerly down-at-heel spots along Atlanta\u2019s 22-mile BeltLine, where old industrial sites have been converted into new market-rate and luxury housing. Philadelphia\u2019s Rail Park is already being promoted by local landlords as a selling point for new housing in the surrounding Callowhill neighborhood (a section is currently being rebranded as the Spring Arts District). In both instances, it\u2019s not that the parks created demand where none existed but that they drove, or will drive, already ongoing development. The High Line did not suddenly draw attention to an otherwise unknown Meatpacking District (though it certainly drove interest in Hudson Yards). Still, even boosters concede that these projects have the potential to displace longtime residents. Ryan Gravel, whose master\u2019s thesis in city planning and architecture became the basis for the BeltLine, eventually resigned from the board of the Atlanta BeltLine Partnership. Gravel wanted more focus on and subsidies for affordable housing.It\u2019s instructive to imagine what this model would look like applied to transit. Would it be legitimate to have a Friends of the New York City Subway that raises millions of dollars in private funding in order to retrofit a section of subway line \u2014 which, newly cleaned up and rat-free, would spur development in the surrounding area \u2014 and then receive more in taxpayer dollars than any other subway line? Why not privatize everything?We haven\u2019t gotten there yet. Parks still subsist largely on public funds. But places like Central Park and Bryant Park look better than they did in the 1970s in part because they get a significant boost from partnerships and private fund-raising. The High Line is perhaps now the greatest outdoor corporate event space in New York City. The Friends of Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx have a tougher time. What is so attractive about the parks, in other words, is also what\u2019s wrong with them. The new public parks give form to cities misshapen by abandoned industry, but threaten to bring into being a novel form of inequality in cities already rife with it. They exude the priorities of a new Gilded Age, even as they cover up the eyesores of an old one. \u2666Nikil Saval is an editor at n+1 and the author of \u201cCubed: A Secret History of the Workplace.\u201dProduced by Rodrigo De Benito Sanz and Linsey FieldsAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Marvel\u2019s \u2018Inhumans\u2019 TV Series Will Arrive via Imax Theaters", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 One of Marvel Entertainment\u2019s most sprawling superhero mythologies, the Inhumans, is headed to the small screen in a major way.But the Inhuman likes of Black Bolt, Crystal and Lockjaw, the teleporting dog, will first appear on big screens. As in the biggest.Shortly thereafter, the episodes \u2014 edited to include additional scenes \u2014 will run on ABC, with new installments unspooling in typical prime-time fashion. (The look of the series on TV will be enhanced due to Imax technology.)The series, billed as a family action-adventure with signature Marvel humor, will be set in the present day, with some action seeming to take place on the moon.The deal is significant for several reasons.As their live audiences have dwindled and competition has increased, broadcast networks have struggled to create sizzle around new shows. ABC, which urgently needs new hits, is betting that Imax, with its strength among younger consumers known as fanboys, will help make \u201cThe Inhumans\u201d a must-see event.\u201cIn the incredibly crowded marketplace of television, we are very excited about this because it\u2019s a unique and innovative and bold way to debut our best new content,\u201d Ben Sherwood, president of Disney-ABC Television Group, said by phone.ABC wants what Marvel Television and ABC Studios have supplied to Netflix \u2014 buzz-creating, widely watched series like \u201cLuke Cage\u201d and \u201cDaredevil.\u201dA co-financing arrangement with Imax will allow ABC and Marvel to spend more to make \u201cThe Inhumans,\u201d which will include cinema-quality visual effects. (One criticism of \u201cAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\u201d has been that certain action sequences are less than dazzling.) Imax has never before served as a financing participant in a TV series, according to Richard L. Gelfond, the company\u2019s chief executive.\u201cWe think this is a business for us,\u201d Mr. Gelfond said of the financing arrangement. \u201cBecause Imax has an equity participation both in the pilot and in the series, this deal will be financially advantageous to Imax on an ongoing basis.\u201dImax has dabbled in the past at showing TV content on its supersize screens. Last year, for instance, it played a couple of Season 4 episodes of \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d But a series has never before made its debut through Imax, which has more than 1,000 locations worldwide.\u201cWe see it as a way to extend the Imax brand and diversify our revenue,\u201d Mr. Gelfond said.\u201cWe\u2019re confident our exhibition partners will be excited about this,\u201d Mr. Gelfond said. \u201cThe response from conceptual conversations has been extremely positive.\u201dMr. Sherwood, noting pains have been taken to make sure ABC affiliates are on board with the Imax debut, said the \u201csneak peek\u201d of \u201cThe Inhumans\u201d would include \u201cbig, theatrical moments specially conceived for the Imax screen.\u201d The series debut will also come at a time when no Marvel movies are playing in theaters.\u201cWe\u2019ve worked very carefully with our friends at Marvel Studios \u2014 and this is a critical point \u2014 to make sure that calendar-wise and content-wise we are only enhancing the Marvel universe,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thin Line Splits Donald Trump\u2019s Politics and Businesses", "Date": "2016-11-05", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisToday Mr. Trump is making his most selfless pledge of all, promising that if elected president he will walk away from his beloved business empire so he can devote himself entirely to the American people. \u201cIf I become president, I couldn\u2019t care less about my company,\u201d he said at one debate. \u201cIt\u2019s peanuts.\u201dWith the presidential campaign in the homestretch, Hillary Clinton is now taking dead aim at Mr. Trump\u2019s professed altruistic purpose. She and her supporters are suggesting that Mr. Trump regards the White House as one more moneymaking venture, the most lucrative opportunity of all to advance his family fortune.Mr. Trump managed to save millions in personal taxes by borrowing \u2013 then losing \u2013 other people\u2019s money.\u201cImagine having a president who owes hundreds of millions of dollars to foreign banks and other foreign entities that he doesn\u2019t tell us about,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said at a rally in Pittsburgh on Friday. \u201cAsk yourself: So if he\u2019s sitting across the table negotiating with people from those countries, is he going to put his own financial interests ahead of America\u2019s interests?\u201dAt the same rally, one of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s supporters, Mark Cuban, the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks, put it even more bluntly: \u201cThere\u2019s going to come a time, if Donald Trump, God help us, was president, where a Putin or an Assad would say to him, \u2018Donald, if you do this, I\u2019ll give you $20 billion,\u2019\u201d Mr. Cuban said, referring to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.\u201cDo you think he\u2019s going to do what\u2019s right for the country? Or do you think he is going to take the money?\u201dThat review reveals plenty of reasons to be skeptical of Mr. Trump\u2019s oft-stated promise to direct every ounce of his business acumen and negotiating prowess in service of the American people. But the same review also reveals patterns of behavior and qualities of leadership that could indeed help Mr. Trump fulfill his now-familiar sales pitch to voters: \u201cIf we could run our country the way I\u2019ve run my company, we would have a country that you would be so proud of.\u201dAnother recurring theme \u2014 one that might come in handy given the inherent unpredictability of the White House \u2014 is Mr. Trump\u2019s strategic flexibility.When either his ambitions or circumstances shift, Mr. Trump has shown himself willing to make swift and dramatic course corrections in his businesses. From the moment Mr. Trump took the reins of the real estate business his father founded, he was bent on reinvention, steering its focus away from mostly middle-class apartment projects in the other boroughs to big, splashy commercial developments in Manhattan. It is a formula Mr. Trump has returned to time and again as he has cycled through different money making personas.The tax records obtained by The Times show that Donald J. Trump claimed a $916 million loss that could have allowed him to legally avoid paying federal income taxes for up to 18 years.\u201cIn my whole life, I\u2019ve gotten things done,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview with The Times in May. \u201cWhether it\u2019s getting a city built on the West Side of Manhattan or getting zoning board approvals, my whole life has been finding a consensus.\u201dFurther complicating matters is his plan to have his children continue running his business empire should he occupy the Oval Office. \u201cI would probably have my children run it with my executives, and I wouldn\u2019t ever be involved because I wouldn\u2019t care about anything but our country,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a debate in January.The potential for conflicts of interest are all the more glaring given the prominent role his children have played in his political operation, both as surrogates and advisers.\u201cWe are not going to be involved in government,\u201d Donald Trump Jr. said during an interview with ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos. Mr. Stephanopoulos asked how conflicts could be avoided given that Mr. Trump was aware of all his business interests. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to discuss those things,\u201d his son replied. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Trust me.\u201dIn June, Mr. Trump posted a message on Twitter that suggested how difficult this may be for him. Mr. Trump said that he had \u201cinstructed my execs\u201d to reopen Trump University if he is elected president. \u201cSo much interest in it!\u201dThis article is based on reporting by New York Times journalists who have been examining Donald J.

State financial assistance would be put to better use on companies that provide manufacturing jobs, he said, adding, \u201cthose are the kinds of jobs that raise up and help maintain a middle class that is struggling to hold on.\u201dA spokesman for AQR said, \u201cThis is a win-win job incentive program for both AQR and Connecticut that builds on our strong record of job growth in the state.\u201d A spokesman from Bridgewater declined to comment.Financial firms have been assisted in Connecticut in the past. Before the financial crisis, cities like Stamford, Conn., thrived as the banking industry, lured by tax credits and other government incentives, set up operations there. But firms like UBS of Switzerland and the Royal Bank of Scotland retreated sharply after the crisis, and the number of employees in Connecticut plunged. In Stamford, UBS was said to have the largest trading floor in the world before the crisis. Now, the floor is largely empty and parts of the city feel abandoned.Connecticut is fighting to keep businesses from leaving after a tax increase last year. The loans to Bridgewater and AQR are part of an initiative by Gov. Dannel P. Malloy to encourage big companies to move their headquarters to Connecticut and to provide incentives to expand for companies already there. In January, General Electric announced it would move its headquarters to Boston from Fairfield, Conn., after four decades in the state.\u201cLet me put it this way \u2014 usually companies don\u2019t call up and say \u2018We\u2019re going to leave if you don\u2019t pay us,\u2019\u201d Catherine Smith, the commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development, said in an interview.\u201cBetween the lines, we understand that these companies are looking elsewhere. In this case, it was not overt but we wanted to provide something that would be competitive,\u201d Ms. Smith said of the AQR deal. \u201cThere is competition out there for these companies \u2014 other states approach them or they approach other states, and in a number of cases we have had to play defense.\u201d Bridgewater, she said, was looking at a site in New York when Connecticut began talks with the investment firm.The financial aid effort has been roundly criticized by organized labor.Lori J. Pelletier, president of the Connecticut A.F.L.-C.I.O., remarked on the financial package for AQR in a statement, saying: \u201cWhile the state continues to cut vital public services to the state\u2019s most vulnerable and lay off critical service providers, the governor leads the way to line the pockets of hedge fund managers.\u201dAs part of the AQR deal, the company will be eligible for $28 million in loans that will be forgiven if the company keeps 540 jobs within Connecticut and creates up to 600 new jobs over the next 10 years.AQR will also receive $7 million in grants, disbursed in phases, to help pay for an expansion. The company moved its operations to Connecticut in 2004 and is based in Greenwich.Mr. Asness co-founded AQR as a hedge fund in 1998.

{"Headline": "Federal Watchdog Agency Steps Up Inquiry Into Home Contracts", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "Supported byThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the nation\u2019s top consumer watchdog, is stepping up an investigation into seller-financed home sales that target lower-income home buyers unable to get a traditional mortgage.The regulatory agency on Monday disclosed that it recently ordered two major companies that offer high-interest installment contracts called contracts for deed to comply with a civil investigative demand for documents. The request is a sign that the investigation is advancing.The two firms, which challenged the demand for documents, are Harbour Portfolio Advisors of Dallas and National Asset Advisors of Columbia, S.C.Harbour Portfolio bought more than 6,700 single-family homes after the financial crisis of 2008, most of them from Fannie Mae, a government-controlled mortgage finance firm, through bulk sales. Harbour paid $10,000 or less for most of the homes, which were foreclosed on during the financial crisis, and sells them \u201cas is.\u201dThis year, Harbour began to sell off more than 600 homes with existing contracts for deeds in place to other investment firms and individual investors.\u201cHarbour has been regulated at the state level since its inception, and it has always prided itself on following the law and treating consumers fairly,\u201d said a Harbour spokeswoman. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe contracts for deed are a consumer financial product or service under the C.F.P.B.\u2019s authority. Since these investigations are quite daunting and costly for a small organization such as our own, we thought it appropriate to exercise our right to challenge the C.F.P.B.\u2019s basis for jurisdiction.\u201dHarbour Portfolio is represented by lawyers with Hudson Cook, a Maryland-based law firm that specializes in consumer finance regulatory matters.A lawyer for National Asset said the firm stood by its legal filing sent to the agency opposing the document request.The five-year-old regulatory agency has recently sought to flex its muscles with enforcement action \u2014 announcing new rules this year that would prevent many financial companies from forcing consumers to resolve disputes through mandatory arbitration. It has also worked on a new set of regulations for payday loans \u2014 which often carry high interest rates and predatory features.Yet after last week\u2019s election of Donald J. Trump, the future of the regulatory agency seems more uncertain than ever.President-elect Trump has signaled that his administration will seek to roll back some of the financial reform regulations and legislation enacted by the Obama administration after the financial crisis.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has been a favorite target for critics in Congress and on Wall Street who contend the agency has been too aggressive and strayed from its mandate of better regulating the mortgage market by venturing into subprime auto loans, mandatory arbitration and payday lending.But the investigation of contract for deed firms would seem to fall within the broad purview of the agency to oversee national standards for the mortgage market.Contracts for deed and similar products \u2014 such as rent-to-own deals for buying homes \u2014 have become more prominent since the financial crisis because of the unavailability of smaller mortgages in urban and rural communities. These alternative deals, in which the seller retains ownership to a home until a contract is paid off, are popular in some Midwestern states hit hard by the foreclosure crisis.Seller-financed transactions are particularly popular in Michigan and Ohio, two states that helped propel Mr. Trump to victory.RealtyTrac, a property data service, estimates that on average 20,000 homes a year have been sold nationally through contracts for deed since 2009 \u2014 and the pace of deals has quickened since the crisis.But it is difficult to know just how many homes are sold through contracts for deed or rent-to-own leases because not all states require such transactions to be publicly recorded.Advertisement"}

Winters, the lender\u2019s chief executive, said that the inquiry related to a securities business that it ceased more than a year ago and that the \u201congoing impact on our revenue is very limited.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t comment on specific investigations beyond what we have disclosed,\u201d he said.Regulators in Hong Kong have taken a hard line against misleading or fraudulent stock market listings in recent years after a series of accounting failures and frauds, primarily involving companies from mainland China.A Hong Kong inquiry would be the latest legacy regulatory issue to emerge as Mr. Winters seeks to turn around Standard Chartered\u2019s prospects. The lender has faced increased regulatory scrutiny in the United States in recent years over its monitoring of suspicious transactions, and it has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in fines.Under a so-called deferred-prosecution agreement with United States authorities, Standard Chartered is required to report any potential wrongdoing to the Justice Department. At the same time, any additional misconduct could prompt prosecutors to revoke the deferred-prosecution agreement and force the bank to plead guilty.The Hong Kong disclosure came as Standard Chartered reported its third-quarter results. Pretax profit fell 64 percent to $153 million from $430 million in the same period of 2015. Revenue declined 6 percent to $3.47 billion.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Having Turned a Corner, Washington\u2019s NoMa Is Coming Alive", "Date": "2016-11-22", "News": "Supported bySquare FeetWASHINGTON \u2014 Outfitted with a trendy name and infused with the enthusiasm of developers and city planners, the NoMa neighborhood here had high hopes riding on it as it took shape a decade ago.Today, NoMa \u2014 named to mimic New York City neighborhoods like SoHo and TriBeCa, and situated near the Union Station transportation hub \u2014 is making progress in establishing a live-work-play environment. And the opening late last month of a 52,000-square-foot REI store is being celebrated in helping the neighborhood build its identity.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely an up-and-coming neighborhood,\u201d said Kevin House, REI\u2019s director of flagship stores and strategy. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the fastest growing in D.C., has a well-organized business climate, and there is lots of potential for development around us.\u201dThe REI store, part of a cooperative based in Seattle that sells sporting goods, camping gear, travel equipment and clothing, is on the ground floor of the former Uline Arena and immediately east of the NoMa-Galludet rail station, which cost $130 million to build. Private businesses partly financed the station, which opened in 2004 as a catalyst for the neighborhood.The area had been largely undeveloped, sprinkled with new, but vacant, office buildings; a department store warehouse had also been converted to offices. In 2007, an initial federal presence arrived with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in a structure designed by the architect Moshe Safdie.Now, more than three million square feet of residential, retail and office space are under construction in the neighborhood, according to the NoMa Business Improvement District, a public-private partnership formed to promote the area. Currently, there are 360,000 square feet of occupied retail space, and 129,000 more are expected in 2018 and 2019.\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing in NoMa is just the surge,\u201d said Douglas Firstenberg, a founding principal of StonebridgeCarras, based in Bethesda, Md., which recently broke ground on its third office building in Constitution Square, the largely government-leased office complex next to the Metro station.Joining REI to the east of the rail line will be 40,000 square feet of retail or office space, and two more new residential buildings with Foulger-Pratt\u2019s conversion of the former home of the National Capital Press Company. And Trammell Crow is planning a mixed-use project nearby, which is to include two residential towers with 650 total units, a 200-room hotel and 50,000 square feet of retail.NoMa now has about 6,400 people living in about 3,800 apartments; there were none in 2010. About 2,550 more units are projected for 2019. The newcomers live in buildings like the Avalon First and M, which has amenities like a rooftop pool and a dog-washing room, or Flats 130, which has a large Harris Teeter grocery store on its ground floor and is just steps from the Metro stop.Mike Ponticelli, a native Washingtonian who has also rented in New York, has lived in both of these NoMa complexes and appreciates the perks of living in newer buildings. Compared with living in New York, he said, the area is \u201can amenities arms race.\u201d He currently pays $4,000 a month for his two-bedroom apartment in Flats 130.Mr. Ponticelli, 32, who works at the commercial real estate news service Bisnow, has lived in NoMa for three years. He frequently travels to New York for work and likes his location, which is a short ride to Ronald Reagan National Airport or a 15-minute walk to Union Station, where he can catch an Amtrak train.Above the REI store, which opened on Oct. 21, are three floors of offices. One floor is unrented; another has 44,000 square feet leased to Regus, a firm offering shared work space; and the top floor, which has a view of the Capitol, will soon be occupied by Douglas Development. Douglas acquired the deteriorated building in 2004, when it was a waste transfer station, and it was last used as a parking garage.The principal of Douglas Development, Douglas Jemal, has made a career in this city of buying properties in distressed areas and waiting for the market to catch up. \u201cI wait a long time for the right tenants to come along,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m patient. You destroy a piece of property, you destroy it for a lifetime. Put REI in there, you uplift a neighborhood.\u201dBrian T. Kenner, the District of Columbia\u2019s deputy mayor for economic development, is also bullish on NoMa. \u201cWe got a lot of those office buildings filled, and there is much more of an established residential community,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cNoMa has been a great story, of a little bit of perseverance and some catalytic\u201d events.The new REI, one of the company\u2019s largest, is on the site of the Beatles\u2019 first American concert in 1964. The arena\u2019s original owner, Miguel L. Uline, was in the ice business, and the three-story ice house remains and is expected to house offices.In 1941, the arena opened as a hockey rink for the Washington Lions of the Eastern Amateur Hockey League, and Sonja Henie\u2019s Hollywood Ice Revue was the inaugural act. Later, the arena was home to two professional basketball teams, the Washington Capitols, coached by Red Auerbach from 1946 to 1949, and the Washington Caps of the American Basketball Association in 1969 and 1970. In 1960, a new owner renamed it the Washington Coliseum.In a homage to its history, REI has embellished some of its walls with old basketball flooring and old stadium seating. Pillars inside display reproduction posters from the Beatles concert and from a Friday \u201cGo-Go night\u201d with Chuck Brown & the Soul Searchers.The store has 124 staff members, and over all, 54,000 people now work in the 237 acres of NoMa. More federal agencies have moved in, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is leasing 350,000 square feet at First and N Streets NE, part of Constitution Square.Constitution Square\u2019s first two buildings also house 3,500 employees of the Justice Department, a number that is expected to expand to 5,000 after a new building opens.The growing federal presence, at about 27,000 workers, is a notable shift for NoMa. Over the last few years, the government started to move offices to NoMa to take advantage of cheaper rents, though now those rents are rising and vacancy rates are at a low 4.5 percent.\u201cYou\u2019ve gone from a neighborhood that felt out on the edge,\u201d said Robin-Eve Jasper, president of the Business Improvement District, to one that is \u201cin the middle of all the new hip stuff going on today.\u201d Now, she added, \u201cwe have buskers and panhandlers, unlike in the old days, when we had no one.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the size of the new REI in Washington relative to other REI stores. It is among the largest; it is not second-largest after the Seattle store.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified a fitness center in the NoMa neighborhood. The fitness center is at Elevation at Washington Gateway, 100 Florida Avenue NE, not at 1160 First Street NE, at Avalon and M Street.Advertisement"}

Eisenberg; the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson (one of the largest political donors on earth); Gail Icahn, the wife of the investor Carl Icahn; Woody Johnson, owner of the N.F.L.\u2019s New York Jets; the hedge fund manager Anthony Scaramucci; the Texas businessmen Ray Washburne and Roy Bailey; and the luxury casino tycoon Steve Wynn.The congratulatory visits keep on coming.Marla Maples, Mr. Trump\u2019s second wife, was spotted entering Trump Tower around 4 p.m. on Tuesday. She was in the building for nearly 25 minutes and waved to journalists and pedestrians as she left.Mr. Trump and Ms. Maples divorced in 1999 and remain on good terms.And speaking of reconciliations, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas stopped by as well.Senator John McCain issued a blunt warning on Tuesday to President-elect Trump and his emerging foreign policy team: Don\u2019t try another \u201creset\u201d with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.During the campaign, Mr. Trump described Mr. Putin as a strong leader and suggested that the United States and Russia might join forces in fighting the Islamic State. Mr. Putin congratulated Mr. Trump on his election in a phone call on Monday and discussed working together to combat terrorism and resolve the crisis in Syria, according to the Kremlin\u2019s account.That was too much for Mr. McCain, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who cautioned the incoming administration not to be taken in by \u201ca former K.G.B. agent.\u201d\u201cThe Obama administration\u2019s last attempt at resetting relations with Russia culminated in Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and military intervention in the Middle East,\u201d Mr. McCain, the newly re-elected Arizona Republican, said in a statement.\u201cAt the very least, the price of another \u2018reset\u2019 would be complicity in Putin and Assad\u2019s butchery of the Syrian people,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is an unacceptable price for a great nation. When America has been at its greatest, it is when we have stood on the side of those fighting tyranny. That is where we must stand again.\u201dRebekah Mercer, the scion of a powerful family of conservative donors and a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s executive transition committee, has had little success in her mission to solicit names and r\u00e9sum\u00e9s for potential administration posts, according to a person familiar with her outreach efforts.Ms. Mercer, 42, the daughter of the New York investor Robert Mercer, has told Republican operatives and members of previous administrations that she was having trouble finding takers for posts at the under secretary level and below. She also made it clear that the transition team was more than a month behind schedule and on a tight timeline, the person said.The Mercer family has invested tens of millions of dollars in conservative causes and is considered especially close to Stephen K. Bannon, the chairman of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign who was named as his senior presidential adviser. Mr. Mercer reportedly invested $10 million in Breitbart, the right-wing news site previously run by Mr. Bannon. Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, also previously oversaw a \u201csuper PAC\u201d financed by the Mercer family.Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the outgoing minority leader, took to the Senate floor Thursday with a slew of stories about bullied children, racist attacks, and anti-Semitic acts, unholstered to bash Mr. Trump, his new hobby. \u201cHis election sparked a wave of hate crime across America. This is a simple statement of fact,\u201d Mr. Reid said before imploring Democrats to stand as a force against Mr. Trump.Representative Steve Stivers of Ohio was named the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, the party\u2019s campaign arm for House candidates, succeeding Representative Greg Walden of Oregon. In a statement, Speaker Paul D. Ryan called Mr. Stivers \u201ca talented leader.\u201dBut when Mr. Cohen, a former national security official in George W. Bush\u2019s administration, suggested the caveat that many foreign policy hands would enlist only if there were credible people leading national security agencies and departments, he said he received a vituperative email in response.The tone of the email surprised him, he said, expressing a level of vengefulness at odds with an administration that is trying to fill important national security positions with qualified people.\u201cThey think of these jobs as lollipops,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cI think we\u2019re on the verge of a crisis here.\u201dWith John Bolton, the former United Nations ambassador, emerging as a finalist for a senior national security post, even secretary of state, Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, said on Tuesday that he would do \u201cwhatever I can\u201d to block him.The floating of Mr. Bolton as one of Mr. Trump\u2019s contenders for secretary of state has baffled members of both parties, because his hawkish foreign policy worldview is so at odds with Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign pitch for less military engagement in the world.That is one area in which Mr. Paul, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s rivals in the race for the Republican nomination, said he agreed with the president-elect.\u201cI can\u2019t imagine supporting anyone who hasn\u2019t learned the lesson of the last 20 years,\u201d Mr. Paul said of Mr. Bolton, who was ambassador to the United Nations for George W. Bush during the escalation of the war in Iraq. Mr. Paul called Mr. Bolton \u201cunrepentant.\u201dMatthew Freedman, the chief executive at Global Impact, a consulting firm, was removed from his post overseeing the National Security Council transition after questions emerged about his lobbying ties.Reached by phone, Mr. Freedman declined to comment Tuesday.Vice President-elect Mike Pence and Rick Dearborn, a Trump campaign staff member who is close to Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, are going over the transition staffing list to make a \u201cvery concerted effort to clear house of any lobbyists,\u201d said one transition official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. This means others beyond Mr. Freedman will likely be purged as well.Carl Icahn, a business magnate who is close to the president-elect, tipped his hand on Twitter: Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs financier and hedge fund founder, seems to have an inside track to be Treasury secretary; and Wilbur Ross, a billionaire investor and turnaround artist, could be Commerce secretary.Spotted entering Trump Tower on Tuesday, he told reporters, \u201cWe\u2019re working on the economic plan with the transition, making sure we get the biggest tax bill passed, the biggest tax changes since Reagan, so a lot of exciting things in the first 100 days of the Trump presidency.\u201dThe estimated cost to the treasury of those plans is more than $5 trillion over 10 years. To put that in perspective, George W. Bush\u2019s tax cuts in 2001 \u2014 the largest in history \u2014 were a wee $1.35 trillion over a decade.Ben Carson spent months trying to persuade voters to elect him president, but, according to his spokesman, he does not think he is qualified to run a federal agency in the Trump administration.According to the spokesman, Armstrong Williams, who is also Mr. Carson\u2019s business manager, Mr. Trump offered the retired neurosurgeon a \u201cbuffet\u201d of job options as a reward for being a loyal ally after dropping out of the race for the Republican nomination.\u201cThe president-elect said, \u2018Ben, tell me whatever you want to run, it will be yours,\u2019\u201d Mr. Williams recounted.But Mr. Carson has no experience running large enterprises, Mr. Williams said, and did not think it would be a wise move to start in the new administration. Mr. Carson had been discussed as a candidate to lead the Department of Health and Human Services or the Department of Education, or to be surgeon general.\u201cHe\u2019d be like a fish out of water,\u201d Mr. Williams said.Amid rising calls for change in Democratic leadership, House Democrats decided in a closed-door meeting on Tuesday to postpone their leadership elections until Nov. 30.After last week\u2019s bruising loss, there have been rumblings among some Democrats that perhaps a new leader should replace Representative Nancy Pelosi of California in the role she has held since 2003. Some members have urged Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio to run, and he is considering it, his office said Monday.Mr. Ryan, a former football player from the Youngstown area, is in stark contrast with Ms. Pelosi, an affluent scion of a Baltimore political family long ensconced in San Francisco, one of the country\u2019s most liberal bastions.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a member of the Trump inaugural committee leadership team. He is Steve Wynn, not Wynne.Jeremy W. Peters and Alan Rappeport contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "3 Chinese Rights Activists Vanish, Apparently in State Crackdown", "Date": "2016-11-30", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Three prominent Chinese rights activists appear to have been detained in recent weeks by the police, part of a continuing crackdown on groups operating outside the umbrella of the state, advocacy groups say.The men, Jiang Tianyong, Huang Qi and Liu Feiyue, disappeared within days of each other in November, each in a different province. The police have charged only Mr. Liu with an offense. Rights groups say he was detained Nov. 17 or 18 in the central province of Hubei on suspicion of subverting state power, which can carry a sentence of life in prison.\u201cI hope the government could at least tell us, his family, where he is and what crimes he has committed,\u201d Ms. Jin said. \u201cAt least we should know his whereabouts.\u201dTheir arrests echo the widespread detentions of rights defenders in July 2015, part of a crackdown on civil society under President Xi Jinping, who has spearheaded a drive to stamp out forces outside the Communist Party\u2019s control out of fear that they threatened its survival.Mr. Jiang\u2019s disappearance may be related to those arrests, because several of the rights defenders arrested last year still await trial, and he was active in supporting their families, his lawyer, Chen Jinxue, said by telephone. Mr. Jiang was visiting the wife of Xie Yang, one of the detained lawyers, and was trying to arrange a visit with Mr. Xie when he disappeared, Mr. Chen said.\u201cThis may show the mind-set of the authorities as they come close to implementing the NGO law,\u201d William Nee, a researcher for Amnesty International who is based in Hong Kong, said by phone.The mobile phones of Mr. Jiang, Mr. Liu and Mr. Huang were either turned off or appeared to not be working. A police officer in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, said that Mr. Huang had been arrested in Chengdu by officers from the nearby city of Mianyang. The police in Suizhou, Mr. Liu\u2019s hometown, said the city government was handling Mr. Liu\u2019s case but denied any further knowledge. The police in railway stations in Changsha and Beijing, as well as in Mr. Jiang\u2019s hometown in central China, had no information on his whereabouts.Mr. Chen, Mr. Jiang\u2019s lawyer, said his client had been moving from place to place in and around Beijing for three years, trying to avoid arrest. He had been detained for months in 2011, amid an earlier crackdown that came in the wake of the movements that swept authoritarian leaders in Tunisia and Egypt from power. China feared the so-called Jasmine Revolution would come to China as well.\u201cIf, as is strongly likely, this was an act carried out by state agents, then this would be an enforced disappearance, which is a crime under international law,\u201d Mr. Nee of Amnesty International said. \u201cJiang Tianyong seems to be placed outside the protection of the law, which makes him very vulnerable to torture and other human rights violations.\u201dKiki Zhao contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Forget Filling Ad Breaks; Some Marketers Make the Podcasts", "Date": "2016-11-20", "News": "Supported byAdvertisingNow comes \u201cLifeAfter,\u201d a futuristic 10-episode drama, the first installment of which was released this month. It tells the story of a low-level worker at the Federal Bureau of Investigation who is obsessed with the traces of life his dead wife left behind on social media, particularly a fictional audio service. The first episode kicks off with what sounds like an ad for that service \u2014 but perhaps that\u2019s a wink of sorts. As with \u201cThe Message,\u201d a notable detail in this branding experiment is that the sponsoring brand is, by design, almost never mentioned.Distributing and helping create such \u201csponsor content\u201d has been part of Panoply\u2019s business for a while. Think of it as a variation on the so-called native advertising or branded content now so familiar online \u2014 material flagged as having been paid for, but crafted to resemble editorial content. According to Matt Turck, Panoply\u2019s chief revenue officer, the company has produced more than 100 episodes of custom podcast series for brands including Purina, Umpqua Bank, Prudential and Starbucks.\u201cIt\u2019s been an important part of our business,\u201d he said. \u201cIt generates revenue and differentiates us in the marketplace.\u201dPanoply spun out of the podcast unit of the online magazine Slate in 2015, positioning itself as a platform for shows produced with partners like The Wall Street Journal and Vox, as well as its own roster of programs. Relatively quickly, Mr. Turck said, the possibility of sponsored shows was added to the mix. G.E., which previously worked with Slate Custom, the site\u2019s sponsored-content division, and became intrigued by podcasting, ended up being one of the first examples.But its approach has been distinct. Most sponsored podcasts follow a fairly traditional hosts-and-interviews format. The decision to turn \u201cThe Message\u201d into a multipart series was inspired in part by the runaway success of the true-crime podcast \u201cSerial.\u201d But the fictional form was an attempt to do something different \u2014 \u201ca new way of reprising the kind of radio dramas of the \u201930s, \u201940s, \u201950s,\u201d said Alexa Christon, head of media innovation for G.E. (The name \u201cGE Podcast Theater\u201d echoes \u201cGeneral Electric Theater,\u201d an anthology series on radio and television in the 1950s and early 1960s that was hosted by Ronald Reagan.)One of the plot twists in \u201cThe Message\u201d \u2014 its story unfolded as a fake podcast documenting efforts to decode an alien communiqu\u00e9 \u2014 was loosely inspired by sound-therapy technology that G.E. is working on. But since that connection is never mentioned, most listeners probably never got it. The name \u201cGE Podcast Theater\u201d is noted at the beginning and end of the series, and on the \u201ccover art\u201d people see when playing an episode on smartphones \u2014 but that\u2019s it.Backing up that assertion is tricky \u2014 one of the widely noted shortcomings of podcast advertising is the dearth of detailed audience data. Outside of download numbers, Ms. Christon said, G.E. judged the success of \u201cThe Message\u201d partly by way of \u201cthe organic groups that have sprung up\u201d in places like Reddit, swapping plot theories and even generating fan fiction.It\u2019s a means, Ms. Christon said, for doing something the best advertising always strives for: \u201ccapitalizing on the zeitgeist.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Her predecessor, Robert Greifeld, will become chairman of the company\u2019s board, replacing Borje Ekholm.For Ms. Friedman, 47, the promotion comes at a time of consolidation within the world of market operators and of rapid changeover in technology. Under Mr. Greifeld, Nasdaq expanded from a single stock exchange to a global markets operator that now trades stocks and options, including through acquisitions of counterparts, like OMX of Sweden, in the United States and abroad.In an interview, Ms. Friedman said that her job as chief executive would be to keep Nasdaq on top of the shifting landscape.\u201cNasdaq today is a world-class market operator and technology leader,\u201d she said.Since joining Nasdaq in 1993, Ms. Friedman has rose steadily through the company; she has served as the head of data products and as chief financial officer. Her career took a different path in 2011 when she joined the investment firm Carlyle Group as its chief financial officer, ahead of its initial public offering \u2014 on the Nasdaq market.Ms. Friedman rejoined Nasdaq two years ago as president and heir apparent to Mr. Greifeld. She added the title of chief operating officer in December.The timing of her promotion was not a surprise to analysts: Mr. Greifeld\u2019s contract was set to expire in February, and the market operator\u2019s board had long been working on a succession plan.\u201cI\u2019ve had the opportunity to watch Adena grow and develop over the last 14 years, and can confidently say she is the right person for this role and is unquestionably as passionate about the company\u2019s future as I am,\u201d Mr. Greifeld said in a statement. \u201cAdena has played an instrumental role in building this organization into one of the most innovative leaders, with a tremendous disruptive spirit.

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Style Puts Gloss on Tesla\u2019s Bid for SolarCity", "Date": "2016-11-08", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorThe deal is about as conflicted as they come. Elon Musk owns large interests in both companies and had the idea for SolarCity, which is led by his cousin. Mr. Musk is also chief executive and chairman of Tesla and is chairman of SolarCity.Incestuous ties like these are not uncommon in Silicon Valley. Yet SolarCity is struggling. Its stock price has declined by more than two-thirds since early 2015 and its revenue is down as solar takes a beating from low oil prices.Given the context and the initial bumbling of the process, it is understandable why some thought that Mr. Musk\u2019s interest in SolarCity was a way to bail out his investment.The initial market reaction when the offer was announced in June indicated as much. Tesla\u2019s stock price declined more than 12 percent in the wake of the possible bid.After the decline in Tesla\u2019s stock price and the criticism of the conflicts, one might have thought that the merger was as dead as pets.com.But a good narrative in Silicon Valley means everything, and Mr. Musk has long played the role of visionary to great effect. He put this to good use in the last few months to shine up this deal.Lawyers were brought in to tidy up the process. SolarCity shopped itself around but found no other buyers \u2014 who else would buy when Mr. Musk had so ardently expressed his desire to acquire a company of which he already owned a fifth?Most important, Mr. Musk amped up his vision.In capital markets today, conglomerates are hated and companies are carved and diced to the finest business. But not Tesla.Tesla has been portrayed as a car company and a battery company, but now Mr. Musk\u2019s vision has turned Tesla into an integrated solar company with SolarCity the crucial missing piece. Well-heeled consumers would get their car from Tesla, as well as their home battery storage and solar from SolarCity to power it all.The strategy appears to be working.The influential proxy advisory firm, Institutional Shareholder Services, has endorsed the merger. \u201cThe transaction is a necessary step toward TSLA\u2019s goal of being an integrated sustainable energy company,\u201d I.S.S. wrote, using Tesla\u2019s stock market ticker symbol.In addition, the advisory service cited the low premium and the fact that Tesla, a $30 billion company, could probably handle SolarCity\u2019s $3.1 billion in debt with the ability to raise more needed capital in the markets.Then there are the structural biases for a deal. The shareholders of Tesla are largely also invested in SolarCity. Mr. Musk owns 21.7 percent of SolarCity and 20.1 percent of Tesla. But the second-biggest shareholder of each is the mutual fund giant Fidelity, which owns 8.9 percent of Tesla and 11.6 percent of SolarCity. Vanguard, BlackRock and Bank of Montreal are in the top 10 shareholders of each.Theoretically, these institutional investors are supposed to look at each investment separately, but a bailout of SolarCity by Tesla might be in their best interest. Certainly, the voting dynamics work in Tesla\u2019s favor.But the biggest spur pushing this deal toward success may be the willingness to believe in the Silicon Valley magic.Take the I.S.S. report. It cited three reasons for the deal. Ultimately, it came down to what the advisory service said was that vision of an integrated solar company.Really? Would any other industry get this pass? Let me answer that: No. The simple truth is that Silicon Valley visionaries are given freedom no other chief executive would. To put it another way, there is a Musk pass (as well as a Zuckerberg pass and a Brin and Page pass). (Glass Lewis, the other large proxy advisory service, refused to give Mr. Musk his pass, calling for a vote against the deal because of the conflicts.)But how could you not bet on Mr. Musk\u2019s vision?Because of this last fact, I fully expect this deal to happen. Perhaps this is to be admired. Too often, institutional investors play it too safe. Now, public shareholders can profit from some risk-taking instead of leaving it all to the venture capitalists.Still, questions persist about the business model of the combined company. The solar market is saturated and limited to people with the cash to buy panels. This is why financing is such an important part of the equation. And are there legions of potential customers willing to spring tens of thousands of dollars for terra cotta glass solar shingles?There is great risk here, as well as possibly great rewards. In most cases, institutional shareholders would pass on the deal solely because of the risk, let alone the conflicts and conglomerate issues. And it raises the question of whether Silicon Valley should, alone among other industries, have a special pass to make deals that no company in any other industry could.Even institutional shareholders seem to lose their heads when it comes to Silicon Valley.An earlier version of this article misstated Tesla Motors\u2019 position on fund-raising. While the company has said it may need to raise funds in the future, it said last month that it had no need to do so now.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Business Leaders Examine a Post-Election World", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byThe interview lineup included:One billionaire investor has come out in support of another billionaire businessman.William A. Ackman told an audience on Thursday that he woke up Wednesday morning \u201cbullish on Trump.\u201dIt was somewhat of a twist for Mr. Ackman, who is known for his support of liberal causes. Mr. Ackman, who runs a $11.6 billion hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, said he liked the idea that the president-elect would run the country like a business.\u201cWe are going to get a lot done,\u201d Mr. Ackman said in the final segment of the DealBook conference in Manhattan.Mr. Ackman had harsh words to say about what he called the \u201cfraudulence of the media,\u201d taking a swipe at a recent portrayal of him in Vanity Fair and coverage of the election.As for his hedge fund firm, he conceded it had been a difficult year; his Pershing Square Holdings are down 20.7 percent so far this year. But Mr. Ackman sought to explain it away by saying the poor performance was largely caused by just one bad trade.\u201cWe\u2019ve had one problem: Valeant,\u201d Mr. Ackman, 50, said.Shares of the troubled pharmaceutical company have plunged to $17 a share from the average $190 a share his firm paid in 2015, Mr. Ackman said. Pershing has a roughly 10 percent stake in the Valeant. While he acknowledged the stock was unlikely to get back to $190 anytime soon, he outlined what he said was a plan for the company and share price to recover.Mr. Ackman also brushed off suggestions that investors might lose patience with him given the poor performance this year. He said the other stocks Pershing owns had performed better, adding that the firm had a \u201cgood batting average.\u201dAs for his best-known bearish stock call \u2014 Herbalife \u2014 Mr. Ackman said he would still be proved right and the stock would eventually go to zero. But he also struck a humble note, saying he had learned his lesson and would have been \u201cbetter off staying in the shadows\u201d and not going public with claims that the nutritional supplements company was a pyramid scheme.He added: \u201cThis is my last public short.\u201d\u2014 ALEXANDRA STEVENSON and MATTHEW GOLDSTEINLloyd Blankfein may be known for making winning investment calls, but like so many on Wall Street the Goldman Sachs chief made the wrong bet in the presidential election.During the campaign, Mr. Blankfein had voiced support for Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy and had been personally featured in a television ad portraying the Democrats as puppets of the global financial elite.But on Thursday the Goldman chief sounded willing to see how Donald J. Trump governs.\u201cI know a lot about Trump the campaigner,\u201d Mr. Blankfein said. \u201cYou go into that office and think about your place in history.\u201dMr. Blankfein said he was not surprised by the two-day rally in the stock market, even as some analysts had predicted a big dip if Mr. Trump was elected, because the Republican\u2019s policies \u2014 most likely a mix of corporate tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks \u2014 will be \u201cmarket supportive.\u201dHe was asked about a media report on Thursday indicating Mr. Trump was considering JPMorgan Chase\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, for Treasury secretary.\u201cHe would be a great Treasury secretary,\u201d said Mr. Blankfein of Mr. Dimon.He said Mr. Trump\u2019s finance chairman during the campaign, Steve Mnuchin, a former Goldman executive, is \u201da highflier, a partner at a young age. He did very well. He is a smart, smart guy.\u201dOn Wall Street issues, Mr. Trump has put forth seemingly contradictory proposals. He has said he will repeal the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law, though his party\u2019s platform calls for breaking up the big banks.Mr. Blankfein said he thought that neither proposal would gain much traction. \u201cIf you want to be good for bankers you have to have policies that drive economic growth,\u201d he said.Even as Mr. Blankfein struck a relatively optimistic tone about the impending Trump administration, he had sought to assure Goldman employees about the election results.On Wednesday, Mr. Blankfein left a voice mail with employees globally, seeking to reassure the firm in the aftermath of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential victory, which he said \u201csurprised many of us, similar to what we saw earlier this year in the U.K. Brexit vote.\u201dHe told employees he couldn\u2019t predict whether the outcome of Mr. Trump\u2019s election would be \u201cgood or bad in the long run\u201d but that Goldman Sachs would need to \u201ccontingency plan for all scenarios,\u201d according to a transcript of the voice mail reviewed by The New York Times.In his voice mail, Mr. Blankfein also addressed Mr. Trump\u2019s caustic words that at times during his campaign had racist, sexist and xenophobic undertones.\u2014 MICHAEL CORKERY and ALEXANDRA STEVENSONAs the boards of CBS and Viacom weigh re-merging, the scion of the family that controls both companies believes that, in the media business, bigger is better.Shari Redstone, whose family\u2019s corporate vehicle controls the voting power at both CBS and Viacom, argued that now more than ever, the companies that produce content need to get larger to negotiate against distributors like Comcast and AT&T.The matter is becoming more acute after huge acquisitions by some of the biggest television providers in the country, including AT&T\u2019s $85 billion bid for Time Warner. (Ms. Redstone said on stage that she believed the deal made sense.)Ms. Redstone and her father have pushed both CBS and Viacom to weigh a reunion, putting together businesses that have been apart for a decade. Since then, CBS has thrived while Viacom \u2014 home to Paramount, MTV and Comedy Central \u2014 has struggled.\u201cScale matters because it is going to give us leverage,\u201d Ms. Redstone said, \u201cand we are going to need leverage with some partners.\u201dAt the moment, special committees at both CBS and Viacom are weighing the merger option. Though media investors and analysts believe that the two companies will go forward, DealBook\u2019s Andrew Ross Sorkin asked Ms. Redstone if it was possible that the two could stay independent and thrive.\u201cThey are two strong companies, and they both will survive,\u201d Ms. Redstone said. Referring to the presidential election, she added, \u201cEverything is possible \u2014 we just saw that this week.\u201d\u2014 MICHAEL J. de la MERCED and EMILY STEELThe day after Donald J. Trump was elected, traffic to HealthCare.gov surged.More than 100,000 people signed up for coverage on Wednesday, often with federally funded subsidies, through the health care law that Mr. Trump and his party have vowed to repeal, according to Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services.Ms. Burwell stuck to a sunny set of talking points on Thursday, emphasizing the changes the law has brought about \u2014 such as guaranteed coverage for those with pre-existing health problems \u2014 and how unpopular undoing some of them would be.\u201cWhen the conversation comes to the point of reality, I think it\u2019s going to be a very different conversation,\u201d Ms. Burwell said.Still, Mr. Trump\u2019s election has cast a shadow over the health care marketplace\u2019s open enrollment period, which began Nov. 1 and ends Jan. 31.\u201cI\u2019m already starting to get the calls where people are fearful about what is going to happen,\u201d said Bernard J. Tyson, the chief executive of Kaiser Permanente. \u201cThe questions are now coming: Should I renew? What does this mean? Am I going to get kicked out of Kaiser Permanente after Jan. 20?\u201d(The answer is no. Any 2017 marketplace health insurance plan that a customer signs up for during open enrollment will remain in force for the year.)But both Ms. Burwell and Mr. Tyson see opportunities for reform where, they hope, bipartisan forces can align, especially around shifting the health care industry\u2019s business model away from high-volume, fee-for-service transactions and toward paying for higher-quality outcomes.Kaiser Permanente is succeeding in its initiatives to move more care out of expensive settings like hospitals and into places like patients\u2019 homes, Mr. Tyson said. Half of its 100 million physician visits last year were done virtually, through tools like videoconferencing and smartphones.\u201cWe\u2019re going to end up, in the 21st century, with the home operating as a medical center,\u201d he said. Wearing a Jawbone fitness tracker, he also predicted that wearables would increasingly become medical devices \u2014 a technological change that could usher in significant advances in preventive care.\u201cI got a picture this morning of a swastika,\u201d said Howard Schultz, the chief executive of Starbucks, Thursday morning.Mr. Schultz, an outspoken supporter of Hillary Clinton, said he had seen some disturbing things happening in America recently. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to understand,\u201d he said.Mr. Schultz said that he felt that much of the country and the world were in a state of shock and disbelief about the outcome of the election, but added that Donald J. Trump\u2019s win was likely the result of years and years of many people in America feeling that no one was listening to them.In September, after Mr. Schultz endorsed Mrs. Clinton, Trump supporters called for a boycott of Starbucks. On Thursday, at a conference held by The New York Times, Andrew Ross Sorkin reminded Mr. Schultz that Mr. Trump had once said that one of the most successful Starbucks cafes was located in Trump Tower.\u201cNot true,\u201d he shot back.Starbucks has been involved in political activism for years. In September 2013, the company asked customers to leave firearms behind when they were in its stores or using its outdoor seating \u2014 a policy change that was made days after a shooting spree at the Washington Navy Yard that left 13 people, including the gunman, dead.And over the summer, Starbucks garnered media attention as customers ordered drinks under \u201cBlack Lives Matter,\u201d rather than their names, so that baristas would shout out the phrase when a drink order was ready.At the conference on Thursday, Mr. Schultz defended Starbucks\u2019s role in activism.\u201cShould we hide behind and not take advantage of the platform we have?\u201d he asked.But when asked whether he would run for political office, Mr. Schultz refused to say yes or no.\u201cI don\u2019t think today\u2019s the day to answer that question,\u201d he said.And, upon being asked whether he would accept a position in the Trump administration (on the off-chance that it were offered to him), Mr. Schultz replied, \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s for me.\u201d\u2014 DANIELLE IVORYRichard Plepler, the chief executive of HBO, may not have predicted the outcome of the presidential election correctly, he admitted on Thursday \u2014 but he remains convinced that combining his parent company, Time Warner, with AT&T remains the right move.One of the main reasons the $85 billion combination makes sense, he contended, was that it would yield even better data on viewers, which HBO could then use to do a better job of figuring out what those subscribers want to watch. Nearly half of HBO subscribers watch only movies available on the service, and if AT&T is better able to figure out what those people like to watch, HBO can then do better at serving up the content that would keep them watching.What the data won\u2019t be used for, he said, is to dictate the kinds of shows that will be made.\u201cThe more we get, the more we learn, the more we can micro-target,\u201d Mr. Plepler said. \u201cNo one is telling a writer, \u2018Write this based on the data.\u2019\u201dHis counterpart on stage and the chief executive of the cable operator Charter Communications, Thomas M. Rutledge, was more circumspect about the deal. Charter \u2014 which struck its own megadeal by buying Time Warner Cable \u2014 spends about $10 billion a year on content already, which Mr. Rutledge says accounts for much of the expense of cable packages.So putting Time Warner under the aegis of AT&T and potentially charging even more for HBO, CNN and other Time Warner properties remains a concern.\u201cIs there a box of tissues here?\u201d Indra Nooyi said with a smile.Ms. Nooyi, the chief executive of PepsiCo and a Hillary Clinton supporter, had just been asked how she was feeling after the election.She offered her congratulations to President-elect Donald J. Trump \u2014 but then professed a deep sadness and sense of disappointment about the outcome.\u201cI had to answer a lot of questions, from my daughters, from my employees \u2014 they were all in mourning,\u201d she said. \u201cOur employees are all crying and the question that they are asking, especially those that are not white: \u2018Are we safe?\u2019 Women are asking, \u2018Are we safe?\u2019 L.G.B.T. people are asking, \u2018Are we safe?\u2019 I never thought I\u2019d have had to answer those questions.\u201dAsked about the coarseness of the language used during the election as well as the domestic violence issues confronting the National Football League, which Pepsi sponsors, she said: \u201cForget the Pepsi brand \u2014 how dare we talk about women that way? Why do we talk that way about a whole group of citizens?\u201dShe said she did not think there was a place for a type of language that has sometimes been dismissed as \u201clocker room talk.\u201d \u201cNot in locker rooms, not in football players\u2019 homes, not in any place.\u201d\u201cIf we don\u2019t nip it in the bud,\u201d Ms. Nooyi added, \u201cthis is going to be a lethal force that takes over society.\u201d\u201cIt has got to stop,\u201d she said \u2014 at which point the auditorium, packed with business leaders, academics and others, erupted into applause.Ms. Nooyi emphasized the need to offer reassurances, as a nation, to women, racial minorities and members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.When Aetna ran through post-election expectations, the idea that Donald J. Trump would win the presidency and that Republicans would control both chambers of Congress seemed so implausible that it was not even in play.\u201cWe started with a fresh piece of paper yesterday \u2014 we had no idea how to approach it,\u201d Mark T. Bertolini, the company\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said Thursday morning at the DealBook conference. \u201cWhat we would have spent months doing if we thought it was even remotely possible, we had to do in a day.\u201dSo what happens now? Mr. Bertolini said he assumed that the Affordable Care Act, the landmark bill that reshaped the health care market, would be repealed but perhaps some parts would survive.In particular, he named three changes mandated by the law that he thinks will endure: allowing young adults to remain on their parents\u2019 insurance policies until they turn 26, the expansion of Medicaid to cover many low-income people and \u201cguaranteed issue,\u201d the rule that requires insurers to offer policies to all applicants, regardless of their health conditions.\u201cI think those are all very important positions that we need to continue,\u201d Mr. Bertolini said.But other provisions are very likely dead, Mr. Bertolini forecast, including the \u201cCadillac tax\u201d on high-cost plans that was scheduled to take effect in 2020. What happens to premiums in 2018 and beyond is also an open question, he said.The National Football League is considering ways to shorten games, including cutting some advertising from broadcasts, to keep the action moving, says Roger Goodell, the league\u2019s commissioner.Responding to shifts in the way fans watch games, the league is looking at whether games should be shorter, including reducing the amount of time spent not playing and speeding up instant replay reviews, to \u201ckeep our games exciting.\u201dFans often complain about the games being too long and frequently express annoyance at the number of commercial breaks and referee video reviews.The league has been plagued with declining ratings this season as fans find nontraditional ways to view games, including online. At Thursday\u2019s DealBook conference, Mr. Goodell said ratings wax and wane in cycles, but he acknowledged that there had been fundamental shifts in the way people use media. The league\u2019s response is to make sure fans are engaged no matter how they see the games.Most public figures should assume that information about them will be leaked. At least, that\u2019s what Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, thinks.Mr. Schmidt, whose emails with members of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign were stolen and recently published online by WikiLeaks, spoke at length about the importance of tightening digital security at a conference held by The New York Times on Thursday, and said that President-elect Donald J. Trump should create a division within the federal government that spends its time auditing the security of its systems.\u201cWe live online now,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you grab someone\u2019s smartphone, it\u2019s equal or worse than grabbing their wallet.\u201dHe said Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, once told him that, because \u201cgovernments are capable of systemic evil, which requires planning,\u201d leaking any form of activity at that level would prevent government from getting \u201ctoo far into that evil.\u201d Mr. Schmidt punctuated that story, however, by saying, \u201cThe problem, of course, with this argument, is that he appoints himself the judge of that.\u201dMr. Schmidt added that the United States government had not yet figured out how to deter digital attacks from other countries.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mergers Could Help European Investment Banks Compete With U.S.", "Date": "2016-11-02", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsCredit Suisse\u2019s chief executive, Tidjane Thiam, is clearly frustrated with the investment banking operations of the institution he oversees.And with good reason: Wall Street banks seem to have won most of the battle for supremacy over who gets most of the fees that the world\u2019s biggest corporations and investment managers pay to bankers and traders.At the same time, the cost of maintaining the Swiss bank\u2019s business of financing companies, advising them on mergers and making markets in a bewildering array of stocks, bonds and other instruments remains high. And regulators keep demanding that banks put up more capital against these activities.It is easy to see where this deliberation might lead. If they cannot make it on their own, Mr. Thiam and others may conclude that they should join forces to take on their American competitors.The idea of merging investment banks may sound so last century and more than a little stupid. After all, Credit Suisse paid $11.5 billion for the New York investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in 2000, only to see the firm\u2019s rainmakers depart and their combined market share fail to materialize. It later wrote off the value of the acquisition.But many of the European banks that bulked up over the last few decades on Wall Street now stand at an existential crossroads. They are gazing at a future in which these businesses, even if they are able to make a profit, will probably struggle to cover their costs of capital in the foreseeable future. This puts them at a competitive disadvantage in wooing clients and retaining talent relative to the American companies. It\u2019s an ugly cycle.Look at where the non-American banks stand in the industry league tables compiled by Thomson Reuters. Although not necessarily a reflection of profitability, it\u2019s generally accepted that the industry\u2019s high fixed costs mean scale allows a greater proportion of the fees to drop to the bottom line. Not one company with headquarters outside Manhattan ranks in the top three advising globally on mergers and acquisitions, underwriting debt and equity or arranging big syndicated loans so far this year.Credit Suisse\u2019s best showing is as the sixth-ranked adviser in mergers and acquisitions, just ahead of Barclays. Deutsche came in 10th in mergers and seventh on debt, equity and loans. Barclays managed the fourth spot in debt, just ahead of HSBC. All of this although Credit Suisse bought DLJ and First Boston before that, Deutsche Bank spent $9 billion on Bankers Trust back in 1999 and Barclays picked up the American carcass of Lehman Brothers after the financial crisis for a bargain $1.8 billion.As the head of one United States bank told me last week: \u201cIt\u2019s over \u2014 the Americans won.\u201d The top slots in the rankings for core investment banking products are all held by some combination of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The picture is broadly similar in the arenas of stock and bond market trading.Maintaining these subscale franchises is expensive. Credit Suisse squeezed out a profit before tax of 73 million Swiss francs ($74.1 million) in its investment banking and capital markets arm in the first half of the year, on 931 million francs of net revenue. Its global markets division lost 44 million francs on pretax income of 2.9 billion francs. These two divisions accounted for about 40 percent of the bank\u2019s core risk-weighted assets. By comparison, Credit Suisse\u2019s international wealth management, Asia Pacific and Swiss banking arms made a combined 1.9 billion francs on 6.8 billion of net revenue.One way to be more efficient would be for Deutsche and Credit Suisse to crunch their United States businesses together. They would also get bigger scale. If the banks were able to maintain their respective market share positions under one roof, they would vault up the rankings. A Credit Suisse-Deutsche Bank duo, for instance, would have challenged JPMorgan as the leading underwriter of global equity and equity-linked securities, raising $47 billion for clients, year to date. And it might figure as a top five merger adviser.Merging would undoubtedly be messy. Conflicts of interest would make it hard for the combined group to keep all its clients. The best employees might leave. Regulators, too, might balk at the idea of big balance sheets getting bigger. A merger of Credit Suisse and Deutsche\u2019s United States holding companies would potentially create a $700 billion institution.Winning approval for such a deal would take finesse from the banks involved. The Federal Reserve would need to be persuaded that one better managed, more profitable and less risky institution was preferable to two weak subsidiaries.Analysts at Macquarie Research pointed out last week that \u201cDeutsche Bank has the largest U.S. balance sheet of European peers and is also the most weakly capitalized of peers. This must be an uncomfortable position for U.S. regulators.\u201dOver time, their parents in Switzerland and Germany could eventually spin off all or part of the combined enterprise to investors, reducing their exposure. But a successful combination \u2014 call it First Boston Bankers Trust \u2014 might even attract other banks facing a similar future of death by a thousand cuts.Who knows? One day, maybe Lehman Brothers and Dillon, Read & Company could join the reunion, too.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Create a Quieter City, They\u2019re Recording the Sounds of New York", "Date": "2016-11-06", "News": "Supported byOn Thursday, microphones mounted outside two buildings in Manhattan went live.Bright yellow signs that say \u201cRecording Underway\u201d announced their arrival.But these devices are not eavesdropping on your conversations.Snippets of audio, about 10 seconds each, will be collected during random intervals over the course of about a year to capture seasonal notes, like air-conditioners and snowplows. The cacophony will be labeled and categorized using a machine-listening engine called UrbanEars. The sensors will eventually be smart enough to identify hundreds of sonic irritants reverberating across the city.The goal of the project, Sounds of New York City, or Sonyc, is to create an aural map that a group of researchers hopes will help city agencies monitor and enforce noise pollution, and will empower citizens to assist in the process.Each $100 machine contains a small computer processor and a Wi-Fi antenna that connect to a custom microphone, shielded inside a 10-inch-long foam wind guard. The machines are also outfitted with plastic spikes to ward off unwanted interference.\u201cPigeon poop is the killer of all microphones,\u201d said Charlie Mydlarz, a British researcher who worked in an anechoic chamber, a room designed to deaden sound, to ensure that the devices met noise measurement standards set by the city.So far, the contraptions have been tested in the heat, Dr. Mydlarz said. But the cold of winter has yet to arrive.Still, New Yorkers continue to howl about the racket. But there are limitations to the way humans can respond to and even report these issues, said Juan Pablo Bello, the lead investigator for Sonyc.It takes an average of four days for one of the city\u2019s 53 noise inspectors to respond and review to a complaint, according to the city\u2019s Environmental Protection Department. By then, the house party is over and the cat has calmed down. And grievances filed through the 311 system tend to be dominated by certain groups of residents. Manhattanites are two to three times as likely to report a disturbance than those who live in the other boroughs, he said.Enter \u201csmart\u201d technology.Recording devices in public places might give some New Yorkers pause, but Dr. Bello said conversations picked up by the microphones could not be reconstructed from the recordings. An independent acoustical consultant was hired to make sure.During the next phase of the project, sensors will transmit data about the time and day that, say, a dog barked or a street performer crooned, and an estimate for the sound level.Eventually, an app called Urbane will allow users to interact with the data, while another app will complement 311 reporting and possibly help New Yorkers track how complaints are handled.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot that needs to be investigated and a lot of things that need to be solved before it\u2019s in a place to really help people,\u201d Dr. Bello said.So far, he said, the reception to the project\u2019s potential has been enthusiastic. The team is scouting new sites for sensors, but the process is time-consuming because they need a strong internet signal, a power source and approval from building owners. N.Y.U. has also made efforts to talk to nearby residents to explain the program.Ted Timbers, a spokesman for the Environmental Protection Department, said officials \u201clook forward to reviewing the data produced through the Sonyc research project to determine if it would be helpful in our enforcement efforts.\u201dDr. Silva will be wrestling with troves of data from the city to contextualize noise with factors like traffic and census information to generate \u201ca full geometry\u201d of the urban landscape.\u201cOn the geek side,\u201d he said, it is exciting to be able to translate technology in ways that \u201ccould change the city.\u201dMaking stronger correlations between crime patterns and noise levels, for example, could help shape public policy.

{"Headline": "Betsy DeVos, Trump\u2019s Education Pick, Has Steered Money From Public Schools", "Date": "2016-11-23", "News": "Supported byIt is hard to find anyone more passionate about the idea of steering public dollars away from traditional public schools than Betsy DeVos, Donald J. Trump\u2019s pick as the cabinet secretary overseeing the nation\u2019s education system.But Ms. DeVos\u2019s efforts to expand educational opportunity in her home state of Michigan and across the country have focused little on existing public schools, and almost entirely on establishing newer, more entrepreneurial models to compete with traditional schools for students and money. Her donations and advocacy go almost entirely toward groups seeking to move students and money away from what Mr. Trump calls \u201cfailing government schools.\u201dConservative school choice activists hailed her on Wednesday as a fellow disrupter, and as someone who would block what they see as federal intrusion on local schools.Former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, where Ms. DeVos helped push legislation establishing tax credits for scholarships to private schools, called her an \u201coutstanding pick,\u201d a \u201cpassionate change agent to press for a new education vision.\u201dFrederick M. Hess, the director of education policy studies for the conservative American Enterprise Institute in Washington, called Ms. DeVos a \u201csmart, principled small-government conservative who\u2019s experienced in politics and versed in the relevant policy.\u201dBut to teachers\u2019 unions, she is anathema.Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, called Ms. DeVos \u201cthe most ideological, anti-public education nominee\u201d since the secretary of education was elevated to the cabinet level four decades ago.Even some groups that share her support for charter schools worried that picking someone so closely identified as a champion of vouchers signaled that the Trump administration would try to starve public schools.As a candidate, Mr. Trump proposed steering $20 billion in existing federal money toward vouchers that families could use to help pay for private or parochial schools, perhaps tapping into $15 billion in so-called Title I money that goes to schools that serve the country\u2019s poorest children. He called school choice \u201cthe civil rights issues of our time.\u201dMichigan is one of the nation\u2019s biggest school choice laboratories, especially with charter schools. The Detroit, Flint and Grand Rapids school districts have among the nation\u2019s 10 largest shares of students in charters, and the state sends $1 billion in education funding to charters annually. Of those schools, 80 percent are run by for-profit organizations, a far higher share than anywhere else in the nation.But if Michigan is a center of school choice, it is also among the worst places to argue that choice has made schools better. As the state embraced and then expanded charters over the past two decades, its rank has fallen on national reading and math tests. Most charter schools perform below the state average.And a federal review in 2015 found \u201can unreasonably high\u201d percentage of charter schools on the list of the state\u2019s lowest-performing schools. The number of charter schools on that list had doubled since 2010, after the passage of a law a group financed by Ms. DeVos pushed to expand the schools. The group blocked a provision in that law that would have prevented failing schools from expanding or replicating.Ms. DeVos, 58, got into education advocacy primarily as a backer of vouchers, and has served on the board of several organizations that have campaigned for them across the country.A ballot initiative she led to establish vouchers in Michigan failed in 2000. The next year, she established the Great Lakes Education Project, which became an ardent proponent of charter school expansion, and has donated generously to candidates who have supported it.The Michigan law pushed by Ms. DeVos to establish charter schools 20 years ago allows an unusually large number of organizations to start such schools, yet established little mechanism for oversight. Even Republican supporters of charter schools say the law has allowed failing charter schools to expand or replicate.Like many conservatives who supported Mr. Trump, she does not support Common Core, the set of standards for what students should know at each grade level that was developed by the National Governors Association and other groups \u2014 and that has been incorrectly branded as a federal policy.She also had not supported Mr. Trump; her family was behind Senator Marco Rubio of Florida in the Republican presidential primary.Advertisement"}

The appeal, filed with the General Court, the top appellate court of the European Union, represents the beginning of a lengthy standoff between European authorities, the Irish government and Apple.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.There is much at stake for both sides.For European officials, the Apple tax ruling is the most visible of a series of cases against American companies accused of using Europe\u2019s tax system to reduce their tax burdens unfairly.

Business groups worry that parts of the law \u2014 such as required security checks on companies in industries like finance and communications, and mandatory in-country data storage \u2014 will make foreign operations more expensive or lock them out altogether. Individual users will have to register their real names to use messaging services in China.He added that by creating such restrictions, China risked isolating itself technologically from the rest of the world.But in many ways, the regulations are not likely to have a major impact on much about how business is done. Most of the rules are already in effect, but not codified. Other parts are vague enough that the government will determine their meaning on the fly.The law, however, is an important statement from Beijing on how the internet should be run: with tighter controls over companies and better tracking of individual citizens.Calling it a \u201cbasic law,\u201d Chen Jihong, a partner at the Zhong Lun law firm in Beijing, said the rules were set up to deal with the growing number of legal issues regarding the Chinese internet and to seek to strike a balance between privacy and security.\u201cThe law only stipulates principles; it would take follow-up laws or interpretations to specify the standards,\u201d he said.Human Rights Watch said on Monday that it was concerned about several aspects of the law, including that it calls for real-name registration for users of Chinese instant messaging services.The final law did soften a few elements. In particular, a second draft of the law said foreign businesses did not need to keep all of their data inside China \u2014 just important business data collected within China or about Chinese consumers.For years the government has been working to ensure that people\u2019s real names are linked to their online activities. Beijing has also long restricted many types of online content, from pornography to political discussion.Last year China passed a national security law that called for technology that supports crucial sectors of the economy and government to be \u201csecure and controllable.\u201d Industry groups say that language means companies can be forced to allow third-party access to their networks, provide encryption keys or hand over source code.After the state news media announced the law\u2019s passage, comments on Chinese news and social media sites were largely censored.On one news app run by the internet company Tencent, some users applauded the law as a way for China to crack down on internet fraudsters and the less savory parts of the web. Others wondered what the cost of that security would be.\u201cI hope this won\u2019t be a law that does more to limit freedom of speech,\u201d wrote one user under the screen name Leisa Wenzhou.Cao Li contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

Trump wanted a cabinet secretary who could help him dismantle and replace President Obama\u2019s health care law, he could not have found anyone more prepared than Representative Tom Price, who has been studying how to accomplish that goal for more than six years.Mr. Price, an orthopedic surgeon who represents many of the northern suburbs of Atlanta, speaks with the self-assurance of a doctor about to perform another joint-replacement procedure. He knows the task and will proceed with brisk efficiency.Mr. Trump has picked Mr. Price, a six-term Republican congressman, to be secretary of health and human services, Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team announced Tuesday morning.While some Republicans have attacked the Affordable Care Act without proposing an alternative, Mr. Price has introduced bills offering a detailed, comprehensive replacement plan in every Congress since 2009, when Democrats started work on the legislation. Many of his ideas are included in the \u201cBetter Way\u201d agenda issued several months ago by House Republicans.In debate on the Affordable Care Act in 2009, Mr. Price railed against \u201ca stifling and oppressive federal government,\u201d a theme that pervades his politics. His most frequent objection to the law is that it interferes with the ability of patients and doctors to make medical decisions \u2014 a concern he will surely take with him if he wins Senate confirmation.\u201cThe practicing physician and the patient could not have a better friend in that office than Tom Price,\u201d said Representative Michael C. Burgess, Republican of Texas, who is also a physician.Mr. Price, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, said he felt events had borne out his warnings about the health law.\u201cCongressional Democrats and the Obama administration blatantly ignored the voices of the American people and rammed through a hyperpartisan piece of legislation that will have a disastrous effect on our nation\u2019s health care system,\u201d Mr. Price said shortly after Mr. Obama signed the bill in 2010.Now, he says: \u201cPremiums have gone up, not down. Many Americans lost the health coverage they were told time and time again by the president that they could keep. Choices are fewer.\u201dA list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.The legislation Mr. Price has proposed, the Empowering Patients First Act, would repeal the Affordable Care Act and offer age-adjusted tax credits for the purchase of individual and family health insurance policies.The bill would create incentives for people to contribute to health savings accounts; offer grants to states to subsidize insurance for \u201chigh-risk populations\u201d; allow insurers licensed in one state to sell policies to residents of others; and authorize business and professional groups to provide coverage to members through \u201cassociation health plans.\u201dAs secretary, Mr. Price would be responsible for a department with an annual budget of more than $1 trillion, health programs that insure more than 100 million Americans, and agencies that regulate food and drugs and sponsor much of the nation\u2019s biomedical research.Democrats criticized the selection of Mr. Price.\u201cCongressman Price has proven to be far out of the mainstream of what Americans want when it comes to Medicare, the Affordable Care Act and Planned Parenthood,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, who is in line to be the Senate Democratic leader in the new Congress. \u201cThanks to those three programs, millions of American seniors, families, people with disabilities and women have access to quality, affordable health care. Nominating Congressman Price to be the H.H.S. secretary is akin to asking the fox to guard the henhouse.\u201dFrom his days as a Georgia state senator, Mr. Price, now 62, has been a voice for doctors, often aligned with the positions of the American Medical Association and the Medical Association of Georgia.He has introduced legislation that would make it easier for doctors to defend themselves against medical malpractice lawsuits and to enter into private contracts with Medicare beneficiaries. Under such contracts, doctors can, in effect, opt out of Medicare and charge more than the amounts normally allowed by the program\u2019s rules.He also supported legislation to bar federal funds for Planned Parenthood, saying some of its clinics had been involved in what he called \u201cbarbaric\u201d abortion practices.Cecile Richards, the president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said that Mr. Price \u201cposes a grave threat to women\u2019s health\u201d and that as health secretary he \u201ccould take women back decades.\u201d If he had his way, she said, \u201cmillions of women could be cut off from Planned Parenthood\u2019s preventive health services,\u201d could lose access to free birth control under the Affordable Care Act and could again be charged more than men for the same health insurance.Mr. Price\u2019s intimate knowledge of Medicare could serve him well. The secretary of health and human services sets Medicare payment policies for doctors, updates the physician fee schedule each year and issues rules that can have a huge influence on the practice of medicine. The government is carrying out a law that changes how doctors are paid under Medicare, and Medicare often serves as a model for private insurers.On the other hand, as secretary, Mr. Price would need a broader perspective. He would have to consider not only the interests of doctors, but also the needs of Medicare beneficiaries, Medicaid patients and taxpayers who finance those programs.Mr. Price is a strong conservative who invariably excites the audience at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference. His website lists him as a member of the Tea Party Caucus. His district includes territory once represented by Newt Gingrich, a former speaker of the House. But Mr. Price is no bomb thrower. He works within the system and has led two groups that promote conservative policies in the House.Some of the parts of the government that Mr. Trump promised to dismantle if he was elected.Born in Lansing, Mich., Mr. Price went to college and medical school at the University of Michigan, did his residency at Emory University in Atlanta and was medical director of the orthopedic clinic at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta.He says he got into politics because he found that officials in Washington and Atlanta who had no medical training were making decisions that affected his ability to take care of patients.Speaking at a political conference in early 2010, Mr. Price said he was proud to join fellow conservatives in an effort to beat back a \u201cvile liberal agenda.\u201dIn a similar vein, he complained this year that Obama administration officials were trying to \u201ccommandeer clinical decision-making\u201d by forcing doctors to participate in experiments that test new ways of paying for prescription drugs, hip and knee replacement operations, and heart surgery for Medicare patients.As secretary of health and human services, Mr. Price could carry out the advice he has given Mr. Obama: \u201cStop these mandatory demonstration projects.\u201dMr. Price is also an outspoken opponent of abortion and has consistently received ratings of 100 percent from the National Right to Life Committee and scores of zero from the Planned Parenthood Federation of America.Gay rights groups have also been critical of Mr. Price. Sarah Kate Ellis, the president and chief executive of GLAAD, formerly known as the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, said Mr. Price was \u201ccompletely unfit\u201d to be health secretary.When the Supreme Court ruled last year that the Constitution guarantees a right to same-sex marriage, Mr. Price said it was \u201cnot only a sad day for marriage, but a further judicial destruction of our entire system of checks and balances.\u201dAlso on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that he had chosen Seema Verma, a health policy expert in Indiana, to be administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Working in state government and then as president of a consulting company, she helped Indiana expand Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act, with conservative policies that emphasized \u201cpersonal responsibility.\u201dMs. Verma worked closely with Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, the vice president-elect, and with former Gov. Mitch Daniels, also a Republican. She has won praise from health care providers and state legislators of both parties. She has also provided technical assistance and advice to Medicaid officials in other states.Under Mr. Obama, the agency that runs Medicare and Medicaid has also led efforts to carry out the Affordable Care Act, supervising most of the online marketplaces where people can buy health insurance and obtain subsidies to help cover the cost.Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Soda Taxes Gain Wider Acceptance, Your Bottle May Be Next", "Date": "2016-11-26", "News": "Supported byWith that public momentum, a soda tax may be coming to a city near you.Advocates say the recent sweep represents a watershed moment in the fight for soft-drink taxes. Once viewed as measures likely to find support only in largely health-conscious cities like Berkeley and Boulder, soda taxes have emerged as a bountiful revenue source for cash-strapped local governments to fund early childhood education, public safety and deficit reduction. Soda tax advocates say they believe more cities will now consider their own taxes on sweetened beverages to combat obesity and to finance local programs.\u201cThere\u2019s a momentum with these taxes that will be hard for the industry to stop,\u201d said Kelly D. Brownell, the dean of the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University, who was met with some ridicule when he first proposed a \u201csin tax\u201d on junk food in 1994. \u201cI expect a year or two from now that the taxes will be widespread.\u201dAll of the new measures so far impose a tax of at least a penny per ounce of sugary drinks, including sodas, sweetened iced teas and some fruit drinks. Soda tax supporters say they are taking inspiration from the fight against tobacco, which included successful efforts to impose hefty taxes on cigarettes as a way to curb consumption. They have even taken to calling the industry \u201cBig Soda,\u201d a not-so-veiled reference to Big Tobacco.Even so, beverage makers say they are not convinced that soda taxes will be widely adopted. With the help of the beverage association, they have effectively painted the taxes as unfair nanny-state measures that are bad for business and impose a disproportionate burden on the poor.\u201cI\u2019m originally from Iowa, born and bred, and I just don\u2019t see this discriminatory, regressive tax being embraced by Iowans or Midwesterners or Southerners and others in a large swath of the country,\u201d said Susan Neely, the president of the American Beverage Association. \u201cI just do not believe that this is going to be a tax sweep throughout America.\u201dBut now he sees soft-drink regulation gaining mainstream acceptance.\u201cWhile we may have lost that battle in the courts, you can make the very good case that we won the war,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg said.\u201cOne thing we\u2019ll continue to do with full gusto is try to reduce calories and sugar in the American diet,\u201d Ms. Neely said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to fight with public health. We agree that more needs to be done, and we\u2019re trying to do it in a very serious and systematic way. We believe we have a responsibility to help address the obesity problem, and we\u2019re doing it in a way that we think is powerful and will yield lasting results.\u201dJohn Arnold, a hedge fund billionaire who invested heavily in the Philadelphia and California campaigns, said he became interested in soda taxes for public health reasons, but also believes soda taxes have advantages over other ways to raise municipal money. \u201cDo you do it by increasing sales taxes or increasing income taxes, or can you find ways, like through soda taxes, where you get an added benefit of improving the health at the local level in addition to raising money?\u201d he asked.Both Mr. Arnold and Mr. Bloomberg said they hoped the recent election successes would make soda taxes a more popular idea, able to attract political support and a wider array of financial supporters. Mr. Bloomberg said he was committed to funding well-organized efforts as they continue to emerge.\u201cWe certainly aren\u2019t going to walk away from this,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What It Takes to Open a Bookstore", "Date": "2016-11-29", "News": "Supported byFor more than 20 years, small bookstores have been vanishing, their business models under pressure from large competitors and internet retailers.In the last several years, though, there are signs that independent bookstores are making a comeback in New York and other cities, in part through innovative financing that gives neighborhoods a stake in the businesses.A case in point: Jessica Stockton Bagnulo and Rebecca Fitting, the owners of Greenlight Bookstore in Fort Greene, have just opened a new location in a second Brooklyn neighborhood, Prospect Lefferts Garden.I\u2019m surely not the only bookworm who has fantasized about working in a bookstore: The quiet, convivial atmosphere; the rows of spines with titles you have always meant to read; the enthusiastic conversations about books.But as I learned, it\u2019s not quite as relaxing as it looks.In interviews, the Greenlight owners and other bookstore entrepreneurs in New York walked me through some of the decisions that need to be taken into account in such a venture.When Ms. Fitting and Ms. Bagnulo opened their first store, they found that banks were unwilling to lend to them.So they asked friends, families and neighbors for loans of $1,000 or more, and pledged to pay those loans back (with interest) over the course of five years. The store did not even have an opening date, Ms. Bagnulo said, so the backers were taking \u201ca leap of faith.\u201dThey raised about $75,000 for the Fort Greene location that way, which helped to persuade conventional lenders to come on board.For the new store, they wanted to cleave to that model.With the help of 95 people, they raised $242,600 for the location, some of it from friends and family but the majority from people in the neighborhood.The lessons from Greenlight are being put to use in other places. Brad Johnson, the store manager of a location of a California bookstore chain, Diesel, is using a community lender program that draws direct inspiration from the Brooklyn store.Janet Geddis, the founder and owner of Avid Bookshop in Athens, Ga., also used a version of the community lending idea to open her first location, also using several other lines of support, including a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo.Emily Russo, the co-owner of a bookstore named Print in Portland, Me., used an even smaller community to raise money for opening the store, putting together about half the necessary capital with the help of her parents and her husband.And a Bronx-born entrepreneur, No\u00eblle Santos, is relying partly on Indiegogo and on her own savings to open The Lit Bar in the borough.Geo Ong, who has worked at Diesel and will manage the new Greenlight location, said that the phenomenon of independents opening with these sorts of models across the country gave the lie to a recent narrative that \u201cbookstores don\u2019t succeed.\u201d\u201cA lot of a bookstore\u2019s success is case-by-case,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the fact that some bookstores are thriving and a lot of bookstores are opening means that there\u2019s something inherently successful in the model.\u201dMs. Bagnulo said there were two major questions to consider when deciding where to open a bookstore: Which city neighborhoods are in need of one, and which can support one.\u201cIt\u2019s sort of joking, but the rule of thumb is, if the neighborhood can support a farmers market, the neighborhood can support a bookstore,\u201d she said.Ms. Santos, 29, is evaluating a location in the Hunts Point neighborhood of the borough.She said she was confident that the area could support a bookstore, saying The Lit Bar, as her store will be called, will be the only independent bookstore in the Bronx.Though she grew up as a self-described \u201cBarnes & Noble kid,\u201d she has embraced the need for neighborhoods to have their own independent bookstores.\u201cWhen you come into a neighborhood like the South Bronx, where most of our population is Hispanic and African-American, you need your stores, your community centers and your organizations to reflect the people that actually live there,\u201d she said.For the new Greenlight store, Ms. Fitting and Ms. Bagnulo commissioned the work of the architect Frederick Tang, who also designed the Fort Greene store.\u201cWe want to make the store beautiful and thoughtful and designed but we don\u2019t want it to be inaccessible and snobby,\u201d she said. They worried about everything from the lighting to the color of the wood shelves (they settled on a honey tone).A narrow storefront and low-hanging pipes constrained some of the space, but Mr. Tang figured out a way to make the ceiling higher in places where the pipes were less plentiful.\u201cIt needs to be somewhere you can come hang out and have a conversation,\u201d Ms. Bagnulo said, \u201cor where you can have a loud party, or where you can have speakers who are going to curse, where kids and families and babies can come hang out during story time.\u201dMs. Fitting, a former sales representative at Random House, where she helped sell books to independents, handles much of the book purchasing.\u201cFor this store, I handpicked every freaking title,\u201d she said, all 7,248 of them.Ms. Fitting said that she tried to put her personal inflection on the inventory, for example, buying \u201cThe Gift\u201d by Lewis Hyde, during the holiday season, which she said was \u201cone of the best gifts that you could give to any creative person, or to yourself.\u201dBut she said she never avoided buying a book because she didn\u2019t personally like it, and tried hard not to make assumptions about what might sell well. That said, it\u2019s true that conservative political books are not big local sellers.\u201cA new Bill O\u2019Reilly book comes out, and we buy one because someone in our marketplace might want one, or might want to give it someone else,\u201d she added.The new store seemed to be off to a good start this weekend, having sold about 500 books.The best-seller on the first day was Mr. Whitehead\u2019s \u201cThe Underground Railroad.\u201d The top book for the entire weekend, in a bookstore owned by two working mothers, was \u201cRad Women Worldwide,\u201d by Kate Schatz.Jonah Engel Bromwich is a reporter at The Times working on breaking news.

{"Headline": "The Alabama Crimson Tide of Mexico", "Date": "2016-11-17", "News": "The Rams of Tec de Monterrey are a college football power. Ask Cam Newton.Supported byMONTERREY, Mexico \u2014 Like many football-crazed boys, Luis Carranza grew up with a poster of Emmitt Smith, his hero, on his bedroom wall and vowed to emulate him.He took a one-hour bus ride to football practice, starting at age 4, and the discipline of study, running, study, running earned him a spot first on an elite high school team and then on what may as well be Mexico\u2019s Crimson Tide: the Rams of Tec de Monterrey.He is now a star running back, and pint-size fans cried out his name and engulfed him for autographs after a recent victory, even though an injury had knocked him out of the game early. A star is a star.\u201cIt\u2019s such a big tradition here,\u201d Carranza said. \u201cEverybody is committed, even the little fans.\u201dThere is no tailgating here, but the stadium tacos aren\u2019t bad. Nobody cries \u201cGooooool!\u201d at a big score, but the \u201ctouch\u201d in \u201cTouchdown!\u201d gets more gusto. Instead of billion-dollar television deals, the games are limited to local TV and streamed on an internet site. And whatever signing bonus these players have in their future will probably come not from the N.F.L. but from the law firms and businesses many are headed to after graduation.The addiction to the other f\u00fatbol \u2014 \u201cf\u00fatbol soccer,\u201d as people make the distinction here \u2014 is better known in this country. But the fever for American football \u2014 \u201cf\u00fatbol americano\u201d \u2014 feeds a vibrant subculture rooted in college teams that attract thousands of fans and players for the Tigres (Tigers), the Potros (Colts), the Aztecas (Aztecs), the Pumas, the \u00c1guilas (Eagles) and one of the oldest and most winning teams, the Borregos Salvajes (Rams.)\u201cThe big difference with the Americans is size and speed, in which they have an advantage over us,\u201d Carranza, 23, said, explaining the appeal. \u201cBut here we play with heart.\u201dOn Monday, the N.F.L., picking up on the American football passion here, will play its first regular-season game in Mexico in 11 years, the Houston Texans versus the Oakland Raiders at the famed Azteca Stadium in Mexico City.The game, the first Monday Night Football contest to be played outside the United States, is sold out, with 76,000 expected to attend.10 PhotosAmerican football does not have the global reach of basketball and baseball, but it is played in dozens of countries. In an international tournament of college teams, Mexico has won back-to-back championships, this year defeating a team from the United States made up of Division III players. Mexico has also done well in postcollegiate international tournaments.This surprises nobody in Monterrey, where the Borregos Salvajes have long exemplified the best football in the country.It was only a scrimmage, but the team\u2019s 2009 defeat of Blinn College in Texas, which featured Cam Newton at quarterback, is still recalled here with the fervor of the Catch and other great N.F.L. plays.\u201cWe didn\u2019t know anything about the team, but we heard all this talk about this great Division I quarterback playing for them,\u201d said Sergio Cantu Mu\u00f1oz, a Tec coach and former player who intercepted Newton, then playing for Blinn between stops at the University of Florida and Auburn.Pulling up the video of the play he keeps on his cellphone, he added, \u201cI didn\u2019t realize until later how important it was.\u201dA handful of its players over the years have landed on practice squads in the N.F.L., but Mexico has had only fledgling professional leagues, including one that started in February but has only four teams.Most players here know that college is the pinnacle of the sport. And then they graduate and move on to careers.The league gives players seven years of eligibility as long as they remain enrolled in classes, meaning some are earning master\u2019s degrees.Carranza is studying to be a lawyer, as are several of his teammates, while other players are working toward jobs in finance, engineering and other professions. The team claims a 90 percent graduation rate.It makes Tec de Monterrey, one of the highest-ranking universities academically in Latin America, something more of a Stanford, then. But with more championships than any other college, it can brag of the winning tradition of an Alabama.\u201cI would say they are like a midway Division II team or a strong Division III,\u201d said Frank Gonzalez, a former longtime coach who unsuccessfully sought to have the university join the N.C.A.A. \u201cThere have been many players good enough to play in the N.F.L., but there are many more players good enough in the United States. There is no pipeline here to send them to the league.\u201dThe players say they are in it more for the game than for the fame.Unlike soccer, with a powerful professional league and a system of clubs and academies to recruit and mold young players, American football has a pipeline that is more ad hoc.Many have followed a similar progression, the sons of players who joined one of the hundreds of youth football clubs in the country and then landed on high school and college teams, most often with the help of scholarships.Tec de Monterrey has had a football team for nearly 70 years, an outgrowth of the sport carried to Mexico by American visitors years before.Television, and more recently the internet, have helped stoke interest in the game; N.F.L. and college games have regularly aired for years, and cable and satellite television has expanded the offerings.With Tec and the proximity to the border \u2014 about a three-hour drive to Texas \u2014 Monterrey has been a football hotbed.On a recent night, hundreds of children clad in helmets and pads raced up and down a field under stadium lights, aspiring to join Tec or one of its rival teams. Some of the Rams coach the younger players.Concerns about concussions and their serious consequences into adulthood have been raised by parents here, though the issue has not been as extensively covered as in the United States.Hugo Barberi, the coach of one of the largest teams here, said that membership dropped off about 15 percent after the 2015 movie \u201cConcussion,\u201d about a forensic pathologist\u2019s fight against the N.F.L. to recognize brain disease in players linked to their years of playing, but that it had rebounded in recent months.The club reduced contact at practices and changed tackling techniques to de-emphasize head-to-head collisions.Likewise, at the college level, neurological testing has been introduced before and during the season, and coaches said efforts had been made to curtail dangerous hits.The thinking here is that while the level of awareness of the health consequences might not be the same as in the United States, neither is the intensity of the game.\u201cThe game is not as physical here,\u201d said Alberto Garc\u00eda Castillo, the owner and editor of Receptor.com.mx, an online publication in Mexico that covers American football. \u201cThere are hits, but it is done without losing valor and respect for the other side.\u201dStill, teams want to win, and the dominance of Tec and its sister campuses, fed in part by robust scholarship offers, resulted in the college league\u2019s being divided several years ago.Tec campuses \u2014 they all wear blue-and-white uniforms and have the same Borregos nickname \u2014 joined with a handful of other private universities, while the public universities have their own league.They are fierce rivals and, Garc\u00eda Castillo said, have accused one another of unfair recruiting practices.This year, there were some interleague games \u2014 some of them drawing thousands of fans \u2014 and the champions of the two conferences will meet in a \u201csuper bowl\u201d for the first time since the split.For the Rams in Monterrey, the pressure is on to win it.They entered the playoffs Saturday with a 6-4 record, while they have previously been undefeated or had only one or two losses. They won their playoff game, though, and advanced to the final next Saturday.Nevertheless, it has been a trying season. Carlos Altamirano is the third coach this season, after one was fired for manhandling a player in practice, and an interim coach did not get the top job.\u201cEso! Eso!\u201d That\u2019s it! he barked, pushing the quarterbacks through a set of scrambling drills as \u201cHighway to Hell\u201d and other rock and hip-hop hits blared from speakers.Instruction \u2014 and cursing \u2014 in Spanish mixed with the usual English football terms: touchdown, quarterback, lineman. Plays are written and called in English, as well, partly because many are adapted from the team\u2019s American counterparts and several of the coaches have attended training clinics in the United States. For a time, coaches wanted the players to \u201cplay in English\u201d so they would be familiar with the terms if they earned a tryout with an American team.That largely remains a dream.Carlos Martell, 23, a linebacker who is Carranza\u2019s classmate in legal studies, grew up surrounded by football memorabilia, and his father invites friends and family members over every Sunday to watch N.F.L. games. Martell has been playing the game since he was 4, but he knows he is not big or fast enough to play at the N.F.L. level.\u201cHere, the main thing is school, your studies,\u201d he said. \u201cWe may have dreams about playing in the N.F.L., but we also know so few have made it.\u201dBefore the last regular-season game, the Rams players gathered for a vulgarity-laced pep rally among themselves in the stands of the football stadium, which was set to host its final game. After 66 years, it will be demolished and a new football stadium built. The players hung a banner reading \u201cAlways Home\u201d and signed it.\u201cLeave everything on the field,\u201d said one. \u201cWhat happens tomorrow, keep it in your heart, man,\u201d urged another. \u201cLet\u2019s rip this mother up, boys!\u201d said another.And so they did, demolishing their opponent, the Rams of Tec\u2019s Mexico City campus, 28-0. In the fourth quarter, when the stadium loudspeaker played \u201cJump Around,\u201d that is what the Monterrey players did on the sideline.Only a few hundred people attended the game; Tec usually wins, after all, and many players and coaches believe the leagues should reunite so that the best teams across the country face each other more regularly.\u201cThe level of competition needs to improve,\u201d said Eduardo Marcos Califa, 23, who scored one of the touchdowns. \u201cIf that happens, the interest will grow more.\u201dCarranza ended up on the sideline for much of the game, and not for the first time. He had torn a ligament in his knee a couple of years ago but managed to bounce back.\u201cThe ups and downs, this is what American football teaches you,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t give up; overcome challenges. Our classes give you constant challenges, and you have to find solutions. You have to try something different. That\u2019s the same on the field. That\u2019s been my life on the field.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Fantastic Beasts\u2019 Is a Hit for Warner Bros.", "Date": "2016-11-20", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Warner Bros. and J. K. Rowling pulled off an exceptionally difficult magic trick over the weekend. Not only did they bring the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d film franchise back to life, they also did it without Harry Potter.At the weekend\u2019s start, it was unclear how Harry Potter fans would react to \u201cFantastic Beasts,\u201d which Ms. Rowling (writing her first screenplay) based on her 2001 creature compendium of the same name \u2014 one of Harry Potter\u2019s textbooks, as the mythology goes. But \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d does not feature any of the same central characters, and it takes place in 1926 New York instead of present-day Britain.\u201cThat speaks volumes about the future of this franchise \u2014 about reaching a new generation of fans,\u201d Sue Kroll, Warner\u2019s president of worldwide marketing and distribution, said by phone on Sunday morning.\u201cWe knew we had a lot to live up to with this movie,\u201d continued Ms. Kroll, fresh off a plane from China, where \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d will roll out in the days ahead. \u201cPeople have enormously warm memories of those earlier Harry Potter movies. So we are very, very happy with the way that audiences responded to this completely fresh and original story. We are now set up beautifully for a very long run.\u201d\u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d couldn\u2019t match the heights of a B-list comic book character?Ms. Rowling\u2019s new wizards and witches also faced inevitable comparisons with the eight Harry Potter movies that Warner released between 2001 and 2011. The lowest opening among those films \u2014 each adapted from a smash-hit novel \u2014 was for \u201cHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,\u201d which collected about $90 million (after adjusting for inflation) over its first three days in North American theaters.Part of Warner\u2019s goal with \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d was to reposition Ms. Rowling\u2019s wizarding world as a limitless movie universe. Ms. Kroll\u2019s team introduced the first trailer for the new film last December. Five more trailers and featurettes followed. Marketing also included extensive partnerships with Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, Google, Amazon and China\u2019s Weibo.It was a delicate line to walk: Warner used snippets of music from the original Harry Potter movies and invoked the boy wizard\u2019s name in certain marketing materials, but was careful not to create overt connections that did not exist in the movie \u2014 something that studios often do with franchise spinoffs, much to the displeasure of fans.Ms. Rowling\u2019s publisher, Scholastic, also expects a \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d bump. The screenplay, for instance, was published in book form on Friday. \u201cAny new story from J. K. Rowling is an event, lifting sales and interest in the backlist books,\u201d Ellie Berger, president of Scholastic Trade, said in a phone interview last week. More than 450 million copies of Ms. Rowling\u2019s books have been sold worldwide.The \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d screenplay, Ms. Berger said, should deliver \u201cstrong, sustained\u201d sales. \u201cWe know there is just tremendous interest,\u201d she added.Three other movies arrived in wide release at domestic theaters over the weekend, and each was trampled.Also bombing was \u201cBleed for This\u201d (Open Road), a boxing drama starring Miles Teller that collected just $2.4 million. Open Road paid a reported $4 million for distribution rights. Faring slightly better was \u201cThe Edge of Seventeen\u201d (STX), a teenage comedic drama starring Hailee Steinfeld and produced by James L. Brooks on a slim budget of $9 million. It arrived to $4.8 million in ticket sales.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why U.K. Is Struggling to Find the Path to \u2018Brexit\u2019", "Date": "2016-11-21", "News": "Supported byThe document identified tensions between enthusiasts for British withdrawal, including the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, and the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, and those fighting to preserve closer economic ties to the bloc, such as the chancellor, Philip Hammond. The enthusiasts believe Britain has to make a clean break with the European Union, while the more cautious types want to preserve Britain\u2019s access to the European market by maintaining membership in the customs union or the single market, or perhaps some combination of the two.As Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s self-imposed deadline of March for starting negotiations on withdrawal with the European Union draws closer, this clash is emerging as the primary sticking point. But it is proving remarkably difficult to resolve.Both the customs union and the single market eliminate tariffs between member states. The customs union sets tariffs with non-European nations, so members share a common trade policy with the rest of the world. The single market removes non-tariff trade barriers, too, for instance by maintaining common product standards. Unlike most free trade deals, the single market also covers some services, which are crucial for Britain, with its big financial sector.For example, without Britain\u2019s single market membership, banks based in London (including foreign-owned ones) could not offer many services to clients in Continental nations.Norway has considerable (but not unlimited) access to the single market without being part of the European Union, or its customs union, through membership in the European Economic Area. The downside is that Norway has no vote in making rules it must follow.A maze of rules and regulations aimed at leveling the playing field and harmonizing product standards infuriates British euroskeptics and helped fuel the campaign to leave the European Union, known as Brexit.To secure full single market membership, Britain would most likely have to contribute to the European Union budget, accept the free movement of workers from the rest of the bloc, and accept rulings from the European Court of Justice or a similar body such as the European Free Trade Agreement (EFTA) court. That would be a tough sell to hardened supporters of Brexit in Mrs. May\u2019s Conservative Party.It might be. Not all members belong to the European Union; Turkey, for example, is not a European Union member but is in the customs union. Britain would be able to trade freely in goods within the union, which would free it of the burden and inefficiency of checking the origins of all the products coming to and from the bloc. But Britain would have to comply with some European Union regulations. Quitting the customs union could mean significant new tariffs, for example for British-based automakers. Consequently, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, is reported to want to retain customs union membership.Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.As little as possible. Accused of lacking a strategy, it refuses to give a running commentary, saying that would weaken its negotiating position. But British officials had not prepared for Brexit before the referendum and are having to examine its impact on every sector of the economy \u2014 a huge exercise. In doing so, they appear to be uncovering more questions than answers.In October, she stressed the importance of regaining control of immigration policy and of freeing Britain from the European Court of Justice \u2014 comments that suggested she was aligning herself with the proponents of a clean break. That set off a precipitous decline in the pound.But she has since tread more cautiously, saying that Britain does not face a \u201cbinary\u201d choice between maintaining a formal relationship with the European Union \u2014 either in the customs union or the single market, or some combination of the two \u2014 or a complete divorce. That implies that she wants some kind of hybrid settlement. This might mean leaving, then opting back into parts of Europe\u2019s economic arrangements, for example those that help finance and the auto industry, while offering some budget contributions in exchange.European nations are not so sure. To many it sounds like a variant of Mr. Johnson\u2019s statement that, as far as the European Union is concerned, he is pro having his cake and pro eating it. Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, responded to that by inviting Mr. Johnson to undertake an experiment: \u201cBuy a cake, eat it, and see if it is still there on the plate.\u201dBritain\u2019s decision to quit the European Union was fundamentally a political one, rather than economic, so it is logical to assume that politics will shape the negotiating position of its partners, too.Many European nations will resist any agreement with Britain that undermines the bloc\u2019s fundamental principles, particularly the movement of labor, or its basic economic structures. The fear is that this would prompt other countries to copy the British, which could be the beginning of the end of the entire postwar European drive to greater integration. Though Britain is a big market, the rest of the European Union collectively is bigger, and therefore the survival of the single market of the 27 is more important to most nations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Feature of the College Tour: First-Class Campus Hotels", "Date": "2016-11-21", "News": "Supported byIt was one of many campuses they toured on their college road trips, where the local accommodations were seldom more than utilitarian. They stayed at the Inn at Oberlin, a 70-room hotel owned by the small liberal arts college and one of the few options in town for overnight guests.\u201cIt was kind of outdated and tattered around the edges,\u2019\u2019 recalled Christian\u2019s father, Gary A. Bolles. \u201cThat\u2019s just part of the process,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what you expect when you\u2019re looking at colleges.\u201dOr at least it used to be. Oberlin, like many other colleges and universities around the country, has decided that campus guest quarters, instead of perfunctory, can become pampering places that help promote the institution\u2019s brand and image.\u201cIt was just a complete surprise to find such world-class accommodations,\u201d Mr. Bolles said. \u201cThe college obviously put tremendous thought into every detail, from the booking, to the front desk, to the food in the restaurant.\u201d\u201cIt ties into the boutique hotel movement,\u2019\u2019 Mr. O\u2019Neill said. \u201cThe economy has something to do with it. And the psychographics of guests has a lot to do with it.\u201dThose guests include not only parents and high school seniors but also visiting alumni, lecturers and artists, as well as sports teams and fans who buy tickets to watch those sports teams.Graduate plans to have 20 hotels near colleges or universities by 2019.Smart, in business since 2010, has opened three \u2014 near the University of Chicago, Duke University in Durham, N.C., and Emory University in Atlanta \u2014 with six others on the way.And as the number of college hotels increases, so does their quality. Witness the Hotel at Oberlin.Even guests who might be oblivious to the hotel\u2019s solar, geothermal and radiant cooling and heating systems might have trouble overlooking amenities that chain hotels would not think to offer for rooms starting at $129 a night.\u201cOne of the objectives we had going into this was communicating Oberlin\u2019s core values,\u201d said Dr. Frandsen, who put the cost of the mixed-use project that includes the hotel as well as new retail and office space at $35 million. \u201cSo if we didn\u2019t pick out the soap dishes and the picture frames, we did make a conscious decision to work with people who understood that sustainability is something we value here at Oberlin, and a big part of our story.\u201dLike other colleges that have ventured into the hospitality industry, Oberlin may be less concerned about the hotel\u2019s profitability than with the image it projects.\u201cI think what we\u2019re seeing is a lot of schools realizing that a hotel is a useful amenity in terms of providing a comfortable place for stakeholders and particularly alumni,\u2019\u2019 said Matthew Arrants, Pinnacle Advisory Group\u2019s executive vice president. \u201cYou want your alumni to come back so you can continue ties with them.\u201dSara Masterson, vice president of hotel management at the Olympia Companies, said her company has made a specialty of running college hotels in recent years, as the niche has developed.\u201cWe know what the college\u2019s brand represents and the fabric of their story,\u201d Ms. Masterson said. \u201cColleges have figured out that a hotel can serve as the front door and the back door for prospective students.\u201dWhether any of this will necessarily sway college-scouting families is another matter.Doug Robinson, a father of four in Basking Ridge, N.J., says he has stayed at more than 30 hotels while visiting college campuses in the last 18 months \u2014 first with a son who is now a freshman at Duke and more recently with a daughter who is a high school senior.\u201cI know the consistency,\u201d he said of the chain. \u201cPlus, they\u2019re sometimes massively cheaper.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lithuania\u2019s New Prime Minister Pledges to Increase Military Spending", "Date": "2016-11-22", "News": "Supported byVILNIUS, Lithuania \u2014 Lawmakers in Lithuania chose as their new prime minister on Tuesday a former police chief and interior minister who supports Donald J. Trump\u2019s call for NATO members to spend more on defense.The choice of Saulius Skvernelis, 46, to lead the government came a month after an election won by the Peasants and Greens Union in a populist whirlwind. The party is hard to classify; it is an unorthodox grouping of farmers and environmentalists that leans left on economic issues but to the right on social issues.During the American election campaign, Mr. Trump called on NATO members to spend more for their collective security and rely less on the United States. Members are supposed to spend at least 2 percent of gross domestic product on their military, but only the United States, Britain, Greece, Poland and Estonia do so now.Mr. Skvernelis said in a statement after his election on Tuesday that Lithuania would join them.\u201cWe are ready to increase financing for our military up to 2 percent by the end of 2017 \u2014 2018 at the latest,\u201d he said. \u201cOn top of that, we will increase spending on interior security systems, such as border control, civil defense and intelligence services.\u201dMr. Skvernelis said his government had \u201cfull trust in the United States, as well as other partners in NATO.\u201d The European Union\u2019s sanctions should be relaxed only when there is \u201creal progress on the ground from Russia\u2019s side,\u201d he said, but so far, the involvement of Russian forces in Georgia and Ukraine \u201cdoes not imply willingness to cooperate in a neighborly spirit.\u201dUnlike the more prosperous countries of northwestern Europe, Lithuania worries about emigration, not immigration. Young people leave in search of jobs and higher living standards, and the population has been falling. The Peasants and Greens Union promised to stem the exodus by emphasizing the nation\u2019s cultural heritage, luring investment to rural areas, and cleaning up corruption, especially in the health and defense ministries.Mykolas Majauskas, 34, a new lawmaker from the Homeland Union party, said the country\u2019s political establishment bore much of the blame for the populist wave in the election last month.\u201cPeople are clearly disappointed, and want someone to come in and make a change,\u201d he said.Mr. Skvernelis, the new prime minister, is viewed by some as the public face of a more powerful figure, Ramunas Karbauskis, the businessman who financed the Peasants and Greens Union.Mazvydas Jastramskis, a political scientist at Vilnius University, said that the new prime minister was \u201cpartly a mystery\u201d even for seasoned political observers. \u201cLithuanians\u2019 trust in the business sector is not that high, but they trust people who are seen as successful,\u201d he said, referring to Mr. Karbauskis.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Earth Isn\u2019t Doomed Yet. The Climate Could Survive Trump Policies.", "Date": "2016-11-29", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneIs the battle to contain global warming now lost?During the campaign, the president-elect of the world\u2019s second largest polluter claimed that climate change is a hoax, threatened to drop the Paris accord, committed to kill the Clean Power Plan at the center of President Obama\u2019s emissions reduction strategy, and promised a new dawn for the fossil fuel industry.Don\u2019t give up just yet. True, international diplomacy will become more difficult as China and India weigh their own energy policy commitments in the light of the possibility that the United States will walk away from its promises. But President Trump\u2019s climate policy \u2014 or his lack of one \u2014 could work out in surprising ways.It\u2019s certainly possible that a Trump administration will drop the Clean Power Plan and renege on the Paris accord. But as long as it keeps the nation\u2019s nuclear power plants online, continues tax incentives for wind and solar energy and stays out of the way of the shale energy revolution, Ms. Lovering and Mr. Nordhaus write, \u201cthe U.S. might outperform the commitments that the Obama administration made in Paris.\u201dFor all his promises to bring back coal jobs in Appalachia, Mr. Trump might be drawn in a different direction by his own objectives of promoting natural gas and achieving energy independence. If he gives those goals high priority, he could well end up pursuing policies that would ultimately lower carbon emissions.Striking a meaningful deal on climate has proved an elusive goal. The first try, in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997, committed advanced nations to reduce emissions between 1990 and 2010. But they actually achieved more in terms of reducing dependency on fossil fuels in the decade before the agreement than in the decade after.If the Kyoto target survived, it was only because of other forces: First, the collapse of the Soviet bloc wiped out a lot of European carbon emissions along with the decrepit Eastern European industrial base; then the global downturn that started in 2008 reduced carbon emissions along with economic growth.Even the most aggressive proposals by the Obama administration probably packed less punch than supporters believe. President Obama\u2019s original cap-and-trade bill, which was blocked in the Senate in 2009, proposed emissions limits that were higher than what emissions have turned out to be. The steep decline was driven not just by the recession and slow recovery, but also by the wholesale move by the power sector over the last decade from coal to less polluting natural gas.As Robert Stavins of Harvard University put it, \u201cThe most important factor in terms of carbon emissions in the United States is the price of natural gas.\u201dAnd for all the hand-wringing over the future of the Clean Power Plan, its demise might not even make that much of a difference. The shift from coal to gas will continue to happen anyway.Of course, President Trump could do much more than simply stopping the Clean Power Plan, especially if he had eight years to work with. But why would he do that?This is not to say that the world could survive forever an American administration that doesn\u2019t believe in climate change and does nothing to contain it.According to the International Energy Agency, the commitments made in Paris will cap the growth of greenhouse gas emissions between now and 2040 to 13 percent. The 450 p.p.m. target requires them to fall by 43 percent. Getting there will require rich countries like the United States to help finance much of the transition for poor countries. The role of global diplomacy will rise.\u201cIt will be a big deal that will affect economic growth and jobs,\u201d said David Victor of the School of Global Policy and Strategy at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cWe need a strategy to assure countries that their economic competitors are undertaking similar types of policies.\u201dFor this to work, the United States, as the dominant economic player, must play ball. Simply pursuing energy independence will not go far enough.In four years, the United States might have an administration that is less hostile to the concept of climate change. In any case, the rationale for policies to support low- and no-carbon energy sources will be even stronger then than it is today.\u201cIf a Trump administration lasts only four years, the process could maybe absorb that,\u201d said Oliver Geden, head of research at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs.The bomb is ticking, but the world still has some time.An earlier version of a picture caption misstated where voters favored Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton 4 to 1.

Senators Joe Manchin and Joe Donnelly, both of whom are known for their bipartisanship, would be good candidates.3.

Manipulating the boundaries of election districts is why the approval rating of Congress is abysmally low yet politicians from the same party continually get re-elected.2. Campaign finance reform. Members of Congress spend about half their time on the phone seeking funds for re-election. Since we are paying them handsomely, I want them working for me full time.3. The Affordable Care Act.

Trump overhauled his transition team from top to bottom on Friday, expanded his outreach to more establishment Republicans, and even offered an olive branch to President Obama \u2014 albeit a narrow one.On the other side, Democrats signaled they would move left in the wake of Hillary Clinton\u2019s narrow-but-startling defeat, and the president-elect\u2019s legal antagonist, Gloria Allred, made it clear that neither she nor many of the women who have accused him of sexual assault are going anywhere.Join us again on Monday for continuing live updates on the transition to the 45th presidency of the United States.Mr. Trump said Friday that, after talking with President Obama this week, he might be willing to leave in place parts of the Affordable Care Act once he\u2019s in office.But in the interview, Mr. Trump said he told the president that he would consider keeping two provisions of the law: the prohibition against insurers denying coverage because of a patient\u2019s pre-existing condition; and the one that allows parents to keep their children on their insurance plans until they turn 26.The problem: Without a mandate for everyone to buy health insurance, the popular pre-existing condition provision could send insurance companies into a tailspin, because their costs would rise with sicker customers, and that would not be offset by healthy consumers forced to buy insurance.Mr. Trump said in an interview to be shown on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d Sunday that Mrs. Clinton \u201ccouldn\u2019t have been nicer\u201d in a congratulatory call she made to concede the election, and that Bill Clinton had complimented him on \u201cone of the most amazing\u201d presidential runs he had ever seen.\u201cIt was a lovely call, and it was a tough call for her \u2014 I mean, I can imagine, tougher for her than it would have been for me,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t have been nicer. She just said, \u2018Congratulations, Donald, well done.\u2019\u201dMr. Trump, who on Thursday said he would seek Mr. Obama\u2019s counsel about the presidency, said he would consider asking for Mr. Clinton\u2019s as well.Mr. Trump also promised that there would be no lapse in health insurance for millions of Americans covered under the Affordable Care Act when he repeals and replaces the law.\u201cWe\u2019re going to do it simultaneously \u2014 it\u2019ll be just fine,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I do. I do a good job. You know, I mean, I know how to do this stuff. We\u2019re going to repeal it and replace it. And we\u2019re not going to have, like, a two-day period and we\u2019re not going to have a two-year period where there\u2019s nothing.\u201dMr. Trump has quietly reached out to Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee who took an impassioned stand against Mr. Trump during the campaign.The call came after Mr. Trump\u2019s surprise victory on Tuesday night, according to two people briefed on it, although it was unclear how it went and what was said.Aides to Mr. Trump and Mr. Romney did not respond to requests for comment.With her eye on the right\u2019s Paula Jones legal crusade of the 1990s, Gloria Allred, the civil rights lawyer representing women who have accused Mr. Trump of sexual assault, is trying to lure the president-elect into a legal battle before he takes office.Ms. Allred challenged Mr. Trump on Friday to retract his threat to sue his accusers for defaming him and suggested that she might bring a case against him if he refused. She also said that she was prepared to countersue if Mr. Trump made good on the threat.Ms. Allred cited a precedent for suing a sitting president: Ms. Jones.\u201cObviously the lawsuit against President Clinton by Paula Jones did proceed while he was in office for actions that were alleged to take place prior to his becoming president,\u201d she said.The Jones case forced Mr. Clinton into a deposition that resulted in his impeachment on charges of lying under oath about an affair with an intern.A sobbing Ms. Zervos sat next to Ms. Allred and offered her own solution: \u201cWhat happened to a good, old-fashioned I\u2019m sorry?\u201dGov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who is under a cloud after two aides were convicted of conspiring to shut down traffic on the George Washington Bridge in the so-called Bridgegate scandal, moves aside.Mr. Trump told advisers that he wanted Mr. Pence\u2019s Washington experience and contacts. An executive committee, which will include members of Congress, will advise Mr. Pence as the process moves forward.See the full story.Corey Lewandowski, who was fired as Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager and then went to work for CNN, even as he continued to consult with the campaign, resigned Friday from his political commentator role, the network confirmed.Mr. Lewandowski is expected to take a position in the Trump administration.He was seen in Trump Tower on Wednesday immediately after Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, chatting with senior aides and attending meetings. Mr. Lewandowski did not return calls for comment.Mr. Lewandowski was viewed as a controversial appointment by the network; he had signed a nondisclosure agreement with Mr. Trump that prevented him from criticizing the candidate publicly, and he was still being paid by the campaign while working for CNN.Two former governors, Howard Dean of Vermont and Martin O\u2019Malley of Maryland, also expressed interest Friday in being the party\u2019s new committee chairman.So much for a warm welcome to Washington.Groups on social media are trying to coordinate a Million Woman March the day after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration in protest of the new president. The march will go from the Lincoln Memorial to the White House on Jan. 21 to show \u201cstrength, power and courage.\u201d Men are also encouraged to attend.\u201cNo woman is free unless all women are free,\u201d the organizers of the march wrote on the Facebook page where it is being organized.State groups for the march have already been formed for people to coordinate travel to the capital. However, some fear that the idea could become a logistical nightmare coming so close to Inauguration Day because of the lack of hotel rooms and the potential for clashes with Trump supportersAmong the president-elect\u2019s most pressing questions as he prepares to take office is where he should live.Mr. Trump, a provincial homebody who divides his time among golf courses in Florida and New Jersey and his townhouse apartment in Manhattan, is weighing how much time to spend in Washington, according to two people familiar with his deliberations.One option is spending weekends in New York and most of the week in Washington. Mr. Trump\u2019s wife, Melania, is ultimately planning to move to Washington, according to one person briefed on the discussions, but their 10-year-old son, Barron, is still in school.Mr. Trump may be triumphant, but Gloria Allred isn\u2019t done with him yet.More than 10 women accused Mr. Trump of sexual assault after a video bragging about his groping habits emerged last month. Ms. Allred, the lawyer who has been working with many of the women, does not appear to be letting the president-elect off the hook.At 2:30 p.m. Eastern time on Friday, she said that she was going to issue a challenge to Mr. Trump at a news conference with one of his accusers who has already come out publicly to tell her story. Ms. Allred would not reveal the name of the woman before the event or share any details of the challenge.Before the election, Mr. Trump said that the accusers were all lying and that he might sue them. Ms. Allred told ABC News on Thursday that her clients had no plans to sue Mr. Trump at this point, but that they would countersue if he did so.The election of Donald Trump has emboldened the forces of hate and bigotry in America.White nationalists, Vladimir Putin and ISIS are celebrating Donald Trump\u2019s victory, while innocent, law-abiding Americans are wracked with fear \u2014 especially African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, Muslim Americans, L.G.B.T. Americans and Asian-Americans. Watching white nationalists celebrate while innocent Americans cry tears of fear does not feel like America.Some of the anti-Trump protesters who have taken to the streets this week are supporters of Mr. Sanders, and on Friday the former Democratic presidential candidate reminded them that creating chaos and disorder should not be their goal.Trump Tower, the skyscraper on Fifth Avenue and the home base of the president-elect, has become a fortress in the wake of the election.The lobby, designated a public space by the City of New York, was closed off on Friday morning as Mr. Trump met with advisers. A large police presence surrounded the building.The tower was built with a special permit more than 30 years ago. The city granted Mr. Trump extra space in exchange for maintaining public access to the lobby.Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley libertarian who secretly financed a lawsuit against the website Gawker, was named a member of the Presidential Transition Team Executive Committee on Friday afternoon.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Combative, Populist Steve Bannon Found His Man in Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-11-27", "News": "Supported byWhen Julia Jones arrived at her office in Santa Monica at 8 a.m. \u2014 by Hollywood screenwriter standards, the crack of dawn \u2014 she found Stephen K. Bannon already at his desk, which was cluttered with takeout coffees. They were co-writers on a Ronald Reagan documentary, but Mr. Bannon had pretty much taken it over. He had been at work for hours, he told her, writing feverishly about his political hero.\u201cA man with a vision,\u201d the trailer says. \u201cAn outsider, a radical with extreme views.\u201dThe Reagan presidency has been a recurring touchstone for Mr. Bannon since 1980, when as a 26-year-old Navy officer he talked his way into Mr. Reagan\u2019s election night celebration. It was at an early screening of \u201cIn the Face of Evil\u201d that he met fellow Reagan admirer Andrew Breitbart, the budding conservative media provocateur.Breitbart.com\u2019s scorn for Muslims, immigrants and black activists drew a fervent following on the alt-right, an extremist fringe of message boards and online magazines popular with white supremacists, and after Mr. Bannon took control of the website in 2012, he built a raucous coalition of the discontented.Mr. Bannon told a colleague in multiple conversations during the presidential campaign that he knew Mr. Trump was an \u201cimperfect vessel\u201d for the revolution he had in mind. But the upstart candidate and the media entrepreneur bonded anyway.Like Reagan, Mr. Trump addressed the people he called \u201cthe forgotten men and women of our country\u201d \u2014 the white working and middle class. He vowed to take on Islamic radicalism, as Reagan had faced off against communism. Echoing the sole-savior theme of \u201cIn the Face of Evil,\u201d Mr. Trump declared of the nation\u2019s predicament, \u201cOnly I can fix it.\u201dMs. Jones, for one, had no trouble seeing the parallels. \u201cTrump,\u201d she said, \u201cis Steve\u2019s Reagan.\u201dTo understand what to expect from the Trump administration means in part to fathom the driven, contradictory character of Mr. Bannon, whom the president-elect has named senior counselor and chief White House strategist. Rarely has there been so incendiary a figure at the side of a president-elect, thrilling Mr. Trump\u2019s more extreme supporters while unnerving ethnic and religious minorities and many other Americans.How did this son of Richmond, Va., who attended Harvard Business School, spent years at Goldman Sachs and became wealthy working at the intersection of entertainment and finance come to view the political and financial elites as his archenemy? Why does a man who calls himself a \u201chard-nosed capitalist\u201d rail against \u201cglobalists\u201d of \u201cthe party of Davos\u201d and attack the Republican establishment with special glee?As a filmmaker, Mr. Bannon, 63, has cited both the Nazi propagandist Leni Riefenstahl and the left-wing documentarian Michael Moore as models. In top physical shape as a young Navy officer, and for years wearing the banker\u2019s uniform of expensive suits, Mr. Bannon has in recent years sported flannel shirts and cargo pants. With a paunch and a sometimes scraggly beard, Mr. Bannon has a rugged look that Stephen Colbert described as \u201cRobert Redford dredged from a river.\u201dVociferous critics of his appointment, a diverse group that includes the conservative talk-show host Glenn Beck and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who challenged Mrs. Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, have variously called Mr. Bannon a racist, a sexist, an anti-Semite and an Islamophobe. Interviews with two dozen people who know him well, however, portray a man not easily labeled, capable of surprising both friends and enemies, with unshakable self-confidence and striking intensity. (Mr. Bannon turned down a request for an interview, saying he was too busy with the presidential transition.)\u201cNo one has called him nice,\u201d said Patrick McSweeney, a former chairman of the Virginia Republican Party and a Bannon admirer who has known his family for years. \u201cHe is the least politically correct person I know. His overriding concern is getting the mission accomplished.\u201dSome longtime associates said they had never heard him express bigoted views. \u201cIn the 14 years I\u2019ve known him, I\u2019ve never heard him utter a racist or anti-Semitic comment,\u201d said Peter Schweizer, a conservative author and the president of the Government Accountability Institute, where Mr. Bannon was a founder and the executive chairman.Mr. Bannon\u2019s backers note that several of Breitbart\u2019s top editors and managers are Jewish \u2014 as was Mr. Breitbart himself \u2014 and the site is staunchly pro-Israel. They also point out that Mr. Bannon\u2019s longtime assistant, Wendy Colbert, is African-American; so are Sonnie Johnson, a conservative writer he promoted on Breitbart, and a former Goldman colleague who has been a close friend for three decades and considers Mr. Bannon family, but who asked not to be named to avoid a flood of media attention.Mary Beth Meredith, Mr. Bannon\u2019s sister, said accusations of personal bigotry against him were \u201cabsolutely absurd.\u201d \u201cWe have interfaith marriages in our own family,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have interracial marriages \u2014 our family is a microcosm of the U.S.\u201dWhere some perceive racism and nativism, others see a different -ism: opportunism. Whatever may be in his heart, they say, Mr. Bannon was happy to draw a white nationalist following to Breitbart, while denying that was his intent.Ben Shapiro, a former Breitbart editor who has been sharply critical of Mr. Bannon, called him \u201ca manipulator\u201d who had \u201cmainstreamed\u201d far-right extremists for cynical political purposes.Ms. Jones, Mr. Bannon\u2019s former film collaborator, who describes herself as very liberal, said, \u201cSteve\u2019s not a racist.\u201dBut, she added, \u201che\u2019s using the alt-right \u2014 using them for power.\u201dRobin Mickle, a fellow Navy officer of Mr. Bannon\u2019s aboard the destroyer Paul F. Foster, remembers that he and some of his idealistic mates were struck by something Mr. Bannon told them in 1978.\u201cHe said he joined the Navy so it would look good on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 because he wanted to go into politics someday,\u201d said Mr. Mickle, a retired defense contractor.Another officer, Sonny Masso, who would stay in the Navy and eventually make admiral, recalls a devoted reader of The Wall Street Journal who picked stocks to buy through a San Diego broker and had an astonishing ability to retain information.He was fit, too. \u201cHe\u2019d run five miles at lunch and he had a 32-inch waist,\u201d Mr. Masso said. \u201cVery preppy when we were out of uniform \u2014 polo shirts with alligators on them, and penny loafers with no socks.\u201dMr. Bannon was the middle child of five in an Irish Catholic family from a leafy North Richmond neighborhood. His father, Martin, 95, to whom he remains very close, was a telephone lineman who had worked his way into middle management at the phone company.Steve was bit of a brawler as a boy, said his older brother Mike Bannon. \u201cHe was a fighter. He was a guy that believed what he believed.\u201d On occasion, Steve summoned Mike to the neighborhood pool for reinforcement. \u201cHe\u2019d get in little scrapes and come back and get me, and I\u2019d say, \u2018I wished it wasn\u2019t eight guys we were fighting. If it was two or three, I wouldn\u2019t mind.\u2019\u201dMike Bannon, eager to rebut charges of racism against his brother, said the boys took two buses to get to Benedictine, and their parents instructed them to give up their seats if a woman boarded: \u201cIt didn\u2019t make any difference if they were black or white or Indian or Jewish or anything else,\u201d he said.Their mother, Doris, who died many years ago, loved to tell them about sneaking Jewish friends into her neighborhood pool in Baltimore \u2014 past a sign that said \u201cNo Jews Allowed.\u201d She later worked on campaigns for Douglas Wilder, a Democrat who became the first African-American governor of Virginia.For Mike Bannon, his brother Steve is \u201ca son of the South\u201d who has never shifted his principles or his character. \u201cHe knew who he was in fourth grade and he\u2019s never changed much over the years,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s very comfortable in his own skin.\u201dAt Virginia Tech, Steve Bannon got his first taste of politics, winning the Student Government Association presidency in a 1975 race that grew quite heated after he challenged the status quo. An opponent, Gary Clisham, told the student newspaper that Mr. Bannon had \u201cimmense charisma\u201d but predicted that he would get nothing done.After graduation, Mr. Bannon joined the Navy, attended Officer Candidate School and served two deployments aboard the Foster, a destroyer that took him all over Asia and into the Persian Gulf. His basketball style \u2014 running the length of the court without passing \u2014 earned him a sarcastic nickname, Coast-to-Coast, said Mr. Masso, his shipmate. Still, he said, Mr. Bannon was popular with the sailors he led in the engineering department, nearly 50 men, the majority of them African-American, Hispanic or Asian.Though his family had Democratic roots, Mr. Bannon, like most of his fellow officers, was scornful of President Jimmy Carter and entranced by Ronald Reagan. At Mr. Masso\u2019s condo, while they watched the two candidates\u2019 debate on television in 1980, Mr. Bannon could hardly contain his excitement.\u201cHe was pacing my living room, and whenever there was a point-counterpoint, he\u2019d say, \u2018Yeah!\u2019 like we were watching a boxing match,\u201d Mr. Masso said. When Mr. Bannon heard later that the Reagan election night party was planned for a Los Angeles hotel, the Century Plaza, he worked the phones to try for tickets.When he got the brushoff, Mr. Masso said, Mr. Bannon said, \u201cHey, listen pal, we just got back from the Persian Gulf.\u201d Soon, he had Reagan aide Lyn Nofziger on the phone saying, \u201cThe governor would be honored to have you there.\u201d It was 4 a.m. when their group left the victory celebration to return to the ship, Mr. Masso said.Both men went on to take Pentagon jobs, and Mr. Bannon earned a master\u2019s degree in international relations at Georgetown at the same time. Mr. Masso thought his friend might try to get into politics, but he was accepted at Harvard Business School, and he left the Navy in 1983 to begin a new life.Friends at Harvard and later at Goldman Sachs were aware of Mr. Bannon\u2019s conservative views, but politics was rarely discussed. \u201cHe was in mergers and acquisitions, I was in corporate finance, and we were both working 100 hours a week,\u201d said Scot Vorse, who met Mr. Bannon on their first day at Harvard and joined Goldman at the same time.After less than four years, Mr. Bannon left Goldman to start his own firm, Bannon & Co., which Mr. Vorse soon joined. As head of a scrappy start-up going up against financial behemoths to get Hollywood deals, Mr. Bannon showed the fierce competitiveness that would later drive his politics.\u201cWe were the underdog,\u201d Mr. Vorse said. \u201cWe were competing for the business of the biggest entertainment companies in the world, and we did well.\u201d Mr. Vorse said Bannon & Co. represented the Saudi businessman Prince Alwaleed bin Talal; the Italian media tycoon and later the prime minister Silvio Berlusconi; Samsung; Westinghouse; and other big players.Mr. Vorse was the detail man, he said. Mr. Bannon \u201cwas the visionary, seeing things before anyone else. He was the rainmaker. He was a leader.\u201dEven as they became successful, Mr. Bannon was not a lavish spender. \u201cHe was driving an eight-year-old Celica convertible,\u201d he said.But in 1993, as part of the sale of Castle Rock Entertainment to Turner Broadcasting System, he acquired a share of the royalties from \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d a move that would prove extremely lucrative as the show became a cultural force.In 1998, Bannon & Co. was acquired by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, and Mr. Bannon ran a series of companies working at the intersection of entertainment and finance.\u201cVery intense, very passionate,\u201d said Trevor Drinkwater, who worked with him in film distribution from 2004 to 2010. \u201cI was impressed that while he was very right wing, he had a lot of liberal friends.\u201d He saw Mr. Bannon\u2019s dress evolve toward the casual, \u201cthe flannel shirt over the polo shirt.\u201dThrough films, Mr. Bannon was turning his attention back to politics. Tim Watkins, his co-director on the Reagan documentary, said Mr. Bannon worked from 7 a.m. to 2 a.m. \u201cI\u2019ve never known him to, say, go to a ballgame,\u201d he said. But Mr. Watkins found his collaborator\u2019s combativeness wearying.\u201cSteve thinks everything has to be a fight,\u201d he said. Once, an argument broke out when he told Mr. Bannon that the rough cut of the film, at two hours and 10 minutes, should be trimmed further. Angry, Mr. Bannon \u201cactually flipped over the table,\u201d Mr. Watkins said.At first, he recalled, before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, they intended to make a standard biopic. But the attacks \u201cchanged the film radically,\u201d Mr. Watkins said. Mr. Reagan\u2019s Cold War battles merged with the coda, which showed the hijacked airliners hitting the World Trade Center and people jumping to their deaths.\u201cSteve crafted a lot of the big ideas,\u201d Mr. Watkins said, notably that \u201clife is a battle of good and evil, and history repeats itself.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s Make America Great Again,\u201d they read.When his eldest child, Maureen, got into West Point, Mr. Bannon was thrilled and joked about switching his allegiance to Army from Navy. He never missed her volleyball games, and he was at Fort Campbell, Ky., in 2011 when she returned from a deployment to Iraq. \u201cThat was one of the greatest feelings I\u2019ve had, seeing my dad when I walked off the plane,\u201d she said.But through his daughter\u2019s service, he saw an inequity that fueled his anger at the privileged Americans among whom he had long worked.At West Point, \u201che saw a complete, utter lack of people from the upper economic levels of American society,\u201d said Mr. Schweizer, the conservative writer. \u201cHe thought it was appalling, especially because the elite set so many policies that sent these kids into war.\u201dMr. Bannon was put off by the George W. Bush administration\u2019s creation in 2003 of the Medicare prescription drug benefit, which he saw as a blatant giveaway to the pharmaceutical companies. The financial collapse of 2008 and the bailouts that followed infuriated him, including the devastating effect of the stock market collapse on the retirement accounts of men like his father, a phone company retiree.Mr. Bannon often spoke to friends about his father\u2019s \u201chonest work,\u201d contrasting it with the paper-pushing he had seen on Wall Street. \u201cWe consider ourselves middle class, and we think the middle class has been shafted,\u201d Mike Bannon said. \u201cBlack, Hispanic, white, everybody. The political class has given them happy talk but delivered nothing. I think that\u2019s what Steve\u2019s talking about.\u201d\u201cNot one criminal charge has ever been brought to any bank executive associated with the 2008 crisis,\u201d Mr. Bannon fumed. \u201cAnd in fact, it gets worse. No bonuses and none of their equity was taken.\u201dBut if his scathing economic analysis sometimes seemed to dabble in Marxism, on other subjects, including race and religion, he made no concessions to political sensitivities. After Mr. Bannon met Mr. Breitbart at the 2004 screening of \u201cIn the Face of Evil,\u201d the two men hit it off, bonding over their similar views and a common irreverent streak.Ms. Jones, the film colleague, said that in their years working together, Mr. Bannon occasionally talked about the genetic superiority of some people and once mused about the desirability of limiting the vote to property owners.\u201cI said, \u2018That would exclude a lot of African-Americans,\u2019\u201d Ms. Jones recalled. \u201cHe said, \u2018Maybe that\u2019s not such a bad thing.\u2019 I said, \u2018But what about Wendy?\u2019\u201d referring to Mr. Bannon\u2019s executive assistant. \u201cHe said, \u2018She\u2019s different. She\u2019s family.\u2019\u201dMr. Bannon\u2019s African-American friend from his Goldman years said that he had been at pains to defend him in recent years to mutual acquaintances put off first by Breitbart\u2019s reputation and now by Mr. Bannon\u2019s association with Mr. Trump. Most Christmas seasons over the past two decades, he said, Mr. Bannon was \u201cmy only token white guy,\u201d or one of two or three, invited to an annual dinner at a New York City club for nearly a score of African-American friends who work or worked in finance.\u201cNow I\u2019m getting a lot of, \u2018What happened to Steve?\u2019\u201d from concerned black acquaintances, the friend said. He said he hoped Mr. Bannon \u2014 and more important, Mr. Trump \u2014 would more forthrightly denounce the bigots who have cheered them on. Still, he said, he completely rejects the accusations against Mr. Bannon.\u201cHell, no, he\u2019s not a white nationalist,\u201d the friend said.Mr. Bannon took over as executive chairman of Breitbart News in 2012 after Mr. Breitbart died, playing a hands-on role in assigning, approving and sometimes dictating changes to articles, according to several former Breitbart employees. Staff members grew polarized for or against him. Most of them spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed a nondisclosure agreement.They describe a decentralized operation overseen by Mr. Bannon in two conference calls a day. Employees rarely had any idea where their peripatetic boss was because he seemed to be constantly moving between homes, offices or borrowed premises in Florida, Washington, New York and occasionally Los Angeles or London.Mr. Bannon\u2019s critics assert that he sometimes put his political preferences ahead of fairness or even of the facts, directing that stories be rewritten to his specifications and shrugging off protests that his changes might make them inaccurate. While Breitbart did not traffic in outright racial slurs, it specialized in inflammatory coverage of police shootings, immigration and Islam in ways intended to prick liberal pieties.Alex Marlow, the editor in chief of Breitbart, denied that Mr. Bannon ever deliberately permitted an inaccurate story to run on the site. \u201cBreitbart represents certain values, like conservatism, populism and nationalism, and Steve Bannon wanted our content to reflect that,\u201d Mr. Marlow said. He said the site has 45 million readers and should not be judged by \u201ca couple thousand people on Twitter\u201d who express offensive views.In 2011, as Mr. Trump pondered a 2012 presidential run, David Bossie, a conservative activist who headed Citizens United, took Mr. Bannon to Trump Tower in New York to meet him. \u201cThey definitely hit it off,\u201d said Mr. Bossie, who has collaborated with Mr. Bannon on a series of films.Mr. Trump and Mr. Bannon had in common a willingness to defy some small-government conservative notions \u2014 for instance, by pushing for a large, costly infrastructure plan to create jobs.Mr. Bannon was deeply impressed in 2014 when an insurgent Virginia Republican, David Brat, managed an unexpected primary race upset of Representative Eric Cantor, the House majority leader. \u201cHe began casting around for other unconventional candidates to support \u2014 people that were not a part of the establishment and would run populist campaigns,\u201d Mr. Schweizer said.As Mr. Bannon became a steadily more obvious supporter of Mr. Trump, some Breitbart editors and reporters thought he was turning a news site into a propaganda platform \u2014 though other staff members approved. Mr. Shapiro was the most outspoken critic, saying that Mr. Bannon had \u201cbetrayed\u201d Mr. Breitbart\u2019s mission of \u201cfighting the bullies.\u201dIf the criticism bothered Mr. Bannon, he did not show it. He was already deeply involved in advising Mr. Trump, and he believed, unlike most pollsters and pundits, that the chaotic, low-budget campaign had a chance.One warm evening in August, after Mr. Trump called on Mr. Bannon to take charge of the campaign, Mr. Caddell, the pollster, met with him at a New York hotel, sitting outside on a veranda.Mr. Bannon said he knew the campaign needed discipline, with Mr. Trump more consistently presenting himself as a populist outsider, Mr. Caddell recalled. \u201cHe said, \u2018Believe me, I\u2019m going to bring this home. I know what needs to be done, and I\u2019m going to do it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Caddell said.A list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.Whatever Reagan scholars like Mr. Cannon might say, Mr. Bossie, who also joined the Trump campaign, said that he and Mr. Bannon discussed Reagan parallels as they saw huge crowds waiting for hours to hear Mr. Trump. Mr. Reagan had run when many voters felt the country was threatened at home and abroad, Mr. Bossie said. \u201cYou can see the same things today with Donald Trump \u2014 that America has lost its way and it\u2019s lost its strength, and Americans are looking for leadership,\u201d he said.Kellyanne Conway, who took the job of campaign manager when Mr. Bannon became chief executive, would later call him \u201cthe general\u201d who made many critical decisions. He pushed for Mr. Trump to visit Flint, Mich., where the water supply was contaminated with lead, and to appear at a black church. Mr. Bannon also hugely accelerated the tempo of what he thought had been a 9-to-5 campaign.In the final weeks of the campaign, Mr. Bannon was sure the polls pointing to a Clinton victory were wrong, other campaign officials said. His family, including all four siblings and his 95-year-old father, made the trip to New York City for election night.For Mr. Bannon, the long night at the New York Hilton was his second presidential campaign victory gathering, coming 36 years after the first. At 4:30 a.m., Mr. Vorse, his former colleague, reached him to offer congratulations. He was reminded of their Hollywood days, when \u201cwe would have victories and Steve would celebrate for two seconds, and then it was on to the next thing.\u201d\u201cHe said, \u2018I got to go because we have a meeting in three hours. I got to hop.\u2019\u201dAn article on Monday\u2019s front page about Stephen K. Bannon, the chief strategist for President-elect Donald J. Trump, misidentified the type of ship on which Mr. Bannon served. The ship Paul F. Foster was a destroyer, not a guided-missile destroyer.Sharon LaFraniere, Jo Becker and Jacqueline Williams contributed reporting.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Trump Save Their Jobs? They\u2019re Counting on It", "Date": "2016-11-12", "News": "Supported byINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 By the time the Chicago Cubs won the World Series for the first time in 108 years this month, Paul Roell was already asleep. He did not stay up to see Barack Obama win the presidency in 2008, or watch in 2000 as the margin of votes separating George W. Bush and Al Gore in Florida shrank to the vanishing point.After all, he has to clock in daily at 5:30 a.m. at the soon-to-be-shuttered Carrier factory here, where he has worked 17 years.But shortly before 3 a.m. Wednesday, when the networks projected that Donald J. Trump would be the next president of the United States, Mr. Roell was wide awake. His wife, Stephanie, was up, too, and they exchanged high fives in the wee hours.In fact, Mr. Roell was so keyed up, he did not sleep at all that night and headed straight to the plant before sunrise, bleary-eyed but euphoric. \u201cI don\u2019t watch sports, but this was my World Series,\u201d he said.It is precisely this level of enthusiasm, from Mr. Roell and millions of like-minded Americans, that pollsters and the campaign of Hillary Clinton did not appreciate, even though it was vividly on display in February after a video went viral showing furious Carrier workers here learning from management that their jobs would be going abroad.Carrier\u2019s decision to move the factory to Monterrey, Mexico, will eliminate 1,400 jobs by 2019. Mr. Trump quickly made the factory Exhibit A in his argument against the trade policies of Republicans and Democrats alike.He cited Carrier again and again on the campaign trail, threatening to phone executives at the company and its parent, United Technologies, and to hit them with 35 percent tariffs on any furnaces and air-conditioners they imported from Mexico. To the cheers of his supporters, he predicted at rallies that Carrier would call him up as president and say, \u201cSir, we\u2019ve decided to stay in the United States.\u201dNow his supporters expect action. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t pass that tariff, I will vote the other way next time,\u201d warned Nicole Hargrove, who has worked at Carrier for a decade and a half and is not certain what she will do if and when her job goes to Mexico.Carrier isn\u2019t changing its plans. On Friday in a written statement, the company said, \u201cWe are making every effort to ease the transition for our Carrier colleagues in Indiana.\u201d The company pointed out that it will finance four-year retraining and educational programs for employees and provide financial help.For Mr. Trump, now comes the hard part. In interviews in recent days and in March, Trump voters here made clear that if he does not follow through on his promises, they are prepared to turn on him, just as they are seemingly punishing Democrats today for not delivering the hope and change voters sought from President Obama after he won as an outsider in 2008.And while Mr. Roell is a conservative, Mr. Trump\u2019s tough talk about Carrier, the economy and the future of American manufacturing jobs also appealed to moderates like Darrell Presley, a steelworker in rural Crawfordsville, Ind., who voted for Mr. Obama in 2008. \u201cHe was for change, and said he would take care of the middle class, but he didn\u2019t live up to those expectations,\u201d Mr. Presley said. \u201cI feel like the American people are at the point where they\u2019ve had it, and this was the last chance.\u201dLast Tuesday, blue-collar workers across the industrial heartland hearkened to Mr. Trump\u2019s call, putting states never thought to be in serious play, like Wisconsin and Michigan, in his win column.As president, however, Mr. Trump will face a tough balance. Tariffs and trade wars stand to hurt American workers who make products that are exported to Mexico or China. Few voters will be happy paying more for imported goods.And regardless of who is in the Oval Office, manufacturers are seeing relentless pressure, from investors and rival companies, to automate, replacing workers with machines that do not break down or require health benefits and pension plans. Wall Street hedge fund managers are demanding steadily rising earnings from Carrier\u2019s parent, United Technologies, even as growth remains sluggish worldwide.The Carrier plant here is plenty profitable. But moving to Monterrey, where workers earn in a day what they make here in an hour, will increase profits faster.Mr. Roell, who earns about $55,000 a year with overtime as a team leader making furnaces, has few illusions about the gulf separating him from Mr. Trump, or the global headwinds that American factory workers face. \u201cHis father was a millionaire, he\u2019s a billionaire,\u201d Mr. Roell said, sitting at Sully\u2019s Bar & Grill on Thursday night opposite the factory with fellow Carrier workers. \u201cHis son Barron\u2019s allowance is probably more than my salary.\u201dNor does he underestimate the profound economic threat to the 1,400 workers at the factory, where layoffs are expected to begin next summer and continue in waves until it closes in 2019. Mr. Roell was promoted to team leader in March.The mood in the factory has worsened since. Senior engineers travel from Indianapolis to Monterrey to supervise the shifting of production lines to Carrier\u2019s factory there, workers and union officials said. Mexican engineers, in turn, have been coming here, measuring and assessing the machines they will operate south of the border, unless, of course, Mr. Trump can deliver on his promise.\u201cIt\u2019s demoralizing when you see them taking pictures,\u201d Mr. Roell said. \u201cIt\u2019s like you are getting divorced but you are still living with your wife and her new boyfriend is coming over.\u201dFor workers like Mr. Roell, 36, who started at Carrier just weeks after receiving his high school diploma and never returned to school, the problem is not a shortage of jobs in the area. Instead, it is a drought of jobs that pay anywhere near the $23.83 an hour he makes at Carrier, let alone enough to give him a toehold in the middle class.When he drives to work each day before dawn, Mr. Roell passes warehouse after warehouse of giants like Walmart and Kohl\u2019s with \u201cHelp Wanted\u201d signs outside promising jobs within. The problem is that they typically pay $13 to $15 an hour.\u201cI guess I could work two full-time shifts a day,\u201d he joked.The situation confronting Mr. Roell and other blue-collar Carrier workers is not simply one anecdote from the region some people call the Rust Belt. It is part of a broad predicament for non-college-educated workers borne out by Census Bureau data. And it explains why even in Indiana, a state with a lower rate of unemployment than the national average, and a strong rebound from the recession in many ways, the economic and political frustration is palpable.Since 2010, the private sector in Indiana has added roughly 300,000 jobs, bringing the unemployment rate from a high of 10.9 percent in January 2010 (nearly a percentage point above the national average) to 4.5 percent now (nearly half a percentage point below the national unemployment rate).But nearly all that growth occurred in the service sector \u2014 hotel and food-service jobs, or health care technicians, or workers in the warehouses Mr. Roell drives past \u2014 which added more than 220,000 positions for a total of 1.9 million today. While manufacturers added 85,569 jobs since the sector bottomed out at 434,919 in January 2010, factory employment in Indiana over all remains significantly below where it was before the Great Recession.And service jobs do not come close to paying what manufacturing jobs do. According to the Census Bureau, the typical service sector position in Indiana paid $39,338 in 2015, compared with $59,029 for a manufacturing position.The cross-generational drop-off can be stark, and it scars families. Within Local 1999 of the United Steelworkers union, which includes workers at Carrier and other local industrial employers, members typically start at $17 an hour, according to Chuck Jones, Local 1999\u2019s president. For comparison, his 21-year-old granddaughter Haley Duncan is about to finish college and take a job in health care that pays $14.50 an hour.Ms. Duncan and her older brother, Drake, were tempted by factory work. But Mr. Jones and their parents told them to forget it and stay in school because, while manufacturing might pay more, its future is becoming more precarious. The Rexnord bearing factory here \u2014 where Mr. Jones started working fresh out of high school in 1969 and where his stepson works now \u2014 last month said it might follow Carrier to Mexico and eliminate at least 300 jobs.Can Mr. Trump, with his promises to bring these jobs back and his calls to retaliate against chief executives if they do not listen, stem the tide?Broader economic trends suggest Mr. Trump will face an uphill struggle even if he does follow through on his threat to pressure Carrier\u2019s executives or hit the company with steep tariffs. What is more, while the bully pulpit of the president is something corporate chieftains fear, Rexnord\u2019s plan to pull up stakes even after the Carrier situation suggests businesses will not bow to the threat of bad P.R.And even if Congress and the White House agree on a plan to increase manufacturing, tax credits for research and new investments, for example, or financing apprenticeships as European countries do, automation will continue to claim jobs.\u201cI\u2019m pretty skeptical Trump\u2019s policies will reverse this process,\u201d said John Van Reenen, a professor of economics at M.I.T. who studies how technology and innovation affect profits and wages at companies. \u201cThese are fundamental forces that have more to do with technology than trade.\u201dIn particular, he said, across developed economies more national income is going to capital, that is, owners and shareholders, rather than labor. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this in many countries with different political systems,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a winner-take-all world.\u201dEven Robin Maynard, a Carrier team leader who enthusiastically backed Mr. Trump, acknowledges that even a phone call from the Oval Office to the company\u2019s executive suite might not be enough to save his job. \u201cHopefully, he can do something for us,\u201d Mr. Maynard said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s out of the C.E.O\u2019s hands. It\u2019s in the hands of the shareholders.\u201dIn this age of 401(k) investment plans and individual retirement accounts, these shareholders are, in a real sense, all of us. But for the Carrier workers in Indianapolis and millions of other blue-collar workers, no matter how they voted, nuances like that do not matter so much now. Just the hope that Mr. Trump will try to reverse the long decline in their neighborhoods, their living standards and even their longevity is an emotional balm.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like blacks. He doesn\u2019t like Hispanics. He doesn\u2019t like disabled people,\u201d said Jennifer Shanklin-Hawkins, who, like roughly half the Carrier factory workers, is African-American. \u201cHe\u2019s not presidential material. But my husband and I weren\u2019t mad or upset when he won. I know blacks who voted for him, and I want to give him a chance.\u201dSome blue-collar neighborhoods that supported Mr. Trump have been portrayed as monocultures, the opposite of supposedly more diverse, cosmopolitan cities that favored Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic candidate. That caricature does not hold up here.At least half of the workers on Carrier\u2019s assembly line are women. And dozens of Burmese immigrants have gone to work at the factory in recent years, part of an influx of nearly 15,000 refugees from Myanmar into Indianapolis since 2001.\u201cIt can be hard to communicate, but they work very hard,\u201d Mr. Maynard said. \u201cThey don\u2019t complain, and I love their work ethic.\u201dAnd the neighborhoods around Carrier\u2019s factory are considerably more diverse than many wealthy New York and San Francisco suburbs, where Democrats dominate.Down the road from the Carrier factory, past the railroad tracks and a few patches of farmland that remain in Indianapolis, the tidy neighborhood of split-level and ranch houses where Cecil Link Jr. lives has changed in recent years. A worker at a plastics factory nearby, Mr. Link noted that a Hispanic family recently moved in next door, and he said he was pleased that blacks and whites now socialize in ways almost unimaginable decades ago.\u201cIt pains me to see this country divided by race,\u201d Mr. Link said. Nevertheless, he voted for Mr. Trump.The last time he voted in a presidential election was 1992, when he cast his ballot for Bill Clinton. But this time, he said, he registered explicitly to vote for Mr. Trump. \u201cI was tired of corruption and lies in Washington,\u201d he said. \u201cI just wanted a nonpolitician like Trump.\u201dMr. Presley, the 59-year-old white Crawfordsville steelworker who voted for Mr. Obama in 2008 and Mr. Trump in 2016, was even more emphatic that racial resentment or ethnic bigotry was not behind his support for Mr. Trump. \u201cI grew up on the West Side of Indianapolis in a racist environment,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I went to a high school that was 57 percent black, and I played football with a lot of black guys and we became close friends. I learned not to be racist.\u201dInstead of bias, what animates these voters, whatever their race or political orientation, is a profound distrust and resentment of wealthier, educated Americans, a group they say lacks a connection to them and does not care about their economic situation. And to them, Mrs. Clinton seemed at least as elite as Mr. Trump, if not more so.\u201cI just couldn\u2019t bring myself to vote for him, but both candidates are evil,\u201d said Ms. Shanklin-Hawkins, who reluctantly voted for Mrs. Clinton, but has never forgiven her for her remarks about \u201csuperpredators\u201d in the 1990s, or the mandatory prison sentencing guidelines Mr. Clinton signed into law as president.\u201cHillary hasn\u2019t sweated a day in her life, unless it was losing a tough case as a lawyer,\u201d Mr. Maynard said. \u201cWe wanted to take America in a different direction. I\u2019m just hoping Trump will do what he says.\u201dCan the Democratic Party recapture these voters if Mr. Trump does not deliver? Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, among the most liberal Democrats in the Senate, contends it can, if Democrats follow his lead in appealing to working-class concerns and opposing free trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement and the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, a pact with Asian nations that President Obama supported.Of course these, too, are Mr. Trump\u2019s positions.Mr. Presley readily acknowledges that Mr. Trump is a billionaire with an Ivy League education.\u201cBut he gets that the country is in bad shape.\u201d Mr. Presley said. \u201cSure, he made some mistakes and sometimes he went a little overboard, but the guys I work with related to it. If we spoke in public, we\u2019d make mistakes too.\u201dTo them, it\u2019s not only the country that\u2019s in bad shape. So are the institutions that once provided structure to working-class life in America. Many Carrier workers are regular churchgoers, but Ms. Hargrove said she was deeply troubled by how priests abused children, or how the police shot suspects even though their arms were raised in the air.\u201cThings are chaotic,\u201d she said.The distrust is evident even within the Steelworkers union, another institution that once provided a support system for workers. Mr. Roell is leery of area leaders like Mr. Jones of Local 1999, who had battles of his own with the union\u2019s top officials over their support for Mrs. Clinton.A fierce supporter of Bernie Sanders, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s rival for the Democratic nomination, Mr. Jones and Local 1999 did not make an endorsement in the general election. \u201cI held my nose and voted for her,\u201d he said between drags on a Marlboro at the local\u2019s union hall. \u201cI didn\u2019t trust her a bit. I told people she would flip on trade deals after she was elected.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m as left-wing as you can find, and I thought Trump was full of it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut everybody is tired of the same old politicians. It could have been Captain Kangaroo and he might have won.\u201dAs for the candidate who did win, Mr. Trump, the union leader said he was waiting for him to make that phone call to Carrier. \u201cHe\u2019s got time. He doesn\u2019t take the oath of office until Jan. 20,\u201d Mr. Jones said. \u201cTrump made Carrier the poster child and said he would hold Carrier accountable. Well, we\u2019re going to hold him to it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Privileged Immigrant", "Date": "2016-11-26", "News": "Supported byOpinionBecause it\u2019s what I knew. Or thought I knew. On long car rides, against the drone of NPR, my parents told me stories of their pasts, and of pasts that reached further back than their own, of stingy uncles and Kerala riverboats and letters written from sanitariums.They told me so many stories, so many times, that the facts of their lives became the facts of mine: mine to pick at my convenience, mine to trample with invention.From somewhere in this field of fact and fiction, I\u2019d plucked the story of my mom and dad, newly married, arriving at Kennedy Airport with only $12 in cash between them.\u201cWe had $16,\u201d my mom said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the Indian government let us take out.\u201d In 1965, $16 was worth about $120 now \u2014 not a huge sum, but more than paupers\u2019 crumbs. Also, my dad had a friend with a car waiting at the airport. And a furnished apartment. And a job as a medical intern at an Albany hospital.Now my parents live in the Berkeley hills with an edge-of-the-world view of the San Francisco Bay. They have a timeshare in Lake Tahoe. My mom ran a pediatrics practice, my dad a urology practice. They raised three children. Hard work, economy, wise investment, humility: the values of the great immigrant equation.In the wake of the election of Donald J. Trump, as I read about an increase in abuse against immigrants and the appointment of Stephen K. Bannon, formerly of the anti-immigrant Breitbart News, as a senior adviser, I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about my family\u2019s immigrant story. There\u2019s something luxuriant in my mishandling of the facts. It speaks to the security of knowing that yes, my parents came to this country with very little, but the details don\u2019t matter, not when they\u2019ve come so far.Indian immigrants have done well for themselves, but their success doesn\u2019t spring from some inherent well of virtue. Nor should it be used as a cudgel against other immigrant groups. We didn\u2019t succeed because we\u2019re better, we succeeded because we had a path.\u201cThey took my gardener!\u201d My neighbor waved me down one morning a few months ago. \u201cMy gardener hasn\u2019t shown up for three weeks,\u201d she panted. \u201cHe was so dependable! They\u2019ve probably sent him away, you know? Picked him up? But what can you do?\u201dShe gazed at my sidewalk planter, ripe now with succulents. \u201cBut who\u2019s your little man? The one who does your yard?\u201dOur little man? My neighbor was talking about Mario, the man who created our garden after I myself had installed a collection of expensive plants and, through assiduous research and care, killed them.Mario planted a new m\u00e9lange. He also painted our rooms, laid carpet, built a storage shed and fixed most everything we found ourselves breaking. But he hadn\u2019t been to our home in over two years. He\u2019d gotten a job at a warehouse \u2014 better work than the day-labor circuit.Mario told me that it took him two tries to cross the border. The first time, he was caught and forced to turn back. The second time, he was kidnapped by smugglers and held in a hotel room for ransom until someone could pay his way out.Then he managed to secure a ride through the border. He traveled in the trunk, folded like an ironing board against two other people, one of whom, Mario once told us with a laugh loosened by time, had recently stepped in dog excrement.The last time Mario worked for us, he painted our breakfast room. I\u2019d chosen a color called limesicle for the walls, minced onion for the trim. An ominous combination.I asked Mario how his daughters were \u2014 one was in high school back in Mexico, the other in college. He hadn\u2019t seen them in person in 10 years.My parents went through similar droughts of contact with their families. In the days before Skype or FaceTime, when people interfaced by faded blue aerogramme, they went for years seeing nobody they loved, except for each other and their children.As of 1960, five years before my parents arrived, there were only about 12,000 Indian immigrants in the United States. Lifelong friendships formed in grocery stores. \u201cMy dad looked through the entire phone book and called every person with an Indian name,\u201d a friend once told me.Recently, I asked my dad about his first years here. He was part of the first wave of foreign medical graduates \u2014 F.M.G.s \u2014 recruited to serve America\u2019s growing hospital network. Between 1965 and 1974, a total of 75,000 foreign physicians would migrate to the States.\u201cSo, um, did you face any discrimination when you started your training? In the hospital?\u201dHe shrugged. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cthere was the system.\u201d\u201cThe system?\u201d\u201cThe system in the hospital. The hours we worked, the jobs they gave us. It discriminated against foreign medical graduates. Is that what you mean?\u201dFrankly, no. I\u2019d imagined gangs of tall white surgeons, cool and cruel in their green scrubs, elbowing past my short brown dad. \u201cSo there was nothing \u2026 personal?\u201d\u201cPersonal? We didn\u2019t have time for personal.\u201dForeign medical graduates spent grueling hours doing the scut work of hospitals. But they had this: the legal right to live and work in the United States.When people talk about Indians in America, they talk about success. How, they muse, has a relatively new immigrant group managed to find its way to the final rounds of spelling bees, to the Ivy League, to Silicon Valley, where 16 percent of start-ups are co-founded by Indians?From this vantage point, the impulse among Indian immigrants and their children, when faced with the plight of the undocumented, underpaid and downtrodden, is to shake our heads and sigh. Poor them, lucky us. The well intentioned call this empathy.Here\u2019s the problem with empathy: It lets us feel good about ourselves. Empathy allows me to shut out a founding truth of success. My American life is held aloft by Mario\u2019s American life, by the lives and labor of workers who process poultry for my aunt\u2019s fiery curries and pick strawberries for my summer salads; by domestic workers who watch our children, who keep our neighborhoods beautiful and our property values high. My immigrant family\u2019s comfort is built, in part, on the hard work of other immigrants.Not all Indians are documented tech workers and doctors. Not all Mexicans are undocumented laborers. This isn\u2019t about Indians and Mexicans, but about the documented and undocumented, and the gulf of privilege that lies between them. This privilege builds on itself, from visa application to employment to finance to homeownership to education to the next generation.Once, during his first year of training, my dad fainted from exhaustion. When he came to, he still had a job, he still had a visa.Eventually he moved on to a residency, a fellowship, his own practice. The journey was backbreaking, but he could take each step knowing that the earth beneath him would not fall away.The last time I saw Mario, he was walking down busy Shattuck Avenue. I pulled over and asked if he needed a ride. \u201cNo, thank you,\u201d he called back and waved and went on walking, each step an act of faith.Shanthi Sekaran teaches creative writing at California College of the Arts and is the author of the forthcoming novel \u201cLucky Boy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Determining a Punishment That Fits the Crime", "Date": "2016-11-07", "News": "Supported byWhite Collar WatchOne of the vexing issues in white-collar crime is figuring out the appropriate sentence for someone who usually has an otherwise spotless record and poses no physical threat to the community. Recent cases show how hard it is to determine a just punishment for defendants who have so much going for them yet engaged in criminal conduct.Then he threw it all away by bilking family and friends out of more than $38 million \u2014 and was seeking more when he was arrested in March \u2014 to finance wildly speculative options trades that ultimately failed. At the sentencing hearing, Mr. Caspersen\u2019s lawyer portrayed the fraud as the product of a gambling addiction that drove his client to keep betting more and more on the market until he was broke.Unlike those who commit street crimes, white-collar offenders are much more likely to be members of the middle class, and possibly even among the economic elite like Mr. Caspersen. They have the resources to present a sympathetic picture of their life while claiming that violations of the law were just aberrations from an otherwise exemplary life.These offenders can often serve up a variety of reasons to explain, and perhaps diminish, their violations. Thus, Mr. Caspersen claimed that his gambling addiction fueled the trading that led to the fraud, not ordinary greed that would make it palatable to impose a harsher sentence.Federal judges are not bound to follow the guidelines, and often vary from them, especially in white-collar cases in which defendants can present a number of reasons they are not the typical offender who should receive a prison term.The issue is what excuses are appropriate for a judge to consider in determining the right punishment for the crime. Figuring out the appropriate sentence requires consideration of multiple competing interests, not the least of which is the message sent to the general public about how this type of criminal should be treated.In Mr. Caspersen\u2019s case, Judge Rakoff agreed that he was afflicted with an addiction to gambling, but said it was just one factor in the sentence because \u201cit was a fraud that involved the deception of people who had a lot of faith in the defendant.\u201d By giving a four-year prison term, the judge took a position somewhere in between what the government wanted and the defense was hoping for \u2014 a common occurrence.A sentencing scheduled for Wednesday before Judge Rakoff will present another issue that arises frequently in white-collar sentencing: How much should the loss of prestige and income by the white-collar offender be a factor in mitigating a sentence?Paul Thompson pleaded guilty to helping manipulate the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, while he was a trader at Rabobank, working with other defendants to push the rate to help the bank\u2019s positions.In a memorandum submitted to Judge Rakoff, his lawyer pointed to the impact of his conviction, that he \u201chas lost his job, his career, his reputation, and, despite decades of sacrifice and hard work, he is unlikely to work in his chosen profession ever again.\u201d In asking for probation, the lawyer argued that manipulating Libor submissions \u201cwas widespread, condoned and well-known throughout the industry,\u201d so that the punishment he \u201chas already suffered has been harsh.\u201dThe Justice Department appears torn by what is an appropriate sentence in a case like this in which the financial harm is difficult to measure. It recommended that he receive at least a year in prison, yet told Judge Rakoff that \u201cbeyond his participation in the scheme at hand, however, all available evidence suggests that Mr. Thompson is fundamentally a decent person.\u201d Should that kind of person be required to spend time in a federal prison?Convictions always have an impact on both defendants and their families, whether it be a white-collar case or a street crime. Judges are fearful of imposing a light sentence on those who look more like them because it would foster the perception that offenders with greater wealth and social standing can expect better treatment in the criminal justice system. So the argument that a defendant has already paid a price for a violation rarely gains much traction.What judges really want to hear is an expression of contrition, word that the defendant is sorry for any harm caused while promising never to engage in such misconduct again. For those who plead guilty, like Mr. Caspersen and Mr. Thompson, the acknowledgment of guilt puts them in a much better position with the court because they can avoid the perception of trying to get away with something or planning the next crime.Under the sentencing guidelines, the two defendants could easily face a recommended prison term of more than four years for the corruption charges. Prosecutors may ask the court to find they committed perjury by testifying that they were unaware of any scheme to engage in misconduct on behalf of the governor, which could push the potential punishment even higher.They have suffered the same loss of their career and social status as Mr. Caspersen and Mr. Thompson, but by going to trial, any claim they might make that they have \u201csuffered enough already\u201d is likely to fall on deaf ears.Sentencing is certainly an art, not a science, despite the attempt at precision in the loss calculations in the sentencing guidelines. Judges are left with making a decision based on what they see in the defendant in front of them, in the hope that the punishment will be perceived as fair. Like it or not, that is the system we have, even if it leaves the public unsatisfied with a penalty that can be considered too lenient \u2014 or too harsh.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hong Kong Elected 2 Separatists. China Took Drastic Action.", "Date": "2016-11-06", "News": "Supported byIn acting against them, the government of President Xi Jinping has asserted new authority to set policy in Hong Kong, opening what could be a more chaotic era here, in which elected officials are held to a vague standard of political loyalty and blacklisted if they fall short.The Communist Party\u2019s intervention in Hong Kong\u2019s independent legal system could also damage the territory\u2019s reputation as an international trade and finance hub in Asia. Many multinational corporations, banks and law firms are based here because of the dependability and fairness of the city\u2019s courts.Businesses also find Hong Kong appealing because of its political stability, but thousands of people demonstrated and clashed with the police on Sunday night in anticipation of Beijing\u2019s action, which could incite more street protests.Monday\u2019s ruling breaks new ground because it is the first time that Beijing has acted in a pending court case without a request by the Hong Kong government or judiciary, and because it appears to establish a mechanism for the authorities to block critics of Communist rule from taking elected office or even getting their names on ballots.The decision also says lawmakers will be held liable if they violate their oaths, but it provides no guidance on who has the power to determine whether a lawmaker is in breach or what the punishment should be. The fear is that this will inject a degree of arbitrariness into a system that is based on rules underpinned by centuries of precedent under British common law.\u201cWhether it would affect my seat is secondary,\u201d Nathan Law, 23, a new member of the Legislative Council who advocates greater self-determination for Hong Kong, said of the ruling by Beijing. \u201cWhat\u2019s most important is that the interpretation is vesting so much power in a person to decide whether someone is sincere and allegiant enough to take office, and there is no checks-and-balance against that person.\u201dThe Basic Law says little about oaths, only that officials must swear allegiance \u201cin accordance with law\u201d to the \u201cHong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\u201dThe Chinese government condemned the pair and labeled them threats to national security for their advocacy of independence, and officials in Beijing left little doubt in announcing Monday\u2019s decision that it was intended to keep them out of office.Li Fei, the chairman of China\u2019s parliamentary committee on the Basic Law, compared Mr. Leung and Ms. Yau, and their supporters, to traitors espousing a \u201cfascist\u201d line. \u201cThere is a great patriotic tradition in the Chinese nation,\u201d he said. \u201cAll traitors and those who sell out their countries will come to no good end.\u201dHe added that the government\u2019s stance \u201cwill not be ambiguous or lenient.\u201dThe United States, on the eve of its own presidential election, urged China not to undermine the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula that has protected basic civil liberties in Hong Kong.The United States believes \u201can open society with the highest possible degree of autonomy and governed by the rule of law is essential for Hong Kong\u2019s continued stability and prosperity as a special administrative region of the People\u2019s Republic of China,\u201d the State Department spokesman, Mark C. Toner, said on Monday.Hong Kong\u2019s politicians reacted along predictable lines, with the pro-Beijing establishment endorsing the decision and the pro-democracy opposition criticizing it as an infringement on self-rule in the territory. The unpopular chief executive, Leung Chun-ying, vowed to fully enforce the decision, saying, \u201cThis is about the country\u2019s unity and sovereignty.\u201dMichael Tien, a pro-Beijing lawmaker in Hong Kong who endorsed the ruling, said it could be used to screen future candidates running for office and to challenge those who have already taken seats in the 70-member Legislative Council, including several opposition lawmakers who have made statements in favor of self-determination or independence for Hong Kong.\u201cThis thing is expansive,\u201d Mr. Tien said in a telephone interview, adding that Beijing\u2019s allies in Hong Kong could ask courts to rule on whether these lawmakers were sincere in swearing allegiance or had violated their oaths.Such a process is likely to be contentious, said Simon Young, a legal scholar at the University of Hong Kong, because the language of Beijing\u2019s decision is short on specifics. It says nothing about whether advocating self-determination or independence violates an officeholder\u2019s oath, for example, or how to handle candidates who change their position on the issue.As a result, politicians such as Mr. Leung and Ms. Yau could seek to win back their seats by renouncing support for independence and going back to court. And that could lead Beijing to intervene further and issue new decisions to stamp out people it wants to disqualify.\u201cThis will possibly be the first of a possible series of interpretations,\u201d Mr. Young said. In the meantime, he added, \u201cthe courts in Hong Kong will have to interpret the interpretation.\u201dBut by intervening in the legal case over Mr. Leung and Ms. Yau, Mr. Xi has drawn more attention to their cause, and he risks provoking a backlash that could strengthen it. In a scene that resembled the 2014 demonstrations, the police used pepper spray early Monday to battle crowds of protesters who had gathered around the Chinese government\u2019s liaison office in Hong Kong, some of whom were shouting, \u201cHong Kong independence.\u201dAlan Wong contributed reporting from Hong Kong.

The first is that buying SolarCity would help Elon Musk turn Tesla into a green energy company whose products would run from solar panels to electric cars.I.S.S.\u2019s second rationale is that the estimated $150 million in cost savings that would arise from a merger of the two could eventually yield $1.5 billion when capitalized, taking care of two-thirds of the purchase price.The last is a starker calculation of dollars and cents: Tesla would be buying SolarCity at a cheap price.Tesla has offered to pay 0.11 of a newly issued share in itself for each share of SolarCity, a bid valued at $20.99 as of Friday afternoon. That is lower than where SolarCity was trading this summer when Mr. Musk announced his deal intentions.Mr. Musk has said that putting the two together is a \u201cno-brainer\u201d from a strategic standpoint. But critics have argued that the deal amounts to a bailout of SolarCity, whose fortunes and stock price have declined as the company has run up $3.1 billion in debt to support its business. Investors have also become pessimistic about the fate of independent solar companies. Competitors like SunEdison have filed for bankruptcy.I.S.S. said Tesla, as a $30 billion company with no debt, should be able to support its corporate sibling, though at a potentially high financing cost.The backing of I.S.S. could prove important to swaying Tesla shareholders, because the firm\u2019s recommendations carry great weight among the big mutual funds that make up the electric carmaker\u2019s independent shareholders.It has always been assumed that SolarCity shareholders would back the deal, especially because advisers to the solar company\u2019s independent directors tried and failed to solicit serious competing bids.Shares of SolarCity rose 8.8 percent on Friday to close at $20.18. Shares of Tesla rose 1.7 percent to close at $190.56.Advertisement"}

Necessary business-model experimentation, however, works best away from the public markets.The primary reason for the merger\u2019s collapse is instructive. Banks pulled their financing commitments after Gannett turned in weaker results than expected. Investors, too, see little promise in these embattled newspaper empires. Media companies like Gannett, Tronc, The New York Times Company, News Corporation and Lee Enterprises all trade at less than seven times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda.There\u2019s little in the way of good news. Magna, a research firm, forecasts that newspaper advertising revenue in the United States will fall 11 percent from a year ago, to about $13 billion. That\u2019s 20 percent of the sum generated back before internet companies like Craigslist and Alphabet\u2019s Google started devouring market share.Getting readers to buy online subscriptions is helping, but not enough. The Wall Street Journal, one of the strongest in digital publishing, is offering a fresh round of newsroom buyouts and considering closing sections of the paper after falling behind budget by 30 percent, according to a report in Politico.Success will require even more radical ideas. That could mean embracing some combination of what Buzzfeed and Business Insider have made work so far: combining populist headlines, slide shows, video clips, aggregated news stories and serious-minded original journalism.Since acquiring The Washington Post three years ago for $250 million and pulling its finances out of the public eye, Jeffrey P. Bezos, the founder of Amazon, has done something similar in a bid to expand paying readership across the world. Many American newspapers would benefit from a steward willing to sacrifice short-term profit for a longer-term vision.That would herald a return to a bygone era where families like the Chandlers and Bancrofts owned America\u2019s periodicals. It might invite the sort of unseemly situation occurring with the casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, who bought The Las Vegas Review-Journal.At this point, however, it\u2019s a chance that many ailing publications probably need to take.Advertisement"}

But in the economic swoon today, getting by as an investor, says one wealthy Russian in the capital, means thinking small.\u201cIn the past two years, Russia has changed quite a bit,\u201d said Aleksei A. Kozlov, a partner in a private equity firm. \u201cBefore we invested in simple things like stocks and large company debt, but we changed strategy because the risk just wasn\u2019t justified.\u201d\u201cThe business climate is extraordinarily murky, and the judicial system is poor,\u201d Mr. Kozlov said. But opportunity exists in untapped potential in the creative and educated population, particularly in Moscow.\u201cWe invest in medium businesses that would be very difficult to take away from the owners, and that are in demand,\u201d he said. A favorite category is private medical clinics, which are booming given cuts to state medical services. Because the doctor talent pool is the heart of the company, it cannot easily be seized, reducing risk.Mining for minds, and not for minerals, has been paying off, Mr. Kozlov said. Despite Russia\u2019s woes, a space exists for private investors.Mr. Kozlov\u2019s private equity firm typically steps in to replace bank loans, taking from 25 percent to 49 percent of shares in a closed stock company in exchange.\u201cA lot of companies have defaulted because of the currency drop, the sanctions or counter-sanctions,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the businessmen are good at what they do, but they are weak in financing,\u201d which is where he sees his firm\u2019s role. The firm, which has about $25 million invested in small and medium-size businesses, rarely puts more than $1 million into any one company.\u201cWe don\u2019t have companies with a lot of capital \u2014 land, machines, tools, or anything else,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is all risk, all hard to sell.\u201dMr. Kozlov, 42, is married to a prominent political activist, Olga Romanova. Like many businessmen, he failed once spectacularly, before bouncing back \u2014 with a Russian twist.\u201cI had a corporate dispute with my partner, who was a member of the Senate,\u201d and well-connected with prosecutors, he explained. At issue was ownership of a factory outside Moscow that was making artificial leather. In 2008, Mr. Kozlov was arrested on fraud charges he said were trumped up.When his legal problems were finally resolved, Ms. Romanova suggested the couple leave Russia. \u201cMy wife said, \u2018You are exonerated, but it\u2019s better to leave. Get out.\u2019\u201d Mr. Kozlov, though, said he knew no other place to go, felt he could still do business in his hometown, still had friends, and in any case, \u201cMoscow is the city I love most in the world.\u201cYou need to fight to the end,\u201d he said of this experience. Paying bribes is a shortcut for the wealthy in Russia, he said, but also a trap. With persistence, it\u2019s possible to run a transparent business, he said. \u201cThe chances are it will be all right.\u201d\u201cWe have been through more than one crisis\u201d in Russia, and times of crisis are always the best for investing, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s always a time to start. Some parts of the economy fall, other parts rise. It never happens that everything falls at once.\u201d\u201cWhat worries me is the political situation and foreign policy, the conflict that is happening between Russia and a lot of other countries.\u201d He worries that potential buyers of his shares in the small companies may not show up when he wants to exit.On weekends, Mr. Kozlov dedicates time to his wife\u2019s charity, saying he is giving back for the support shown to him during his roughly three-and-a-half years in jail. The government\u2019s business ombudsman estimates more than 100,000 small-business men are in jail in Russia. The charity, among other things, brings clothes and food to jails to pass along to incarcerated businessmen.Another weekend ritual for Mr. Kozlov, as for so many other Russian businessmen, is to visit the Sanduny steam baths, an opulent, Greco-Roman themed bathhouse with a deep history in the Russian capital as a mixing place for the well-to-do.Here, wearing sheets or nothing at all, Russia\u2019s financial and governmental elite let the week\u2019s worries seep away. And sometimes, deals can be cut in the more relaxed atmosphere that could not happen in suits in an office, Mr. Kozlov said.\u201cI go with a group of friends and discuss business,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good atmosphere. It\u2019s totally relaxed. And there\u2019re no cellphones bothering us. We go early in the morning, when there aren\u2019t so many people. And we get the pleasure of the steam, and of our company.

He had scheduled a meeting with the Federal Railroad Administration on the same day, he said, even though it could have been held another time.\u201cAfter being on the job for only a few days, I felt that I needed to have a better understanding of the agency,\u201d Mr. Santoro said.Now three weeks into the job, Mr. Santoro took a conciliatory tone with lawmakers, explaining the steps the railroad was taking to improve safety and to fill vacant jobs. After listing the issues uncovered by the investigation, Mr. Santoro said, \u201cThese findings are unacceptable.\u201dIn response, the agency was conducting unannounced inspections and had increased penalties for workers, including longer suspensions, among other measures, Mr. Santoro said.Mr. Santoro was joined by several top officials from the agency, who together faced a barrage of questions from state lawmakers reviewing thousands of pages of documents that New Jersey Transit recently submitted about its operations and staffing. The agency has \u201ccritical vacancies\u201d in its rail division and was now working to hire rail managers and other employees, Mr. Santoro said.State Assemblyman John F. McKeon, a Democrat who leads the Judiciary Committee, questioned New Jersey Transit\u2019s hiring last year of Michael Drewniak, a former press secretary for Mr. Christie, who had no transportation experience. He noted that Mr. Drewniak, who until recently served as the agency\u2019s chief of staff and remains at the agency, was one of its highest-paid leaders.Mr. Santoro said he was not the executive director when Mr. Drewniak was hired and he now had a different chief of staff, Paul Wyckoff, who was seated next to him at the hearing. Mr. Drewniak returned to his previous job as policy and strategic planning director.At the end of the hearing, Mr. McKeon said he believed officials were still \u201cdancing a little bit\u201d in evading questions about Mr. Drewniak. He said he had identified 10 people who worked for the agency and had ties to Mr. Christie but little transportation experience, though he declined to identify them.\u201cWe\u2019re going to stop New Jersey Transit and the Port Authority and other places as being dumping grounds for patronage,\u201d Mr. McKeon said. \u201cThat has got to stop.\u201dAfter months without a public meeting, New Jersey Transit\u2019s board met twice recently and approved its annual operating budget last week. The board also approved financing for the lease of radio spectrum needed to implement positive train control, which can automatically stop or slow a speeding train.The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the fatal crash in Hoboken and has not determined a cause. Investigators said they did not know yet whether the safety technology could have prevented the crash, but they have said it could have prevented other crashes, including an Amtrak derailment in Philadelphia last year that killed eight people.New Jersey Transit intended to meet a federal deadline to install the safety technology by the end of 2018, Mr. Santoro told lawmakers. He also said he would suggest to the board that it convene every month from now on.After complaints from commuters about recent fare increases amid worsening service, Mr. Santoro said there would be no fare increase this fiscal year. He also said he proposed to state officials that there be no fare increase in the fiscal year ending in 2018.Mr. Santoro acknowledged that New Jersey Transit had more train accidents than other commuter railroads and that older trains were breaking down more often, arguing that plans to hire rail managers and buy new equipment would help address the problems.Asked about the agency\u2019s safety culture, Mr. Santoro said it needed to be improved.\u201cClearly there needs to be a refocusing and rededication and new resources related to keeping the culture,\u201d he said, \u201cand improving the culture as well.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Western Michigan\u2019s Perfect Record Could Give Way to Pain Off the Field", "Date": "2016-11-05", "News": "Supported byKALAMAZOO, Mich. \u2014 When Western Michigan hired P. J. Fleck before the 2013 season, he was, at 32, the youngest head coach in the Football Bowl Subdivision. With indomitable energy, offensive smarts \u2014 he had been a receivers coach in the N.F.L. \u2014 and a penchant for quirky motivational mantras like \u201cRow The Boat,\u201d he has turned the Broncos from a 1-11 doormat in his first year to a 9-0 team that is No. 17 in this week\u2019s Associated Press poll.Fleck\u2019s success, as intense as his personality, is great news for Western Michigan. It is also, in a sense, bad news. No matter how the university finishes its regular-season schedule, starting Tuesday night at Kent State (3-6), it almost certainly will not get the chance to play for the national title. It will absolutely continue to be forced to subsidize its athletic program to the tune of several million dollars a year. And there is a good chance that in the next year or two, it will lose Fleck.\u201cThey are trying to do some things, improvements, coaches\u2019 salaries,\u201d said David Ridpath, a sports business professor at Ohio, which competes in the Mid-American Conference against Western Michigan. \u201cBut they\u2019re going to get the same players, same competitiveness in the conference.\u201dThey reside in what are known as the Group of 5 conferences, and more than a few are looking for a way out. During the summer, when the Big 12 announced that it was considering expansion, about 20 such teams raised their hands. (The Big 12 eventually announced it would not take on new members.)\u201cPeople have just assumed he\u2019s gone,\u201d Kathy Beauregard, Western Michigan\u2019s athletic director for the last two decades, said of Fleck, \u201cand we haven\u2019t just assumed that.\u201dThis year, even a 13-0 season, complete with two road wins over Big Ten teams, will almost certainly fail to net the Broncos a chance to play for a national championship, a reality confirmed by the College Football Playoff selection committee\u2019s decision to seed them No. 23 in its first rankings on Tuesday night.And at some point \u2014 maybe this November, maybe the next one, maybe the one after that \u2014 Fleck\u2019s success will earn a compelling offer from the kind of program that can promise both a multimillion-dollar salary and the carrot of knowing an undefeated season will mean a place in the playoff bracket rather than an invitation to a prestigious but ultimately meaningless bowl game.\u201cI told him the day I hired him that I knew he had an incredible future ahead of him,\u201d Beauregard said.Given the MAC\u2019s history, it is impossible to conceive of a young coach taking a job there and not wondering whether it might be a steppingstone. Miami University in Ohio has been known as the cradle of coaches for playing host, in a bygone era, to Woody Hayes, Ara Parseghian and, a little later, Bo Schembechler \u2014 the future head coaches at Ohio State, Notre Dame and Michigan. More recently, Central Michigan produced Brian Kelly (Notre Dame) and his successor Butch Jones (Tennessee), and Northern Illinois sent Dave Doeren to the Atlantic Coast Conference (North Carolina State). Alabama\u2019s Nick Saban (Toledo) and Ohio State\u2019s Urban Meyer (Bowling Green) also cut their teeth in the league before going on to greener, richer pastures.The arrangement is mutually beneficial. These public colleges in the Midwest (and Buffalo, N.Y.) get to buy low and sell high, enjoying the services of future title-winning coaches for comparative pennies. The coaches get to compete in a league of unusually equal resources, giving them a chance to prove their recruiting and coaching mettle.But cradles, in Western Michigan\u2019s thinking, are for babies.John M. Dunn, who is in his 10th and final year as Western Michigan\u2019s president, said he hoped to initiate a change in the MAC\u2019s reputation by keeping Fleck.\u201cAre there opportunities that would convince a coach like P. J. that this is the place?\u201d Dunn said. \u201cThat\u2019s one data point. How about two or three? Now you\u2019ve got a trend line.\u201dIn an interview Thursday in his office overlooking Waldo Stadium, Fleck showed off his boundless energy and colorful socks. And he spoke elliptically about his future at Western Michigan, where a contract extension through 2020 has made him the MAC\u2019s highest-paid coach.\u201cThere\u2019s always visions, there\u2019s always bucket-list items, there\u2019s always career aspirations,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s all out there.\u201dHe had offers to leave Kalamazoo after last season, he said, but they \u201cweren\u2019t right.\u201dAs for major conference realignment, it is like the Messiah: Many people believe it is coming, but they disagree on when and how. The next easily foreseen tectonic shifts are years away. The middle of the next decade will bring the expiration of several major-conference broadcast rights deals, the contracts holding the Big 12 together, and the College Football Playoff, which runs through 2026.\u201cOur important piece is to make sure we take care of our business and position ourselves continually to right now be the best in the Mid-American Conference,\u201d Beauregard said. \u201cWhen and if a time comes, we\u2019d certainly take a look at what we have and what is the right fit for us.\u201dAdded Fleck, sounding like a man who saw himself staying put for a while: \u201cThis isn\u2019t the end of Power 5 expansion, I promise you that. As we move forward, we always want to be in a position where we are attractive.\u201dYet even if one optimistically posits that realignment is coming, and that it has a place for a MAC team, who knows what state the Broncos will be in, and if Fleck will be leading them?Beauregard said Western Michigan was prepared to come up with a higher offer should it become necessary, and to do it with private financing \u2014 an important factor for a public university program that, depending on your preferred method of accounting, receives in the neighborhood of $19 million or $9 million in direct annual subsidies, and another several million dollars indirectly. She pointed to the speedy renovation of the football building that abuts Waldo Stadium, which now resembles the glossy, touchscreen-filled facilities at Power 5 programs.Western Michigan is hoping for a virtuous, self-fulfilling cycle: wins that raise money and prominence, money and prominence that enable it to keep its coach, and a coach that will keep the program winning. And such success would better position it to draw the attention of the Power 5.\u201cThere is a lot of debate about what is the enhancement or marketing value of having a winning football team,\u201d said Dunn, the president. \u201cThe economists have argued it back and forth, so I\u2019m not going to try to overcook it, but I think, right now for us, it\u2019s been very helpful.\u201dAll the same, he added, \u201cThe idea of being to some extent an overachieving football team is rewarding in itself.\u201dAn earlier version of a capsule summary with this article misidentified the record of Western Michigan\u2019s football team. It is 9-0, not 13-0.Advertisement"}

They were trying to sway an international phone poll to name Jeju Island in South Korea \u2014 a verdant spur of volcanic rock famous for its fresh air and succulent seafood \u2014 one of the \u201cnew seven wonders of nature.\u201dSouth Koreans, from then-President Lee Myung-bak to schoolchildren, pitched in. On Jeju Island alone, government officials voted up to two million times a day on their office phones, generating $20.3 million in phone bills.But Lee Hae-gwan smelled something fishy. Mr. Lee, a union leader at South Korean\u2019s main telephone company, heard from fellow workers that their employer was handling the calls locally, even as it charged South Koreans millions for calling Britain.Mr. Lee blew the whistle \u2014 and paid for it. Over the last four years he has endured a suspension, a transfer, a pay cut and being fired. All, he says, were the result of his whistle-blowing.His plight \u2014 which ended only this year, when he won his job back \u2014 demonstrates why South Korea is having trouble getting inside executives and officials to call out wrongdoing, despite a broader push to uproot corruption.\u201cI would do it again,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cBut if my children or friends ask me what to do in the same situation, I would not encourage them to do as I did. You pay too big a price.\u201dCorruption is becoming a pressing issue in South Korea as economic growth slows and its people begin to demand higher standards from their leaders and big companies. After a string of corruption scandals that implicated prosecutors and judges, opposition parties are calling for the establishment of an independent agency to investigate graft among senior public servants.But the groups expect progress to be slow because of broad political gridlock as well as entrenched attitudes toward whistle-blowers, especially among government officials and corporate executives.\u201cThey do whatever it takes to find an excuse to expel whistle-blowers,\u201d said Lee Young-kee, a lawyer who heads the Horuragi Foundation.South Korea\u2019s past military dictatorship spawned a rigidly hierarchical office culture that made whistle-blowing difficult. With \u201cloyalty to the organization\u201d upheld as a key value, whistle-blowing was seen as an act of betrayal. Rules were routinely ignored in the name of meeting management goals, but few spoke out against colleagues because life in the office revolved around hometown, family and school connections, reinforced through nepotism and late-night wining and dining.In its 2013 survey of 42 whistle-blowers, the Horuragi Foundation found that 60 percent were fired after exposing corruption in their organizations. Whistle-blowers reported financial straits, divorces and suicidal impulses as they were ostracized by their colleagues and harassed with defamation and other lawsuits from managers.In 1992, in one of the first cases of whistle-blowing in a democratized South Korea, an army lieutenant revealed vote-rigging within the military barracks during parliamentary elections. He was demoted to private and dishonorably discharged. In 2003, when four Red Cross officials revealed that their group shipped blood tainted with AIDS, hepatitis and malaria viruses to hospitals, the Red Cross reprimanded them for \u201cdisorderly behavior.\u201dWhen Lee Hae-gwan blew the whistle on the Jeju Island situation in early 2012, he was taking on a popular cause. At the time, he was a midlevel marketing staff member at KT Corporation, South Korea\u2019s largest telecom company.Kim Yoon-ok, South Korea\u2019s first lady, was appointed as honorary chairwoman for a national committee supporting Jeju\u2019s bid. The National Assembly adopted a unanimous resolution supporting the effort. Local campaigners encouraged people to vote as many times as they could, offering them free Hyundai and Kia cars via a lottery. Citizens, including children with their piggy banks, donated $5 million to help finance the telephone voting.But Mr. Lee and other workers wondered how KT\u2019s lines could handle that volume of international calls, as well as how the fees from the phone calls might be divided between the phone company and New7Wonders.In early 2012, he shared his misgivings with a local TV station and a government anticorruption commission. Authorities later fined KT less than $3,200, but the company also donated $4.1 million to help Jeju Island pay its phone bill.Eamonn Fitzgerald, spokesman for New7Wonders, said his group took \u201ca small portion\u201d of the telephone fee paid by each voter and collected fees from corporate sponsors in the places competing for the title. Mr. Fitzgerald declined to say how many votes Jeju ultimately received, and the Jeju government declined to comment.The furor died, but Mr. Lee began to feel rising pressure from his employer. First KT suspended him for two months. It then transferred him out of Seoul. In his new post, he was shunned by colleagues.In late 2012, KT fired him, citing factors like taking sick leave without permission.In February, South Korea\u2019s top court affirmed an earlier decision that Mr. Lee\u2019s punishments were a pretext and that he should be reinstated. But KT was not done with him.In March, he was punished with a month\u2019s pay cut for the same reasons it had fired him in 2012. In a statement, KT said its action was justified and was not a reprisal for whistle-blowing. It has since rescinded the pay cut without explanation.Mr. Lee cited what many workers in South Korea call \u201cthe bitter taste of organization.\u201d \u201cI blew the whistle expecting KT to apologize, fix the problem and move on,\u201d he says. \u201cHow na\u00efve I was.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Snapchat\u2019s Parent Files for a Stock Offering", "Date": "2016-11-15", "News": "Supported byThe clock has started for one of the most eagerly awaited market debuts of 2017: that of Snapchat, the popular messaging service.The social network\u2019s parent, Snap Inc., has filed confidentially to go public, with an eye toward being valued at more than $30 billion, people briefed on the matter said Tuesday. That would make Snap the third-most-valuable technology company at the time of its market debut, after Alibaba and Facebook.The company is aiming to begin having its shares traded as soon as March, though the final timing for an offering has not been determined.The confidential filing, made with the Securities and Exchange Commission before the presidential election last week, comes amid a relative drought in the market for initial public offerings. There have been 96 offerings of companies with a market value of more than $50 million in the United States so far this year, down 41 percent from 2015, according to data from Renaissance Capital.A Snap share sale is also expected to eschew the complexities of previous technology initial public offerings like Google\u2019s in 2004. Still, like Google, Facebook and other tech companies, Snap\u2019s recently amended corporate charter shows that a different class of stock would enable its top executives, including its co-founder Evan Spiegel, to maintain control even after the service is publicly traded.Yet Snap will encounter intense scrutiny from potential investors, as rivals try to encroach on its turf by copying some of the photo messaging service\u2019s signature features. In August, Facebook\u2019s Instagram rolled out its version of the Snapchat Stories photo and video service.Founded in a Stanford University dorm room in 2011, Snapchat has become a darling of the tech world, as it has grown from a simple disappearing-messages service into a digital video phenomenon. Its lofty goal is to essentially become the online generation\u2019s equivalent to television.It has built up its popular Stories service, in which users upload photos or videos and share them with followers. And it gained new levels of popularity after rolling out features like lenses, which lets users transform their likenesses into cartoon dogs, silly faces \u2014 or Taco Bell tacos, paid for by sponsors.Such has been the popularity of Snapchat that media organizations have rushed to establish beachheads on the service. Even the White House has set up a Snapchat account, and President Obama has given an interview on the company\u2019s in-house political show.Analysts have estimated that Snap, which began its advertising business less than two years ago, could reach $1 billion in sales next year, up from more than $350 million this year.Snap\u2019s financial information will be known when its offering filing is publicly disclosed \u2014 if the company decides to go ahead with a sale of its shares.Unlike some private companies, Snap has had no trouble raising money on the private markets, so investors were not given preferential treatment regarding how many shares they will get in the event of a public offering, according to corporate documents filed in Delaware.This sets Snap apart from offerings from Square and Box. Both of those companies had to give some of their private investors special deals that diluted other early shareholders. When Square went public last November, some investors received an additional 10.3 million shares, which came at the expense of other investors.Similarly, when Box went public in 2014, some of the company\u2019s earlier private investors were entitled to extra shares.\u201cSnapchat will certainly be an indicator of whether there is a big pile of investor cash ready to go into the market,\u201d said Doug Bontemps, Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s managing director of corporate finance. \u201cBut Snapchat is unique. It\u2019s growing quickly, is doing some interesting things with glasses and has gotten a lot of attention. There aren\u2019t a lot of that ilk.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the number of days in which companies must publicly disclose their offering documents before pitching the proposed share offering to prospective investors. It is 15 days, not 21.Advertisement"}

Stone\u2019s analysis of San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez is a welcome voice in aid of pending litigation against the abysmal education provided to Detroit\u2019s children. It should be pointed out, however, that Rodriguez is perhaps most notable for its profoundly deleterious effects on the education of all poor children.Rodriguez has consigned children living in poor public school districts to a less well-financed education than children in richer districts. In relation to quality of schooling, poor children have thus been penalized in perpetuity for being poor, a penalty that prejudices their chances of attending college and competing in the workplace.Rodriguez intimated that the court might eventually recognize a children\u2019s right under the Constitution to have government educate them with basic minimal skills. Not even this meager right exists yet, though obviously districts enjoying wealthier property-tax bases educate children beyond these skill sets.But should the court recognizes the right, the lot of impoverished children will not markedly improve; they will then be constitutionally entitled to instruction in only the rudiments.It is cruelty to tell deprived youngsters that they can be whatever they want to be and simultaneously deny them the means to fulfill their dreams. Nor should we wonder why, despite America\u2019s superpower resources, international comparisons of educational attainment show that our children lag behind.SUSAN H.

{"Headline": " Egypt Averts Economic Collapse, for Now", "Date": "2016-11-05", "News": "Supported byEditorialA result has been a lack of foreign currency, which has forced many Egyptians to buy dollars on the black market, reduced imports of everything from sugar to cars and led to layoffs in some companies. After President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi seized power in 2013, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates provided billions of dollars in aid. That saved Egypt, but it also allowed Mr. Sisi, who fears popular unrest, to ignore the I.M.F. and its demands for structural reforms as a condition of its lending.Mr. Sisi, a former general who has become an authoritarian and repressive leader, is not known for his economic expertise or political courage. But several factors \u2014 further economic deterioration, rising criticism of his government and pressure from the United States \u2014 have combined to change his mind. Even so, he waited until now to accept a deal that was tentatively approved in August.Ahead of the float, scheduled to begin on Sunday, the Egyptian central bank had devalued the currency by nearly 50 percent, an effort to guide the level at which it should eventually trade. The move was designed to wipe out the advantage of the black market, which siphoned money from the banking system. Fuel subsidies were also cut. Egypt had already been addressing the I.M.F. requirements that it pass a value added tax, reduce electric subsidies and raise $6 billion in external financing.Whether poor Egyptians can hang on that long is unclear. The price of many subsidized staples, including bread, sugar, rice and cooking oil, could rise. Inflation across the board is already at a seven-year high, about 15 percent, and food prices are even higher. More anger and deprivation could lead to popular unrest, further taxing a country that has experienced enormous upheavals, including the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak in 2011 and the ouster of his successor, Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, two years later.Mr. Sisi and other Egyptian leaders will have to convince the public that they have a plan that can rescue the economy without hurting the poor. More broadly, to put Egypt on a path to revival, they must educate and provide jobs for millions of young Egyptians; attract foreign investment to help move many of the nearly seven million government workers to the private sector; reduce the army\u2019s role in the economy; and develop a political system in which ordinary Egyptians, not just the military, can have a voice.Advertisement"}

If he lives up to that promise and serves about four more years in United States custody, Mr. Zubair would be repatriated to Malaysia to serve the remainder of his sentence.The Obama administration declined to comment on the deliberations. The officials who described them spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deal is not public or final. Lawyers for Mr. Hambali and Mr. Lillie said they had heard rumors of movement but had no details.There is a new attorney general in Malaysia, and there appears to be greater high-level political will for Malaysia to take back its two nationals at Guant\u00e1namo.The talks have also explored whether Mr. Zubair might plead guilty both to military commission charges and \u2014 via videoconference link from Cuba \u2014 to domestic criminal offenses in Malaysia, potentially bolstering Malaysia\u2019s domestic legal authority to keep imprisoning him after a transfer.The Malaysian government wants to get back Mr. Lillie as well, and the American government wants to convict him \u2014 either through a plea or by trial with help from Mr. Zubair\u2019s testimony. But its ultimate goal is to use testimony from one or both of them to win a conviction against Mr. Hambali. The Bali bombings killed 202 people, including seven Americans; the Jakarta bombing killed at least 11 people and wounded about 140 more.Mr. Denbeaux said he had not yet discussed any new plea deal with Mr. Zubair.

{"Headline": "Up in the Sky, Help to Keep Africans From Starving", "Date": "2016-11-08", "News": "Supported byFixesAndrew Mude, a Kenyan economist, has a way of explaining satellites. When he\u2019s talking to pastoralists in his country\u2019s north \u2014 people who roam the earth with a dozen head of cattle and very little else \u2014 he talks about the stars that don\u2019t act like other stars. \u201cThey\u2019re actually taking pictures of the ground,\u201d Mude says. Herders, a stargazing people, understand.Mude has figured out a way those fake stars can help. They can make it easier to assure rural Africans that they can survive a drought.Because of climate change, life has become harder each year for pastoralists. What used to be every-five-year droughts now come every other year. Each time, they leave the land more parched, with less water and grass for forage. And pastoralists have nothing to fall back on when their animals die.Wherever land cannot grow crops \u2014 it is too cold, too dry, too mountainous \u2014 people keep animals. More than 100 million of the world\u2019s poorest live this way. Among the 50 million pastoralists in sub-Saharan Africa, the average income is $2 per day and dropping.What can help them?Historically, poor herders could never insure their livestock. The transaction costs were absurd. No agent could afford to take an all-terrain vehicle across vast expanses of roadless, arid lands to find a nomadic pastoralist and certify that a $140 cow had died.Mude\u2019s program began in one Kenyan county in 2010. Today, about 16,000 families are insured; most are in Kenya, and some are in southern Ethiopia.Insurance may also help even pastoralists who are not insured. When forage dries up, a whole region is hit at once. So insurance providers inject needed cash from outside reinsurers, and the resulting economic activity can lift everyone.Commercial insurers sell the livestock insurance. But the government is trying to spread this approach by beginning to shoulder some of the cost of premiums. Kenya expects to cover 80,000 households by 2019 in the Kenya Livestock Insurance Program. But that\u2019s a tiny percentage of households that need it, and the program will cover only five cows per household.Mude said that numerous governments in Africa and parts of Asia have contacted him, eager to try the idea. So it\u2019s worth looking at how Mude and his collaborators overcame some of the toughest problems \u2014 and what still needs to be solved.What\u2019s harder is helping them understand that they should buy an invisible product that is likely to produce no financial benefit \u2014 and they should do it season after season.\u2022Shariah and insurance. Many pastoralists in the Horn of Africa are Muslim. But Shariah, or Islamic law, objects to the selling of risk, which can be considered the foundation of insurance.The company insures against every kind of loss, but livestock insurance is close to Bashir\u2019s heart. He was born in Wajir \u2014 he doesn\u2019t know exactly when \u2014 in a pastoral family. His father still lives there and owns 150 head of (insured) cattle. Bashir himself still owns cattle and goats as investments.\u2022Commercial profitability? Not soon.Insurance relies on the laws of large numbers. There is probably no bigger challenge in the insurance business than finding large numbers of customers among impoverished, uneducated, nomadic pastoralists.\u201cWe don\u2019t have to find them to verify the animal loss,\u201d said Bashir. \u201cWe don\u2019t even need to know if animal died. But we do have to sell them the policy and find them for payout.\u201d Using agents to do that didn\u2019t work very well, he said; Takaful sold only about 120 policies per season.Then the company did something different: It provided village shopkeepers in pastoralist areas with training and low-end Android smartphones with which to do most of the work. \u201cYou press a picture of a cow when you want to insure a cow. It asks for the number, and the back end calculates the premium,\u201d Bashir said.\u201cThen we started selling 2,000 to 3,000 policies,\u201d he said. Using familiar, respected storekeepers who won\u2019t be going anywhere as Takaful\u2019s agents increased confidence.Richard Kyuma, coordinator of Kenya\u2019s government program, said the program\u2019s purpose was to set the stage for unsubsidized private insurance. \u201cWe\u2019re identifying a very small number of people and covering very few animals,\u201d said Kyuma. \u201cWe want to tell people this can work, and can be used as a way of mitigating against drought. Then we will pull out slowly, and in two or three years we will have weaned them totally to commercial insurers.\u201dThis seems unrealistic. Many farmers will never buy insurance if they must pay. And without widespread acceptance, this insurance has no chance of becoming commercially viable. \u201cBreak-even depends on insuring a million animals and above,\u201d said Bashir. \u201cWe\u2019re at slightly over a tenth of that \u2014 so not even near it.\u201d\u2022An imperfect index. Satellites can tell you how much vegetation is on the ground, but they can\u2019t identify the type. Some of it is stuff animals don\u2019t eat. Mude is trying to solve that problem by crowdsourcing \u2014 asking herders to send photos of vegetation.The bigger problem is that satellite data on forage cover is only a proxy for animal death. Mude has spent years looking at actual animal death, comparing it with ground cover data to see what correlates. Nevertheless, forage data will never be a perfect proxy; in insurance-speak, that\u2019s called a high basis risk. \u201cThere can be rain in one area and none a kilometer away,\u201d said Barrett. \u201cIf it\u2019s uncorrelated, it\u2019s a lottery ticket, not an insurance policy. Andrew and I for half a dozen years have had the conversation: how do we make sure we\u2019re selling insurance and not lottery tickets?\u201dThis is a problem for the government program, Kyuma said. \u201cThere are areas where some locals are saying you should be paying, but the model is saying \u2018no, it\u2019s not the time to pay,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIf people are stressed and yet this product is not responding, then we can be in a terrible fix.\u201d He said the government was working with the World Bank to improve the model\u2019s ability to predict animal death.If livestock insurance spreads to new regions of the world, each will have to begin from scratch to gather data. That means even more basis risk, at least initially. \u201cTrying to meet demand for scale without reducing the rigor of careful design \u2014 this is a particular challenge for us,\u201d said Mude.But even a flawed model has created real improvements for policy holders. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t do away with drought risk, but it still works,\u201d said Barrett \u2014 to keep children betternourished and alive, to improve the well-being of families. \u201cYou can demonstrate real benefits.\u201dAdvertisement"}

On game days, the campus\u2019s iconic quad \u2014 a painterly expanse of lawn, majestic trees and bell tower \u2014 becomes a crimson and white tent city of numbered tailgating plots, some with electricity.Coach Nick Saban is so revered that as rain threatened this year\u2019s sorority rush, prayers went out to \u201cLord Saban\u201d for sunshine, which brings us to the second thing Bama is famous for: Greek life. Banners flew along Colonial Drive after the August rush. One, for Alpha Omicron Pi, descended over four white pillars boasting, with a pun on the house\u2019s floral symbol, of recruiting success: \u201cWe Rose Higher Than the Rest.\u201dHow then, you might ask, did Brianna Zavilowitz, a Staten Islander with 2120 SATs and a 4.0 grade-point average, daughter of a retired N.Y.P.D. detective and an air traffic controller, with zero interest in pledging and middling enthusiasm for football, wind up in Tuscaloosa for college?This was not the capricious choice of a freckle-faced teenager, which she is. Rather, the reason she turned down the University of California, Berkeley, and canceled her Columbia University interview (\u201cI figured I didn\u2019t want to waste his time\u201d) reveals the new competitive ethos in public higher education: Think big and recruit.Ms. Zavilowitz first noticed the university on Facebook. A few clicks and Bama was omnipresent. Pop-ups, emails and literature piqued her interest. She visited, took the bus tour, was tickled by the Southern hospitality. Her mother appreciated detailed parent information suggesting \u201ca well-oiled machine.\u201d There was more: a full-tuition scholarship. \u201cMy mom kept telling me not to look at the money,\u201d said Ms. Zavilowitz, chatting in red Alabama footies. \u201cBut it definitely helped.\u201d Roll, Tide, roll.With state funding now just 12.5 percent of the university\u2019s budget, campus leaders have mapped an offensive strategy to grow in size, prestige and, most important, revenue. The endgame is to become a national player known for more than championship football. Berkeley, the University of Michigan and University of Virginia are the schools \u201cwe compare ourselves against,\u201d said Kevin W. Whitaker, Alabama\u2019s interim provost,Alabama has invested heavily to lure students like Ms. Zavilowitz, who does not qualify for federal financial aid. The university is spending $100.6 million in merit aid, up from $8.3 million a decade ago and more than twice what it allocates to students with financial need. It also has hired an army of recruiters to put Bama on college lists of full-paying students who, a few years ago, might not have looked its way.Each year, about 18 percent of freshmen leave their home state for college in another. They tend to be the best prepared academically and most able to pay, said Thomas G. Mortenson, senior scholar at the Pell Institute for the Study of Opportunity in Higher Education, who tracks this data. Achieving students are likely to be bound for successful lives, enhancing their alma mater\u2019s status and, the hope is, filling its coffers with donations. Schools want them.Merit aid given to achievers has a magnetic effect. \u201cIf we recruit five students from a high school, we will get 10 students the next year and they may not all be scholarship students,\u201d said Stuart R. Bell, president of the University of Alabama.Instead of layoffs and cuts, some public universities facing budget challenges are following this blueprint for survival: higher charges to students, and more of them. Nowadays, the real money comes from tuition and fees. The average for four-year public colleges rose 81 percent in constant dollars between 2000 and 2014. At Alabama, tuition and fees have about doubled in the last decade, to $10,470 for residents and to $26,950 for nonresidents.Even when it awards full-tuition scholarships, the university makes money \u2014 on dorm rooms and meal plans, books, football tickets, hoodies and school spirit items like the giant Bama banner Ms. Zavilowitz and her roommates bought for the blank wall in the suite\u2019s common area. All told, these extras and essentials brought in $173 million last year \u2014 on top of $633 million in tuition and fees, up from $135 million in 2005.\u201cI hate very much to use this analogy, but it\u2019s like running a business,\u201d Dr. Whitaker said.The impact of this strategy is visible on campus, where pristine brick Greek Revival buildings seem like toy models slipped from boxes and set on green plots amid curvilinear streets of fresh black asphalt. In the past decade, the university has added 64 buildings, including an engineering research quad with labs for testing combustion engines and large-scale structures (a \u201cshake table\u201d simulates earthquakes).\u201cThe university must have campus facilities that are competitive to meet student enrollment goals,\u201d according to the 2014-15 financial statement. Gleaming new labs await researchers, and there are plans to expand graduate programs and hire 300 to 400 new faculty members in the next five years. Around Tuscaloosa are cranes, fenced-off construction zones and new apartments (8,270 additional beds since 2012). The parking lots are license-plate bingo heaven.Ambition has its costs. As colleges adopt enrollment management strategies like aggressive recruiting and merit aid, the traditional role of public colleges is changing, said Stephen Burd, senior policy analyst at the think tank New America. This is leaving state residents and lower-income students with \u201cno four-year schools where they can go in an affordable way,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is less aid for low-income students and there are fewer seats\u201d as colleges favor those who already have an advantage.Alabamians are now just 43 percent of the student body. On a campus bus tour crowded with out-of-state students and parents, a senior in a red dress, black heels and pearls (a guide uniform) offered that fact as a selling point.\u2022\u201cWhat happens when states stop funding higher education altogether?\u201d he asked. Politicians have made college affordability a talking point, but education experts like Mr. Mortenson doubt that election-year proposals will reverse the trend, at least any time soon.Overall enrollments have been dropping since 2010. That has all but the nation\u2019s top schools battling for students. Alabama may be a standout example, but across the country university flagships and even regional campuses once focused on serving nearby counties are extending their reach. Arizona State University, Oregon State University and Utah State University have amped up online programs (Starbucks reimburses employee tuition for A.S.U. Online degrees), expanded their campuses, are building or buying satellite campuses and, in the process, significantly raising enrollments.When states suffer budget woes, others feast. \u201cStress in California,\u201d said Kent Hopkins, vice president of enrollment management at A.S.U., \u201cis definitely an advantage as we talk to California students and their parents.\u201d Enrollments from California are up 46 percent in six years. It might be ugly, but once-staid public universities \u201care doing what private colleges have done for a long time,\u201d said Kevin W. Crockett, president of enrollment management at Ruffalo Noel Levitz, a higher education consulting firm. They are asking, \u201cWhat is the appropriate price point for students to cross state lines?\u201dMiami University of Ohio got on board for fall 2010, announcing a scholarship \u201cguarantee\u201d with an ACT of 26 and a 3.7 G.P.A. The university had fallen \u201cseveral hundred\u201d short of the freshman goal, said Susan K. Schaurer, assistant vice president for enrollment management and director of admission. \u201cOur mantra had been to accomplish, but do so humbly and quietly,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you are thrust into an incredibly competitive higher education landscape, you have to shift that thinking.\u201dOver the next 18 months, Miami hired two national recruiters and bought contact information from the College Board and ACT for students around the country instead of tapping the usual feeder schools. With its classical arches, tranquil courtyards and liberal arts curriculum, it is often mistaken for a private college, which it is capitalizing on, reaching out to families \u201cseeking that private school experience,\u201d Ms. Schaurer said. Applications are up 62 percent since 2010; two-thirds now come from out of state. Last year, for example, 41 students applied from Greenwich High School in Connecticut and 33 from Mira Costa High School in California.With its success in drawing more students, Miami has walked back on merit aid; there are still scholarships, but the guarantee is gone and, as of this fall, the qualifying ACT score is higher. These days, Ms. Schaurer said, \u201ca student with a 26 ACT is really below average.\u201d Miami now has seven recruiters.The University of South Carolina has 20. Since it hired someone to recruit in Massachusetts, applicants from that state have jumped, from 335 in 2010 to 881 last year, and enrollments have nearly tripled, from 57 to 156; Massachusetts now ranks eighth as a source of out-of-staters to the Columbia, S.C., campus. Over all, applications from out-of-state students are now double those of residents.Recruiters are shaking up college conversations, said Paul C. Kaser, a counselor at the Bergen County Academies, a public magnet school in New Jersey where nearly half the seniors are National Merit Scholars, finalists, semifinalists or commended students, and parents and students meet counselors with Excel spreadsheets in hand. \u201cThere might be an old stereotype of public universities not caring and just looking at numbers,\u201d he said, but their recruiters \u201ccome to our school to be on panels, to host luncheons.\u201d They respond to emails within hours. As a result, students are now at universities that \u201cwere not even on our radar five years ago.\u201d When he first mentioned Alabama four years ago, he recalled, \u201cthe parents said, \u2018Alabama!?\u2019 I said, \u2018Hear me out.\u2019\u201dOne student starts a pipeline. Five graduates of the Academies are now there.The University of Alabama has 45 recruiters \u2014 36 outside of Alabama, including Dee McGraw-Hickey, a Tuscaloosa native living on Long Island. Last spring, she tweeted as her recruits committed. In August, she held a send-off lunch at her home with sweet tea, lemonade and a game of corn hole in the backyard. Her schedule includes 80 events between September and Thanksgiving. She loves to mention merit aid at them because so many from her region \u2014 New York City, Long Island and Connecticut \u2014 qualify, giving Alabama a competitive edge.\u201cEverybody wants the kids from the Northeast and California,\u201d according to Mr. Burd of New America. \u201cThey are wealthy and they tend to be good students.\u201dIn the past six years, in Ms. McGraw-Hickey\u2019s region, applications to Alabama rose from 193 to 903. At Alabama, recruiting assignments go all the way to the top. Dr. Bell, the president, routinely travels to meet parents and students, recently telling a young man in Dallas not to visit campus without stopping by. \u201cHe came to my office on Friday with his dad,\u201d Dr. Bell said.Raising alumni money for academics, much as the Crimson Tide Foundation has cultivated athletic boosters, is on Dr. Bell\u2019s wish list. \u201cThat is an area we are going to grow,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a culture shift.\u201dIt\u2019s one that more are making.While most public universities have sat back as privates landed eye-popping donations, that\u2019s changing. As dusk settled over New York City, the Empire State Building was lit up in green and gold, the colors of the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Va. Uptown, over miniature Virginia ham sandwiches, the college thanked 400 local donors who helped to raise $52 million. A new $1 billion campaign has as a goal to secure donations from 40 percent of its alumni. This year, donor dollars covered 12.8 percent of William & Mary\u2019s budget; 11.8 percent came from the state. In 1980, state money provided nearly 43 percent of the budget.It is no accident that states with among the largest drops in state allocations since 2008 \u2014 Arizona (down 56 percent), South Carolina (down 37 percent) and Alabama (down 36 percent), according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities \u2014 have entrepreneurial public campuses trained on growth. Those same states also had the greatest net gain in students: More entered the state to attend their four-year public institutions than left to study elsewhere, according to fall 2014 data, the most recent available.New Jersey has long struggled to draw students. It had the second largest net loss in students, after Illinois. Rutgers officials noticed. An honors college, another popular recruiting tool, opened at the New Brunswick campus last year in a new building with stained glass windows, carpeted dorm rooms and light-filled social spaces, including a coffee bar with fireplace. Campus recruiting goals are modest \u2014 7 percent more out-of-state students and 2 percent more international students for next fall \u2014 but officials certainly want to keep the likes of Daniel Ferioli from Hillsdale, N.J., with a 2300 SAT and 3.98 G.P.A., from leaving.\u201cWe have been losing top academic talent to other states,\u201d said Matt Matsuda, academic dean for the honors college. Halting that \u201cis something that from the president\u2019s office on down has been a priority.\u201d Mr. Ferioli turned down Georgetown for Rutgers, reasoning that with plans for an M.B.A. from Harvard or Wharton the honors college offered a similar path at a better price. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be worth paying all that money for Georgetown if I would end up in the same place.\u201dJillian Mazon, too, had weighed college options carefully. When we met before classes began in August, she was still getting used to the South (\u201cEveryone calls you ma\u2019am\u201d) and the serious sorority rush (35 parties in seven days; she\u2019s in Delta Gamma). It was 96 degrees, and unbearably humid for a Burlington, Conn., native. She showed me her dorm room. Over the desk was a map of Connecticut made by one of her six best friends; arrows radiated from a heart with the distance to each one\u2019s college. She has gone the farthest: 1,135.6 miles.An organized person whose closet is arranged by color, Ms. Mazon started her college list in eighth grade and toured 26 campuses. Her mother liked Duke, but she was certain after two visits that Vanderbilt was her top choice \u2014 until the full-tuition scholarship and admission to the honors college came from Alabama. She didn\u2019t apply elsewhere. \u201cI would never want to be $70,000 a year in debt,\u201d said Ms. Mazon, who plans a career in finance.For Ms. Mazon, whose mother is a teacher and whose father heads maintenance at an assisted living complex, graduating nearly debt-free put Alabama alongside prestigious privates in her mind. \u201cI don\u2019t think I am at a disadvantage,\u201d Ms. Mazon said, leaning against a crimson padded bench, green toenails slipped into flip-flops. \u201cHow many Alabama alumni are out there compared to Harvard? My freshman class is 8,000 kids,\u201d she said. \u201cThat network is so extensive, it is insane.\u201d\u2022To critics who say public universities are shirking their public service role, Dr. Bell counters that enrolling out-of-state students seeds the Alabama economy with talent. It\u2019s not uncommon for students to settle in the state of their alma mater \u2014 \u201cone of the biggest drivers of growth in our state,\u201d he said.But Natasha Levitin, daughter of computer programmers, is looking forward to \u201cgoing home\u201d for a job as an analyst at Wells Fargo in New York City after graduation this spring. \u201cI was just looking for the school that was the best bang for the buck,\u201d she said.When she matriculated, she had not grasped the culture of the campus. \u201cI had never seen a Confederate flag until I came down here,\u201d she said. Then there was the dominance of Greek life. She had known a sorority was not for her. But neither was she prepared for the protests and national attention after the student newspaper reported the exclusion of black women from sororities, partly because of pressure from the Machine, a secret society that controls Greek life, to block pledges based on skin color.\u201cSeeing it happen my freshman year that black girls are not allowed in sororities because they are black \u2014 it was embarrassing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was all over the news.\u201d Suddenly, she had to defend her choice of Alabama to friends on social media.The campus is now 11 percent African-American. It was 15 percent in 2000. The state is 27 percent black.When I asked Ms. McGraw-Hickey how diversity concerns figured in her recruiting, she said it rarely comes up. \u201cI feel like to me the campus is diverse in so many ways,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cYou see so many students from all over the country, from different religions, different racial backgrounds.\u201dHow a school with deep Southern history builds a modern national identity is an open question. To students from the urban North, the oft-evoked appeal to Bama \u201cpride\u201d and \u201ctradition\u201d may seem more like stubborn adherence to parochial views than something rich to rally behind. More than just ACT scores and G.P.A.\u2019s, growth in stature is also about extending cultural boundaries.Diluting ties to home states and communities, and filling classrooms with students from around the nation, can free ingrained perspectives.On the other hand, it may transform these entrepreneurial public players \u2014 the pathway to better fortune for generations of state residents \u2014 into yet another national brand for those with resources. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like you can travel around the country and you see the same suburban stores everywhere you go, the same chains,\u201d said Mr. Burd of New America. \u201cYou don\u2019t diversify by only bringing in the most privileged people. You just get people who have pretty much the same values.\u201dMr. Mortenson understands the pressures for revenue. \u201cI don\u2019t blame them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what kind of future are we building for the country?\u201dLaura Pappano is writer-in-residence at Wellesley Centers for Women at Wellesley College.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Capital, Diplomacy and Carnations", "Date": "2016-11-29", "News": "Supported byOn PhotographyA few weeks ago, I stepped into a gallery in Brussels to see an exhibition by the American photographer Taryn Simon. The walls were covered with large color photographs of flower arrangements, 13 in all. Each photograph was framed in wood, and embedded in each frame was a long caption. One began: \u201cAgreement establishing the International Islamic Trade Finance Corporation. Al-Bayan Palace, Kuwait City, Kuwait, May 30, 2006.\u201d Another: \u201cFramework agreement for economic cooperation. Quito, Ecuador, Jan. 12, 2012.\u201d It was these captions that made the arrangements legible, confirming that, far from being merely decorative, the flowers were charged with historical meaning.I saw this new exhibition \u2014 which has the intriguing title \u201cPaperwork and the Will of Capital\u201d \u2014 in late October, and decided to write an essay about it. When I returned to the United States in early November, I was caught up in the presidential campaign and too distracted to write anything; I figured I\u2019d get to it on Nov. 9. The shock of that morning\u2019s election result was not mine alone. I lay in bed in grief and confusion. I was not merely \u201csad.\u201d I was derailed. All my work suddenly seemed pointless. It was so difficult for me to organize thoughts into language that I felt as if I\u2019d had a stroke. It wasn\u2019t until late on Nov. 10 that language slowly returned. The return of the ability to write felt like resistance, the reclamation of an insight: Even at the worst of times, there is nothing pointless about the work we do as critics or artists.So I looked at Taryn Simon again. Take, for instance, her photograph of an arrangement of spray rose and lisianthus. The flowers are piled on a chartreuse table or plinth; the wall behind them is the color of raw linen. The caption begins: \u201cComprehensive claims settlement agreement between Libya and the United States.\u201dWhat could a flower arrangement have to do with an agreement to settle claims between two nations? \u201cPaperwork and the Will of Capital\u201d originates in the press and official photographs made at signings of agreements, declarations, memorandums, treaties, communiqu\u00e9s, conventions, contracts and other formalized moments of accord. Simon noticed the ubiquity of floral displays at these occasions. To refocus attention on the workings of power at these signings, she took an oblique approach: a re-creation of the flower arrangements. The flowers were originally a decorative note, a reflex to signal the importance of the occasion. Reconstructed, they are not mere decorations. The people are gone. The documents are absent. The isolated arrangements are like secrets that can be parsed only with the help of their captions.The caption to the spray rose and lisianthus continues, with punctilious official language: \u201cUnited States Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs David Welch and head of U.S. affairs in the Libyan Foreign Ministry Ahmed al-Fatouri signed an agreement settling all outstanding lawsuits to provide compensation for damages claimed by their respective nationals.\u201d The text goes on, offering details about claims made in the 1986 bombing of a Berlin discoth\u00e8que, the bombing of Tripoli and Benghazi by American forces the same year and the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. The photograph looks innocent (what could be more innocent than flowers?), but the caption is a whirlwind of actions and consequences, of decisions and their political fallout.Similar tensions propelled Simon\u2019s earlier projects. \u201cAn American Index of the Hidden and Unfamiliar\u201d (2007) was about secret sites in the United States, from a nuclear-waste facility to a deliberation room for jury simulations. For \u201cContraband\u201d (2010), Simon spent a working week at John F. Kennedy International Airport, making over a thousand photographs of items that had been seized by customs officials, from dead animals and exotic fruit to a parade of counterfeit pharmaceuticals and luxury items. In the most complex of her projects, \u201cA Living Man Declared Dead and Other Chapters I \u2013 XVIII\u201d (2008-11), she used portraits and captions to look at families in several different countries. In each \u201cchapter,\u201d the story was woven around one individual, to whom all the others were related. The project was systematic at the same time that it revealed the impossibility of systematic accounts of human experience: The more detail Simon supplied, the more the observer became aware of how many more details could be piled on.Photojournalists give us images that work by themselves, or seem to. A photograph in a work by Simon is different: It verifies, or purports to verify, the claim made in its caption, rather than the other way around. The photograph is reduced to the status of evidence: It is there to testify to something that is not a photograph, something that predated its making. But matters are not so simple, because this \u201cevidence\u201d is itself carefully made and lushly presented. Simon\u2019s art is ambidextrous, catching us with both its narrative and its technique.If \u201cA Living Man Declared Dead\u201d was about the nature of personal fate, \u201cPaperwork and the Will of Capital\u201d uses a different set of tools to think about political fate. Powerful men (it is usually men) meet to sign some papers. Afterward, the world is not the same. And yet few of those whose lives are altered by whatever was signed could conceivably trace their circumstances to that event. All they know \u2014 all most of us know \u2014 is that there are powerful forces in the world that shape our day-to-day realities. Simon\u2019s project brings the scattered light of those forces to clear points of attention.Consider another arrangement. Beside an assortment of spray carnation, baby\u2019s breath, cornflower and oxeye daisy is the caption: \u201cClassified \u2018Spare Parts\u2019 deal. Oval Office, White House, Washington, D.C., United States, May 16, 1975.\u201d This one is especially opaque, so I read the next paragraph. \u201cUnited States President Gerald R. Ford, United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and the shah of Iran, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, held a classified meeting in which they discussed a plan to provide material support to Turkey by funneling supplies through Iran.\u201d A longer paragraph describes how Ford and the shah circumvented the arms embargo Congress imposed on Turkey. Simon\u2019s project evokes 17th-century Dutch still-life paintings in its crisp attention to detail and in the impossibility of the bouquets it presents: flowers that bloom in different seasons, or that would never be found growing in the same terrain. And just like those baroque paintings, \u201cPaperwork and the Will of Capital\u201d is made possible by the global flow of goods and money.God is in the details, it is said. Or just as often: The Devil is in the details. Perhaps we should leave theology out of it and simply say that what is human is in the details. Turkey, Iran, Kissinger, Ford: It all seems so long ago. But we don\u2019t turn to history because it is demonstrably relevant, and we don\u2019t look at art only because it is monumental or beautiful. Taryn Simon\u2019s work happens to be relevant, monumental and beautiful. But the greater consolation in thinking about this work at this moment lies in its details. It is in the deadpan meticulousness it embeds, its unruffled testimony about the highways and byways of history.On those immediate postelection mornings in November when I lay in bed aphasic and estranged from myself, whatever did not address the current predicament seemed unworthy. But what became clear was that \u201cthe current predicament\u201d was precisely this condemnation of detail. This erasure of historical nuance can be the anteroom to hopelessness. Sure, clear and direct opposition to bad policies has to be part of the response to the coming years. Marching will be important, and there might be a need to shout slogans. But no less necessary will be our commitment to detail, to meticulousness, to all the accumulated forms of patience that guarantee, rather than merely decorate, our lives.Teju Cole is the author, most recently, of the essay collection \u201cKnown and Strange Things.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Bashar al-Assad, Winning the Syrian War May Lead to New Troubles", "Date": "2016-11-28", "News": "Supported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 With the Syrian government making large territorial gains in Aleppo on Monday, routing rebel fighters and sending thousands of people fleeing for their lives, President Bashar al-Assad is starting to look as if he may survive the uprising, even in the estimation of some of his staunchest opponents.Yet, Mr. Assad\u2019s victory, if he should achieve it, may well be Pyrrhic: He would rule over an economic wasteland hampered by a low-level insurgency with no end in sight, diplomats and experts in the Middle East and elsewhere say.As rebel forces in Aleppo absorbed the harshest blow since they seized more than half the city four years ago, residents reported seeing people cut down in the streets as they searched frantically for shelter. The assault punctuated months of grinding battle that has destroyed entire neighborhoods of the city, once Syria\u2019s largest and an industrial hub.If Aleppo fell, the Syrian government would control the country\u2019s five largest cities and most of its more populous west. That would leave the rebels fighting Mr. Assad with only the northern province of Idlib and a few isolated pockets of territory in Aleppo and Homs Provinces and around the capital, Damascus.But analysts doubted that would put an end to five years of war that have driven five million Syrians into exile and killed at least a quarter of a million people.Ryan C. Crocker, a veteran diplomat in the Middle East, including in Lebanon, Syria, Kuwait and Iraq, where he served as an American ambassador, said he believed that the fighting in Syria would go on for years because once the Assad government had taken the cities, the insurgents would hide in the countryside.\u201cThe Lebanon civil war is a comparison worth looking at,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was long, hot and mean, and it took 15 years to end and it only ended because the Syrians moved into Lebanon and stopped it.\u201dHe added, \u201cWith Syria, we\u2019re just five years into it, and there\u2019s no Syria to come in and end it.\u201dA little over a year ago, such an outcome was virtually unthinkable. Even if Mr. Assad ultimately prevailed, the thinking went, he had crossed so many red lines that he would be too toxic to remain in power.But buttressed by Russian air power, Iranian expertise and recruits that include Iran-trained Iraqi and Afghan militias and fighters from the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, the Assad government has reversed the tide, steadily regaining ground it lost earlier in the war.\u201cThe Russian and Iranian intervention has completely changed the dynamic for Assad,\u201d said Robert S. Ford, a former American ambassador to Syria and now a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute.\u201cLook at the fighting in Aleppo,\u201d he added. \u201cThere are at least as many Lebanese Hezbollah and Iraqi-Iranian militia fighters as there are soldiers born in Syria, so the war of attrition that was going against Assad is no longer doing that because of Iranian manpower.\u201dBut the darker side is what kind of country would be left. \u201cSo Assad stays there and the Russians and Iranians prevail, but they govern over a half-dead corpse, and Syria is just this gaping wound that stretches as far as the eye can see,\u201d Mr. Ford said.Mr. Assad would also be beholden to his two sponsors, Russia and Iran, reviled by many of his own citizens in the Sunni-majority country and rejected by some of the main Sunni powers in the Middle East. That could mean he would face efforts from Iran to solidify its regional reach by expanding Shiite influence in Syria and demanding a role in conquered areas such as Aleppo, perhaps even assigning Iranian-backed Shiite militias there, some experts said.Still, he is ascendant now, in a limited fashion. The rebels lack consistent military aid \u2014 particularly with the incoming administration of President-elect Donald J. Trump expressing doubts about the current level of American support for them \u2014 and they are divided among a bewildering array of groups, including Qaeda aspirants and Kurdish separatists. They have witnessed a decline not only in fighters but in community support, always a critical factor for guerrilla movements.At the same time, Washington is incurring a strategic cost for its decision not to engage, said Emile Hokayem, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies\u2019s Middle East office in Bahrain.\u201cPutin looks tough and wily, while America looks incompetent and unable to sustain its commitment, and that\u2019s a big win because you have a lot of countries in the region which are re-evaluating their relationships,\u201d Mr. Hokayem said. \u201cNow, Russia is a relatively weaker power to the U.S., but with Trump there\u2019s no expectation that the U.S. will serve as a guarantor of regional security, so Russia is a very attractive partner.\u201dGradually, Mr. Assad has worn down his most determined opponents.The regional actors who oppose Mr. Assad \u2014 Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf countries \u2014 have limits to their support of the rebels.In particular, Turkey, which at one time turned a blind eye to the Islamic State\u2019s transit of its borders, has recently embraced fighting the extremist group and made that, rather than fighting Mr. Assad, its top mission. In large part, its motivation for putting its troops into Syria has been to make sure the Kurds, its main enemy, do not gain control of more territory along the Turkish border.Mostly, Continental Europe just wants the war to stop in order to stanch the flow of refugees trying to cross its borders.In Germany, economically the strongest country in the region and the one which has taken by far the most refugees, \u201cAngela Merkel is just hanging on,\u201d said Mr. Crocker, who was recently in Berlin, referring to the German chancellor.\u201cEither the U.S. leads or no one leads,\u201d Mr. Crocker said. \u201cMerkel can\u2019t do it.\u201dYet, Mr. Assad\u2019s victory could confront Europe with a Hobson\u2019s choice: Help pay for Syria\u2019s reconstruction or face having the flow of refugees continue. Without economic help, there will be little to keep people in Syria, particularly if the insurgency continues, as analysts expect.Other than Europe, it is hard to see where Mr. Assad could attract the funds he would need to rebuild his devastated country.That could leave Syria in a long-term state of war and poverty. \u201cWhere\u2019s the financing for rebuilding? I don\u2019t think that Russia and Iran can afford it, and I don\u2019t think China will do it,\u201d Mr. Ford said. \u201cThey need hundreds of billions of dollars.\u201dThe American Congress is unlikely to contribute, and neither are institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, where opponents of Mr. Assad\u2019s like the United States and Saudi Arabia have considerable influence.It is also unlikely that the United States will make a renewed effort in Syria. Mr. Obama always resisted involvement in the civil war, focusing on defeating the Islamic State and giving limited training and support to the rebels opposing Mr. Assad. Mr. Trump is expected to continue to focus on the Islamic State, and he has expressed little interest in maintaining support for the rebels.Meanwhile, the Assad government appears to be moving methodically to destroy the remaining rebel positions around Homs, Damascus and Aleppo.The desperate words used by political activists, civilians and fighters interviewed on WhatsApp, a phone and messaging service, from inside places now being bombed repeatedly suggest the rebel resistance may be nearing its limit \u2014 especially in Aleppo.An Aleppo rebel activist, Hisham, who refused to give his full name for fear of reprisal from the government, said over the weekend that the rebel groups were meeting continuously to discuss options, most involving deals with the Syrian government to try to get aid to civilians in eastern Aleppo, who are in desperate need of food, fuel and clean water.The rebels have a dilemma: go on fighting and allow people to die of starvation or from bombings, or agree to lay down their weapons so the Syrian government, Iranian militias and the Russian military will allow aid convoys through. But if they do that, they will have ceded the ground to the Syrian government.\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to decide what to do: If we refuse, that means the decision is to execute 300,000 people, and if we agree to transform the revolution into aid and lifting the siege. \u2026 \u201d Hisham\u2019s voice trailed off.Sheer deprivation can make the intentions of even the most fervent activists begin to dissolve, which is the whole point of the Syrian government strategy of besieging rebel holdouts.Bassem Ayoub, another activist in Aleppo, described the sense of barely hanging on late last week. \u201cMany foodstuffs are missing in Aleppo: vegetables, fruit, coffee and baby milk,\u201d he said, as well as tissues, diapers, gas and cookies.\u201cIf you ask the children about their dreams, they will tell you, \u2018We dream of bananas, apples, chicken.\u2019 Those are their dreams.\u201dAnne Barnard and Hwaida Saad contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Finance and Technology Come Together", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "Supported byThe hub of the technology industry is Silicon Valley. In finance, the world capitals have long been London and New York.But in the emerging industry that combines finance and technology, often called fintech, the center of activity is less obvious.The traditional centers, London, New York and San Francisco, are attracting substantial investment, but so are less-established capitals like Berlin, Singapore and Sydney, Australia.The lack of a clear winner has been apparent to executives like Chris Larsen, chief executive of the San Francisco company Ripple, which offers international payment processing services to banks. Mr. Larsen fields a steady stream of calls from representatives of foreign cities hoping to lure him and his company to their shores to bolster their fintech credentials.\u201cEverybody recognizes that the capital of fintech has yet to be determined,\u201d said Mr. Larsen, who founded the fintech companies Prosper and E-Loan.Several cities around the world are competing to become the capital, or at least one of the regional capitals, of fintech. If the young financial technology industry has the transformative effect that some have imagined, the contest could also determine the future capitals of finance as a whole.At the recent Money 2020 conference in Las Vegas, the largest fintech conference in the world, government representatives from Dublin, Hong Kong, London, Luxembourg and Belfast, Northern Ireland, among others, were walking the floor looking to woo companies.In the exhibition hall, Invest Hong Kong, a quasi-governmental agency, had a booth where start-ups could learn about the regulatory benefits and subsidies the government of Hong Kong recently began to offer fintech companies.\u201cThe whole industry is waiting to be disrupted,\u201d said Lawrence Tang, the agency employee at the booth. \u201cWe are at the right place to try to capture some of these high-flying fintech companies.\u201dHong Kong has the benefit of being connected to China, which has, mostly in isolation, been home to some of the most notable developments in the fintech world. Chinese fintech companies like Alipay and Tencent have been processing more financial transactions than the largest Chinese banks. The four most highly valued fintech unicorns (companies valued at $1 billion or more) are based in mainland China, according to most recent surveys.Early this year the chief executive of Hong Kong\u2019s central bank, Norman Chan, announced a multipronged effort to become a \u201cFintech Innovation Hub.\u201dThe city-state\u2019s government is offering to put money into companies that locate in Hong Kong, and its regulators have a new \u201csupervisory sandbox\u201d where new companies can try their products without needing to fulfill all the normal regulatory requirements. Hong Kong brought in several foreign companies this month to attend its first government-sponsored conference.Hong Kong has lots of competition from Singapore, which recently started its own aggressive effort to become a capital of fintech. Singapore has begun offering some of the same inducements as Hong Kong, including its first fintech week.Last year, more fintech companies in Singapore raised money from venture capitalists than did in Hong Kong, but the Singapore companies raised less money in sum than those in Hong Kong, according to data from Accenture.Nowhere, though, has the competition been fiercer than in Europe, because of the British vote to leave the European Union.Before the so-called Brexit vote, London had clearly established itself as the hub of fintech activity for the Continent. But if Brexit comes to pass, financial institutions in London are likely to find it harder to do business freely with European companies and financial institutions. Equally important for start-ups, young developers from outside Britain may not be able to remain in London.The day after the Brexit vote, the Irish government sent a playful message to Mr. Hinrikus and TransferWise on Twitter: \u201cDublin sure is a nice place for a fintech company. Just saying\u2026\u201dBerlin, which has become a hub for young technology workers, took an even more aggressive approach. The city\u2019s minister of the economy and technology wrote a letter to dozens of fintech companies in London pitching Berlin as a better option.Berlin Partner, a government-financed agency leading the city\u2019s effort, opened a small office in London in September to court fintech companies full time.Stefan Franzke, chief executive of Berlin Partner, said that five London-based fintech start-ups had already decided to move to Berlin, and he has 40 more prospects.Mr. Franzke said that many banks did not want their fintech employees in a financial capital like London or Frankfurt, because they needed the workers to avoid the mind-set of the traditional financial industry.\u201cIt\u2019s really complicated to disrupt something in your headquarters,\u201d Mr. Franzke said.Mr. Hinrikus, of TransferWise, said that a year ago he would have told young companies to go to London. \u201cBut right now,\u201d he said, \u201cI would recommend people to go to Berlin.\u201dLondon is certainly not watching business go quietly. The primary British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, has set up Project Innovate to help start-ups clear regulatory hurdles.At the conference in Las Vegas, the British Department for International Trade was co-host of a breakfast at a French bistro, where start-ups could meet with the head of Project Innovate.Shaul David, the department\u2019s leader of fintech expansion, said at the breakfast that his job was certainly easier before the Brexit vote. But he said his goal remained the same, \u201cto make London synonymous with fintech as much as Silicon Valley is with technology more broadly.\u201dIn the United States, the government has been slow to act, but the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has been talking about creating a type of charter, with more limited rules, for fintech companies.And the United States still has the hub of tech talent that is Silicon Valley. Mr. Larsen, of Ripple, still has his headquarters in San Francisco, but said the United States might not keep companies like his.\u201cIt\u2019s not prewritten that we are going to win this battle,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Environmentalists Target Bankers Behind Pipeline", "Date": "2016-11-07", "News": "Supported byIn early August, just as protesters from across the country descended on North Dakota to rally against an oil pipeline near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, some of the world\u2019s biggest banks signed off on a $2.5 billion loan to help complete the sprawling project.In campaigning to reduce the world\u2019s carbon emissions, environmentalists have increasingly focused on the financiers behind the fossil fuel industry \u2014 highlighting their role in financing coal, oil and gas projects. It is an expansion of traditional protest efforts, and it has met with some early success.Thirteen of the 17 banks that participated in the latest loan to the Dakota pipeline project, including all five of the lead banks, are members. The group was holding its annual meeting in London on Monday and Tuesday.Hillary Clinton, the Democrat nominee in the race for the United States presidency, has said she will back the climate policies of President Obama, including continued support of the Paris agreement. Her Republican opponent, Donald J. Trump, has called global warming a hoax, and has said he would \u201ccancel\u201d the Paris deal if he were elected.In their battles with banks, environmentalists have scored some early victories. After a concerted effort by climate-change campaigners, several global banks, including Barclays, ING and Deutsche Bank, stepped back over the last two years from projects that involve mountaintop removal mining, a practice experts say is particularly damaging to the environment.Experts also question the profitability of the Dakota pipeline, at a time of slumping oil prices.Citigroup said that it had already raised concerns over the project with Energy Transfer and advocated engagement with the Sioux tribe. It was closely following the outcomes of the federal government\u2019s efforts to engage local communities in a possible review of the project, the bank said in a statement. A Wells Fargo spokesman, Alan Elias, declined to comment.Judith Schmidt, a spokeswoman for TD bank, declined to comment on the letter specifically. Mizuho and the Bank of Tokyo could not immediately be reached for comment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Tightens Controls on Overseas Use of Its Currency", "Date": "2016-11-29", "News": "Supported bySHANGHAI \u2014 As an exodus of money adds to the pressure on a slowing economy, regulators are trying to put the brakes on overseas use of China\u2019s currency by increasing the scrutiny of certain overseas deals.The decision to restrict overseas use of the renminbi represents a setback in China\u2019s long-term drive to turn the currency into a rival to the dollar and euro in the global marketplace.But that leniency created a problem for China. The currency flowed out of the country in recent months and then traded heavily overseas, beyond the control of China\u2019s regulators.The situation has contributed to the currency\u2019s steady weakening against the strong dollar this autumn. That weakness, in turn, has prompted some Chinese businesses and households to move even more money out of the country before its value can erode further.\u201cThe authorities, under the relentless pressures of capital outflows, are poised to impose extensive restrictions on capital movements, marking a reversal of the gradual liberalizations introduced in recent years,\u201d Fred Hu, the chairman of the Primavera Capital Group, an investment firm based in Beijing and Hong Kong, wrote in an email reply to questions.\u201cWhile such capital controls may be intended to be temporary,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthey will introduce mounting uncertainties for Chinese outbound investments.\u201dIn an effort to slow the exodus, an affiliate of China\u2019s central bank, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, issued a directive to bankers on Monday that amounted to additional scrutiny.The directive, which was quickly and broadly circulated within China\u2019s financial community, told banks that their domestic customers must check with the Beijing regulator before transferring $5 million or more \u2014 in dollars or renminbi \u2014 out of the country. The rules will also cover renminbi that is sitting in overseas accounts, which had previously escaped most regulation.\u201cThe People\u2019s Bank of China in Shanghai is facing great pressure to keep a balance\u201d between inflows to and outflows from China, said the directive, referring to the Shanghai office of the central bank. The directive said that 5.1 trillion renminbi, or $740 billion, sluiced out of China in the first 10 months of this year while only 3.1 trillion came back into the country.The State Administration of Foreign Exchange declined Tuesday evening to respond to a faxed question regarding offshore renminbi, suggesting that the question should be submitted instead to the People\u2019s Bank of China. The central bank did not respond to questions late Tuesday evening.Government directives are not supposed to be public in China. In a sign of government irritation at the unauthorized distribution, censors reached into private WeChat social media accounts on Tuesday and deleted copies of the directive.The rules appear to take aim at a relatively discrete set of overseas deals that largely allow companies to pull money out of the country, rather than more strategic acquisitions.Many Chinese companies, for example, have used their overseas subsidiaries to buy or borrow renminbi in Hong Kong, London, New York and elsewhere from the international arms of Chinese banks. Some of them then sell the renminbi and buy dollars, in a bet that the dollar will strengthen.The new rules will apply broadly to Chinese companies. In the past, only companies with headquarters in Beijing typically had to notify the government of big moves in offshore renminbi.Even so, the new rules amount more to a modest tweak than an outright overhaul.Capital controls in China already restrict the movement of money. Individuals, for example, are not supposed to move more than $50,000 out of the country annually. Companies, too, have limits and other approval processes. The latest directive basically adds another layer of approval and closes some additional escape valves.\u201cThey are not changing the rules,\u201d said Jeffrey Sun, a partner in the Shanghai office of Orrick, Herrington and Sutcliffe, a global law firm. \u201cIt\u2019s that, internally, they need to go through this extensive process.\u201dWhile Chinese regulators are increasing their scrutiny, they have been reluctant to ban overseas investment outright. Four different regulators issued a joint public statement on Monday through the official Xinhua news agency to emphasize that it was still acceptable for Chinese companies and households to invest overseas.China\u2019s overseas investments have \u201cplayed an important role in deepening China\u2019s mutually beneficial cooperation with other countries and promoting domestic economic restructuring and upgrading,\u201d the statement said.But even those more strategic deals may soon get a second look. Regulators are also drafting rules that would require prior approval from Beijing for very large overseas corporate acquisitions.\u201cThe companies behind these large acquisitions are themselves very influential, and many will still find ways to close targeted deals,\u201d said Brock Silvers, the chief executive of Kaiyuan Capital, a Shanghai investment advisory firm.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazil\u2019s President, Michel Temer, Embroiled in New Corruption Scandal", "Date": "2016-11-25", "News": "Supported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 A new corruption scandal was engulfing the fledgling government of Brazil\u2019s president, Michel Temer, on Friday after a former minister in his cabinet accused him of exerting pressure to assist a top political ally in a property deal.The former minister, Marcelo Calero, who was in charge of culture, told federal investigators that Mr. Temer had pressured him to overrule a heritage preservation measure halting the construction of a luxury tower in the northeastern city of Salvador. The ally of Mr. Temer, Geddel Vieira Lima, who held the title of government secretary, had invested in an apartment in the development. Mr. Vieira Lima submitted his resignation on Friday morning, apologizing and explaining in a letter to Mr. Temer that he was leaving the government for the good of the nation.Signaling the potential for even more turmoil, pressure is growing on another leader in Mr. Temer\u2019s party, Renan Calheiros, the head of the Senate, who is battling multiple claims of corruption including a case in which he is alleged to have allowed a lobbyist for a construction company to pay child support for Mr. Calheiros\u2019s son from an extramarital affair.Mr. Temer and his party were allies of the leftist Workers\u2019 Party for more than a decade before breaking this year with Ms. Rousseff and her mentor, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who was president for eight years, starting in 2003.Mr. Vieira Lima, the official with the investment in the real estate venture in Salvador, was already under investigation in connection with a corruption scandal around the national oil company, Petrobras. Mr. Temer had insisted that the inquiry should not prevent Mr. Vieira Lima from remaining in his cabinet, where he held one of the most influential positions in the executive branch.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the number of years that Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva was president. It was eight, not seven.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Philanthropy in Silicon Valley: Big Bets on Big Ideas", "Date": "2016-11-04", "News": "Supported byGiving Special SectionSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The founders of Silicon Valley\u2019s technology companies, many of whom have amassed huge fortunes at a young age, tend to look at their philanthropic giving much as they do their companies: They study a problem, explore a number of ways to attack it and eventually invest heavily to scale up the ideas they think will be winners.The couple eventually made substantial donations to programs identified by GiveWell, including nearly $30 million to the Against Malaria Foundation, which distributes mosquito nets to reduce malaria infections among children in Africa, and more than $47 million to GiveDirectly, a program that gives cash directly to extremely poor people in Kenya and Uganda.More recently, Ms. Tuna and Mr. Moskovitz have chosen to fund projects intended to mitigate potential global catastrophes, like an epidemic of a deadly disease, biological warfare and the threats posed by advanced artificial intelligence.Those risks receive little attention from other philanthropists, Ms. Tuna said, which is one reason Good Ventures decided to focus on them.\u201cWe think internally about worldview diversification,\u201d she said.Many of the projects funded by Good Ventures will not succeed, but she and her husband are comfortable with that. \u201cI actually expect that most of our work will fail to have an impact, and that is part of doing high-risk philanthropy well,\u201d Ms. Tuna said.This methodical approach is characteristic of tech-industry philanthropists, said Emmett D. Carson, chief executive of the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, which has advised about 2,000 donors in the region on their giving.\u201cThey talk to people themselves. They read the material themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they are willing to make very big bets on very big ideas, provided that they learn something.\u201dAmir Pasic, dean of the Lilly Family School of Philanthropy at Indiana University, said that in analyzing the philanthropic approaches of big donors, it helped to consider how they made their money. \u201cWealthy folks tend to use their experience and say, \u2018How can I apply that to solve the world\u2019s problems?\u2019\u201d he said.Data on different donation styles is scarce, but some general trends are apparent, according to those who study philanthropy.\u201cTech people tend to be interested in more early-stage start-ups,\u201d said William Foster, head of consulting at the Bridgespan Group, which works with nonprofits and philanthropists on high-impact social change projects. These philanthropists typically support disruptive new ideas, get more directly involved in their giving and show a willingness to move quickly to another approach when one fails.The couple, who made the pledge after years of conversations with scientists and other philanthropists, did not donate the money to a leading medical institution or university. Instead, they said they intended to invest the funds in efforts to build basic tools to help the whole scientific community make breakthroughs in research.Some of the $3 billion will be spent advocating for more public and private money to attack disease. As they have done with their education initiatives, the couple is also likely to take ownership stakes in for-profit companies that are doing promising work.The Omidyar organization\u2019s efforts to bring financial services to underserved populations, for example, include all three types of contributions. Early on, Omidyar financed BRAC, a nonprofit that makes microloans in Africa, Asia and Haiti. It has also invested in for-profit companies like Prosper, a peer-to-peer lender, and MicroEnsure, which provides insurance to low-income people in emerging markets.\u201cWe have a motto here: Problem first, tool second,\u201d said Matt Bannick, a former eBay executive who is managing partner of the Omidyar Network. The approach appeals to Silicon Valley\u2019s pragmatism and has since been widely adopted by the region\u2019s philanthropists.The Omidyar Network, which focuses on early-stage projects, also takes board seats and provides networking opportunities and training to the organizations it finances. \u201cHalf of the organizations report that our nonmonetary assistance to them was as valuable as our monetary assistance,\u201d Mr. Bannick said.Measuring the precise impact of any particular gift or investment is more difficult. You can count the number of solar lanterns distributed or the number of mosquito nets handed out, but how do you measure the impact of those on a child\u2019s life?\u201cThere are a lot of people who have tried to figure out whether you can boil down impact to a number,\u201d Mr. Bannick said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a fool\u2019s errand.\u201dStill, principles like focusing on underfunded yet highly effective charities can be helpful for any donor, no matter how small.\u201cThe biggest piece of advice I would give any donor is to be proactive,\u201d Ms. Tuna said. \u201cFind the best charity for your values. The charities that are the most aggressive and best at marketing aren\u2019t necessarily the ones doing the most good.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Is Now Hiring", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "Supported byEditorialStaffing his administration is the first test of Donald Trump\u2019s sales pitch to Americans: that his career running companies will make him a better president than any politician. Whom he hires and how he goes about it will be an early sign of his skill at managing the most consequential \u201ccompany\u201d in the world, and its millions of employees.Mr. Trump, who until now had no experience in the federal government, is under immense pressure to find 4,100 qualified people to lead it. In an ideal scenario, his White House staff should be in place, and the 100 highest-ranking government agency officials \u2014 the cabinet, plus a range of defense, homeland security, disaster and pandemic response officials \u2014 should be ready to start work the moment Mr. Trump puts his hand on the Bible, to guard the nation from vulnerability during the transfer of power. That means their vetting and security clearances should be done and the nominees lined up for Senate confirmation. An additional 300 Senate-confirmed jobs should be filled by the start of the August congressional recess.On Sunday, Mr. Trump chose as his chief of staff Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, who is a good friend of Mr. Pence and of Paul Ryan, the House speaker, and who has good relations with Congress. He is better than the other possible choice, Stephen Bannon, chairman of Breitbart News, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign chief and Pied Piper of alt-right conspiracy theorists. It\u2019s ominous that Mr. Bannon will be chief strategist and senior counselor, in an arrangement billed as \u201cequal partners,\u201d with Mr. Priebus. And while the flashier jobs have been garnering Mr. Trump\u2019s attention, who is thinking about labor or the F.C.C.? What about the critical assistant secretaries? Will Mr. Trump, a micromanager who practically bounces quarters on the beds in Trump hotels, become bogged down in r\u00e9sum\u00e9 minutiae, or entrust hiring to others? Will he shuffle and reshuffle his team, as he has his campaign staff?Reassuringly, some experts have been sighted. The Partnership for Public Service, an advocacy group for effective government that has analyzed generations of good and bad transitions, and its Center for Presidential Transition have been working with Mr. Trump\u2019s team. The transition team has hired some experienced transition leaders from the George W. Bush and Romney teams that the center recommended. The center\u2019s suggested hiring timelines even appears verbatim on Mr. Trump\u2019s transition website, GreatAgain.gov. But Mr. Trump\u2019s layering of its team with family, friends and hacks is worrying. The inclusion of lobbyists flies in the face of his \u201cDrain the Swamp\u201d refrain. The big donors on the team, like Rebekah Mercer, are also unnerving, a sign that the new government may be further in debt to superwealthy backers.A successful transition needs professionals able to challenge the boss if necessary, and separate qualified from unqualified job-seekers. As Clay Johnson III, George W. Bush\u2019s director of presidential personnel, put it at the time, \u201cThe president appoints, and I disappoint.\u201dSuch a manager could guide Mr. Trump on his rumored cabinet choices, helping him decide, for example, on a secretary of state from candidates like Mr. Gingrich, the ethically challenged former House speaker, and Zalmay Khalilzad, George W. Bush\u2019s former United Nations ambassador and a Muslim. And on whether to nominate as Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin, the Trump campaign finance director and a former Goldman Sachs executive, or Thomas Barrack Jr., chief executive of Colony Capital, a private equity and real estate investor. Such a manager could help estimate the chances that the Senate would confirm Sarah \u201cDrill, Baby, Drill\u201d Palin to lead the Department of Interior, or Joe Arpaio, departing sheriff of Maricopa County, Ariz., anti-immigration hard-liner and lawsuit magnet, as homeland security secretary.On Page 1 of the thick transition guide there\u2019s the famous quote from the 1972 film \u201cThe Candidate,\u201d in which an unprepared senator-elect turns to his campaign manager and says, \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201dAs Mr. Trump, modern history\u2019s least politically experienced president-elect, takes on one of the weightiest management jobs in the world, let\u2019s hope he is asking that question of the right people, and listening to their answers.Advertisement"}
