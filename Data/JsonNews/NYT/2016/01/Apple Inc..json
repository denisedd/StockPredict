{"Headline": "Brazil\u2019s Digital Backlash", "Date": "2016-01-12", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsBrazilians take their social media very seriously. The country has one of the fastest growing populations of Internet users in the world. Online tools like Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp are used not only to express opinions; they are an affordable alternative to exorbitantly priced Brazilian telecom providers. One recent study in Brazil found that WhatsApp was used by 93 percent of those surveyed who had Internet access.The official reason for the judge\u2019s decision to suspend WhatsApp was because its parent company, Facebook, refused to comply with requests to provide personal information and communications records to prosecutors in an investigation into organized crime and drug trafficking. This is not the first time that the Brazilian authorities have jousted with tech companies. Notwithstanding the seriousness of the crimes being investigated, the judge\u2019s action was reckless and represents a potentially longer-term threat to the freedoms of Brazilians.The ruling was not entirely out of the blue. Brazil\u2019s Congress has been considering legislation that would roll back key provisions of the country\u2019s freshly minted digital bill of rights, known as the Marco Civil da Internet, which was passed in 2014. The new proposal is expected to make it easier for prosecutors to access citizens\u2019 personal information without the nuisance of having to obtain a court order.Described by critics as \u201cthe big spy bill,\u201d it would require Brazilians to register personal details like their home address, telephone number and other private information when accessing websites. It would also expose citizens to possible charges of libel for comments made on social media. At a time when political dissent is vigorous, this bill would surely chill debate.When Brazilian legislators passed the Marco Civil, the government signaled to its citizens and the international community that it took \u201cnet neutrality\u201d and digital sovereignty seriously. It was, in effect, declaring that the democratic principles of freedom, privacy and human rights were equally applicable in cyberspace as in the physical world.Last month\u2019s judicial injunction, together with retrograde proposals like the spy bill, set a dangerous precedent. For a while, the country looked to be a progressive voice for digital freedom. No one expected Brazil to become a leader in cyber surveillance and censorship.

{"Headline": "Try to Interview Google\u2019s Co-Founder. It\u2019s Emasculating.", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Supported byI started as The New York Times\u2019s Google beat reporter in August 2014. Shortly thereafter, I told the company\u2019s public relations people that at some point I would love to interview Larry Page, the company\u2019s co-founder. I\u2019ve been waiting ever since.Mr. Page is a fascinating character who has changed the world a few times over and is worth tens of billions of dollars. But he makes little time for the press. He rarely grants interviews, and, when he does, they are usually limited to staged events like TED.Before we go any further, I want to say loud and clear that I don\u2019t think Mr. Page or any other business leader has a responsibility to talk to the press. He is a busy man and his media shyness probably should not be confused with reclusion. Mr. Page is visible at Google\u2019s Mountain View, Calif., campus and regularly talks to the company\u2019s 60,000 employees there and around the world (via videoconference), during the company\u2019s weekly T.G.I.F. gatherings.But companies are run by people, so it is extremely difficult to understand Google without understanding Mr. Page. If you can\u2019t talk to the man himself, the next best thing is to talk to people who have worked with him.As I reported the story, two things kept surfacing. The first was that a number of recently departed Googlers told me that after they gave notice, Mr. Page personally asked them to stay. They said that, during these conversations, he honestly laid out his concerns and aspirations for the company and its future.The second thing was that as I reported the profile \u2014 as well as other technology stories \u2014 I kept meeting scientists and other researchers who had bumped into Mr. Page at Google\u2019s various academic and scientific gatherings.Whenever someone asks me what I do at The Times, and I tell them I cover Google, the result is often a confused stare. \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201dNot really. Our technology group tends to work thematically, meaning that we try to focus on how tech is changing our readers\u2019 work and personal lives. Google is the main focus of my reporting, and it is a brutally competitive beat. It takes me an hour to go through the day\u2019s headlines each morning, and there are dozens of competitors and talented journalists on the tech beat. That means I\u2019m often scooped, and the scrum of daily news can make it hard to see the bigger picture.It\u2019s worth it, though. There\u2019s a strong argument that Google is now the most important company in the world. It is worth $500 billion and is neck and neck with Apple as the most valuable company by market capitalization. Six Google products have more than one billion users. I use Google to research stories, I email my editors through Gmail, and I use Google Maps to go to meetings.Google\u2019s power is unparalleled and partly explains why it and other giant technology companies have faced a bit of cultural backlash in the wake of Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who leaked documents about government spying.Google\u2019s omnipresence is such that it is often hard for me to get away from work. For example, a few weeks after Mr. Page announced the formation of Alphabet, the author Jonathan Franzen published \u201cPurity,\u201d his fifth novel. I read the book for fun, but, as often happens on the Google beat, it quickly turned into work.One of the main characters in Mr. Franzen\u2019s novel is Andreas Wolf, a hacker who has exposed secrets about the East German Stasi and the United States nuclear arsenal, but, during one fictional exchange, refused to publish leaks from two Google employees for fear that the company might use its search engine to tar Mr. Wolf\u2019s reputation.I emailed Mr. Franzen, via a publicist, to see if he might be willing to tell me what kinds of real-world concerns led to that imaginary exchange.\u201cThat paragraph came out of the distance between what the N.S.A. was collecting in terms of metadata, basically the Snowden leak, a relatively paltry amount of data compared to the rather large amounts of data we are willingly giving up \u2014 or unwillingly giving up by clicking the \u2018I accept the terms box\u2019 \u2014 to these very powerful corporations,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cAnd my feeling is, you look around at who is powerful in the world now, and, yes the U.S. government still has drones and a nuclear arsenal \u2014 it has some might \u2014 but in terms of power over people\u2019s daily lives, I think it\u2019s shifted to the private sector.\u201dLater, he added: \u201cI think it\u2019s appropriate always to resist concentration of power in the hands of too few. There is bound to come a point where that becomes dangerous.\u201dBut Mr. Page has also used his own power \u2014 through an unusual share structure, he and co-founder Sergey Brin control the company outright \u2014 to isolate himself from Wall Street\u2019s demands. In the 16 years I\u2019ve been covering business I have met countless C.E.O.s who describe their jobs in almost academic terms, using phrases like \u201cfiduciary duty\u201d to dodge questions about what kind of role their company has to society.In public comments, Mr. Page goes out of his way to say the opposite, describing Google more in terms of a nonprofit than a gigantic corporation. During a 2014 interview with Charlie Rose, he said he wished there were a vehicle for people to donate money to their company so that it could be used for projects that had some kind of social purpose.These are some of the ideas I tried to get at in the article, but of course I would love to have included an interview with the man himself. There is a popular image of reporters as a pack of pushy cold callers who will stalk anyone to get their story, and while that is true at times, I can tell you from experience that it is really awkward and emasculating to try to interview someone who doesn\u2019t want to talk. You feel like a big dork.In total, I have encountered Mr. Page three times for a total of five minutes or so. Once was at an off-the-record gathering where nothing interesting happened, and another was at a press event where he politely shook my hand before heading in another direction.The other time, I was at Google\u2019s Mountain View campus, talking to an executive, when Mr. Page rode up on his bike to say hello to his employee. I introduced myself as a New York Times reporter and he immediately pedaled away.\u201cThat went well,\u201d the executive said.It\u2019s not always the most flattering work, but I do believe it\u2019s important.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Mass Shootings, Some on Wall St. See Gold in Gun Makers", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byWhile the country reels from a series of mass shootings, each one reigniting the debate over the regulation of firearms, the hottest investments in the stock market seem to be shares of gun manufacturers.But some investors have missed out on the rally in gun stocks by choice. A number of public pension funds and other money managers have moved to sell their stakes in gun and ammunition companies in recent years, arguing that their profits come at too steep a price.Still, the business climate for gun makers has rarely been better. Firearms enthusiasts, whether they are hunters, target shooters or those concerned with their personal safety, buy more guns after mass shootings and the resulting appeals for stricter gun laws. After the call for sales restrictions after the San Bernardino attacks, more guns were sold in December than almost any other month in nearly two decades, according to federal data released this week.On Monday, Smith & Wesson alerted Wall Street analysts and investors that it believed its full-year sales would be higher than expected, above $650 million for its fiscal year, which ends in April. That is up more than 57 percent from its 2012 sales of $412 million.One of the investors\u2019 first targets was the Freedom Group (now called Remington Outdoor), a large gun maker owned by the investment firm Cerberus Capital Management. One of the guns used in the Sandy Hook shootings was a Bushmaster, a Remington Outdoor brand.More guns were sold in December than almost any other month in nearly two decades after President Obama called for new gun-buying restrictions.Likewise, Gotham Asset Management, a firm whose co-investment chief is Joel Greenblatt, a well-known New York money manager, largely sold off its position in Smith & Wesson early last year. But starting last fall, it bought more than a million shares of the company and today is one of the largest shareholders.Neither firm responded to requests for comment.A number of large shareholders in gun manufacturers are the nation\u2019s largest providers of 401(k)\u2019s, including Fidelity Investments, the Vanguard Group and BlackRock. It is unclear whether the stocks are in actively managed funds or in passive index funds, which are intended to mimic the movements of the broader markets.For Mr. Navellier, there was nothing personal driving his decision to invest in Smith & Wesson and Sturm, Ruger. His home in Nevada came with a gun range, but he uses it as a wine cellar. When he inherited some guns from his father-in-law, he gave away the ammunition to his employees and locked the guns away in a safe, he said in a phone interview on Tuesday.Instead, the decision to buy the gun shares had everything to do with profits.\u201cEverybody is so desperate for earnings. The strong dollar is crushing company earnings,\u201d Mr. Navellier said. \u201cAs a professional manager, I\u2019m looking for companies with real sales and real earnings.\u201d\u201cBut nobody,\u201d Mr. Navellier said, \u201chas told me not to buy guns.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Are Corporations Hoarding Trillions?", "Date": "2016-01-20", "News": "Supported byOn MoneyThere is an economic mystery I\u2019ve been struggling to understand for quite some time, and I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s confused: Among financial experts, it is often referred to as a conundrum, a paradox, a puzzle. The mystery is as follows: Collectively, American businesses currently have $1.9 trillion in cash, just sitting around. Not only is this state of affairs unparalleled in economic history, but we don\u2019t even have much data to compare it with, because corporations have traditionally been borrowers, not savers. The notion that a corporation would hold on to so much of its profit seems economically absurd, especially now, when it is probably earning only about 2 percent interest by parking that money in United States Treasury bonds. These companies would be better off investing in anything \u2014 a product, a service, a corporate acquisition \u2014 that would make them more than 2 cents of profit on the dollar, a razor-thin margin by corporate standards. And yet they choose to keep the cash.Take, for example, Google. Its new parent company, Alphabet, is worth roughly $500 billion. But it has around $80 billion sitting in Google\u2019s bank accounts or other short-term investments. So if you buy a share in Alphabet, which has sold for roughly $700 lately, you are effectively buying ownership of more than $100 in cash. With $80 billion, Google could buy Uber and its Indian rival Ola and still have enough left over to buy Palantir, a data-mining start-up. Or it could buy Goldman Sachs outright or American Express or most of MasterCard; it could buy Costco or eBay or a quarter of Amazon. Surely it could use those acquisitions to earn more than 2 cents on the dollar.This strange vogue for corporate hoarding seems to have begun around the turn of the millennium. General Motors is perhaps the most extreme: It now holds nearly half its value in cash. Apple holds more than a third. These numbers are maddening on their face. If the companies spent their savings, rather than hoarding them, the economy would instantly grow, and we would most likely see more jobs with better pay. In the 1990s, when companies saved far less of their profits, they built new factories, bought new buildings. In part because of all that corporate spending, the 1990s were a period of low unemployment and high growth. Remarkably, the United States government was able to tax all that productive corporate behavior so much that it came close to paying off all its debts for the first time in 160 years.So what is going on now? There are countless economic journal articles laying out theories about why corporations have shifted from borrowing to saving. Some of the reasons are prosaic. Just like people, companies might want to have money for emergencies or for lousy economic times, and the past decade has been a period of increasing risk. Also, corporations have become far more focused on something they call \u2018\u2018tax efficiency,\u2019\u2019 which the rest of us call \u2018\u2018tax avoidance\u2019\u2019: For various reasons, holding on to cash and carefully shifting it among subsidiaries, especially foreign ones, is a great tool to shrink your tax bill.Another reason to hold on to cash is a byproduct of the increasingly intense competition for talent and acquisitions, especially in technology and pharmaceuticals. When Apple or Google enter negotiations to buy a smaller company, any other firm considering a competing offer may be scared off by their nearly infinite resources. Oddly enough, then, holding on to all that cash might be saving these companies even more money, by allowing them to pay less for the firms they acquire. (Google buys about one company a week, on average; Apple\u2019s acquisitions are more sporadic, but not far behind.)But even if you accept all these reasons, we are still left with an enormous puzzle. Companies like Google and GM are holding on to far more cash \u2014 many times more \u2014 than could possibly be explained by emergency funds and tax efficiencies and M.&A. intimidation put together. Lee Pinkowitz, a professor at Georgetown, told me that finance economists agree that there is a puzzle here but break into two distinct camps over the cause. One camp believes that a large cash hoard is a sign of an unhealthy company. Maybe its whole industry is doing so poorly that there is nothing worth investing in; maybe it\u2019s because executives are up to something shady, stockpiling cash as a personal war chest to mask poor decision-making and protect their jobs (cash in the bank, suddenly deployed, can make a firm seem more profitable than it actually is). The other camp doubts that the free market could be allowing executives to hold all that cash if it were purely for their own benefit.Along with his colleague Rohan Williamson, Pinkowitz built a valuation model that analyzed how investors react to different levels of cash holding. He ran 50 years of data (originally from 1965 to 2004, but then he kindly updated his findings for me, through 2014) for 12,888 different publicly traded companies. The model shows how investors value a dollar of savings when it\u2019s held by different sorts of companies, divided into 43 industry types.His findings show that both theories have some truth to them. For several industries, hoarding cash is clearly correlated with negative results. When publishing and entertainment companies or aircraft manufacturers hold on to extra cash, investors perceive that money to be worth less than it should, somewhere in the neighborhood of 40 cents on the dollar (the authors make a specific estimate for each industry but also provide a range to account for error). The defense and coal industries are considerably worse, with a dollar in savings valued negatively. This might suggest protective behavior by chief executives in those industries, because the market is clearly not valuing their decision to save.For other industries, though, a dollar of savings is worth a lot more than itself. For pharmaceutical companies, a dollar in savings is worth $1.50. For software firms, it\u2019s even higher: more than $2. This means that investors are behaving as if they trust the executives in these industries, like Larry Page of Alphabet, to be smarter about using that money than the investors themselves could be. And a cursory scan of the industries in this second group \u2014 which also includes automakers, medical-equipment makers and others \u2014 correlates well with the ones hoarding the most cash. Corporations, it seems, may have amassed at least a good chunk of that $1.9 trillion in mysterious savings because the stock market is rewarding them for it.Which leaves one last question: Why? The answer, perhaps, is that both the executives and the investors in these industries believe that something big is coming, but \u2014 this is crucial \u2014 they\u2019re not sure what it will be. Through the 20th century, as we shifted from a horse-and-sun-powered agrarian economy to an electricity-and-motor-powered industrial economy to a silicon-based information economy, it was clear that every company had to invest in the new thing that was coming. These were big, expensive investments in buildings and machinery and computer technology. Today, though, value is created far more through new ideas and new ways of interaction. Ideas appear and spread much more quickly, and their worth is much harder to estimate. (Indeed, the impossibility of valuing the Internet is essentially what created the 2000 stock bubble.)Surely the most important economic question of our time is a fairly simple one: Are the good times over? Will wages continue to fall for many, while rising high for a few? In the cash conundrum, we might find a modest reason for optimism. If corporate leaders and their investors truly believed that the future were bleak, that innovation and economic growth were irreparably slowing, there would be little reason to hold on to all that cash. Their hoarding of it hints that they think the next transformative innovation could be just around the corner. If in fact they do \u2014 and if they\u2019re right \u2014 it\u2019s good news for all of us.Adam Davidson is a founder of NPR\u2019s \u2018\u2018Planet Money\u2019\u2019 and a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

Let\u2019s call it, Who\u2019s Losing?But don\u2019t expect it to shift much. Asking \u201cwho\u2019s losing?\u201d misses a larger truth about how thoroughly Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft now lord over all that happens in tech.Who\u2019s really losing? In the larger picture, none of them \u2014 not in comparison with the rest of the tech industry, the rest of the economy and certainly not in the influence each of them holds over our lives.But for much of the last half-decade, most of these five giants have enjoyed a remarkable reprieve from the bogeymen in the garage. And you can bet on them continuing to win. So I\u2019m coining the name the Frightful Five.Though competition between the five remains fierce \u2014 and each year, a few of them seem up and a few down \u2014 it\u2019s becoming harder to picture how any one of them, let alone two or three, may cede their growing clout in every aspect of American business and society.Indeed, the Frightful Five are so well protected against start-ups that in most situations, the rise of new companies only solidifies their lead.This gets to the core of the Frightful Five\u2019s indomitability. They have each built several enormous technologies that are central to just about everything we do with computers. In tech jargon, they own many of the world\u2019s most valuable \u201cplatforms\u201d \u2014 the basic building blocks on which every other business, even would-be competitors, depend.These platforms are inescapable; you may opt out of one or two of them, but together, they form a gilded mesh blanketing the entire economy.The Big Five\u2019s platforms span so-called old tech \u2014 Windows is still the king of desktops, Google rules web search \u2014 and new tech, with Google and Apple controlling mobile phone operating systems and the apps that run on them; Facebook and Google controlling the Internet advertising business; and Amazon, Microsoft and Google controlling the cloud infrastructure on which many start-ups run.Many of these platforms generate what economists call \u201cnetwork effects\u201d \u2014 as more people use them, they keep getting more indispensable. Why do you chat using Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp, also owned by Facebook? Because that\u2019s where everyone else is.Then there\u2019s the data buried in the platforms, also a rich source for new business. This can happen directly \u2014 for instance, Google can tap everything it learns about how we use our phones to create an artificial intelligence engine that improves our phones \u2014 and in more circuitous ways. By watching what\u2019s popular in its app store, Apple can get insight into what features to add to the iPhone.\u201cIn a way, a lot of the research and development costs are being borne by companies out of their four walls, which allows them to do better product development,\u201d Mr. Parker said.This explains why these companies\u2019 visions are so expansive. In various small and large ways, the Frightful Five are pushing into the news and entertainment industries; they\u2019re making waves in health care and finance; they\u2019re building cars, drones, robots and immersive virtual-reality worlds. Why do all this? Because their platforms \u2014 the users, the data and all the money they generate \u2014 make these far-flung realms seem within their grasp.Which isn\u2019t to say these companies can\u2019t die. Not long ago people thought IBM, Cisco Systems, Intel and Oracle were unbeatable in tech; they\u2019re all still large companies, but they\u2019re far less influential than they once were.Even with these difficulties, it\u2019s unclear if the larger dynamic may change much. Let\u2019s say that Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce company, eclipses Amazon\u2019s retail business in India \u2014 well, O.K., so then it satisfies itself with the rest of the world.So get used to these five. Based on their stock prices this month, the giants are among the top 10 most valuable American companies of any kind. Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft are the top three; Facebook is No. 7, and Amazon is No. 9. Wall Street gives each high marks for management; and three of them \u2014 Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook \u2014 are controlled by founders who don\u2019t have to bow to the whims of potential activist investors.So who\u2019s losing? Not one of them, not anytime soon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shinola Takes Its \u2018Detroit Cool\u2019 Message on the Road", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byDETROIT \u2014 \u201cWhen I first saw this neighborhood, I thought: \u2018You want to put a store here? You kidding me?\u2019\u201d said Tom Kartsotis, the Shinola founder, recalling his initial tour of Detroit\u2019s Cass Corridor, where he opened his company\u2019s flagship two and a half years ago, with a couple of colleagues. While there were signs of resurgence, he said, \u201cThis was a rough part of town.\u201dAs recently as a few years ago, when Mr. Kartsotis started his company known for its \u201cBuilt in Detroit\u201d watches, bicycles and leather goods, these blocks were on the fringe of an infamous skid row, the city was sliding toward bankruptcy, and the words \u201cluxury\u201d and \u201cDetroit\u201d were rarely paired outside the executive suites of Cadillac.But even as Shinola has become a feel-good story for a city that needed one, questions linger. Mr. Kartsotis is a moneyman from Dallas. Not one of the company\u2019s top executives is from the city. So how Detroit is Shinola? Is it \u201cDetroit\u201d enough?Despite the city\u2019s well-chronicled woes, Mr. Kartsotis came to town in what, in retrospect, seems like perfect timing. By 2012, when Shinola hired its first nine assembly workers, Detroit \u2014 select neighborhoods, at least \u2014 was already well into a striking resurgence. Downtown, elegant prewar skyscrapers that had sat hauntingly empty for years had begun to fill up with luxury apartments and hotels. Within a few years, a John Varvatos boutique would sprout on Woodward Avenue.\u201cIt\u2019s a little nutty,\u201d Mr. Kartsotis said of the Shinola concept, hunched over an oversize burger at the Bronx Bar, an old-school tavern near the Shinola flagship. \u201cI think that might be part of its charm.\u201dIn Detroit, Mr. Kartsotis gets a lot of ink \u2014 he has been cast as a savior, a carpetbagger \u2014 but you rarely hear him weigh in on the debate. The 56-year-old entrepreneur almost never speaks to the news media, and even though he stands out at 6-foot-7, with his surferish mop of gray hair, he has not posed for a press photo, he said, in 30 years. (Just try an Internet search.)Even that afternoon, dining in this blue-collar bar with the Shinola president, Jacques Panis, Mr. Kartsotis seemed to be wearing a form of camouflage: dressed in jeans, work boots and an untucked plaid shirt that looked more Walmart than Filson \u2014 a chic heritage brand he owns \u2014 he looked as if he had spent the morning hanging Sheetrock.He was explaining the Shinola mission.\u201cWe\u2019re not a watch company,\u201d Mr. Kartsotis said. \u201cI did not want to build another watch company. This company really started as a job-creation vehicle.\u201dTrue, no one on his team had any ties to Detroit. They chose the city, they said, because, well, it needed jobs, and because of its legacy as an industrial powerhouse. \u201cWhen you think manufacturing, you think Detroit,\u201d Mr. Kartsotis said. The fact that later internal research indicated that Detroit \u2014 a city that many seemed to want to throw money at \u2014 might be a potential marketing windfall certainly did not hurt.After recent openings in Miami; Dallas; and Palo Alto, Calif., Shinola has a dozen gleaming boutiques scattered around the country, along with one in London, selling American-made watches, bicycles and leather goods marketed as a blend of contemporary sleekness and a timeless Norman Rockwell sturdiness, with a heavy emphasis on its Motor City roots. (The word \u201cretro,\u201d however, is verboten around Shinola headquarters.)Shinola plans to open three more stores beginning this summer, in Dumbo, Brooklyn; the trendy Arts District in Los Angeles; and Chicago. At around 5,000 square feet apiece, the ones in Brooklyn and Los Angeles may be considered minimalls for cool kids.The marketing is built on the back story, and the back story is that origin counts. \u201cIn today\u2019s world, people want to know who\u2019s making their food, where it\u2019s coming from,\u201d Mr. Kartsotis said. Is it the same with $230 goose-feather dog beds designed with the fashion photographer Bruce Weber?Indeed, Shinola scored a hipster hat trick, unveiling a brand that married \u201cAmericana,\u201d \u201clocavore\u201d and \u201csmall batch\u201d at the height of the artisanal era. It didn\u2019t hurt that it was Detroit, a city that has defined \u201cauthentic\u201d for indie types from the days of the Stooges, who came from nearby Ann Arbor, right through to the White Stripes.As a symbol of Detroit gentrification \u2014 always a tangled issue in a town where issues of race and social class burn deep \u2014 Shinola has also taken shots.Mr. Kartsotis rolled his eyes at the suggestion that he is an economic imperialist looking to profit off Detroit chic.\u201cProfit?\u201d he asked ironically. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201dDespite Shinola\u2019s successes, including investment from the likes of Dan Gilbert, the Quicken Loans founder who is spurring considerable development downtown, it is still running in the red, Mr. Kartsotis said. That is in part because the company pays hourly workers at least $3 more than the $8.50 minimum wage and absorbs the cost of worker training itself.Even so, management is already preparing to unveil Shinola, Part II.This fall, the company will introduce an audio line of turntables, speakers and, most important, audiophile-quality headphones, rendered in leather and brushed stainless steel, which it intends to sell for $450 to $650. Its founders think those will become one of its biggest revenue drivers.\u201cWe read about Beats by Dre selling to Apple for $3 billion and we thought, \u2018Huh,\u2019\u201d Mr. Kartsotis said with a smile.Initially, the audio equipment will be manufactured in the company\u2019s midtown headquarters, although Shinola recently purchased an abandoned creamery in the same area where it plans to create a free-standing audio factory.A market that potentially is even bigger than headphones, Mr. Kartsotis said, is eyewear, which the company hopes to move into seriously by 2017. The plan is to open a Shinola eyewear plant on the South Side of Chicago, in Hyde Park. \u201cIt\u2019s every bit as hard hit as here,\u201d he said.In a few years, watches and bikes may be only a slice of the pie.\u201cWho knows what else we\u2019ll get into,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re always looking for nooks and crannies.\u201d\u201cThe beautiful thing is, when you come into this organization, you\u2019re part of the family,\u201d said Mr. Panis, who, despite his musically Gallic name, is a bearded dynamo with an athletic build and a south Virginia twang who seems more Navy SEAL than watch executive.The image of happy workers is a big part of the Shinola pitch. Mr. Panis was touring the watch-assembly floor at the Shinola headquarters, within a design college in the former General Motors Argonaut research building in midtown Detroit, wearing a shower cap and blue smock, like the assembly workers on duty.That day, Mr. Panis was slapping backs and chatting with workers, many of them from nearby neighborhoods, as they took a break from work that can require surgical precision.There can be 105 parts in the movement alone, and there are dozens of steps \u2014 many painstakingly detailed \u2014 as workers churn out up to 1,000 watches a day.Key to the marketing, certainly, are the watch case backs that read \u201cBuilt in Detroit: USA Movement with Swiss Parts.\u201d It is a matter of some debate, however, what constitutes \u201cbuilt,\u201d \u201cUSA\u201d or \u201cSwiss.\u201dOn the tour that day, Mr. Panis discussed the sourcing of the parts. The primary components of the watch (the crystal, the case, the dials, the hands) come from Asia, which he said is common among many Swiss watchmakers. About 70 percent of the movement parts come from Switzerland; the rest from Asia.Sourcing is an issue in Switzerland as well as in Detroit. Swiss regulations require that 50 percent of the value of the watch movement be of domestic origin to be considered Swiss, among other stipulations. (Under revised \u201cSwissness\u201d rules, at least 60 percent of the manufacturing costs of the whole watch will have to occur in Switzerland.)To Joe Thompson, the editor of WatchTime magazine, the question of sourcing obscures the larger point: that Shinola \u201cis a very serious effort by very accomplished watch-industry veterans to manufacture quality analog watches in large quantities in the United States.\u201d\u201cAsking a start-up to begin making its own movement components from scratch is not realistic,\u201d Mr. Thompson said. \u201cBy importing parts and assembling them here, Shinola has created jobs and is developing in-house expertise in watch-movement making that will pay off down the line.\u201dIt is not always possible to reconcile domestic production with the bottom line, Mr. Kartsotis said. For example, while its watch straps, leather goods and even the boxes for the watches are made in the United States (the boxes, from Minnesota, cost the company $18.50 apiece), buying American-made shopping bags for its flagship store would have cost $6 apiece; instead, the company opted for a $1 Chinese variant.The company reinvested the savings in part, in a facility to produce rubber watch straps in Minnesota. \u201cYou can\u2019t stay in business and buy the $6 shopping bag,\u201d Mr. Kartsotis said.One thing that is very clearly not \u201cBuilt in Detroit\u201d is Shinola\u2019s management team, a motley assemblage that Mr. Kartsotis said reminds him of \u201cthe bar scene in \u2018Star Wars.\u2019\u201dThat was evident one evening as the Texas-bred founder sipped a cocktail wearing the same flannel shirt and jeans at the London Chop House, an old-school jacket-and-tie-style steakhouse downtown.Across the table sat Bridget Russo, wearing chunky glasses and an art-curator haircut. Ms. Russo was talking about how she used to live in TriBeCa and was an executive at Edun, the fair-trade fashion brand founded by Bono and his wife, Ali Hewson, before she chucked it all for Detroit, where she just bought a house on the East Side and works as Shinola\u2019s chief marketing officer.\u201cI know it all sounds very \u2018Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,\u2019\u201d she said, referring to the Tina Fey comedy about a cult survivor, \u201cbut it\u2019s true.\u201dAbsent that night was another of Shinola\u2019s idea generators, Don Nelson \u2014 yes, that Don Nelson, the coach with the most wins in N.B.A. history. He has traveled with management from the early days as an unpaid adviser.Mr. Nelson, 75, is a close friend of Mr. Kartsotis\u2019s from Maui, where both have houses and play in a regular poker game that includes Owen Wilson, Woody Harrelson and Willie Nelson. (Before Don Nelson\u2019s final year as the Golden State Warriors coach, the 2009-10 season, he tried to hire Mr. Kartsotis as an assistant coach. \u201cI told him, \u2018You can sit behind the bench, keep stats, and I\u2019ll do all the coaching,\u2019 because you know, he didn\u2019t know anything about basketball,\u201d Mr. Nelson recalled. \u201cBut he\u2019s great with people. I said, \u2018You can keep everybody happy.\u2019\u201d)Very visibly, Shinola\u2019s management has zero tangible connection to the old Detroit of smokestacks, 5 p.m. whistles and Stroh\u2019s beers at Tiger Stadium. They are outsiders. Then again, they are, in a sense, quite representative of the new Detroit, a city where a fresh generation of professionals is tiptoeing onto unfamiliar turf, trying to will a resurgence in a city that many outside its borders had written off.Wearing a black-on-black Detroit Tigers cap pulled low over his eyes, Mr. Quirarte, 40, sat next to Mr. Kartsotis.The voluble New York restaurateur, nightclub owner and brand consultant has extensive connections in art, fashion and Hollywood, so he serves as Shinola\u2019s director of culture. \u201cHe\u2019s our cultural thermometer,\u201d Ms. Russo said.He is a true believer, too. That night, Mr. Quirarte lifted his right hand to show a small tattoo on the inside of his wrist \u2014 a lightning bolt from the Shinola logo, courtesy of Mr. Campbell, who has the same tattoo, as does their friend Justin Theroux. So does Mr. Kartsotis. So does Mr. Panis. So does Mr. Nelson (it\u2019s his only tattoo).\u201cHow would you want to hate on a company that is doing so awesome, creating jobs in America, where we really need it?\u201d Mr. Quirarte said.\u201cPeople need to get behind the fact that it\u2019s about the home team,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd we are the home team.\u201dA picture caption last Thursday with an article about Shinola misspelled the given name and the surname of a worker shown at the company\u2019s Detroit headquarters. He is Darrin Brouhard, not Darran Brossard. Another caption misidentified the leather goods shown. The picture was of dog collars produced by the factory, not belts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Looking for Signs That Apple\u2019s Runaway Growth Is Waning", "Date": "2016-01-24", "News": "Supported byAlready, some investors have begun to treat Apple in a new way: as a \u201cvalue\u201d stock, a label typically attached to companies that generate predictable business results or a reliable dividend, rather than ones that deliver runaway revenue growth. Value stocks often command much lower valuations than growth stocks.\u201cPeople were in love with Apple because hits like the iPod and iPhone created phenomenal growth,\u201d said Ernesto Ramos, a fund manager at BMO Global Asset Management, which manages $18 billion and counts Apple as its largest holding. \u201cAs investors shifted their minds around the fact that it\u2019s no longer going to deliver the same sort of huge growth over the next five years, the stock became a value play.\u201dMr. Ramos says his firm still owns Apple in some of its growth funds, but began including the stock in value funds in mid-2013.Switching from being a growth stock to being a value stock can also be a long and painful process. Growth investors need to sell a company\u2019s shares and drive down the price until it is low enough to tempt value investors, who buy stocks they think are cheap compared with the intrinsic value of the company. In the tech industry, a shift from growth to value also often signals to investors that a company is facing newer competitors with more innovative products, raising the question of how relevant the company can remain.\u201cInvestors don\u2019t like to see the words tech and value combined because when growth slows at a tech company, it usually means that something essentially is not working,\u201d said Angelo Zino, a senior analyst at the research firm S&P Capital IQ.A spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment.Any change would have repercussions beyond Apple because its soaring performance in recent years helped lift the broader market. If Apple shares were removed from the equation, the performance of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index in five of the last seven years would drop by about 1 percentage point, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices. In 2014, for instance, the index rose 13.7 percent with Apple and 12.9 percent without Apple.The Apple effect is even more pronounced when technology names are isolated. For tech stocks on the S.&P. 500 as a group, annual gain in 2009 declined by 6 percentage points when Apple shares were not included, dropping to 56 percent from 62 percent.The effect was more muted last year as Apple\u2019s growth decelerated, according to the data.Investors have turned to Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet, which owns Google \u2014 collectively referred to as the FANG stocks \u2014 for growth. Those companies are each expected to show annual revenue gains of 23 to 40 percent for the last three months of 2015, while Apple is projected to deliver 3 percent revenue growth, according to Bloomberg data.Mr. Ramos says companies like Amazon have bigger growth potential for his fund than Apple, though he plans to continue owning Apple shares. \u201cAmazon will see about 20 percent revenue growth, and earnings per share are expected to jump considerably,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a very strong growth story.\u201dApple shares have already been buffeted in recent months because of worries about the slowing economy in China, which the company counts as one of its largest markets. Half a dozen companies that provide parts for the iPhone also blamed weak demand from Apple for lower-than-expected earnings, causing worries about the company\u2019s sales trajectory.\u201cIf you wanted to outperform the market, the FANG stocks did better,\u201d said Jonathan Krinsky, an analyst at MKM Partners, though he added that Apple remained a must-watch stock because it composed such a large part of many stock indexes.Investors may still someday reanoint Apple as a growth stock, especially if the company can create a best-selling new product that drives up its sales rate. Wall Street analysts cite Microsoft as an example of a business that lost steam and then made the adjustments necessary to deliver strong revenue growth again.Apple has been reclassified as a value stock before. FTSE Russell, which makes several closely followed stock indexes, found in 2013 that Apple no longer met its criteria to be treated purely as a growth stock. Some of the company\u2019s enormous market capitalization was reallocated to the Russell Value Index, as well as being in the Russell Growth Index. A year later, when the company\u2019s sales had risen strongly with the introduction of the iPhone 6, FTSE Russell placed Apple solely back in the growth index.Tom Goodwin, FTSE Russell\u2019s senior research director, said that stock price, sales growth and analyst expectations determine whether a company is placed in the growth or value index, or in both. About a third of the stocks that Russell tracks are included in both indexes, he said.But until Apple reveals another hit or shows a significant pickup in iPhone sales growth, Apple should be viewed as a value-oriented name, Mr. Zino said.\u201cHistorically Apple was the name to own if you wanted to outperform the market,\u201d he said. \u201cNow there are other places to look.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Alphabet Close to Overtaking Apple as Most Valuable Company", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsAlphabet could soon become the most valuable company in the world.The Google powerhouse traded on Friday morning with an equity value above $500 billion, less than 10 percent shy of Apple\u2019s value. Investors value the search firm\u2019s earnings from rapidly growing digital advertising more than twice as highly as Apple\u2019s in a saturating smartphone market. Wall Street, however, may be overlooking Alphabet\u2019s risks.Global smartphone sales growth slowed to 10 percent last year, according to the consulting firm IDC. Reports of cutbacks at Apple suppliers suggest tepid demand for its latest phones. Analysts fear that the company may struggle this year to match the 230 million or so iPhones sold in the last fiscal year to September.An oversupplied market could bring price wars, which could hurt margins \u2014 and the iPhone accounts for about 60 percent of Apple\u2019s revenue and a bigger chunk of its profit. As a result, investors expect little growth in the company\u2019s top line this year and are paying only about 10 times estimated 2016 earnings for the stock.The mobile digital advertising market, meanwhile, should almost triple to nearly $200 billion globally by 2019, consultants at eMarketer reckon. Alphabet\u2019s sales are forecast to grow about 15 percent this year. This wind at Alphabet\u2019s back and the possibility that its self-driving cars, robots or medical endeavors will pay off help explain why it commands a price-to-earnings multiple above 20.A subpar earnings report from Apple next week, or a strong one from Alphabet the week after, could bring a new name to the top of the world\u2019s most valuable companies list.Investors are, however, prone to overconfidence in technology trends. Facebook is snagging more and more ad dollars. European antitrust authorities are circling. Moreover, some of Alphabet\u2019s revenue comes courtesy of iPhone users: it cost Google $1 billion in 2014 to keep its search bar on the Apple device, Bloomberg reports based on transcripts of a court case.Alphabet is far more reliant on Internet advertising than Apple is on the iPhone. Ads bring in about 90 percent of the company\u2019s revenue. Any hint of investor skepticism about that market could keep Apple at the top of the list.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Farhad and Mike\u2019s Week in Tech: Lessons From Earnings Season", "Date": "2016-01-30", "News": "Supported byAnyway, before I start checking out Craigslist housing ads in Nevada, let\u2019s go over the tech news of the week, which was dominated by several huge earnings reports. I\u2019ve got to say, I love earnings season. It\u2019s the one time we get a peek at some of the actual numbers that are often hidden in the murk of Silicon Valley puffery. And this week brought some big reversals.I wonder if we\u2019re witnessing what could be a long-term shift in Wall Street\u2019s attitude toward Jeff Bezos\u2019s shopping engine. For two decades, investors have been willing to let Bezos reinvest every penny Amazon makes into building out a bigger and bigger company. But last year, Amazon started to show investors some skimpy profits \u2014 which are, like, the actual point of running a business \u2014 and to everyone\u2019s surprise, people on Wall Street seemed to like the money, and now they seem to keep wanting more.So it will be interesting to watch Amazon\u2019s fortunes over the next year. Will investors continue to punish it for favoring growth over profits? And if they do, will Jeff Bezos care?But you covered the earnings, so I\u2019ll let you take it away.No one was ready for it, as we spent years just building out advertising for larger screens. Entire companies were destroyed. There were ripple effects in adjacent companies that were deeply connected to Facebook. (Go look at Zynga before and after its I.P.O.) It was a total mess.Facebook went heads down and figured out how to create ads that aren\u2019t terrible and conform to a screen the size of a smartphone. And lo and behold, the company did it in an amazingly fast amount of time. In 2012, Facebook\u2019s mobile advertising revenues represented roughly 20 percent of the company\u2019s overall ad revenue. As of last quarter, that number has quadrupled to 80 percent. It\u2019s astounding how fast it was able to do it.That\u2019s why I always try to keep people\u2019s expectations of me incredibly low. That way when I do something cool, everyone practically gives a party.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apps to Manage Passwords So They Are Harder to Crack Than \u2018Password\u2019", "Date": "2016-01-20", "News": "Supported byTech FixIT became official again this week: We are awful at passwords.Year after year, studies show that many people still rely on passwords that are so weak that even a 5-year-old could crack them. According to a study released this week by SplashData, a developer of password management software, consumers continue making the riskiest choices with passwords by consistently using overly simple ones.Now for a confession: I am no better than the rest of you. The password management app Dashlane recently ran a security audit of all my passwords \u2014 and what it found was ugly. It revealed that out of my 70 passwords, I had reused the same one 46 times. Twenty-five of the passwords were flagged as being particularly weak, or easy for a hacker to crack.In my shame and embarrassment, I put together a guide of best practices for passwords and tested some tools that would help manage them. Here\u2019s what it boils down to: To have the safest passwords protecting your digital life, each password should be unique and complex. But since memorizing 70 unique and complex passwords is nearly impossible, we also need password manager programs to keep track of them all.Jeremiah Grossman, the founder of WhiteHat Security, a web security firm, says he memorizes only a few passwords, including one to unlock his computer, and another to unlock an encrypted USB drive containing a file with a list of all his passwords for dozens of services. None of his passwords are memorable because they are random.\u201cI select them quite literally by banging on the keyboard a few times like a monkey,\u201d Mr. Grossman said in an interview, adding, \u201cMy setup is a bit more paranoid than the average person.\u201dTo put the password managers to the test, I began by cleaning up my password hygiene. I spent two and a half hours logging in to all 70 of my Internet accounts and changing each password, one at a time. Following the advice of security experts, I created long, complex passwords consisting of nonsensical phrases, lines from movies or one-sentence summaries of strange life events, and added numbers and special characters. (Samples: My favorite number is Green4782# or The cat ate the CoTTon candy 224%.)Then I turned to the password managers, which store your passwords and make them accessible with a master password. Naturally, your master password should be rock solid. So for each of the three apps, I created a complex master password and jotted those down on a piece of paper. After a few days I memorized those passwords and threw away the paper.I recommend 1Password for several reasons. The app consistently and automatically detected whenever I logged in to websites or created new passwords to ask if I wanted to add a password to the vault.When logging in to a site, I clicked on the 1Password icon in a computer browser or opened the app on a phone, entered my master password and selected the service I wanted to log in to in order to plug in the password. (1Password can be set up to require the master password after a certain amount of time, say five minutes, if you don\u2019t want to keep entering it; on iPhones it can be configured to unlock the vault with your fingerprint instead of the master password.)Dashlane said the app was proactive about notifications partly because it was designed for users who may not be technically savvy.\u201cWith password management becoming something that mainstream consumers care about, the simplicity of the product needs to be completely different,\u201d Emmanuel Schalit, Dashlane\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview. \u201cWe tried to build a solution that a not sophisticated user could use.\u201dThe third app, LastPass, was less annoying than Dashlane, but in multiple instances it did not detect when I was logging in to a website to add the password into its vault. That required me to manually create a new password entry to add to the vault.Each of the apps offers the ability to share password vaults across multiple devices, like smartphones, tablets and computers. Wireless synchronization for passwords is a necessity: You don\u2019t want to be locked out of a service on your smartphone because you left your laptop containing all your passwords at work, for instance.What distinguishes the password management apps is how they share your passwords among different devices, and how much they charge. Dashlane is initially free and hosts its own cloud server to share passwords across your devices, but it costs $40 a year to use the cloud service. LastPass is also free up front; it offers the ability to share passwords across devices for $12 a year.The app 1Password came out on top because it offered the most value for the money. For a one-time payment of $50, you get a license to use 1Password on a computer. You can use the core features of 1Password on iPhones or Android devices free \u2014 if you want to unlock extra features, like the ability to store serial numbers for software licenses, it costs $10.\u201cWe\u2019ve been very popular among security professionals and I.T. folks,\u201d said Amber Gott, a marketing manager for LastPass.To avoid that, you may want to skip password managers. If that\u2019s your preference, Mr. Grossman said there\u2019s always a low-tech way to keep track of passwords: Jot them down on a piece of paper and keep the list in a safe place. The best part about that approach? It\u2019s free.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "App Makers Reach Out to the Teenager on Mobile", "Date": "2016-01-01", "News": "Supported byOver the past decade, advertisers have spent untold millions trying to turn Talia Kocar and her peers in the millennial generation into loyal customers. But on a recent afternoon in Santa Monica, Calif., in a kind of consumer torch-passing, Ms. Kocar, 25, watched a focus group of teenagers drink free Snapple and suck Doritos powder off their thumbs while answering questions about their smartphones.Ms. Kocar works on Wishbone, a social networking application full of breezy polls about pop culture, prom dresses and other fixtures of teenage life. Users \u2014 most of them girls \u2014 post side-by-side pictures that compare rappers (Lil Wayne or Tyga?), celebrities (Kim Kardashian or Beyonc\u00e9?) and the like.Like most social media apps, Wishbone users achieve status by amassing friends who vote with a thumb tap. There is a bonus, however, which is that twice a day, Ms. Kocar and her team send a \u201cDaily Dozen\u201d of the best and most popular polls to every Wishbone user. This is somewhat like being named \u201cfunniest\u201d or \u201cmost clever\u201d in a yearbook: Featured polls are guaranteed a lot of votes, and votes, similar to likes on Facebook, are the coin of Wishbone\u2019s realm.Ms. Kocar said her first attempts at market research began with trips to Starbucks stores and nail salons, where she would find Wishbone users and ask them what they did and did not like about the app. She got lots of information, but wanted more. Hence, the focus group.Teenagers being teenagers, the room was full of angst and contradictions. They love Instagram, the photo-sharing app, but are terrified their posts will be ignored or mocked. They feel less pressure on Snapchat, the disappearing-message service, but say Snapchat can be annoying because disappearing messages make it hard to follow a continuing conversation. They do not like advertisements but also do not like to pay for things.At one point a questioner asked the group when they were least likely to be online. \u201cWhen I\u2019m in the shower,\u201d a girl responded.Those numbers have created a growing advertising market and fortunes for apps like Snapchat and Instagram, which is owned by Facebook. This year companies are projected to spend $30 billion on in-app advertising in the United States, roughly double what they spent in 2014, according to eMarketer, a research company.But even though these services all have the same core functions \u2014 find friends, post pictures, send messages \u2014 teenagers juggle them constantly, developing arcane customs for what to post where and ditching one app for another the moment it becomes uncool.That churn leaves an opening for upstarts like Wishbone, which is about a year old and already has about three million monthly users. Since July it has ranked among the top 30 most-downloaded social media apps in Apple\u2019s App Store, according to App Annie, a data and analytics company. But staying there will be tough. Mobile apps are a hit or miss business in which a handful of top players get most of the users and money.Hoping to get their app in that elite few, people like Ms. Kocar pore through data and turn to focus groups for insight on how to get new users to sign up and old users to stay. Their efforts are a window into how teenage lives are documented on mobile screens.\u201cThey have immediate social validation or lack of validation at the touch of a button,\u201d said Michael Jones, chief executive of Science Inc., which owns Wishbone. \u201cSo if you thought that the immediate gratification generation was two generations ago, you haven\u2019t even seen what immediate gratification looks like until you start spending time with, like, a teen on a phone.\u201dOne hot afternoon last summer, Leila Khan and Lucy Nemerov, two eighth graders from Palo Alto, Calif., cruised their local mall, scoring free samples at See\u2019s Candies and dropping into Brandy Melville to look at clothes, but not buy. Lucy is an avid Wishbone user, but the app is just one among several that she and her friends rotate through each day.To manage their identities in and obligations to this world in their pockets, they adhere to rules that have somehow been absorbed and adopted by their peers. For instance, that afternoon, since nothing particularly special happened, Lucy posted a few videos to Snapchat \u2014 including a clip of me interviewing her \u2014 but nothing on Instagram.Why the distinction? Because Instagram is special, Leila explained. On Snapchat, where messages disappear, you can be less selective because there is a lower bar for quality. On Instagram, you have to be careful not to clog your friends\u2019 feeds with a barrage of low-quality pictures that might annoy them.They also regularly delete their Instagram photos so that their profiles never have more than a handful at a time. For comparison, I\u2019m a medium-level Instagram user and have several hundred. They reacted to this information as if it were the smell of warm garbage.\u201cI have zero right now,\u201d Lucy said.\u201cYeah, \u2019cause I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh wait, I look stupid in this one,\u2019 \u201d Leila said.App makers fear this kind of juggling the way TV networks fear DVRs. Each time someone leaves one app for another, there is a chance that user will never come back. And since apps make money only when users are plugged in and absorbing ads, the number of monthly users is less important than how many users they get each day \u2014 and how long they stay.Social media apps and messaging services \u2014 Wishbone included \u2014 tend to get an outsize portion of their ad revenue from a handful of mobile game makers and other app download ads. But Wishbone is making the not-terribly-crazy bet that as people spend more time with their phones and advertisers become comfortable with the medium, more brands and money will follow.For now big advertisers remain focused on the millennial generation, who, at about 18 to 35 years old, are old enough to buy cars, homes and other big-ticket items. But an early wave is starting to think about the next group, said Erna Alfred Liousas, an analyst at Forrester Research, who said the firm had a number of financial services and media companies ask for studies on the under-17 group.As with coffee and newspapers, the key to a successful app is to make it a daily habit. Which is why in early September, Mr. Jones of Science sat in a cinder block room staring at a computer screen full of data. He was with Benoit Vatere, head of Science\u2019s mobile group, and Peter Pham, the company\u2019s chief business officer, discussing the best time to send push notifications alerting Wishbone users to new polls.Push notifications \u2014 those incessant reminders that make your phone light up and ding \u2014 are the infantry of app warfare, cracking the attention span to remind users that someone on the Internet might be talking about them. All summer Wishbone had been sending out alerts four times a day, but the three men were thinking about adding more and, now that students were back in class, trying to recalibrate around the school day.\u201cCan we have a friends feed at noon?\u201d Mr. Jones asked Mr. Vatere. \u201cIt would be great to do \u2018Your friends have updated.\u2019 \u201d\u201cAnd you talk about it while you\u2019re at school,\u201d Mr. Pham added.Every generation has its thing, and the last two have been marked by digital technology. One of the big dividing lines between Generation X and millennials was that millennials grew up with the Internet. A big difference between millennials and the next group \u2014 the postmillennials \u2014 has been smartphones.\u201cThere\u2019s a whole new curriculum being pushed by Gen X parents and one thing it emphasizes above all is emotional intelligence and being very sensitive to the needs of others,\u201d Mr. Howe said.In surveys, his consulting company, LifeCourse Associates, has found that teenagers are extremely anxious about being criticized on social media and are more conscious than their parents of when an app makes them feel bad \u2014 or at least aren\u2019t bashful about saying so.During the recent focus group at Science, one girl said she showed Instagram ideas to at least three people before posting. Another said she deleted any post that did not garner enough likes. \u201cI post and I just delete, because I don\u2019t want to have, like, never mind,\u201d she said, too ashamed to announce the precise number of likes out loud.Wishbone sees those anxieties as an opportunity. The app doesn\u2019t ask users to take pictures in which they look \u201csooo beautiful!!!!,\u201d nor does it require having parents who vacation in Instagram-perfect locales. Users just make funny polls to talk about celebrities, makeup and bands. It is about your tastes, not your identity.Rajada Victor, a 14-year-old ninth grader who lives in Los Angeles, was seated near the girl who was ashamed of her paltry likes. In a follow-up interview, she said she had grown exhausted by the frenzy for online status but was a regular on Wishbone, which she checks all the time: in class, while walking to school, on weekends.\u201cI like the fact that you don\u2019t have to look a certain type of way to post,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t comment rudely or anything \u2014 you\u2019re just comparing stuff.\u201dMr. Vatere can see this in the data: Wishbone users frequently describe themselves by their interests \u2014 they might like Taylor Swift, for instance \u2014 but rarely post personal photos. The app also employs an \u201ceveryone gets a trophy\u201d philosophy by having Ms. Kocar and her editorial team choose many different polls, not just the most popular ones, for the coveted Daily Dozen of posts that all Wishbone users vote on.\u201cYou want to create an environment where it doesn\u2019t feel like only 1 percent of the people win,\u201d said Eric Kuhn, Science\u2019s head of product. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve heard that with other platforms, like as soon as you\u2019re clearly not in that top 1 percent, you don\u2019t want to use the app anymore.\u201dMr. Jones, a 40-year-old Gen Xer, has tracked youth culture since the grunge \u201990s, when he started a magazine called Elixir as a University of Oregon sophomore. This was back when teenagers went to bookstores in search of small-circulation \u201czines.\u201dHe spent the next two decades tracking the migration of media to the web, to social platforms to mobile phones. Elixir became a website and, as Mr. Jones got more interested in the web than publishing, he started a software company called Userplane that was bought by AOL.Later Mr. Jones was the chief executive of MySpace, where his job was to try to blunt the ascendance of a new competitor called Facebook. This did not go well.He founded Science four years ago with Mr. Pham. He calls it a \u201cstart-up studio\u201d that helps entrepreneurs turn their ideas into businesses. Wishbone is part of Science\u2019s mobile group \u2014 which includes several other apps \u2014 but Mr. Jones is so enamored with social media that he decided to run the group and Wishbone himself. The Science offices are just a few blocks from the beach in Santa Monica and have requisite start-up touches like exposed ceilings, copious whiteboards and employees who toil quietly while wearing Beats headphones.Science has raised about $40 million in venture capital, most of it from Hearst Ventures. After the MySpace debacle, Mr. Jones said he initially steered clear of social media and focused on building online commerce businesses such as Dollar Shave Club, a razor subscription service, and DogVacay, a dog-boarding version of Airbnb, the online home-rental service.\u201cComing out of MySpace I was like, ahhh, this is so hard \u2014 social ads is tough,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s just take a pause.\u201dAs social media moved to mobile phones, Mr. Jones figured there would be a chance to get back in. Wishbone came out of a few facts and a hunch. The facts are that people spend several hours a day on their phones, and that teenagers favor apps in which everyone gets to create content and be part of the show.The hunch was that a polling app would do well. Mr. Jones knew from his AOL days that polling was among the most addictive of online features. And since successful mobile apps reward repetitive behavior, he figured polling would translate well to smartphones.If Wishbone were almost anything besides an app, three million users would be a huge success. But apps are a brutal business, where a few gigantic hits like Facebook and YouTube make most of the money. American smartphone owners use about 27 apps per month, but spend about 80 percent of their time in five, according to a recent study by Activate, a consulting firm.Wishbone is a long way from that top tier, which is why employees show up to meetings with laptops full of statistics about what teenagers are doing. And it is why they spend time running focus groups.Right around Thanksgiving, Mr. Jones, Mr. Pham and Mr. Vatere started rethinking their strategy for sending out push notifications. All through the summer and fall they had been limiting the number of daily alerts on the assumption that, like them, Wishbone users would be annoyed if they were interrupted by too many pings and dings. And, as one might expect when three fathers make an assumption about teenage girls, they could not have been more wrong.\u201cWe talked to them and they\u2019d be like, \u2018Why am I not getting notified when people vote on my stuff?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Jones said. \u201cAnd we\u2019d be like, \u2018Well, we wouldn\u2019t want to do that \u2019cause we might send you, like, 50 notifications that you got 50 of your friends to vote on your card.\u2019 They\u2019re like, \u2018But that\u2019s what I want.\u2019 \u201d\u201cIn fact,\u201d Mr. Jones said, \u201cthey would even kind of subtly infer that if they didn\u2019t get at least 50, it was kind of like a bad day.\u201dThe same way Gen X measured its worth in answering machine messages, the mobile-minded teenager sees each like and mention as reassurance of an active social life. And when your phone is the default security blanket for enduring the awkwardness of walking a high school hallway, it feels nice to have a bunch of digital hellos ready with a swipe.So just before Thanksgiving weekend, Wishbone opened the fire hose, sending out notifications for everything \u2014 every vote, every mention, everything that has to do with a user on the app. A week later they found several key metrics, like voting, had almost doubled.Those in the Wishbone focus group said they loved getting notifications but acknowledged getting lost in their phones. One girl said that it had come to the point that the only way she could finish her homework was to put her phone in another room.\u201cSometimes it\u2019s fun \u2019cause it\u2019s like people are thinking about you and are like, \u2018I want to show this to Jada,\u2019 \u201d said Rajada Victor, the ninth grader in Los Angeles, who goes by Jada. But, she also said, she tries not to become caught up in worrying about social media.\u201cI\u2019m focusing on my grades and all that stuff,\u201d she said.And that\u2019s the thing about teenagers: They grow up.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fidelity Switches to Visa for Credit Card Branding", "Date": "2016-01-04", "News": "Supported byBut even as other credit card issuers have cut back rewards, Fidelity\u2019s cardholders need not fear: The generous rewards system will remain intact. Instead, Fidelity is ending a 12-year partnership with American Express, and will offer Visa-branded cards through U.S. Bank.The company said it believed that the new Fidelity Rewards Visa Signature card would be attractive to a wider group of people, including the coveted millennial generation, generally viewed as people born from about 1980 through the \u201990s. Visa cards are more broadly accepted by merchants than American Express cards, which was one of the big drivers behind the change.\u201cWe think usage of the card will go up, which will help build customer relationships,\u201d said Ram Subramaniam, president of Fidelity\u2019s retail brokerage business. \u201cIt\u2019s a key value add-on to what we bring to the customer.\u201dFew credit card issuers manage to sustain generous rewards programs because it is hard to make them profitable; their costs are not always covered by the fees merchants pay. Fidelity\u2019s current rewards program has paid out more than $1 billion in rewards since 2003, when it was first introduced. Fidelity has acknowledged that in the past it paid for some of the rewards. But executives declined to say whether this new partnership would improve the card\u2019s profitability.Visa was accepted at 9.5 million locations at the end of 2014, according to The Nilson Report, a newsletter that tracks the credit card industry. That compares with the 6.9 million merchants that accept American Express. Fidelity Investment Rewards American Express has about 550,000 cardholders, representing about 2 percent of Fidelity\u2019s 24 million customers. They will be issued new Fidelity Rewards Visa Signature cards by July. Until then, consumers can continue using the American Express cards. U.S. Bank will acquire the existing $1.7 billion portfolio of outstanding balances.In addition to returning 2 percent on all purchases, the new card does not charge an annual fee. The new card will continue the policy of not putting caps on rewards or limits on spending. The Fidelity Visa card also does not require cardholders to spend in certain categories, like restaurants or gas.Cardholders can also opt to redeem their points for other rewards, like statement credits, merchandise, gift cards or travel, but the exchange rate means this is not as lucrative as getting cash back.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Shifts Online Strategy on ISIS", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration on Friday announced an overhaul of its efforts to respond to online propaganda from the Islamic State after months of acknowledgments that it had largely failed in its attempts to counter extremist recruitment and exhortations to violence on social media.The administration has emphasized that it needs the assistance of some of the nation\u2019s biggest technology companies, and a group of top White House and national security officials flew to California on Friday to plead their case with executives. In a reflection of just how urgent the White House considers the efforts, the discussions involved officials like Denis R. McDonough, the White House chief of staff; Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch; James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence; James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director; and Lisa Monaco, the president\u2019s counterterrorism adviser. They met with Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, as well as top executives from Facebook, Twitter and Google. \u201cGiven the way the technology works these days, there surely are ways that we can disrupt paths to radicalization, to identify recruitment patterns and to provide metrics that allow us to measure the success of our counter-radicalization efforts,\u201d Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said before the meeting began in California.A task force will be created in the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department to coordinate the government\u2019s new effort. The State Department announced the creation of a center to respond to disinformation from extremist groups by highlighting their misdeeds and creating positive images of the West. It hopes to cultivate a global network of governments and nongovernmental organizations to help the effort. After the terrorist attack last year that killed 130 people in Paris, President Obama delivered a series of speeches seeking to reassure the country while demanding rapid changes within the administration to improve responses to jihadist propaganda. But the State Department has largely foundered in its efforts to fashion the kind of war room that would effectively counter the propaganda flowing out of the Islamic State, which is widely seen as adept at using social media to recruit and inspire followers.For help with these challenges, the administration turned on Friday to Silicon Valley. \u201cI do have a lot of confidence that those companies that are run by patriotic Americans are not interested in seeing their tools or their technology used by terrorists to harm innocent Americans,\u201d Mr. Earnest said.Those executives, however, are in charge of global corporations whose revenues are increasingly derived from people outside the United States. The executives have long pushed back on demands by governments to censor posts, provide access to user accounts, or hand over the keys to encryption technologies. If the companies begin to work with the government to monitor and remove posts or create antiterrorism counternarratives, they might have a harder time resisting similar requests from foreign governments.\u201cIt\u2019s a slippery slope with free speech where if you start making exceptions, where do you stop and where do you draw the line?\u201d said Emma Llanso, a director at the Center for Democracy in Technology, a think tank. She said the consequence could be an erosion of trust by consumers. That erosion of trust began in the wake of revelations from Edward J. Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor, who showed previous coordination among some technology companies with American surveillance efforts. Executives are eager to avoid a repeat.There is also the technological challenge of sifting through vast amounts of user-generated content in different languages on a growing number of platforms.Law enforcement officials for years have expressed frustration that technology companies are increasingly creating products like smartphones with encryption technologies that make it difficult, if not impossible, for the government to monitor conversations. But the discussion on Friday, while touching on encryption issues, was expected to focus largely on how social media companies could more effectively police their platforms. Some former top administration officials now work at prominent technology firms, including Jay Carney, a former White House press secretary, who is now a senior vice president at Amazon. Megan Smith, the administration\u2019s chief technology officer, who worked at Google, and Alexander Macgillivray, the administration\u2019s deputy chief technology officer, who worked at Twitter, both attended the meeting on Friday in California.\u201cThis meeting is the latest in the administration\u2019s continuing dialogue with technology providers and others to ensure we are bringing our best private and public sector thinking to combating terrorism,\u201d said Melanie R. Newman, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "At CES, Netflix Adds Over 130 Countries to Streaming Service", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byNetflix went live with its streaming television service in nearly every country across the world on Wednesday, an unexpected acceleration of the company\u2019s aggressive quest for global ubiquity by the end of 2016.Yet one major region on Netflix\u2019s world map remains dark: China, home to nearly a quarter of the world\u2019s broadband households. And in many of the 190 countries where Netflix now is available \u2014 including Turkey, Russia and Poland \u2014 the service is available in English, but not the local language.\u201cWe still have a lot of work to do,\u201d Reed Hastings, chief executive of Netflix, said in a telephone interview Wednesday afternoon. \u201cBecause of the number of countries, it seems like we are ahead of plan. But we still have China \u2014 we still have a quarter of the world to go.\u201d\u201cRight now, you are witnessing the birth of a global TV network,\u201d Mr. Hastings said from the stage in a keynote address. A montage of global flags scrolled in the background followed by a map of the world emblazoned with the hashtag #netflixeverywhere.\u201cWhether you are in Sydney or St. Petersburg, Singapore or Seoul, Santiago or Saskatoon, you now can be part of the Internet TV revolution,\u201d Mr. Hastings added.The proclamation was a bold move from Netflix to address growing skepticism about whether it can sustain its breakneck expansion and deliver on its promises.Costs are running high for Netflix. In addition to its global rollout, the company plans to spend more than $6 billion in cash on programming in 2016, offering more than 600 hours of original series, films and other content. And after running roughly at break-even profitability through this year, Netflix has pledged to deliver material global profits starting in 2017.International expansion is increasingly crucial for the company as growth slows in the United States. The opportunity is big. While the United States has about 100 million broadband households, according to SNL Kagan, that is just a fraction of the 730 million total global broadband households.Yet there are steep challenges, including whether Netflix will be able to land programming rights to series that appeal to customers around the globe and compete with local streaming rivals.\u201cInternational is really the place where people have a bigger sense of debate,\u201d said Michael Nathanson, a media analyst with MoffettNathanson Research. \u201cIt has never been attempted before.\u201dMr. Hastings said that Netflix was now in about 70 million homes and he expected the number of customers outside the United States to surpass the number domestically at some point in 2017. Netflix\u2019s long-term goal is to reach 60 million to 90 million subscribers in the United States, but has yet to set a similar target internationally.Around the globe, Netflix will be available for one monthly price \u2014 in India that is 500 rupees, or about $7.50 \u2014 and global subscribers will be able to watch Netflix original series as well as a library of licensed television shows and movies. Netflix said that in 2016 it planned to release 31 new and returning original series, 24 films and documentaries, 30 original children series and stand-up comedy specials. They will become available to all subscribers at the same time around the world.Netflix also announced that it was including Arabic, Korean and simplified and traditional Chinese to the 17 languages already available.The service will not be available in Crimea, North Korea and Syria because of United States government restrictions on American companies.China remains the major unanswered question, analysts said. \u201cThat is the big wild card that Netflix and investors are waiting for,\u201d said William V. Power, analyst at Baird Equity Research. \u201cThe questions are: Just how do you tackle that market with the various governmental or regulatory obstacles? Can they go it alone or do they partner with somebody?\u201dMr. Hastings said that Netflix continued to explore its options in China but that establishing a service there could take many months or even some years. \u201cWe are building relationships and trying to be very patient,\u201d Mr. Hastings said. \u201cThe strategy is to think very long term, to be like Disney, Apple or Starbucks in China.\u201dWall Street is watching Netflix\u2019s moves carefully. The company\u2019s share price surged 135 percent in 2015, making it the top performer on the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. But some analysts question whether the company can maintain the momentum. On Monday, Netflix shares dropped after an analyst downgraded the company\u2019s stock, citing concerns over weaker-than-expected subscriber growth in the United States.Mr. Power, the analyst at Baird who downgraded the stock, outlined other risks, including escalating content costs, international expansion and rising competition from Amazon, Hulu and YouTube.\u201cGiven Netflix\u2019s high valuation, any missteps could prompt outsize movement in the stock,\u201d Mr. Power said.On Wednesday, Netflix shares increased about 9 percent.Advertisement"}

Uber is perhaps the seminal harbinger of that change; take one well-entrenched industry (taxi and livery service) with a corner on the market and no need for innovation. Add one start-up with a clever, convenient approach and a willingness to flout laws. Pour millions of dollars on idea. Repeat.So while things like food delivery or on-demand office cleaning or whatever are certainly not as world-changing and attractive as robot monkey butlers, it is pretty much par for what Silicon Valley stands for: the destruction of the old in the name of efficiency and expediency.And that, my basic friend, is what is interesting to me: those being marginalized while the death and rebirth of new industries are widely celebrated by a handful of people in a small enclave of California. (I also like the technologies themselves, some of the time, at least.)But I am curious as to what would not bore you right now. What sort of start-ups are you looking for? What more do you want than on-demand booze and cookies?What I do think is pretty basic right now is the start-up financing scene. A year ago, the market looked crazy. Venture capitalists were funding anything that moved, and unicorns were everywhere. Then, in the fall, a gloom fell over the market, and it seemed we were headed for some kind of bust.That is to say, there will certainly be spectacular flameouts to come.

{"Headline": "Apple Says Sales of iPhones Have Slowed", "Date": "2016-01-26", "News": "Supported byTimothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief, said the company was experiencing \u201cextreme conditions.\u201dThe results and guidance reflect how Apple, under its chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, is grappling with becoming a maturing tech company and is now entering a period of slow growth. While Apple once delivered high double-digit revenue gains on the back of soaring sales of the iPhone and other devices, that has decelerated as the iPhone has begun saturating the market and the company has not introduced a new blockbuster device.In a conference call with analysts on Tuesday, Mr. Cook said that the slowdown at Apple was indicative of greater global economic and financial market uncertainty.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing extreme conditions, unlike anything we\u2019ve experienced before, just about everywhere we look,\u201d Mr. Cook said, calling the global macroeconomic environment \u201cchallenging.\u201dShares of Apple, which are down more than 11 percent over the last year, fell 2.6 percent in after-hours trading after the results were announced.For the quarter that ended Dec. 26, Apple said it sold 74.8 million iPhones, essentially flat from the 74.5 million sold a year ago. In total, revenue was $75.9 billion, up 1.7 percent from a year ago, and lower than Wall Street forecasts of $76.6 billion. Net profit was $18.4 billion, up from $18 billion a year earlier.For the current quarter, which ends in March, Apple projected revenue of $50 billion to $53 billion. That would be down from $58 billion from a year earlier and lower than the $55.4 billion forecast by Wall Street, according to S&P Capital IQ.\u201cThere will be some speed bumps ahead until we get to the iPhone 7 mega-product cycle later this year,\u201d said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets.Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said in an interview that the results were affected by the strengthening United States dollar.\u201cIn the December quarter alone, the foreign exchange impact was $5 billion to our revenue line,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you take $100 of the business that we did outside of the U.S. in September 2014, when we launched the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, the same level of business today translates to only $85.\u201dOther growth areas that Apple has relied upon are also starting to experience a slowdown. Sales in the greater China region, which includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, rose 14 percent in the quarter from a year ago \u2014 yet annual revenue growth from the region has hovered at around 70 percent or more in the last four quarters.The company did see growth in services, where revenue rose 26 percent, while revenue from a category known as other products \u2014 which include the Apple Watch \u2014 increased 62 percent.Mr. Maestri said that Apple would continue to raise money in debt markets in the United States and abroad to continue to return money to investors in the form of dividends and stock buybacks. Because Apple houses the majority of its $216 billion in cash overseas, it has borrowed money over the last three years to pay out more than $9 billion to investors.As Apple matures, Mr. Maestri said, the company could also become a business that delivers steady financial advances through its huge installed base of one billion active devices currently used by consumers. He pointed in particular to the potential of the services business, which includes the iTunes Store, the App Store and Apple Music.\u201cThe market has not fully understood that we have a portion of our business directly tied to our incredible installed base that\u2019s not driven by quarterly results,\u201d Mr. Maestri said.Mr. Cook echoed that sentiment. \u201cEspecially during periods of economic uncertainty, it\u2019s important to appreciate that a significant portion of Apple\u2019s revenue occurs over time,\u201d he said. He added that the popularity of the iPhone provided the company a \u201clong-lasting foundation.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Instead, he is glum about the future for Taiwan\u2019s tech industry.\u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re riding on the Titanic, and you know it\u2019s going to hit an iceberg, and you\u2019re trying to turn the rudder, but you know it\u2019s not turning fast enough,\u201d he said in a recent interview.Five years ago, Taiwan\u2019s tech industry was riding high. The device maker HTC had surpassed Apple to become the largest smartphone vendor in the United States, while the computer company Acer had leapfrogged Dell to become the world\u2019s second-largest personal computer maker. Such successes helped lift Taiwan\u2019s economy, building on the country\u2019s longtime work on computer chips and moving the island nation into its next phase as a tech power.As voters went to the polls and elected a new president over the weekend, a rare point of agreement between Taiwan\u2019s fractious political parties was that the tech industry needs help. Just days before the election four years ago, major Taiwan tech figures took to television to argue that the policies of the incumbent president, Ma Ying-jeou, to improve relations with China would lift the industry.Taiwan\u2019s tech problem, as Mr. Lin sees it, is the result of a culture and government that have failed to generate the talent and flexibility to move beyond the manufacturing prowess that made the island a tech hub in the 1980s and \u201990s and forward to the software and Internet industries driving Silicon Valley\u2019s current boom. The dilemma became apparent to him in 2009 when he saw a commercial for Apple\u2019s iPhone.\u201cThe commercial said whatever you want to do, there\u2019s an app for that,\u201d Mr. Lin said. \u201cImmediately, I realized that\u2019s the end of Taiwan. We\u2019re so good at making cheap computers and phones, but we\u2019re so bad at making an app for anything.\u201dThat has solidified a \u201csurvival mentality\u201d unsuited to innovation, with tech executives unwilling to spend on the marketing and design that could set their firms apart from competitors, said Willy Shih, a professor at Harvard Business School who studies Taiwan\u2019s tech companies.One example of that philosophy was on display recently at Silicon Power, which produces branded portable hard drives and USB drives. When the company, based in the affluent riverside neighborhood of Neihu in Taipei, received a flood of orders before Christmas last year, it sent employees responsible for marketing, design and sales \u2014 all key to building a brand \u2014 to the factory floor, according to one employee, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak about the policy.Yvonne Chang, a Silicon Power spokeswoman, said the move was meant to improve communication between office workers and the factory, not to cut costs. An internal email announcing the plan, however, called for an \u201cemergency mobilization\u201d of employees to help on the manufacturing \u201cfront lines.\u201dSome of Taiwan\u2019s larger tech companies have suffered from a similar philosophy. HTC did not put enough emphasis on branding, Mr. Shih said, adding that Acer failed to adequately transfer to mobile devices as the personal computer market sagged. Many of the Taiwanese companies are now beholden to bigger branded companies, mostly in the United States, for computers, servers and smartphones.Acer and HTC did not respond to requests for comment. Nick Wu, the chief financial officer of Asustek, said the company anticipated the shifts in the industry and was working to expand into robotics, as well as computing devices for the home and car.\u201cTransition is not something that can be completed overnight,\u201d Mr. Wu said. \u201cIt takes strategic planning and solid execution, especially when our industry is undergoing a massive paradigm shift.\u201dTaiwan\u2019s entrepreneurial scene, meanwhile, is growing but remains small. Many of those trying to start new companies said they had often run into the conservative mind-set that shunts younger people into risk-averse positions at established companies. Entrepreneurs also have to grapple with a maze of regulations that have restricted online payment platforms and limited tech start-ups\u2019 ability to list in Taiwan.Mr. Lin of AppWorks recalled a moment last year when he and four others in the tech industry met with 30 legislators to work on a law to regulate online payments like PayPal. Of the legislators in the room, only a few had ever used any form of online payment platform.\u201cIf none of them has used it, what rights do they have to criticize it or say it\u2019s not useful?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou have to at least do your homework.\u201dThe institute is also spearheading an initiative to link Taiwanese companies and offer their services to hardware start-ups in places like Silicon Valley that are in need of quick prototyping and manufacturing, with the aim of bringing in new business from the United States. And the organization has created a research group to work on regulatory problems.Co-founded in 2011 by Horace Luke, a former HTC executive, Gogoro has raised $180 million and produces scooters powered by replaceable batteries stored at stations around Taipei. The company grew to more than 600 employees in 2015, up from 15 in 2011.Mr. Luke said his goal was to avoid relying on larger companies and to build a platform by offering services and devices based around the replaceable battery stations. Because of his strong local reputation, Mr. Luke said he had been given freedom by investors to run the company as he wanted. He said he encouraged employees, many of whom are under 40, to shun short-term considerations in favor of longer-term innovation.Mr. Luke said Taiwan\u2019s lack of urgency around tech was receding. In the last 18 months, an \u201calarm bell went off\u201d over the tech scene, he said. \u201cBusiness leaders here, everyone is talking about that,\u201d he said. \u201cAwareness is the first step to a correction.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fund Managers Win With Tech Stalwarts and Burly Brand Names", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byBets on the biggest purveyors of technology \u2014 companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft \u2014 powered three of the top-performing funds of the fourth quarter.Mr. Baker, who has managed the fund since 2009, said he believed that the best companies combined top technology with burly brand names and large scale. Take Alphabet, he said. \u201cNot only does it have a great brand, but every day it does seven to eight times as many searches as all of its competitors combined. So every day its search accuracy is improving that much faster than competitors\u2019.\u201dAs befits a growth investor, Mr. Baker is a technophile. He will riff at length about the technological themes that undergird his picks, like the omnipresence of cloud computing, the maturation of solar power and the promise of artificial intelligence. Skeptics complain the information age isn\u2019t yielding benefits comparable to the industrial revolution, but that is humbug, he says.\u201cThe steam engine, to take advantage of that, you needed to dig canals and put in railroads. The peak change was 75 to 100 years after the invention.\u201d As far as the microchip goes, he said, \u201cAll of the infrastructure is in place, and we\u2019re entering the period of peak economic and social change.\u201dEven video game makers are benefiting, he said. Consider Activision Blizzard, another top holding and the producer of Call of Duty and Guitar Hero. A decade ago, its market comprised a few million game consoles and personal computers, Mr. Baker said. \u201cNow you have a billion smartphones, all of which you can play a video game on.\u201d And Activision Blizzard is trying to broaden its share of the mobile market with its pending acquisition of King Digital Entertainment, maker of the game Candy Crush.Mr. Baker\u2019s fund, with an expense ratio of 0.83 percent, returned 13.34 percent for the quarter, compared with 7.04 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.\u201cBrands hold their value, and a global brand isn\u2019t dependent on one geography,\u201d she said. Est\u00e9e Lauder, Starbucks and Nike were all among her fund\u2019s recent stakes. \u201cTheir markets are growing because they address the whole world,\u201d she said.Sturdy brands also drew her to Constellation Brands, which owns the United States rights to popular Mexican beers like Corona, Modelo and Pacifico, as well as a groaning cellar of wines. \u201cIn good times and bad, people still drink wine and beer,\u201d she said.Ms. Starke took over her fund about a year and a half ago. It then held more than 80 stocks. She set about paring that number, with an aim of keeping the portfolio at 30 to 50 holdings. \u201cIn large-cap growth, it\u2019s hard to outperform with a big portfolio,\u201d she said. \u201cA concentrated portfolio is the way to do it.\u201d With too many holdings, a fund can end up looking too much like the broader market and merely matching its return.She also plowed a greater portion of the fund\u2019s money into her top picks. Previously, the top 10 holdings accounted for about 14 percent of the portfolio, she said. Now they are more than 40 percent.The fund\u2019s biggest sector weightings are information technology, health care and consumer discretionary. Those tend to produce the best earnings growth, she said. \u201cI\u2019m looking for healthy earnings growth and healthy sales growth,\u201d she said.Ms. Starke\u2019s fund, with an expense ratio of 1.12, returned 9.92 percent in the fourth quarter.Like Mr. Baker\u2019s fund, it lately held shares of Microsoft. Mr. Kleinschmidt said the fund had owned the stock for about a decade, even as the company was seen as falling behind competitors like Apple and Google. But Microsoft kept putting up strong numbers, he said.\u201cForget the name,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I just gave you their market share, their cash flow, their return on equity, if I showed you all of that, would you be interested? Yes. Most people would be.\u201dFacebook, an overlap with both Mr. Baker\u2019s and Ms. Starke\u2019s top holdings, is a more recent purchase. Mr. Kleinschmidt said he was attracted to the social network\u2019s enormous customer base, about 600 million people when the company went public in 2012. Tocqueville bought shares in the months after Facebook\u2019s initial public offering, when the stock sagged. \u201cI reasoned a smart management team would be able to figure out how to make money on 600 million users,\u201d Mr. Kleinschmidt said. Facebook says its network has grown and estimates more than a billion people use its service daily.Mr. Kleinschmidt has patience. As he has with Microsoft, he will stick with a stock for years. His fund\u2019s annual turnover ratio is 15 percent. In contrast, the average actively managed stock fund tracked by Morningstar turns over about two-thirds of its portfolio annually.\u201cOne of the hardest things to do in this business \u2014 and yet one of the best things \u2014 can be to sit on your hands and not let the market\u2019s noise convince you that you have to do something,\u201d he said.Mr. Kleinschmidt cautioned that his turnover might increase in coming months. As a contrarian, he said he often finds buying opportunities when the market sags, as it has lately. \u201cThe essence of a contrarian thinker is to lean against the wind. You do that by looking into situations where the prevailing feeling is, \u2018Oh, my God.\u2019\u201dMr. Kleinschmidt\u2019s fund, with an expense ratio of 1.25 percent, returned 10.97 percent in the fourth quarter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Antitrust Chief Takes Swipe at Privacy Issue", "Date": "2016-01-17", "News": "Supported byMUNICH \u2014 Margrethe Vestager, the European Union\u2019s antitrust chief, warned on Sunday that the collection of a vast amount of users\u2019 data by a small number of tech companies like Google and Facebook could be in violation of the region\u2019s tough competition rules.Ms. Vestager\u2019s comments are the latest in a growing chorus of European criticism about the privacy practices of American tech giants, many of which rely on crunching data based on people\u2019s social media posts, online search queries and e-commerce purchases to fuel their digital advertising businesses.The comments by Ms. Vestager, who, as the region\u2019s top competition official, has sweeping powers to fine companies that are found to abuse their dominant market positions, show that European officials are stepping up their fight to strengthen data protection. In the European Union, an individual\u2019s right to privacy is viewed on par with other fundamental rights like freedom of expression.\u201cIf a few companies control the data you need to cut costs, then you give them the power to drive others out of the market,\u201d Ms. Vestager said at the DLD conference, a gathering of digital executives and policy makers.She said that \u201cit\u2019s hard to know\u201d how much data is given up when using an online messaging service. \u201cBut it\u2019s a business transaction, not a free giveaway,\u201d she continued. \u201cAs consumers, we need to be treated fairly.\u201dMs. Vestager\u2019s warning shot in the often-rancorous privacy debate comes ahead of a Jan. 31 deadline for Europe and the United States to reach a new data-sharing agreement.\u201cIf someone like Google or Facebook has all of the data, then that\u2019s not good,\u201d Mr. Samwer said here on Sunday.But for Ms. Vestager, a 47-year-old Danish politician who has garnered both fans and detractors for her ambitious competition activities, adding data protection to her portfolio could prove difficult.On Sunday, Ms. Vestager denied claims that Europe was unfairly targeting American tech companies, although some executives in the United States have claimed that European officials are trying to bolster local technology companies at the expense of their large American rivals.Ms. Vestager added that she was not against further consolidation within the industry, despite European antitrust officials\u2019 balking at a number of recent proposed takeovers in the region\u2019s telecommunications sector that they said would reduce competition at the consumer level. Future mergers, she said, should not reduce consumer choice and worsen market competition.\u201cYou can\u2019t just go out there and buy yourself a monopoly,\u201d Ms. Vestager said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Taxing Google and Other U.S. Giants Is Dividing Europe", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byBRUSSELS \u2014 For some European nations, big American corporations like Google are seen primarily as employers and technological innovators whose presence can help with their global competitiveness.But for others, the multinational giants are seen as having used complex accounting to sidestep corporate taxes. That, some argue, makes them prime targets at a time when governments are grasping for revenue to fill budget deficits and trying to address populist concerns about inequality.The divide, long present in Europe, is playing out with new intensity.European Union officials in Brussels are intent on imposing a blocwide standard for taxation and clawing back what they consider to be improper tax breaks granted by national governments to multinational companies.While some countries like France and Germany are happy to see back taxes collected from big corporations as a result of the effort, others are essentially saying they would rather the companies keep all or some of their tax breaks as long as they bring prosperity.The difference in approach may not rank with more existential problems for the European Union, like how to control the migrant influx without sacrificing open borders across much of the Continent. But it shows how tax policy cuts to the core of economic competitiveness for most countries in Europe, where sustained growth and balanced budgets have been hard to achieve lately.Ms. Vestager made her comments about Britain\u2019s deal with Google on the same day that the European commissioner for financial affairs and taxes, Pierre Moscovici, proposed measures meant to close a number of corporate tax loopholes across the European Union.The European Union wants no member state to use tax policy to achieve an unfair business advantage over its neighbors. But the ability of European countries to tailor tax practices to their own purposes is a matter of national sovereignty that many leaders are unwilling to cede to Brussels. That is true for the countries that are trying to compete for jobs and foreign investment brought by multinational titans like Google, Apple or Facebook as well as for those trying to wring more tax revenue from rich companies to help support a struggling economy.\u201cNational governments have competing objectives here,\u201d Neal Todd, an international tax expert and partner at the law firm Berwin Leighton Paisner, wrote in an email message to reporters on Thursday. \u201cWhilst nearly all governments want multinationals in general (and U.S. tech groups in particular) to pay more tax,\" he wrote, \"none of them want to change their own rules only to find that businesses simply relocate to warmer fiscal climes.\"Although the British prime minister, Mr. Cameron, defended his Google deal, his political opponents have criticized it as too generous to the company and not reflective of the full magnitude of its British revenue for the 10 years it covers.In studying the Cameron-Google agreement, Ms. Vestager may follow up on a request of the Scottish National Party, a British opposition party, which has sent a letter to the European Commission criticizing the tax deal with the search giant. A spokesman for Ms. Vestager\u2019s office said on Thursday that the complaint would need to be studied to see if it warranted a formal investigation.The issue could be particularly delicate, coming as Mr. Cameron has been trying to negotiate better terms for Britain within the European Union. As soon as June, Britain may hold a referendum in which voters would be asked whether they want to remain in the bloc or leave it.But Christian Cubitt, a Cameron spokesman, declined on Thursday to elevate the tax dispute to the level of the debate on Britain\u2019s place in the European Union. He said simply that it was \u201ca decision for the commission\" to decide whether to investigate, although he stressed that Google had agreed to pay all the tax that is due.Britain is by no means alone in seeking to handle corporate tax matters on its own terms.Italian financial police officials were to issue an investigative report to Google on Thursday, indicating whether the company has paid sufficient taxes in Italy since 2008. Although Google has not been accused of wrongdoing, tax officials say the delinquent amount could be about 300 million euros, or about $325.3 million.Google is also in discussions with France over back taxes. Last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the company\u2019s executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, met with the French economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, to discuss the matter.There has been no public discussion of how much in back taxes is being sought by France\u2019s Socialist government, but local news reports have placed the figure as high as \u20ac500 million.Google\u2019s official response to reports of those negotiations has been the same, which it repeated yesterday: \u201cGoogle complies with the tax laws in every country where we operate. We continue to work with the relevant authorities.\u201dThe biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Ms. Vestager is also investigating tax arrangements between Ireland and Apple, and Luxembourg and Amazon over whether the companies received preferential tax deals that broke the European Union\u2019s state-aid rules. A decision in the Apple case is expected in March, at the earliest; the Amazon case could also be decided in the coming months. The companies and governments say they have done nothing wrong.In previous cases where Ms. Vestager has ruled that corporate tax arrangements violated European Union law by favoring certain companies, governments have been ordered to recoup back taxes that they would rather not collect lest they signal to other multinationals that their countries are not business-friendly.While Ms. Vestager is investigating cases where countries might have let companies pay too little tax, the proposals by Mr. Moscovici on Thursday are meant to prevent tax avoidance before it happens by closing gaps in cross-border rules to channel profit to subsidiaries in lower-tax countries.In a news conference, Mr. Moscovici said losses from the loopholes amounted to nearly \u20ac70 billion a year, discriminated against small business and angered ordinary citizens.His proposals mean to deter European governments from, for example, letting companies shift profit to low-tax jurisdictions. Mr. Moscovici said his proposals also showed Europe\u2019s eagerness to put into effect international standards endorsed by the leaders of Group of 20 major economies last year.Mr. Moscovici\u2019s measures would also require corporations to fully disclose all of their taxes, profit, revenue and other financial data to the administrations of all countries where they operate.The proposals, though, might be hard to turn into law. They would require the unanimous approval of European Union governments, and some could balk. And the measures would not affect the low across-the-board corporate tax rates that countries like Ireland use as an inducement to attract foreign companies.Oxfam, an antipoverty group, criticized Mr. Moscovici as taking an ineffective \u201clowest common denominator approach\u201d to the tax overhaul.British lawmakers aligned with Mr. Cameron\u2019s government were wary of Mr. Moscovici\u2019s proposals.\u201cGlobally, there is a battle raging for jobs and growth,\u201d said Ashley Fox, the leader of the delegation of British Conservatives at the European Parliament. \u201cThe E.U. must ensure that its proposals do not act as a deterrent to international investment and employment.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Friday about divisions in Europe over the taxing of multinational corporations misidentified the recipients of written comments about European tax policies from Neal Todd, an international tax expert. They were sent to the news media, not to Mr. Todd\u2019s clients.James Kanter reported from Brussels, and Mark Scott from Rome. Stephen Castle contributed reporting from London, Elisabetta Povoledo from Rome, and Aurelien Breeden from Paris.Advertisement"}

More on that later.Apple said that Siri had \u201cbecome faster and smarter\u201d and spoke more languages than other assistants. Microsoft said it was \u201cjust scratching the surface\u201d on how Cortana could help people. Google said that it wanted smartphones to do more of the heavy lifting, and that users could do a host of things just by speaking to Google. Amazon did not respond to requests for comment.On the productivity front, Siri, summoned by pressing the home button on the iPhone or by saying, \u201cHey, Siri,\u201d was best able to schedule a meeting with a friend in Hawaii, check what was on my calendar for tomorrow, send an email and read my most recent email aloud. Others could complete only some of those tasks \u2014 Google could not read my last email out loud, and Alexa could not compose an email or create a calendar event.Siri also fared well in music-related tasks, but was bested by Alexa. Both assistants could play the song \u201cHey\u201d by the Pixies, put on the latest episode of the \u201cRadiolab\u201d podcast and play music in the instrumentals genre. But Alexa, summoned simply by saying \u201cAlexa,\u201d could play a specific music station on Pandora, whereas Siri could only open the Pandora app.Google, which builds its voice-controlled assistant into the Google mobile app, achieved the highest marks for completing travel and commuting-related tasks. It responded perfectly to the question \u201cWhat is the traffic like to 221 Main Street?\u201d by showing me how long it would take to drive there.When I said, \u201cTake me to the Dogpatch Boulders gym,\u201d it showed me a map and gave voice directions. When I said, \u201cFind me plane tickets to New York next week,\u201d it offered an impressive response: Flights from San Francisco to New York next week start at $435, and the shortest flight is five hours and 10 minutes long.On travel and commuting, Cortana could offer solutions for the questions about traffic and directions, but not the one about flights. Siri earned a C-minus in the category: She could not give traffic estimates, and in response to the question about flights to New York, she spat out an unhelpful list of web search results related to traveling to New York. And instead of taking me to a bouldering gym to hone my physique, she took me to a brewery.Alexa got a D \u2014 she could offer traffic estimates for only one fixed location that was set up inside the app, like your office, and she added the task of finding a flight to New York to my to-do list. (I gave Alexa a pass on failing to map me to the gym. It seemed too much to ask from a home audio speaker.)For food-related tasks, Google and Apple were even. Each of the assistants was able to find a list of nearby Indian restaurants. Only Google\u2019s voice assistant could order delivery food, but with an unintuitive process that required naming a specific restaurant that delivers food through one of the apps that Google has teamed up with. Siri was the only one capable of booking a restaurant table.In my limited time with M, I asked her to handle some of the most mundane tasks: Call the water company to ask about my utility bill, find out what meats are on sale at the local Whole Foods store and research when would be the cheapest time for my editor to fly to Hong Kong (not that I was trying to get rid of my editor).M pondered for a few minutes before answering each question, which made me suspect that a person handled most of the tasks. So I asked M to schedule a photo shoot with a studio owned by a friend of mine. Within minutes, the photo studio\u2019s phone rang, and my friend picked up.\u201cHi, I\u2019m calling on behalf of my boss,\u201d said M, who sounded like a young woman. \u201cHe wanted to find out if you guys have the ability for a photo shoot at 2 p.m. tomorrow.\u201dM left a contact phone number with a 650 area code, which includes Menlo Park, Calif., where Facebook has its headquarters.\u201cI didn\u2019t catch your name,\u201d my friend at the photo studio said.\u201cFirst name is M,\u201d the not-so-virtual assistant replied. \u201cLast name is Messenger.\u201d\u201cIs that Greek?\u201d my friend at the photo studio asked. M laughed nervously.In other words, M probably is more capable than all the virtual assistants, but largely because humans are on the other end of the puppet strings handling tasks that artificial intelligence cannot. That makes me doubt that many consumers will get to meet M, at least in its current state, in which it is free.\u201cM is still in its very, very early stages,\u201d Facebook said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re not yet focused on scaling M to a large number of people.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The SIFI designation only costs $150 million a year, but that could change once regulators complete the rules for insurers. Carving up A.I.G. now, though, would mean forgoing almost 10 times that amount in tax benefits. The numbers raise questions about how Apple will satisfy investors who want growth and consumers who want new, cutting-edge technology. Steven Davidoff Solomon writes in the Deal Professor column.In a down market, what was volatile on the upside is now shooting downward, bringing this exuberance tumbling back to earth. This happened in the financial crisis of 2008, and history seems to be repeating itself this year with hedge funds, including Pershing Square and Icahn Enterprises, buffeted by the downturn. The result would not only be a reduction in the number of activist attacks. One or two highflying funds may collapse, and some of the stronger funds may survive and buy opportunistically.

{"Headline": "Walgreens Says No Customers\u2019 Tests Will Be Done at Theranos Lab in California", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byTheranos contends that more than 90 percent of its laboratory analysis is done in Arizona, where it worked with Walgreens. But the statement did little to allay concerns about the reliability of Theranos\u2019s technology. Walgreens said previously that it was evaluating its next steps regarding its relationship with Theranos, and a company spokesman had no further comment.Theranos said it remained \u201copen for business\u201d and would continue testing at its Arizona lab. \u201cThis is an issue that many other labs have faced, and we will fix it quickly and completely, working with our regulators as we always do,\u201d said Brooke Buchanan, a spokeswoman.But Walgreen\u2019s decision underscores the concerns raised by a letter sent to the company by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, one of two federal regulators overseeing the Theranos laboratory operations, earlier in the week. The agency outlined five deficiencies, including one that it said posed \u201cimmediate jeopardy to patient health and safety\u201d involving Theranos\u2019s hematology testing, for blood cell counts or the monitoring of patients\u2019 blood.Theranos, which said it was addressing the problems highlighted in the letter, said \u201ca full plan of correction will be submitted to C.M.S. within days.\u201dIn its statement, Walgreens said it would wait to see what action the agency took before making any further decisions. \u201cNo patient samples will be sent to the Newark lab until all issues raised by C.M.S. have been fully resolved,\u201d it said.Theranos was founded in 2003 by Elizabeth Holmes, a Stanford University dropout who promised to upend the traditional laboratory testing industry with a proprietary technology. She attracted widespread attention, and her company garnered an astonishing $9 billion valuation before questions surfaced over the company\u2019s operations.Since then, Mr. Gass\u00e9e said he had met with Theranos executives at the company\u2019s Palo Alto headquarters. In a telephone interview on Thursday, he said he was not swayed by its explanation of the significant test result variations. \u201cI sort of shrugged and left,\u201d he said.Ms. Buchanan, the spokeswoman, said Theranos executives discussed the differences between the two labs. \u201cHis results fell within the accepted variance,\u201d she said. \u201cWe took time and effort and spent hours addressing this with him.\u201dMr. Gass\u00e9e said he had his blood tested again later at a Theranos lab, and found that \u201cthe numbers were a little bit all over the place.\u201dWhile Ms. Holmes has expressed confidence in Theranos\u2019s ability to get approval for its methods and the tests it plans to offer, the company must wait for the F.D.A. to weigh in. The company is permitted to use conventional methods to continue its testing, but it remains unclear how much of its own technology the company is able to use while awaiting regulatory approval.Advertisement"}

Car sales in the United States hit a record 17.5 million in 2015 and could keep rising. And analysts predict G.M.\u2019s profit will reach $8.3 billion this year, according to Thomson Reuters data. Yet the company\u2019s stock trades at just six times earnings. Rival Ford manages an only slightly better seven times.Several factors are to blame: fears of overheating sales, fueled in part by subprime lending; a sluggish turnaround in Europe; problems in Latin America and Russia; and a slowdown in China.But there\u2019s also a longer-term worry about the rise of self-driving cars, shared ownership and ride-hailing. People may buy fewer cars in the future and the likes of Tesla, Google, Apple and tech-focused car-parts suppliers could become more important, and more profitable, at the expense of traditional manufacturers.Branching out into Lyft gives G.M. a better chance of navigating these trends. For example, the two companies plan to set up hubs offering people who want to drive for Lyft the chance to rent cars by the day, week or month. That\u2019s a flexible approach that aligns with part-time and multijob employment trends. And it gives G.M. an extra market for its vehicles.Over the longer run, the two also intend to pair Lyft\u2019s ride-matching and payments systems with G.M.\u2019s progress in making autonomous and connected cars. The company already has its own assisted-driving technology with OnStar, as well as arrangements with suppliers like the camera and radar maker Mobileye.Lyft is not the market leader. Its latest $5.5 billion valuation makes it just one-tenth the size of Uber. But that also makes G.M.\u2019s hefty stake and board seat less expensive at Lyft. It\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s a partial insurance policy against what could become existential threats.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Good Governance Stock Index Lacks Expert Judgment", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Supported byAnother ViewLast week in Davos, Switzerland, a group of giant pension funds unveiled a new stock index, the Standard & Poor\u2019s Long-Term Value Creation Global Index.In the image of the World Economic Forum whence it came, the index aspires to collect the best-run global companies, by evaluating their governance, financial quality and sustainability initiatives. Most Standard & Poor\u2019s indexes are defined by mere region and asset class. What is the purpose of a stock index composed of supposed global elites?\u201cWe are trying to use the index to change corporate behavior,\u201d said Mark Wiseman of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, a member of the group that established the index.So how will the Standard & Poor\u2019s Long-Term Value Creation Global Index work? Its marketing materials point out that despite the qualitative nature of the criteria \u2014 long-term strategy, innovation, sustainability \u2014 do not worry, \u201cexpert judgment is limited.\u201d Instead of experts using their brains, the \u201cindex\u201d will rely on a messy stew of checklists and quantitative models. The \u201cquality score,\u201d for instance, seeks to tell us how good a business is based on a formula with three inputs: return on equity, financial leverage and a rudimentary balance sheet metric. This is, of course, madness.Here we have an opaque, quantitative investment strategy masquerading as an S.&P. index based on qualitative factors. And what are the largest holdings of this \u201cindex\u201d of long-term value creators? What are the elite companies that Mr. Wiseman hopes will be the envy of their peers? Perhaps visionaries like Google, Amazon or Berkshire Hathaway? Nope. The top 10 holdings include two cigarette makers, McDonald\u2019s, and, why not, McGraw Hill Financial, which happens to own Standard & Poor\u2019s.What\u2019s especially frustrating about this ill-advised plan is that the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and its cohorts should know better. Public pension plans have learned a lot of tough lessons about the cost of bad public company governance. For much of the 1970s and 1980s, passive institutional investors struggled with their responsibilities as large public company shareholders. After they were exploited for years by both corporate raiders and entrenched management teams, General Motors\u2019 1986 buyout of Ross Perot\u2019s stake in the automaker drove them over the edge. The head of the State of Wisconsin Investment Board proclaimed, \u201cIf shareholders continue to be passive, they will continue to be shorn like sheep.\u201dBy the end of the 1980s, many large institutional investors were doing their homework. They ran proxy fights, submitted scores of shareholder resolutions and formed opinions on sophisticated corporate governance issues. This paved the way for the kind of shareholder activism that dominates markets today. The current explosion in hedge fund shareholder activism, which has pressured corporations like Microsoft, Apple, DuPont and General Electric, has been fed by the (often tacit) support of large institutional investors behind the scenes.And now, rather than directly challenging offenders as a shareholder activist might, the pension funds want to ride the growing wave of indexation to create an exclusive collection of best-in-class companies. They hope to lure retail investors into this \u201cindex,\u201d which they believe can provide excellent investment returns while encouraging corporate management teams to focus on long-term value creation. The problem is, you can\u2019t identify great, long-term oriented companies with quantitative models and checklists.The proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services provides a cautionary tale about relying on checklists to evaluate corporate boards. Robert A.G. Monks and Nell Minow, two renowned scholars of corporate governance, founded I.S.S. in 1985 with the best intentions. Mr. Monks and Ms. Minow used their own expert judgment to advise public company shareholders on how to vote their proxies. Since they sold the business in 1992, it has changed hands several times and grown rapidly. Regulations that require investment firms to have robust proxy voting policies have had the peculiar effect of pushing more of them to outsource the responsibility to I.S.S.As the proxy adviser\u2019s growth forced it to resort to standardized, checklist-style evaluations, some of its recommendations became shockingly imprudent. In 2004, I.S.S. advised Coca-Cola shareholders to withhold votes from Warren E. Buffett because of conflicts of interest related to his ownership of Dairy Queen. Apparently, there was no question on I.S.S.\u2019s checklist that asked, \u201cIs the candidate the greatest capital allocator to ever live?\u201dMr. Wiseman, the Canadian pension board and their pension fund partners should know that wise, long-term corporate governance requires the kind of sound business judgment you cannot evaluate by employing a hundred-page checklist. Markets will only reward companies that govern themselves for the long term when large institutional owners use their expert judgment to vote bad boards out of office.Advertisement"}

Supporters like Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, have said virtual reality is the next big platform after mobile. The technology, which can make users feel transported by immersing them in different environments, has the potential to transform games, movies, social networks and work. Almost $4 billion has been invested in virtual reality start-ups since 2010, according to PitchBook, a research firm.Developing virtual and augmented reality technology is about creating \u201cthe next operating system,\u201d said Linc Gasking, co-founder and chief executive of 8i, a company that creates virtual reality software. \u201cApple currently owns the computer in your pocket, and it needs to be part of the next big user interface if it wants to retain that ownership.\u201dApple has not, until recently, been publicly enthusiastic about virtual reality. While it has made tiny acquisitions in the field, it has not made a deal as large as Facebook\u2019s Oculus purchase and has not brought any hardware to market.Apple has filed dozens of virtual reality-related patents in the past, including one in 2008 for a head-mounted display apparatus.

{"Headline": "Fake Online Locksmiths May Be Out to Pick Your Pocket, Too", "Date": "2016-01-30", "News": "Supported byMaybe this has happened to you.Locked out of your car or home, you pull out your phone and type \u201clocksmith\u201d into Google. Up pops a list of names, the most promising of which appear beneath the paid ads, in space reserved for local service companies.You might assume that the search engine\u2019s algorithm has instantly sifted through the possibilities and presented those that are near you and that have earned good customer reviews. Some listings will certainly fit that description. But odds are good that your results include locksmiths that are not locksmiths at all.They are call centers \u2014 often out of state, sometimes in a different country \u2014 that use a high-tech ruse to trick Google into presenting them as physical stores in your neighborhood. These operations, known as lead generators, or lead gens for short, keep a group of poorly trained subcontractors on call. After your details are forwarded, usually via text, one of those subcontractors jumps in a car and heads to your vehicle or home. That is when the trouble starts.The goal of lead gens is to wrest as much money as possible from every customer, according to lawsuits. The typical approach is for a phone representative to offer an estimate in the range of $35 to $90. On site, the subcontractor demands three or four times that sum, often claiming that the work was more complicated than expected. Most consumers simply blanch and pay up, in part because they are eager to get into their homes or cars.\u201cIt was very late, and it was very cold,\u201d said Anna Pietro, recalling an evening last January when she called Allen Emergency, the nearest locksmith to her home in a Dallas suburb, according to a Google Maps search on her iPhone. \u201cThis guy shows up and says he needs to drill my door lock, which will cost $350, about seven times the estimate I\u2019d been given on the phone. And he demanded cash.\u201dThe phone number at Allen Emergency is now disconnected.Lead gens have their deepest roots in locksmithing, but the model has migrated to an array of services, including garage door repair, carpet cleaning, moving and home security. Basically, they surface in any business where consumers need someone in the vicinity to swing by and clean, fix, relocate or install something.\u201cI\u2019m not exaggerating when I say these guys have people in every large and midsize city in the United States,\u201d said John Ware, an assistant United States attorney in St. Louis, speaking of lead-gen locksmiths.A Google spokesman said that the company worked hard to check bad actors and quickly removed listings that violate its policies.But the company is still too easily tricked into listing lead gens, high up, even after years of redesigns and algorithm adjustments, critics say. Local service results have improved of late, but too many consumers are still getting ripped off because Google, the world\u2019s biggest search engine, is perennially a step behind a group of sophisticated swindlers, according to experts in the field.The flaws in the Google machine are well known to Avi, an Israeli-born locksmith, who asked that his last name be omitted from this story, citing threats by competitors. (\u201cOne told me there is a bounty on my head,\u201d he said.) Avi has been at war with lead-gen operators for eight years. It\u2019s like guerrilla combat, because the companies are forever expanding and always innovating, he said.The company\u2019s website at the time listed six physical locations, including a pinkish, two-story building at 10275 West Santa Fe Drive, Sun City, Ariz. When Avi looked up that address in Google Maps, he saw in the bottom left-hand corner a street-view image of the same pinkish building at the end of a retail strip.There seemed no reason to doubt that a pinkish building stood at 10275 West Santa Fe Drive.Avi was skeptical. \u201cThat\u2019s about a five-minute drive from here,\u201d he said.We jumped in his car. It wasn\u2019t long before the voice in his GPS announced, \u201cYou have arrived.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the address,\u201d he said. He was pointing to a low white-brick wall that ran beside a highway. There was no pinkish building and no stores. Other than a large, featureless warehouse on the other side of the street, there was little in sight.\u201cThis is what I\u2019m dealing with,\u201d Avi said. \u201cGhosts.\u201d(Yes, Google makes money every time a person clicks on an AdWords ad, and yes, in the case of locksmiths, the cost can be $30 for every click \u2014 even more in some cities. If you\u2019ve ever wondered how Google gives away services and is still among the most profitable companies in the world, wonder no more. People clicking AdWords generated $60 billion last year.)In a search for locksmiths in Mountain View, Calif., home to Google\u2019s headquarters, the first AdWords listing was 24hourlocksmithsanjose.net, which offered $19 service. Research into the company\u2019s domain name revealed that it is owned by Yossi Assraf of Locksmith Advertising, in Portland, Ore.Those have all the trappings of a lead gen. And, 247 Locksmith Advertising has an F rating from the Better Business Bureau, along with a list of nearly identical complaints.\u201cOver all the cost was $200!!\u201d wrote one unhappy customer, who had been expecting to pay $19. \u201cThis was a complete bait and switch!\u201dMessages left for Yossi Assraf were not returned.Recently, I sent Google the ad for 24hourlocksmithsanjose, as well as a screen shot of the fake Locksmith Force building and the names of about 20 other locksmiths that appeared to be lead gens. The company asked for a few days to look into the matter.National data that could capture the scale of the lead-gen problem does not exist, largely because most of the complaints occur at the state level, by way of attorneys general, Better Business Bureaus and Yelp. Also, the sums involved are usually modest, so many people have no idea they have been swindled, or they know but don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth anyone\u2019s while to contact the authorities.\u201cTalk to anyone in the business and they\u2019ll tell you that revenue is down 30 to 40 percent,\u201d said Mark Baldino, who owns a handful of locksmith stores in the Washington area. \u201cThere are 10 fake locations around me, and consumers have no idea which of us is real and which is going to rip them off.\u201dThe difference between people like Mr. Baldino and locksmiths sent by lead gens is not just a physical storefront; excellent locksmiths work out of cars and vans, too. Lead-gen locksmiths are essentially short-term hires, and their priority is not repeat customers. It\u2019s quick cash.Many of the locksmith lead gens are run by Israelis, and Avi learned their modus operandi by working for them. When he landed at La Guardia Airport in 2008, he wanted to work with computers, the field he had trained for in Israel. But it was the height of the recession, and he did not have many options.\u201cAt the time, if you were an Israeli, it was either carpet cleaning or locksmithing,\u201d he said. \u201cI tried carpet cleaning for a week and hurt my back so badly, I said this is not for me.\u201dA company in New Jersey, owned by an Israeli, hired him, gave him a week of training and told him he could keep 40 percent of every job. His instructions were to size up each customer and ask for as much money as possible. He quit, found an honest shop, eventually earned enough to open his own company and relocated to Phoenix.Many of the recruits later establish their own lead-gen operations, which then recruit more talent. This has increased competition and made deceiving Google an ever more esoteric pursuit. That was evident during a conversation with Roy Alverado, the owner of Locksmith Force, the company that created the fake pink building in Sun City. He insisted that he ran an authentic local business, with trained and courteous locksmiths.As for that fake building: \u201cWe wanted to have a store in that area, but the rents were too high,\u201d he said. He told a web design firm to create a building using Photoshop. Actually, all but one of the buildings are Photoshop creations, since Locksmith Force\u2019s sole physical location is in Phoenix, Mr. Alverado said. The more buildings on the site, he candidly stated, the more people would believe they were calling someone who could show up at a car or house quickly.Mr. Alverado said those fake buildings were necessary because getting to the first page in Google results now took ingenuity and cunning.\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d he said, sounding a little weary when asked about competition. Israelis were his toughest rivals, he said, and they had instilled a kind of awe in him. \u201cI can tell you point-blank, they are freaking smart,\u201d he said. \u201cI really admire them.\u201dA few months ago, he decided that he needed some help with search engine optimization. A company called Over the Top SEO showed up on the first page of an \u201cSEO company\u201d search, so he figured it was very good. Then he saw that the company was based in Israel. Mr. Alverado was sold. If he couldn\u2019t beat the Israelis, he would hire them.\u201cWe\u2019re already seeing great results,\u201d he said.Even with the rise of Facebook and improvements to Apple Maps, Google is still the essential source of revenue for local businesses \u2014 85 percent of all local search traffic reaches local businesses through Google, according to Mike Blumenthal, who writes a definitive blog on the topic.To understand how lead gens game Google\u2019s algorithm, you need to know a bit about how a company\u2019s address winds up in Google\u2019s results, and how those results can be fraudulently altered. Few know the particulars better than Bryan Seely, who worked for a lead-gen outfit in the automotive glass repair field, based in Southern California, from 2008 to 2010. During that time, he produced about 3,000 fake auto glass repair listings across the country. Eventually appalled by his handiwork, he became what he calls a reformed hacker and explained his techniques in a self-published book, \u201cCyber Fraud: The Web of Lies.\u201d\u201cMy hope was that the book would cause Google to patch up these holes,\u201d he said on the phone recently. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work.\u201dBoth Google My Business and Map Maker are a bit like Wikipedia, insofar as they are largely built and maintained by millions of contributors. Keeping the system open, with verification, gives countless businesses an invaluable online presence. Google officials say that the system is so good that many local companies do not bother building their own websites. Anyone who has ever navigated using Google Maps knows the service is a technological wonder.But the very quality that makes Google\u2019s systems accessible to companies that want to be listed makes them vulnerable to pernicious meddling.\u201cThis is what you get when you rely on crowdsourcing for all your \u2018up to date\u2019 and \u2018relevant\u2019 local business content,\u201d Mr. Seely said. \u201cYou get people who contribute meaningful content, and you get people who abuse the system.\u201dThe most obvious symptom of abuse is a wild proliferation of lead-gen listings. Charles Eastwood, a locksmith in Phoenix, subpoenaed Acxiom, a data brokerage firm, as part of a lawsuit he filed against a group of purported lead gens in 2010. He wanted to know how many locksmiths were listed in Arizona.\u201cThere were 9,600 of them in the list I got from Acxiom,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s about 9,000 more than anyone believes actually work in the state.\u201dTo fight lead gens, Google deploys a little-known army of volunteers, called Mappers, many of whom are engaged in a contest that takes wit and stamina. These are people around the world who propose and approve edits to Google Maps, with an assist from Google employees, all in the interest of refining the product and fighting spam \u2014 a term that in this context means anything fake and misleading.It may seem bizarre that people would work gratis for one of the world\u2019s richest companies. But many Mappers turn the job into a calling. For Dan Austin, who lives in Olympia, Wash., it was more like an addiction.A former truck driver for DHL, he became a Mapper after he was laid off from his job and started fixing mistakes he had noticed on Maps while on the road. By the fall of 2011, Mr. Austin had discovered locksmith spam and was soon spending 10 hours a day, seven days a week, deleting it from Maps.\u201cIt was like a video game except it had a moral element to it,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, I\u2019d have wiped out 1,000 locations and I would think, that\u2019s 1,000 phone calls that didn\u2019t get made, 1,000 consumers who didn\u2019t get scammed. I felt like Superman.\u201dMr. Austin became a Regional Lead, the highest rank in Google\u2019s Boy Scout-like badge system of incentives, a job \u2014 still unpaid \u2014 that required him to sign a nondisclosure agreement.He was quickly locked in a struggle that seemed inspired by Cold War spycraft. Some lead-gen owners became Mappers themselves, hoping to stealthily protect their listings. They were essentially moles. One of them, who called himself Baton Sason, contacted Mr. Austin through a private detective.\u201cAt first, he thought I was another spammer,\u201d Mr. Austin recalled. When Mr. Sason realized that Mr. Austin was truly on Google\u2019s side, he tried to win amnesty for his sites in exchange for help informing on his competitors. Mr. Austin played along for a few months, then deleted Mr. Sason\u2019s sites too.Initially, Mr. Austin regarded Google as a benign Goliath that cared about consumers and small businesses. But about 18 months after his campaign began, pessimism crept in. He realized, he said, that spammers were changing tactics much faster than Google was adopting countermeasures.\u201cFor me, it was always like I was looking at a five-alarm fire,\u201d he said. \u201cTo them, it was smoldering.\u201dBy the fall of 2012, Mr. Austin was disillusioned. He decided that the subtle approach to getting attention wasn\u2019t working. So he did something obnoxious. In the middle of the Google Map of Los Angeles, he placed a marijuana grow house. Not a dispensary, which is legal. A grow house, which is a place where plants are harvested. Those are illegal. Then he highlighted the stunt on a Map Maker forum.The plan was to demonstrate that it was too easy to hoodwink Google. The plan failed. Google fired him from his unpaid job. (A Google spokesman declined to comment.)Today, Mr. Austin has the faintly bitter tone of a man who has left a cult, but he is cleareyed about why Google never seemed to respond quickly enough to spammers. It wasn\u2019t a priority, he said. The company is dominated by software coders, and they want to solve the most interesting problems, or create the coolest products.\u201cFighting spam is boring,\u201d Mr. Austin said. \u201cThe employees who cared didn\u2019t have the political clout in the company. I\u2019d hear Googlers say, \u2018Maps is a mess. It\u2019s known at the highest levels, but we don\u2019t talk about it publicly.\u2019\u201dLittle, it seems, went right after that. One defendant fled the country, according to prosecutors. In 2013, a federal magistrate judge recommended dismissing the case because the government had deported four witnesses, all of them former Dependable employees who might have helped the defendants. The judge also suggested that the case would be difficult for the prosecution to win because Dependable phone representatives usually added the phrase \u201cand up\u201d when quoting prices.One of the prosecutors, Mr. Ware, the assistant United States attorney in St. Louis, respectfully disagreed with those findings.\u201cNinety percent of people were charged more than the estimate,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had locksmiths tell us that they would take whatever they could get from customers.\u201dOne lesson of the Dependable case, which took years from inception to dismissal, is that the criminal courts are a terrible way to fight purported lead-gen locksmiths. Civil cases have fared no better. Mr. Baldino, the locksmith in Washington area, lost a case against Google and other directories in which he said the companies commingled legitimate and illegitimate players in listings. Last February, a Virginia state court found that Google had immunity under the Communications Decency Act, which extends to all information that does not originate with Google \u2014 \u201ceven when given notice that it has published false information,\u201d the court concluded.Only Google, it seems, can fix Google. The company is trying, its representatives say, by, among other things, removing fake information quickly and providing a \u201cReport a Problem\u201d tool on the maps. After looking over the fake Locksmith Force building, a bunch of other lead-gen advertisers in Phoenix and that Mountain View operation with more than 800 websites, Google took action.Not only has the fake Locksmith Force building vanished from Google Maps, but the company no longer turns up in a \u201clocksmith Phoenix\u201d search. At least not in the first 20 pages. Nearly all the other spammy locksmiths pointed out to Google have disappeared from results, too.\u201cWe\u2019re in a constant arms race with local business spammers who, unfortunately, use all sorts of tricks to try to game our system and who\u2019ve been a thorn in the Internet\u2019s side for over a decade,\u201d a Google spokesman wrote in an email. \u201cAs spammers change their techniques, we\u2019re continually working on new, better ways to keep them off Google Search and Maps. There\u2019s work to do, and we want to keep doing better.\u201dThere was no mention of a stronger verification system or a beefed-up spam team at Google. Without such systemic solutions, Google\u2019s critics say, the change to local results will not rise even to the level of superficial.Apprised that Locksmith Force had been relegated to the Internet\u2019s version of oblivion, Avi was in no mood to celebrate.\u201cOne down,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cFifty thousand to go.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Display at CES, Tech Ideas in Their Awkward Adolescence", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtBut if news from CES feels especially desultory this year, it might not be the show that\u2019s at fault. Instead, blame the tech cycle. We\u2019re at a weird moment in the industry: The best new stuff is not all that cool, and the coolest stuff isn\u2019t quite ready.It\u2019s not that today\u2019s tech is terrible \u2014 lots of potentially groundbreaking ideas are just around the corner. In product labs across the world, engineers and designers are working to turn a collection of annoying buzzwords \u2014 artificial intelligence, virtual reality, wearables, the \u201cInternet of things,\u201d autonomous cars and drones \u2014 into products that we find irresistible. They are all pushing the limits of what machines can currently accomplish, and working to come up with business models that customers will stomach. In time, after years of experimentation and incremental advances, many of these technologies might become mainstays.But that future will take a few years to pan out. In the meantime, you can expect to be bombarded with early versions of tomorrow\u2019s tech that are bound to feel janky and incomplete. Welcome to Prototype World, a brief intermission in your regularly scheduled program of disruption, during which everything new will more or less stink.\u201cIt\u2019s like the junior high years in technology,\u201d said Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies. \u201cWe\u2019re in those awkward teenage years where everything looks and feels funky.\u201dOver the next couple of CESes, there\u2019s a good chance we will see a lot of devices that will feel not quite ready. Virtual reality will underwhelm, artificial intelligence will feel annoyingly unintelligent, and cars and drones that navigate themselves will seem safer when parked. There will be wearables you won\u2019t want to wear and home devices that will make you want to buy a new place.\u201cIt will eventually cross that hump and become mature, but it\u2019s not there right now,\u201d Mr. Bajarin said.It\u2019s unsurprising that early versions of new tech will be a bit flawed. But what\u2019s unusual about the current moment is how many new, interdependent technologies are coming about at the same time. We\u2019re in the middle of a grand cycle in technology \u2014 the revolution pushed by smartphones, social networks and ubiquitous online servers (that is, the cloud everyone talks about). Over the last decade, these three technologies have altered wide swaths of the business world, destroying and creating hundreds of billions of dollars in wealth in sectors as varied as media and transportation.Venture capitalists are eager to see these trends continue. Fred Wilson, a co-founder of Union Square Ventures, told me he was paying close attention to opportunities for mobile devices and social networks to alter health care, finance and education.Hunter Walk, of the firm Homebrew, echoed this idea. \u201cIt may be true that there\u2019s not a consumer-tech phenomenon that breaks through this year, but the cascading wave of tech goodness from mobile isn\u2019t close to being done when we look at this other part of your life called work,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I\u2019m not bored.\u201dI take his point; we in the press are often quick to become bored and demand the next great thing. And yet, what can I say? I am kind of bored. Even if smartphones and social networks have lots of room to grow before conquering the world, they feel like old, mature tech. This is an industry that moves on anticipation of the next great thing. Artificial intelligence, virtual reality, autonomous vehicles and wearable computers are the building blocks of tomorrow\u2019s great tech cycle. The trouble is, the cycle is just getting started.But how will Apple get there from here? Improving the watch will require lots of fundamental advances over a period of years \u2014 smaller, faster processors and radios; better batteries; better artificial intelligence and voice recognition, among other things. Can Apple provide all that? Probably, and if it doesn\u2019t, some other smartwatch maker will most likely do it. But it won\u2019t happen this year. It might not even happen next year. You\u2019ll just have to wait.Similar advances will also be required to perfect self-driving cars and self-flying drones. Advances in A.I. will also power a set of intelligent assistants far smarter than Siri, some that don\u2019t make you tear your hair out.All this could be grand: A few years from now, if you believe the boosters in Vegas this week, many of us will be shuttling around in self-driving cars, regularly plugging into reality-defying virtual worlds, and adorning ourselves with smart jewelry that will seamlessly integrate our bodies with the Internet. Our homes will be connected, our drones will be autonomous and our phones will sizzle with artificial intelligence.That\u2019s a good vision to keep in mind as you struggle, over the next few years, to get anything to work as it should.Email: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjoo Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pepsi Turns Restaurateur, to Serve Up Some Buzz", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byBehind black doors, what used to be a trendy restaurant in New York had been stripped to its concrete bones. Wires and cables snaked along the floor. Ceiling lights twinkled in the gloom.Known for its beverages, Pepsi is now moving into the restaurant business. The 5,000-square-foot space \u2014 on the same block as Milk Studios in Chelsea (Pepsi insists it resides in the ultrahip meatpacking district) \u2014 will become Kola House, a restaurant-bar-event space that the company hopes will be both social hub and testing ground for new products.\u201cThis isn\u2019t a pop-up,\u201d said Seth Kaufman, PepsiCo\u2019s chief marketing officer for beverages in North America. \u201cThis is something much bigger than that.\u201dMr. Kaufman said he wanted Kola House to offer visitors \u201ca premium experience,\u201d and to that end, it will not be plastered with the Pepsi logo or filled with Pepsi products. Everything at Kola House will be centered on the kola nut, a bitter fruit that contains caffeine and gives cola beverages their name. Essentially, Pepsi is trying to market its product without marketing its product.Mr. Kaufman\u2019s ambitions may seem outsize for a space still under construction. But his vision reflects how brands are trying to connect with consumers in ways beyond TV commercials and online ads.Kola House is designed for the social media age. However grandiose, Pepsi\u2019s goal is that visitors \u2014 particularly influential ones \u2014 will talk about Kola House on Facebook and Twitter and post pictures on Instagram.\u201cPeople consume content with a speed that we\u2019ve never experienced before,\u201d said Mauro Porcini, head of design for PepsiCo. \u201cThat\u2019s why, to be relevant online in these conversations, these companies need to activate offline in the best possible way.\u201dConsumer companies that set up shop in hip areas are trying to seem more on the edge and exclusive, said Allen Adamson, a branding expert and the former chairman for North America at Landor Associates, a global brand company.The danger for a big, mainstream brand like Pepsi, however, is that it will look more like a dad at a high school party than a member of the cool kids club.\u201cThis will continue to be something we learn from,\u201d he said. \u201cA year after it launches, there will be components of it that look different than when it launched because that\u2019s what marketers need to do these days.\u201dPepsi declined to say how much Kola House would cost to operate or for how long the company had rented the space. But Mr. Kaufman said it was a \u201csignificant undertaking\u201d that was being run by the marketing department.Pepsi is expected to introduce the Kola House concept in San Francisco in the days leading up to Super Bowl 50. Pepsi will also sponsor the Super Bowl halftime show and run a television commercial during the game that will focus on music and well-known songs.Before the game, Pepsi will set up what it is calling a modular Kola House (\u201crather than a pop-up,\u201d Mr. Kaufman said). There it plans to serve kola sliders, made with wagyu beef and caramelized onions, and beef tartare with caviar and kola truffle aioli. On the beverage menu is a drink called East Meets West, a pearlescent, vodka-based cocktail with kola bitters.The permanent Kola House in New York will include space for live entertainment.Mr. Kaufman and Mr. Porcini both emphasized that the Pepsi branding would be subtle \u2014 a logo here or there, but nothing too obvious.\u201cConsumers will love your brand because your brand enables you to have the experience, but they don\u2019t want to have the brand in their face,\u201d Mr. Porcini said. \u201cIt needs to be very subtle, elegant, sophisticated.\u201dTo that end, he said, there will be a small Pepsi logo on the sculpturelike bar fixture, but there will not be bottles of Pepsi and bags of Fritos lying around.\u201cWe are in a time where we have to transform how we connect with and engage consumers,\u201d Mr. Kaufman said. \u201cIf brands don\u2019t do that today, they will be irrelevant tomorrow, whatever tomorrow is.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Need to Fret, Apple Is Doing Fine", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtLet\u2019s get this out of the way first: Despite what you may have heard, the iPhone is not dying. Neither, by extension, is Apple.But if Apple is now hitting a plateau, it\u2019s important to remember that it\u2019s one of the loftiest plateaus in the history of business. The $18.4 billion profit that Apple reported on Tuesday is the most ever earned by any company in a single quarter.So this column will try to do something tricky: explore what\u2019s ailing Apple without going off the deep end. Here\u2019s my ice-cold take: Apple is doing quite O.K.Could it be doing some things better? Sure. Are any of its problems urgent? Not particularly, and from what one can tell, it\u2019s working to address many of its shortcomings. Does it face existential threats? Yes, but no more than any other tech giant. Will it remain an outsize presence in the tech industry for years to come, generating profits on a scale that no other corporation can match? Almost certainly.I\u2019ll get to those long-run worries in a bit, but let\u2019s start with the present. At the moment, Apple\u2019s biggest problem is its own success. The iPhone turns nine this year. The iPad turns six. These devices have made Apple the world\u2019s most valuable company (until Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, overtakes it, which might happen soon).Yet the very dominance of Apple\u2019s aging mobile empire inspires doubts about its future. The bigger the iPhone gets, the harder Apple has to work to beat its previous milestones, and the more vulnerable it appears to some fatal technological surprise.But there\u2019s something worth keeping in mind about each of these criticisms. They\u2019re the gripes of a technophile, and they don\u2019t necessarily reflect mainstream consumer perceptions about Apple\u2019s products.But if continued growth sounds like wishful thinking, there\u2019s another path for Apple to prosper even if iPhone sales do hit a wall: Suck more money out of each phone. In a note to clients last fall, analysts at Goldman Sachs suggested that through a widening number of subscription services baked into the iPhone, Apple could begin to reap a huge monthly fee from its users, which it said constituted \u201cthe most lucrative installed base in the world.\u201dIt\u2019s an argument Apple executives are starting to vocalize loudly. On Tuesday\u2019s earnings call, Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said the popularity of the iPhone provided the company a \u201clong-lasting foundation.\u201dApple\u2019s ecosystem is so sticky that people tend to flock to its services even if there are better products out there. Even if I\u2019m not a fan, 10 million people have subscribed to Apple Music in its first six months.Given all these options for minting bullion from the iPhone, the most alarming worries for Apple aren\u2019t about the present. They are about the future beyond the horizon, and they are necessarily speculative.The basic question is this: In the future, will physical devices matter less than they do now? If computers are more like the machines in the movie \u201cHer\u201d \u2014 ethereal, ambient computers that exist in the cloud, that respond to our voices and our bodies, anticipating our desires \u2014 what will happen to Apple then? This is a company whose entire existence hinges on the cultural appreciation of physical things. Can it prosper in an age of ambient computing?These are interesting questions to pose. I had a long conversation with Mr. Thompson about these ideas, and Apple\u2019s apparent weaknesses \u2014 how it\u2019s not as good at artificial intelligence and voice recognition as Google, how it lacks the cloud infrastructure that Amazon has built, and how, most important, its entire corporate culture is geared toward making actual stuff, which could limit its capacity to create fantastic online services.But ultimately the discussion felt academic. It seems obvious that as the tech world changes around it, Apple, over the next decade, will need to reinvent itself. But so will everyone else. That is just what you do in this industry.An earlier version of a credit for an illustration with this article misspelled the illustrator\u2019s surname.
