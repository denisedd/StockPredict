{"Headline": "Glass Beads Made in Czech Village Adorn Bodies of the World\u2019s Tribes", "Date": "2016-01-12", "News": "Supported byDesna JournalVenture up the Amazon or into a Masai Mara village in Kenya, explore a jungle bazaar in southern India or even a roadside shop in Arizona selling Navajo knockoffs, and the chances are excellent that most of the beads you will see were produced in this unlikely mountain village a stone\u2019s throw from the Polish frontier and a short drive to Germany.The Preciosa factory, which produces the beads using a mixture of traditional processes and modern industrial techniques, remains, with 900 workers, the chief employer in this small village of 3,000 people.\u201cIt\u2019s a good job, with good pay and you get to say you are helping to make products that are the best in the world,\u201d said Zdenek Gyalog, 29. He oversees the sorting department, whose workers, in many cases, have been at Preciosa for 15 or 20 years, and their parents before them.\u201cIf my son, someday, comes to me and says he wants to go into this business,\u201d Mr. Gyalog said, \u201cI certainly would not oppose it.\u201dDesna became a center of Bohemian bead production a little over 150 years ago when Josef Riedel, the descendant of generations of glass traders and manufacturers, built a factory astride a chattering river with the ragged Jizera Mountains looming on all sides. Some of his original buildings are now part of the Preciosa complex.The Riedel family tomb dominates a steep hillside across the road from the factory, and the white mansion of the man once known as the glass king of the Jizera Mountains is down the road, now a museum.For centuries, beads and glass vessels were made here in small workshops, or in literal cottage industries run by families, often as a second source of income.The houses are still easily identifiable in the surrounding countryside, notable for their two chimneys, indicating that a glass furnace anchored one part of the property.Today, nearly all of those mom-and-pop operations have fallen by the wayside, said Josef Nagy, 48, who runs a small beadmaking operation in the village of Pencin, not far from the Preciosa complex in Desna.Since only Preciosa has the technology capable of making the higher-quality seed beads, smaller manufacturers \u2014 like Mr. Nagy\u2019s company, Fipobex \u2014 target smaller and more specialized markets. But the Chinese competition does not make it easy.\u201cEverybody is struggling,\u201d Mr. Nagy said.A decade ago, he had 120 employees. Now there are only 15, and much of the equipment in his aging factory sits idle. To make up for the lost revenue, the company started giving tours, opened a goat farm, a museum of agriculture, and a craft shop where people can experiment with making their own beaded jewelry. \u201cWe could see the writing on the wall,\u201d Mr. Nagy said.But as the smaller operations have struggled, Preciosa\u2019s bead factory in Desna has only flourished, as has the town.\u201cAs we say, beads are a cheap joy for poor people,\u201d Mr. Pus said, leading the way late last year across a water-slick floor in an old, traditional furnace room.Through eight gaping gates, workers scoop molten glass out of red-hot pots in the brick furnace. The glowing ingots sink with an angry hiss into wooden tubs of water large enough to swallow an easy chair.The seed beads that are the basis of Preciosa\u2019s current prosperity are more difficult to produce than ordinary glass beads \u2014 in which molten glass is pressed into a mold \u2014 but allow artisans a wider array of treatments, flourishes and colors.Glass rods are melted in a furnace, then, while still pliable, pulled through a machine that shapes them into a strawlike tube.The end result looks a bit like a cocktail straw, although there are 20 sizes, each creating its own size of bead, and 20 basic colors that can be mixed into an almost endless selection of tones and shades, some opaque, some transparent.The holes in the straw can be round, triangular, star-shaped, even double-barreled, and a second color can be used to accent the hole or create baked-in glass patterns on the bead\u2019s face.The glass straws are sent through a slicing machine that bites off bead-size lengths, which are then reheated gently and put into a spinning machine that shapes the pliable glass into perfectly round beads that are then sorted and polished.\u201cAnd at the end of all that, all you have is one measly glass bead,\u201d Mr. Pus said.Leos Adler, Preciosa\u2019s bead production manager, set some sample boards on a conference room table.Preciosa sells directly to 70 countries and, through regional distributors, to 40 more. In Africa, the company sells to the Masai and Samburu tribes in Kenya and Tanzania, and to the Zulus, Xhosas, Ndebele and other tribes of southern Africa.\u201cYou go to the Masai Mara and a lot of the beads you will see in the tourist markets are cheap Chinese products,\u201d Mr. Adler said. \u201cBut the Masai themselves will only use our beads for their personal use.\u201dIn North America, the largest market is for home hobbyists, but several Native American tribes also purchase the beads for higher-end pieces aimed at collectors and flush tourists.Southern Sudan has also become a big market, Mr. Adler said. In South America, there are ceremonial garments for religious occasions, like childbirth ceremonies, as well as costumes for Carnival and an assortment of belts, napkin rings and jewelry for everyday use.The biggest surprise of recent years was an explosion of interest in Czech beads in Ukraine and Russia, where they were suddenly being used to adorn religious icons and paintings.\u201cIt has become a huge market,\u201d Mr. Adler said. \u201cAnd it just happened.\u201dKaterina Hruskova, assistant chief curator at the Museum of Glass and Jewelry in the nearby city of Jablonec nad Nisou, where an exhibition of Czech beadwork since 1700 had recently opened, said that was understandable.\u201cIt is just a job for the people who live here,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you are working eight hours or more every day with beads, you don\u2019t really want to go home and see beads.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Mozart in the Jungle\u2019: Where Classical Music Meets Soap Opera", "Date": "2015-12-30", "News": "Supported byThe situation, happily, has been rectified in the second season of \u201cMozart,\u201d which was available for streaming starting on Dec. 30. Overheard at home, singing to herself some melancholy bars of the standard \u201cIt All Depends on You,\u201d Ms. Peters\u2019s character, Gloria Windsor, is told, \u201cYou should be performing in front of an audience.\u201dIt turns out that Gloria once had cabaret aspirations. And lo and behold, there she is in the following episode, wearing a slinky gown and delivering a sly, smoldering rendition of \u201cCome on-a My House.\u201dBased on a 2005 tell-all book by Blair Tindall, which described a young oboist\u2019s climb through the sex- and drug-fueled ranks (who knew?) of the New York classical music scene, \u201cMozart\u201d loves roman \u00e0 clef moments like Ms. Peters\u2019s torch song. Rodrigo, the on-screen orchestra\u2019s dynamic, demented conductor, is played by Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal but is clearly inspired by Gustavo Dudamel, the music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic.So there Mr. Dudamel is, in the first few frames of the new season, appearing in a cameo as an employee of \u2014 what else? \u2014 the Los Angeles Philharmonic, where Rodrigo has arrived to lead that orchestra at the Hollywood Bowl. \u201cOne thing to conduct Mozart,\u201d he tells Rodrigo, knowingly. \u201cAnother thing, labor negotiations.\u201dThese insider-ish jokes provide some of the season\u2019s most amiable moments. I don\u2019t know how many people watching \u201cMozart\u201d will be able to identify the eminent pianist Emanuel Ax, who in the fourth episode (of 10 half-hour chapters) is a denizen of a superstar-musician hangout. (Lang Lang is there, too, playing Ping-Pong and tickling the ivories.) But Mr. Ax\u2019s genial presence, for those who recognize him, is delightful.Beyond such winking moments, though, the second season of \u201cMozart\u201d feels slacker than did the first, which was released a year ago. That initial round of episodes aspired to a Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez-style magical realism to match Mr. Garc\u00eda Bernal\u2019s charismatic amalgam of Latin-lover stereotypes.This was a world in which parrots flew onto podiums and white horses suddenly appeared in the middle of fancy country-house cocktail parties. It was silly, but there was a core of insight about the way the classical music industry actually works \u2014 and doesn\u2019t work \u2014 these days. In Season 1, Gloria told a metrics-obsessed colleague who expects the orchestra to turn a profit that \u201cclassical music has been losing money for people for 500 years \u2014 it\u2019s not a business.\u201dThe labor dispute at the heart of the show was approached a little simplistically, sure, but also with reasonably accurate references to strict union rules and fights over pensions. The conflicts at the heart of today\u2019s music scene \u2014 between musicians and management, art and money \u2014 were depicted with a grin, but also with an essential, enlightening seriousness.Those contract negotiations have been dragged, kicking and screaming and generally drearier than before, into the second season, which mostly lacks the first\u2019s flights of fancy. Not that there aren\u2019t glimmers of the surreal. A dance party that migrates to Rodrigo\u2019s apartment seems meant to echo a more endearing community celebration in the first season that breaks out unexpectedly in an abandoned lot.Debra Monk (as Betty, a vengeful but not entirely unlikable veteran oboist) gets a lap dance from a stripper dressed as a Baroque master who\u2019s been dirtily renamed Johann Sebastian \u2014 well, you can guess the rest. He gyrates to a techno remix of Bach\u2019s Air on the G String, which is more or less the season\u2019s finest musical moment. (This isn\u2019t, sadly, a music-theme series with a must-listen soundtrack.)In these new episodes the plotting feels, paradoxically, both less whimsical and flimsier. A brazen labor lawyer (Gretchen Mol) starts sleeping with the head of the musicians\u2019 negotiating committee (Saffron Burrows). There is a confusing subplot in which the orchestra\u2019s concertmaster fakes the theft of his violin for the insurance money. Jason Schwartzman, one of the show\u2019s executive producers, returns, for no apparent reason, as a photographer and videographer.A tour to Latin America is the main set piece, but it ends up being mostly an anticlimax. It is also a reminder of what remains one of the show\u2019s most irritating qualities: its depiction of Latin life and culture as simpler, more passionate and yet more grounded.Only Mr. Garc\u00eda Bernal\u2019s seemingly endless reserves of charm make bearable sequences like the one set in Rodrigo\u2019s grandmother\u2019s house in rural Mexico. Or scenes fixated on his budding, boring will-they-won\u2019t-they romance with the series\u2019 protagonist, the ambitious oboist Hailey Rutledge (Lola Kirke). Mr. Garc\u00eda Bernal is always compulsively watchable, and has been nominated for a Golden Globe for best actor. Who else could seem natural describing the soccer star Lionel Messi as \u201cthe discreet Paganini of the midfield\u201d?Though Malcolm McDowell is still delightfully dry and perpetually aggrieved as an aging conductor, Mr. Garc\u00eda Bernal\u2019s appeal is truly matched only by Ms. Peters, whose harried dignity is the only thing that\u2019s deepened in the second season. But her character is on the whole less interesting this time around: While the first season\u2019s Gloria was neither entirely hero nor villain, clashing with Rodrigo and allying alternately with the musicians and some craven board members, she\u2019s now more completely \u2014 and therefore dully \u2014 sympathetic. (But can she do some Sondheim next season? Please?)After a bunch of gentle twists \u2014 we explore, among other things, the psychosomatic roots of Rodrigo\u2019s ringing ears \u2014 the season ends at a moment of decision for the orchestra\u2019s stewing labor calamity. But by that point it\u2019s hard to care. As in the real-life classical music industry these past few years, the endless sense of crisis gets tiring. And the show now has fewer dreamlike amusements to act as distractions.\u201cLook, it\u2019s not third-rate,\u201d Rodrigo tells a composer, trying to let him down easy about a long-worked-over symphony. \u201cMaybe second and a half.\u201d That\u2019s not a bad description of this new season of \u201cMozart in the Jungle.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Netflix Faces a U.S. Slowdown, Despite Global Growth", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported byThe Netflix fourth-quarter results paint two different pictures of the company: one achieving record global growth, the other facing a slowdown in the United States, where its already high penetration is making it increasingly difficult to add new subscribers.In the United States, however, Netflix missed growth forecasts, adding just 1.56 million subscribers, a decline from the 1.9 million it added during the same period the previous year.The company said that increasing its subscriber base in the United States was becoming harder. Netflix said growth challenges in the United States include the transition to new chip-based credit and debit cards that made it more difficult for members to renew their subscriptions and forthcoming price increases for the service.\u201cThe next 50 million is a little bit harder than the first 50 million in terms of growth,\u201d David Wells, the Netflix chief financial officer, said during an earnings call.Total profit slid to $43.2 million, a 48 percent drop for the quarter from the same period a year earlier. Netflix has warned investors that it would run at break-even profitability through the end of 2016 as it pushed to make its service available across the globe. The company has said that it would deliver material global profits starting in 2017.Total revenue was $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter, up 22.8 percent from the same period during the previous year.Shares of Netflix rose more than 7 percent in after-hours trading on Tuesday. In the last year, Netflix shares have climbed about 125 percent as investors bet on the company\u2019s continued rapid growth both in the United States and throughout the world.Netflix must tread carefully. Some on Wall Street have raised questions about whether the company will be able to keep up its growth trajectory. Analysts have raised concerns about subscriber growth in the United States, content costs, international expansion and competition from Amazon, Hulu and YouTube.This year is shaping up to be an important one for Netflix. This month, the company announced that it had introduced its service to more than 130 countries, making it available in nearly every country across the world, except China.In a letter to shareholders, Reed Hastings, chief executive of Netflix, said the company was primarily aiming at \u201coutward-looking, affluent consumers with international credit cards and smartphones,\u201d with its global expansion.\u201cYou can think of them in shorthand as iPhone owners,\u201d he added during the call.The company plans to introduce more than 600 hours of original series, films and other content \u2014 up from 450 hours in 2015.Mr. Hastings shot back on Tuesday, stating that Netflix didn\u2019t need to release program-level ratings because it does not sell advertising. \u201cWe release \u2018ratings\u2019 for Netflix as a whole every quarter with our membership growth report (75 million and counting!),\u201d he said in the letter. \u201cIt is member viewing and satisfaction that propels our growth.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Sales Soared 22% in Holiday Quarter, but Profit Fell Short", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byAmazon prompts strong emotions, and they were on full display Thursday \u2014 first a faith that the company will indeed measure up to outsize expectations to be the store that sells everything to everyone everywhere, then the sneaking fear that that might be a dream.Analysts said the fourth-quarter numbers, momentarily disappointing as they might have been, did not dent the optimistic case.\u201cThis was more of an expectations correction than a fundamentals correction,\u201d said Mark Mahaney, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the numbers that would mark a dramatic change in Amazon\u2019s growth or profit profile.\u201dInstead, the mood swings just reflected an enthusiasm that got out of hand.\u201cThe last three quarters the company generated bottom-line results that were materially above Street expectations,\u201d Mr. Mahaney said. \u201cThat set up expectations we would see more of the same. We didn\u2019t.\u201dRevenue for the fourth quarter jumped to $35.7 billion, up 22 percent from $29.3 billion. Impressive as that was, analysts had predicted a little bit more: $35.93 billion.Profit is something Amazon has trained Wall Street not to expect. But part of the optimistic assumptions is that the moment is drawing nigh when the dollars will start to pile up. Analysts estimated the retailer would earn $1.56 a share in the quarter, up from 45 cents in 2014. But the company said its fourth-quarter profit was only $1 a share.Investors, who had pushed Amazon shares up 100 percent last year, partly in anticipation of those profits, sent the stock up another $52 to $635 in regular trading Thursday. When the results came in, they did not shrug them off. After-hours, the stock fell more than $84.Against such travails, a 22 percent rise in revenue that was expected to be 23 percent is inconsequential. When Walmart reports its holiday sales quarter, revenue is forecast to actually be down for the quarter from 2014.Amazon\u2019s computing platform subsidiary, Amazon Web Services, contributed heavily to the bottom line. Operating income from that unit rose to $687 million in the quarter from $240 million in 2014. AWS will soon be a $10 billion business, company executives noted in a conference call with analysts.Getting all the work done has required many new employees. Amazon\u2019s head count grew 50 percent in the last year, to 230,000 full-time workers.Amazon might be the powerhouse of e-commerce, yet paradoxically has only a small share of the global market \u2014 which is one of the things feeding enthusiasm for it. For Amazon bulls, there are so many more worlds to conquer.In data assembled before the fourth-quarter results were in, the research firm eMarketer said Amazon had $71.8 billion in e-commerce sales over the last 12 months, an increase of 5.6 percent from the previous 12 months. Walmart, by contrast, had revenue of $13.5 billion online during the period.But Amazon\u2019s revenue pales against the worldwide e-commerce market, which eMarketer estimated as $1.672 trillion. \u201cAmazon is gaining share as evidenced by 26 percent unit growth, compared to our best estimate of 18 percent for global e-commerce growth,\u201d Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray, wrote in a note to clients after the quarterly numbers. The note was headlined \u201cInvestors Overreacting.\u201dIn the current quarter, Amazon has estimated that sales will grow 17 to 28 percent. Operating income might be as little as $100 million, which would be less than last year, or as much as $700 million, which would be considerably more. It was a forecast that allowed plenty of room for enthusiasm, as it also left open the possibility of disappointment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Julien Duvivier, a Gallic Auteur at Home, and Jacques Feyder, One Abroad", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "Supported byPerennially ripe for rediscovery, Julien Duvivier (1896-1967) was a prolific if uneven filmmaker with a five-decade career that included a short stint in Hollywood and encompassed a variety of genres.The critic Andr\u00e9 Bazin considered Duvivier a pillar of French \u201cpoetic realism\u201d (along with Jacques Feyder, Marcel Carn\u00e9 and Jean Renoir); Bazin\u2019s disciples at Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma deemed Duvivier hopelessly square, although at least one, Claude Chabrol, later revised his opinion, pronouncing Duvivier \u201can auteur who didn\u2019t declare himself.\u201dThe great rediscovery of the Criterion set is \u201cDavid Golder,\u201d a controversial but not unsympathetic portrait of a ruthless immigrant Jewish financier (Baur). More an attack on French hypocrisy than an exercise in anti-Semitism, the movie is fluid, lyrical and inventive \u2014 as remarkable a sound debut as its source was for a first novel. Duvivier orchestrates an accomplished synthesis of Germanic lighting and Soviet montage, while providing an American-style narrative drive that builds to an extraordinary ending in which the disillusioned and dying Golder returns to his native Russia.\u201cPoil de Carotte,\u201d a sound remake of a 1925 silent film, is utterly different in style and tone, although also impressive in its use of music and overlapping sound, and distinguished by its performances (notably by the 12-year-old Robert Lynen, later a martyr of the French Resistance, as the rejected \u201ccarrot top\u201d). Shot on location in a rural district of south-central France, it coincides with Renoir\u2019s plein-air talkies.Renoir adapted a Simenon novel in 1933; Duvivier followed suit. \u201cLa T\u00eate d\u2019Un Homme\u201d is a superbly sordid psychological thriller with intimations of Dostoyevsky and Fritz Lang. Simenon\u2019s cleverly structured detective story is rejiggered to emphasize the mental chess match between the imperturbable Maigret (Baur) and a grandiose medical student (played with appropriate intensity by the Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 Val\u00e9ry Inkijinoff, a leading player in \u201cStorm Over Asia,\u201d Vsevolod Pudovkin\u2019s 1928 silent.)The early films are lean; \u201cUn Carnet de Bal,\u201d which requires 130 minutes to detail the quest of a young and most unmerry widow to regain her past, is not. Although this plodding, episodic movie has its moments (the protagonist\u2019s discovery that one of her swains has grown up to be a drunken abortionist) and fans \u2014 notably Stephen Sondheim, who considered turning it into a musical and introduced its screening at the Museum of Modern Art\u2019s 2009 Duvivier retrospective \u2014 it\u2019s most striking for its cast (including Baur, Fernandel, Raimu, and Louis Jouvet).The critic Pauline Kael called \u201cCarnet\u201d \u201ca text on the varieties of French acting.\u201d The other features in this Eclipse set could be taken as texts on the strategies used by the first French sound films.Duvivier\u2019s sometime collaborator Jacques Feyder (1885-1948) made his first talkies in Hollywood, imported by Irving Thalberg to direct two of MGM\u2019s leading foreign-born stars, Greta Garbo and the original Ben-Hur, Ram\u00f3n Novarro.MGM hoped that the sophisticated Feyder would revitalize Novarro\u2019s on-screen image. (According to Thalberg\u2019s biographer Mark Vieira, the studio was concerned that its romantic star, who was a closeted gay man, was \u201cunwilling to marry for the sake of appearances, and aging.\u201d) Feyder directed Novarro as the dashing hero of two ambitious but flawed costume dramas, both released in 1931. In the waltz-drenched \u201cDaybreak,\u201d adapted from a novella by Arthur Schnitzler, Novarro plays a rakish imperial lieutenant who seduces an innocent music teacher; in \u201cSon of India,\u201d he appears \u00e0 la Rudolph Valentino, as a wealthy princeling who embarks on a forbidden love affair with Madge Evans\u2019s na\u00efve American tourist.Made in advance of Hollywood\u2019s strict Production Code, the two movies share daring premises compromised by studio rectitude. Schnitzler\u2019s cynicism is submerged in a tacked-on happy ending and, while Ms. Evans conveys a convincing erotic excitement in her infatuation with Novarro, Novarro himself seems to echo her disapproving brother (Conrad Nagel), who, seeking to rescue his wayward sister, ringingly declares, \u201cYou\u2019re a white woman, where\u2019s your pride?\u201d\u201cSon of India\u201d was Feyder\u2019s last Hollywood movie. He bought out his MGM contract and returned to France, where, among other things, he made the risqu\u00e9 \u201cCarnival in Flanders\u201d (1935), hailed by the New York Times reviewer Frank Nugent as \u201ca sly, gay and impious farce, typically Gallic in its conception and execution\u201d \u2014 in short, everything Feyder\u2019s American films were not.Both \u201cDaybreak\u201d and \u201cSon of India\u201d have been released on DVD by Warner Archive, as part of a series of Novarro talkies. Other studios have intermittently mined their archives. None have shown anything remotely approaching Warner\u2019s depth, care and sustained creative energy.NEWLY RELEASEDAdvertisement"}

Four American men travel to Belize to visit a wealthy college pal, Milo (Billy Zane), for a 40-somethings-gone-wild getaway at his lavish oceanside villa. There\u2019s an aggressive edge to his invite, a determination to show how much better he\u2019s done than his friends: the cautious financial planner Cobi (Steve Zahn), the irresponsible Lex (Michael Imperioli), the family man Gus (Romany Malco) and the embittered Joel (Ben Chaplin).Milo has done well, but he hasn\u2019t done much good. His money comes from underworld connections, and his guests are soon drafted into a feud between him and a local crime lord. A bit like Billy Bob Thornton\u2019s Lorne Malvo in Season 1 of \u201cFargo,\u201d Milo is an instigator, goading his friends into joining him to prove that they\u2019re still men. \u201cWhere\u2019s the fire in your belly?\u201d he demands.It\u2019s a familiar theme, but thrillingly executed in the early going. Suddenly our soft American friends find themselves stuck in Belize with a stolen boat, a trove of illicit cash, numerous deadly enemies \u2014 and a couple decades\u2019 worth of interpersonal resentments coming out under the pressure.Cris Cole, working with Shawn Ryan (\u201cThe Shield\u201d), adapted the series from Mr. Cole\u2019s British drama of the same name. The implicit \u201c\u2026 and Englishmen\u201d is lost in the Americanized version.But there\u2019s still plenty of midday sun. \u201cMad Dogs\u201d is all blinding jewel tones, painting its setting as both gorgeous and alienating. Everywhere there are wild animals and menacing locals, underscoring the old theme of overcivilized characters confronting their atavistic core in the booga-booga tropics.Gus picks up on this directly: Milo, he says, \u201cwent all Col. Kurtz\u201d in Belize. (That Gus is black at least complicates all the cultural othering going on here; at another point, he reminds Lex that Belize is not \u201cwhite man\u2019s America.\u201d)Like many streaming series, though, it seems to be marking time in the middle (Amazon previewed six of 10 episodes for critics), as the characters try to escape Belize and the plot tosses them among so many frying pans and fires that the whole thing threatens to overcook.The strongest parts of these episodes come in the downtime, when the friends are thrown together in close quarters and reflect on their lives, their resentments and, of course, what it means to be a man. One idea they debate, at a dark moment, is the notion that, at the end of life, women regret things they have done and men regret things they haven\u2019t.There\u2019s no woman present to verify this theory \u2014 it\u2019s a refreshing change, in fact, when Allison Tolman (\u201cFargo\u201d) turns up midseason to offer a counter-perspective. Exotic in its looks but predictable in its themes, \u201cMad Dogs\u201d journeys into the heart of darkness and finds a man cave.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Activision Buys Major League Gaming to Broaden Role in E-Sports", "Date": "2016-01-04", "News": "Supported byThe deal, worth $46 million, is relatively small for a company the size of Activision, which has a market value of over $27 billion. But it could play a significant role in Activision\u2019s broader ambitions to become a bigger player in the media business.Robert A. Kotick, chief executive of Activision Blizzard, said he saw an opportunity to build a bigger mainstream audience for e-sports through more professionally produced events modeled on traditional athletic competitions and the broadcasts that bring them into homes.While most of its e-sports events are more likely to be watched over the Internet, as most professional e-sports competitions are today, Activision intends to bring them to viewers through a traditional television channel distributed by cable and satellite providers, Mr. Kotick said.\u201cI have a simple vision for this,\u201d Mr. Kotick said in a phone interview. \u201cI want to build the ESPN of video games.\u201dActivision has already begun bringing in people with extensive backgrounds in broadcasting and e-sports. In October, Activision hired Steve Bornstein, the former chief executive of ESPN and NFL Network, to run its new media division. It also hired Mike Sepso, a co-founder of Major League Gaming, to serve as a senior vice president of the division.As part of the acquisition, Sundance DiGiovanni, the other co-founder of Major League Gaming and its chief executive, will join Activision.Major League Gaming, founded 12 years ago, will continue to organize professional video game competitions featuring games made by Activision and other publishers.Other big publishers have begun increasing their investments in e-sports in recent months. In December, Electronic Arts, the publisher of the Madden and Battlefield franchises, formed an e-sports division and appointed Peter Moore, its former chief operating officer, to run it. Last year, Microsoft increased its investments in a professional tournament for players of Halo, its science-fiction shooter game.But no publisher has been more successful at fostering a large e-sports audience than Riot Games, whose October championship match for its arena battle game, League of Legends, was viewed by as many as 14 million people at one time, up from 11 million the prior year.For the most part, publishers like Riot have viewed e-sports as a way to energize their fan bases by showcasing the talents of the most highly skilled players. The competitions are not generally big sources of profits on their own but benefit publishers indirectly by improving sales and increasing the online purchases that occur within games.Mr. Kotick, of Activision, said that he saw similar benefits for his company\u2019s games, but that he believed organized competitions would become a big business in their own right, as corporate sponsors and advertisers become more familiar with the category.Activision is hardly the first company to consider the broadcasting of e-sports competitions as a crucial piece of the e-sports business. Twitch became a streaming powerhouse by allowing professionals and amateurs to broadcast matches, and it was eventually acquired by Amazon for nearly $1 billion. YouTube, which is owned by Google, has also turned itself into a popular destination to view gaming videos of all kinds.Much of the gaming content on Twitch and YouTube is contributed by users, though these platforms also broadcast professional competitions. Mr. Kotick thinks an e-sports network singularly focused on premium content \u2014 including slickly produced competitions and news shows akin to \u201cSportsCenter,\u201d on ESPN \u2014 will be able to attract more interest from advertisers.\u201cWe think user-generated-content networks are great and widely available,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is really focused on premium content.\u201dThe studios within Activision that make its games will be able to decide whether to team with Activision\u2019s own broadcasting arm to air their competitions or an outside company, Mr. Kotick said.In addition to Call of Duty, the digital card game Hearthstone, developed by the Blizzard side of the company, has developed a sizable e-sports following. Blizzard\u2019s StarCraft helped create the modern e-sports scene, which first emerged in South Korea over a decade ago.Advertisement"}

In 2014, it maneuvered the similarly themed \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d to nine Academy Award nominations and three wins, including best picture. Fox Searchlight also distributed \u201cBirdman,\u201d the reigning best picture winner.Nancy Utley and Stephen Gilula, the presidents of Fox Searchlight, said in a statement that Mr. Parker\u2019s \u201cdedication and artistry in revitalizing Nat Turner\u2019s legacy and place in history has resulted in an extraordinarily compelling and moving film that delivers on every level.\u201d Aja Naomi King co-stars as Mr. Turner\u2019s wife, Cherry, the victim of a horrific gang rape. Armie Hammer plays a sometimes kind, sometimes brutal plantation owner. The film is Mr. Parker\u2019s feature directorial debut.The film, based on a true story, borrows its title from the 1915 D.W. Griffith movie that is considered both a classic for its innovative filmmaking technique and racist for its stereotypical depiction of blacks and its sympathetic portrayal of the Ku Klux Klan. \u201cGriffith\u2019s film relied heavily on racist propaganda to evoke fear and desperation as a tool to solidify white supremacy as the lifeblood of American sustenance,\u201d Mr. Parker, 36, said in a recent interview with Filmmaker Magazine.A look at select films screening at the Sundance Film Festival.He pointedly added, \u201cNot only did this film motivate the massive resurgence of the terror group the Ku Klux Klan and the carnage exacted against people of African descent, it served as the foundation of the film industry we know today.\u201dMr. Parker\u2019s \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d is poised to join a subgenre of films touching on slavery that Oscar voters have supported over the years, even as they have been slow to rally around films about contemporary African-American life. In addition to \u201c12 Years a Slave,\u201d Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cAmistad,\u201d about the events after a mutiny on a slave ship, was nominated for four Academy Awards in 1998; Quentin Tarantino\u2019s \u201cDjango Unchained\u201d drew five nominations in 2013, including one for best picture, and won two Oscars.While there are no official record keepers for Sundance prices, \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d sale far surpassed previous high-water marks, including that of \u201cLittle Miss Sunshine,\u201d which Searchlight bought in 2006 for roughly $12 million, after adjusting for inflation. (A high price, of course, does not necessarily mean a box-office hit. Focus Features in 2008 paid about $11 million for the comedy \u201cHamlet 2,\u201d which took in only half that amount in ticket sales.)Searchlight was the first traditional distributor to make a splash at Sundance this year. During the first half of the 11-day festival, the most active bidders were Amazon, which bought five movies, including the prestige drama \u201cManchester by the Sea,\u201d and Netflix, which made four significant purchases, including spending about $7 million for \u201cThe Fundamentals of Caring,\u201d a comedic drama.Losing bidders for \u201cThe Birth of a Nation,\u201d whose sale was handled by William Morris Endeavor, included Paramount, Universal, Sony and the Weinstein Company.The independently financed \u201cBirth of a Nation\u201d cost an estimated $10 million to make. Mr. Parker, known for his acting in films like \u201cThe Great Debaters\u201d and \u201cRed Tails,\u201d spent seven years working on the film, although the actual shoot, which took place in Georgia, lasted less than a month.In an unusual show of support, at least by Sundance standards, \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d received a standing ovation before it even played. The moment, which had a cathartic feeling after days of #OscarsSoWhite tension, coincided with Mr. Parker\u2019s introduction of the film at the 1,270-seat Eccles Theater. Mr. Parker brought what seemed to be his entire cast and crew, many of whom rose to their feet when he appeared.After the credits rolled \u2014 again, to whoops and cheers \u2014 Mr. Parker spoke of how deeply the racial injustices and atrocities covered in the film continued to reverberate today. \u201cAre you passive, or are you corrupt and complicit?\u201d he asked the audience. \u201cThere is no middle ground.\u201dHe added: \u201cI made this film for one reason: with the hope of creating change agents. That people can watch this film and be affected. That you can watch this film and see that there were systems that were in place that were corrupt and corrupted people, and the legacy of that still lives with us.\u201dCara Buckley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Retail Sales Were Lackluster in December, Signaling Fragile Economy", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byBut even excluding receipts of autos and gas, retail sales were flat in December, after a 0.4 percent rise in November. Economists had forecast that December would mirror the gains recorded in the previous month.The National Retail Federation, an industry trade group, separately estimated that holiday sales rose just 3 percent from the previous year, far below its projection of 3.7 percent growth.Lackluster retail sales also reflect wider shifts in the habits and fortunes of many American consumers, economists say. Much of the wage gain has come at the top end of the wage distribution, leaving many middle-income Americans feeling less than well-off. And burned by the Great Recession, many households have increased their savings, while paring back borrowing.When they do spend, more shoppers hunt for deals, a shift evident in the recent success of heavy discounters like T.J. Maxx and Marshalls. To compete, major department store chains like Macy\u2019s and Nordstrom have raced to open their own off-price locations.For the rest of the retail industry, business has become a cutthroat battle for market share, involving longer sales seasons and deeper discounts.This holiday\u2019s winners include Lululemon Athletica, the upscale maker of stretchy yoga pants, which raised its earnings outlook as it continued to ride a boom in athletics wear. L Brands, which owns Victoria\u2019s Secret, reported its \u201cbest December ever\u201d after the lingerie brand generated holiday buzz with a star-studded fashion show.While falling prices for crucial items may be good news for consumers in the short term, a prolonged fall can condition consumers to hold off on spending as they wait for better deals.

{"Headline": "Why Are Corporations Hoarding Trillions?", "Date": "2016-01-20", "News": "Supported byOn MoneyThere is an economic mystery I\u2019ve been struggling to understand for quite some time, and I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s confused: Among financial experts, it is often referred to as a conundrum, a paradox, a puzzle. The mystery is as follows: Collectively, American businesses currently have $1.9 trillion in cash, just sitting around. Not only is this state of affairs unparalleled in economic history, but we don\u2019t even have much data to compare it with, because corporations have traditionally been borrowers, not savers. The notion that a corporation would hold on to so much of its profit seems economically absurd, especially now, when it is probably earning only about 2 percent interest by parking that money in United States Treasury bonds. These companies would be better off investing in anything \u2014 a product, a service, a corporate acquisition \u2014 that would make them more than 2 cents of profit on the dollar, a razor-thin margin by corporate standards. And yet they choose to keep the cash.Take, for example, Google. Its new parent company, Alphabet, is worth roughly $500 billion. But it has around $80 billion sitting in Google\u2019s bank accounts or other short-term investments. So if you buy a share in Alphabet, which has sold for roughly $700 lately, you are effectively buying ownership of more than $100 in cash. With $80 billion, Google could buy Uber and its Indian rival Ola and still have enough left over to buy Palantir, a data-mining start-up. Or it could buy Goldman Sachs outright or American Express or most of MasterCard; it could buy Costco or eBay or a quarter of Amazon. Surely it could use those acquisitions to earn more than 2 cents on the dollar.This strange vogue for corporate hoarding seems to have begun around the turn of the millennium. General Motors is perhaps the most extreme: It now holds nearly half its value in cash. Apple holds more than a third. These numbers are maddening on their face. If the companies spent their savings, rather than hoarding them, the economy would instantly grow, and we would most likely see more jobs with better pay. In the 1990s, when companies saved far less of their profits, they built new factories, bought new buildings. In part because of all that corporate spending, the 1990s were a period of low unemployment and high growth. Remarkably, the United States government was able to tax all that productive corporate behavior so much that it came close to paying off all its debts for the first time in 160 years.So what is going on now? There are countless economic journal articles laying out theories about why corporations have shifted from borrowing to saving. Some of the reasons are prosaic. Just like people, companies might want to have money for emergencies or for lousy economic times, and the past decade has been a period of increasing risk. Also, corporations have become far more focused on something they call \u2018\u2018tax efficiency,\u2019\u2019 which the rest of us call \u2018\u2018tax avoidance\u2019\u2019: For various reasons, holding on to cash and carefully shifting it among subsidiaries, especially foreign ones, is a great tool to shrink your tax bill.Another reason to hold on to cash is a byproduct of the increasingly intense competition for talent and acquisitions, especially in technology and pharmaceuticals. When Apple or Google enter negotiations to buy a smaller company, any other firm considering a competing offer may be scared off by their nearly infinite resources. Oddly enough, then, holding on to all that cash might be saving these companies even more money, by allowing them to pay less for the firms they acquire. (Google buys about one company a week, on average; Apple\u2019s acquisitions are more sporadic, but not far behind.)But even if you accept all these reasons, we are still left with an enormous puzzle. Companies like Google and GM are holding on to far more cash \u2014 many times more \u2014 than could possibly be explained by emergency funds and tax efficiencies and M.&A. intimidation put together. Lee Pinkowitz, a professor at Georgetown, told me that finance economists agree that there is a puzzle here but break into two distinct camps over the cause. One camp believes that a large cash hoard is a sign of an unhealthy company. Maybe its whole industry is doing so poorly that there is nothing worth investing in; maybe it\u2019s because executives are up to something shady, stockpiling cash as a personal war chest to mask poor decision-making and protect their jobs (cash in the bank, suddenly deployed, can make a firm seem more profitable than it actually is). The other camp doubts that the free market could be allowing executives to hold all that cash if it were purely for their own benefit.Along with his colleague Rohan Williamson, Pinkowitz built a valuation model that analyzed how investors react to different levels of cash holding. He ran 50 years of data (originally from 1965 to 2004, but then he kindly updated his findings for me, through 2014) for 12,888 different publicly traded companies. The model shows how investors value a dollar of savings when it\u2019s held by different sorts of companies, divided into 43 industry types.His findings show that both theories have some truth to them. For several industries, hoarding cash is clearly correlated with negative results. When publishing and entertainment companies or aircraft manufacturers hold on to extra cash, investors perceive that money to be worth less than it should, somewhere in the neighborhood of 40 cents on the dollar (the authors make a specific estimate for each industry but also provide a range to account for error). The defense and coal industries are considerably worse, with a dollar in savings valued negatively. This might suggest protective behavior by chief executives in those industries, because the market is clearly not valuing their decision to save.For other industries, though, a dollar of savings is worth a lot more than itself. For pharmaceutical companies, a dollar in savings is worth $1.50. For software firms, it\u2019s even higher: more than $2. This means that investors are behaving as if they trust the executives in these industries, like Larry Page of Alphabet, to be smarter about using that money than the investors themselves could be. And a cursory scan of the industries in this second group \u2014 which also includes automakers, medical-equipment makers and others \u2014 correlates well with the ones hoarding the most cash. Corporations, it seems, may have amassed at least a good chunk of that $1.9 trillion in mysterious savings because the stock market is rewarding them for it.Which leaves one last question: Why? The answer, perhaps, is that both the executives and the investors in these industries believe that something big is coming, but \u2014 this is crucial \u2014 they\u2019re not sure what it will be. Through the 20th century, as we shifted from a horse-and-sun-powered agrarian economy to an electricity-and-motor-powered industrial economy to a silicon-based information economy, it was clear that every company had to invest in the new thing that was coming. These were big, expensive investments in buildings and machinery and computer technology. Today, though, value is created far more through new ideas and new ways of interaction. Ideas appear and spread much more quickly, and their worth is much harder to estimate. (Indeed, the impossibility of valuing the Internet is essentially what created the 2000 stock bubble.)Surely the most important economic question of our time is a fairly simple one: Are the good times over? Will wages continue to fall for many, while rising high for a few? In the cash conundrum, we might find a modest reason for optimism. If corporate leaders and their investors truly believed that the future were bleak, that innovation and economic growth were irreparably slowing, there would be little reason to hold on to all that cash. Their hoarding of it hints that they think the next transformative innovation could be just around the corner. If in fact they do \u2014 and if they\u2019re right \u2014 it\u2019s good news for all of us.Adam Davidson is a founder of NPR\u2019s \u2018\u2018Planet Money\u2019\u2019 and a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

Let\u2019s call it, Who\u2019s Losing?But don\u2019t expect it to shift much. Asking \u201cwho\u2019s losing?\u201d misses a larger truth about how thoroughly Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft now lord over all that happens in tech.Who\u2019s really losing? In the larger picture, none of them \u2014 not in comparison with the rest of the tech industry, the rest of the economy and certainly not in the influence each of them holds over our lives.But for much of the last half-decade, most of these five giants have enjoyed a remarkable reprieve from the bogeymen in the garage. And you can bet on them continuing to win. So I\u2019m coining the name the Frightful Five.Though competition between the five remains fierce \u2014 and each year, a few of them seem up and a few down \u2014 it\u2019s becoming harder to picture how any one of them, let alone two or three, may cede their growing clout in every aspect of American business and society.Indeed, the Frightful Five are so well protected against start-ups that in most situations, the rise of new companies only solidifies their lead.This gets to the core of the Frightful Five\u2019s indomitability. They have each built several enormous technologies that are central to just about everything we do with computers. In tech jargon, they own many of the world\u2019s most valuable \u201cplatforms\u201d \u2014 the basic building blocks on which every other business, even would-be competitors, depend.These platforms are inescapable; you may opt out of one or two of them, but together, they form a gilded mesh blanketing the entire economy.The Big Five\u2019s platforms span so-called old tech \u2014 Windows is still the king of desktops, Google rules web search \u2014 and new tech, with Google and Apple controlling mobile phone operating systems and the apps that run on them; Facebook and Google controlling the Internet advertising business; and Amazon, Microsoft and Google controlling the cloud infrastructure on which many start-ups run.Many of these platforms generate what economists call \u201cnetwork effects\u201d \u2014 as more people use them, they keep getting more indispensable. Why do you chat using Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp, also owned by Facebook? Because that\u2019s where everyone else is.Then there\u2019s the data buried in the platforms, also a rich source for new business. This can happen directly \u2014 for instance, Google can tap everything it learns about how we use our phones to create an artificial intelligence engine that improves our phones \u2014 and in more circuitous ways. By watching what\u2019s popular in its app store, Apple can get insight into what features to add to the iPhone.\u201cIn a way, a lot of the research and development costs are being borne by companies out of their four walls, which allows them to do better product development,\u201d Mr. Parker said.This explains why these companies\u2019 visions are so expansive. In various small and large ways, the Frightful Five are pushing into the news and entertainment industries; they\u2019re making waves in health care and finance; they\u2019re building cars, drones, robots and immersive virtual-reality worlds. Why do all this? Because their platforms \u2014 the users, the data and all the money they generate \u2014 make these far-flung realms seem within their grasp.Which isn\u2019t to say these companies can\u2019t die. Not long ago people thought IBM, Cisco Systems, Intel and Oracle were unbeatable in tech; they\u2019re all still large companies, but they\u2019re far less influential than they once were.Even with these difficulties, it\u2019s unclear if the larger dynamic may change much. Let\u2019s say that Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce company, eclipses Amazon\u2019s retail business in India \u2014 well, O.K., so then it satisfies itself with the rest of the world.So get used to these five. Based on their stock prices this month, the giants are among the top 10 most valuable American companies of any kind. Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft are the top three; Facebook is No. 7, and Amazon is No. 9. Wall Street gives each high marks for management; and three of them \u2014 Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook \u2014 are controlled by founders who don\u2019t have to bow to the whims of potential activist investors.So who\u2019s losing? Not one of them, not anytime soon.Advertisement"}

I did all of that while mostly standing around in a far less interesting place: Las Vegas, where the International CES, the giant consumer electronics trade show, was being held. To escape from the artificial reality of Sin City during the show, I spent a few days trying out different virtual-reality headgear and applications to assess whether virtual reality was a gimmick or a lasting trend.My verdict: Virtual reality is here to stay for the long term, partly because the content looks and feels great (and also because so many tech companies will not stop talking about it). Whether it ends up widely appealing to consumers depends on how the companies market the technology and whether they bring prices down for virtual reality devices. But considering the high quality of the early content and applications already made for virtual reality, and given the amount of cash that companies are investing in the medium, this is probably not a fad that will fizzle out like 3D television. Virtual reality companies said 2016 is the year that many consumers will try out virtual reality for the first time and perhaps be wowed, though it will not be the year that it reaches mass adoption in terms of sales.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI haven\u2019t had anyone yet try the Rift and take it off and say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I didn\u2019t get it, that\u2019s not incredible,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Brendan Iribe, the chief executive of Oculus, in an interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMost people\u2019s reaction is, \u00e2\u0080\u0098That\u2019s probably the best thing I\u2019ve ever seen in technology in my life.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009dDuring my virtual reality jaunts at the trade show, I strapped on the Rift headgear, which connects to a computer, and looped the two controllers around my hands to test two applications. An app called Toybox places a user in a virtual playroom surrounded by objects that you can pick up and interact with, like ping pong paddles, a laser gun, a slingshot and fireworks. Another player can join you in the session, too, to hit the ping pong ball or shoot a paintball at you with the slingshot.Fox Entertainment also demonstrated a virtual reality app it developed for Oculus to promote the movie \u201cThe Martian.\u201d The app gives you the opportunity to be Mark Watney, the astronaut left stranded on Mars, who is played by Matt Damon in the film. The experience, which lasted about 20 minutes, consisted of seven scenarios, including a sequence where you use the hand controllers to operate a crane to load solar panels onto the Mars Rover. A less enthralling scene involved sorting potatoes by throwing them into different buckets. I was lousy at tossing the potatoes into the buckets, just as I am inadequate at throwing objects in real life.The hand controllers for both Rift and Vive took some time getting used to, but it felt natural to interact with objects on both devices. I figured out how to repair the Aperture robot and operate the crane in \u201cThe Martian\u201d app without any help. Chet Faliszek, a video game writer at Valve, said the intuitiveness of virtual reality should open the medium to broad applications, not just games. \u201cThe applications and the different ways that they can be used are so diverse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.Rift and Vive had some major differences. Rift is designed for use while standing or sitting. Vive encourages you to walk around \u00e2\u0080\u0094 there is a front-facing camera on the headgear to let you peek into the real world with the press of a button, in case you want to grab a glass of water, for instance.Both devices had some flaws. Rift was difficult to wear on my face; I failed to orient the device to block out the outside world in a space under my nose (perhaps because I have a long nose) and a quick head movement made the headgear go out of focus and required a readjustment. Because Vive encourages moving around, I tripped over the cord a few times. With both devices, I felt exhausted and overstimulated after 20-minute sessions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 virtual reality feels like media designed to be consumed in small doses, not hours at a time.Oculus and Vive are initially targeting gamers with their products, and there are limits to the appeal of the systems. Consider the aesthetics of the headgear, which could be off-putting to everyday consumers. Both pieces of headgear still look freakishly sci-fi, like something out of a \u201cStar Trek\u201d episode.Jaunt, which hopes to one day to become the \u00e2\u0080\u009cNetflix of VR,\u00e2\u0080\u009d believes that, at least initially, the smartphone, not fancy headgear like Rift or Vive, will be the key to mass consumer adoption of virtual reality.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all about smartphone technology,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said David Anderman, the chief business officer of Jaunt. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEverybody who has a smartphone in their pocket \u00e2\u0080\u0094 quite soon that could be everybody \u00e2\u0080\u0094 can play VR content.\u00e2\u0080\u009dTed Schilowitz, the resident futurist at Fox who helped develop the virtual reality app for \u201cThe Martian,\u201d said the smartphone had trained consumers to embrace virtual reality. Smartphones, he said, act as robots that are our virtual assistants \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and now people should be comfortable with becoming even more intimate with virtual environments.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u2019s happened to our psychology, to our humanity, has set the stage for what\u2019s going on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u2019re ready for this now.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFollowAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Please, Read My Book (Unless You\u2019re a Friend of My Sons)", "Date": "2016-01-03", "News": "I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m incredibly proud of the book I wrote. I hope it has some of the things I love when I read other people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work. I want readers to find the story funny and sad; honest and relatable. My characters fall in and out of love, they try things they never thought they would and things they will never admit to. And some of these things are dirty. This did not have to be a dirty book. At several points, I could have faded to black, like a 1950s Hollywood movie. No, this didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to be a dirty book. It just gets to be.As I worked to find an agent or publisher I entered a lot of Twitter contests.  You get 140 characters, including the contest hashtag, to pitch your opus. I got a text from my younger son, 19. His friend had told him, \u201cI think your Mom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Twitter was hacked.\u201d He had to explain that I was indeed the author of those racy tweets. My older son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s roommates were even more intrigued. They followed me after they read my tweets and offered themselves as beta readers. Last July, I did land a publisher. I expected the book would release late spring dovetailing perfectly with my life. My youngest son will graduate from high school then. This would allow me the focus and time to promote the book and it would give my son some privacy. But the manuscript whipped through the necessary steps, editing, proofreading and cover design. The night before last, I got the news: It will release this winter. There goes my plan to get him out of high school before his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dirty book hits Amazon. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m trying to reconcile the years I put in to realize this long-held desire to publish against my family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hope that I will simply keep being Mom. So, while I really want you to read my book, I kind of don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want you to if we know one another through our children, our house of worship or my mother.I wonder how E.L. James (do I even need to say, author of the infamous \u201c50 Shades of Grey\u201d) manages. She has two teenage sons. Does she sit at school conferences and talk to their math teacher about trigonometry, or bondage? Before she goes out for a day of errands, does she have to steel herself from too-knowing glances, or does she look at the balance in her checkbook and think: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah. All\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As an author, having a reader identify with one of my characters is like a runner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s high. When my book club read my manuscript, one discussion point was a pivotal disagreement between the main character and her best friend. The character confessed to an emotional affair and the best friend was upset on behalf of the character\u2019s unsuspecting husband.My book club friend asked: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy would the best friend care? Is she in love with the husband?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Another woman answered: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be upset. It changes the whole dynamic of all their relationships.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I fell to my knees, crying: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes! Yes!\u00e2\u0080\u009d  But only in my mind. In reality I went, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMmmm,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and took another sip of chardonnay. A young man, a former co-worker, read the book and confided to me: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe sex scenes work. I mean work. Know what I mean?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I did know what he meant. I was as thrilled he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d responded so, um, viscerally, to my writing, as I was to the friend who understood what I wanted to share about the rhythms of friendship and love.So I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m left to tiptoe through this minefield of pride and sensibility. If you shake your head at modern life and ruminate on the insanity of relationships, then I want you to read my book. But if we know each other exclusively because our children were confirmed together, then, maybe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t read it. Or at least, hold off until July. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Looking for Signs That Apple\u2019s Runaway Growth Is Waning", "Date": "2016-01-24", "News": "Supported byAlready, some investors have begun to treat Apple in a new way: as a \u201cvalue\u201d stock, a label typically attached to companies that generate predictable business results or a reliable dividend, rather than ones that deliver runaway revenue growth. Value stocks often command much lower valuations than growth stocks.\u201cPeople were in love with Apple because hits like the iPod and iPhone created phenomenal growth,\u201d said Ernesto Ramos, a fund manager at BMO Global Asset Management, which manages $18 billion and counts Apple as its largest holding. \u201cAs investors shifted their minds around the fact that it\u2019s no longer going to deliver the same sort of huge growth over the next five years, the stock became a value play.\u201dMr. Ramos says his firm still owns Apple in some of its growth funds, but began including the stock in value funds in mid-2013.Switching from being a growth stock to being a value stock can also be a long and painful process. Growth investors need to sell a company\u2019s shares and drive down the price until it is low enough to tempt value investors, who buy stocks they think are cheap compared with the intrinsic value of the company. In the tech industry, a shift from growth to value also often signals to investors that a company is facing newer competitors with more innovative products, raising the question of how relevant the company can remain.\u201cInvestors don\u2019t like to see the words tech and value combined because when growth slows at a tech company, it usually means that something essentially is not working,\u201d said Angelo Zino, a senior analyst at the research firm S&P Capital IQ.A spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment.Any change would have repercussions beyond Apple because its soaring performance in recent years helped lift the broader market. If Apple shares were removed from the equation, the performance of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index in five of the last seven years would drop by about 1 percentage point, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices. In 2014, for instance, the index rose 13.7 percent with Apple and 12.9 percent without Apple.The Apple effect is even more pronounced when technology names are isolated. For tech stocks on the S.&P. 500 as a group, annual gain in 2009 declined by 6 percentage points when Apple shares were not included, dropping to 56 percent from 62 percent.The effect was more muted last year as Apple\u2019s growth decelerated, according to the data.Investors have turned to Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet, which owns Google \u2014 collectively referred to as the FANG stocks \u2014 for growth. Those companies are each expected to show annual revenue gains of 23 to 40 percent for the last three months of 2015, while Apple is projected to deliver 3 percent revenue growth, according to Bloomberg data.Mr. Ramos says companies like Amazon have bigger growth potential for his fund than Apple, though he plans to continue owning Apple shares. \u201cAmazon will see about 20 percent revenue growth, and earnings per share are expected to jump considerably,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a very strong growth story.\u201dApple shares have already been buffeted in recent months because of worries about the slowing economy in China, which the company counts as one of its largest markets. Half a dozen companies that provide parts for the iPhone also blamed weak demand from Apple for lower-than-expected earnings, causing worries about the company\u2019s sales trajectory.\u201cIf you wanted to outperform the market, the FANG stocks did better,\u201d said Jonathan Krinsky, an analyst at MKM Partners, though he added that Apple remained a must-watch stock because it composed such a large part of many stock indexes.Investors may still someday reanoint Apple as a growth stock, especially if the company can create a best-selling new product that drives up its sales rate. Wall Street analysts cite Microsoft as an example of a business that lost steam and then made the adjustments necessary to deliver strong revenue growth again.Apple has been reclassified as a value stock before. FTSE Russell, which makes several closely followed stock indexes, found in 2013 that Apple no longer met its criteria to be treated purely as a growth stock. Some of the company\u2019s enormous market capitalization was reallocated to the Russell Value Index, as well as being in the Russell Growth Index. A year later, when the company\u2019s sales had risen strongly with the introduction of the iPhone 6, FTSE Russell placed Apple solely back in the growth index.Tom Goodwin, FTSE Russell\u2019s senior research director, said that stock price, sales growth and analyst expectations determine whether a company is placed in the growth or value index, or in both. About a third of the stocks that Russell tracks are included in both indexes, he said.But until Apple reveals another hit or shows a significant pickup in iPhone sales growth, Apple should be viewed as a value-oriented name, Mr. Zino said.\u201cHistorically Apple was the name to own if you wanted to outperform the market,\u201d he said. \u201cNow there are other places to look.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Media Titans Would Be Wise Not to Overlook Netflix", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtImagine you run a global media conglomerate. Say you\u2019re Robert A. Iger, the chief executive of Disney, or Brian L. Roberts, of Comcast, or perhaps you\u2019re slightly lower down on the ladder of behemoths \u2014 the boss of Twenty-First Century Fox or Time Warner, perhaps. In any case, you own a lot of valuable stuff: movie studios, broadcast and cable TV networks, perhaps a broadband infrastructure, maybe some theme parks with roller coasters and a few impressive castles.Yet Netflix is still a tiny frigate in the global sea of the content business, and surely it\u2019s no threat to the mightiest fleets in the industry. Your castles are safe, right?Well, here\u2019s a scarier proposition for you and your fellow media executives to ponder while roasting marshmallows by the fire at Davos next week. What if Netflix is the Amazon of the entertainment industry \u2014 the embodiment of a slow, expensive, high-risk effort to consume the entirety of your business?The good news for the Davos set is that there are lots of reasons that Netflix\u2019s strategy won\u2019t work. The bad news: So far, it just keeps working.Netflix\u2019s audacious strategy arouses strong feelings among folks on Wall Street. The company, based in Silicon Valley, is now valued at $50 billion, but many analysts rapturously say its efforts to reinvent TV could be worth several times more. Others find the ardor for Netflix to be nearly physically repulsive.\u201cI\u2019ve covered stocks for more than 15 years, and it\u2019s amazing how bad my idiot competitors are on this,\u201d said Michael Pachter of Wedbush Securities, who believes Netflix is highly overvalued. \u201cIt\u2019s like they drink the Kool-Aid and they\u2019re done.\u201dThe reason opinion is split is that, like Amazon before it, Netflix\u2019s business is so daring that it seems like it shouldn\u2019t work \u2014 and yet the company keeps surprising everyone. Observers and rivals were expecting Netflix to go global over the course of the next couple of years, not to open up just about everywhere on a single day. But the rest of the industry always seems to be a step or two behind in realizing the scope of Mr. Hastings\u2019s ambition.A capacity for surprise is the first and most obvious similarity between Netflix and Amazon. There are lots of others.Consider that like Mr. Bezos\u2019s retail machine, Netflix has been given leeway by investors to spend huge sums to build a globe-spanning video jukebox available to anyone. For Amazon, the investment was in warehouses; for Netflix, the money is being plowed into original content. During a speech at the International CES trade show last week, Ted Sarandos, Netflix\u2019s chief content officer, said the company would produce 600 hours of original programming in 2016, about double what it created last year, and on par with most major TV networks.In a recent note to investors, Nat Schindler, an analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, counted all the new shows Netflix is offering this year. He tallied 31 TV series, 10 feature films, 30 children\u2019s shows, 12 documentaries and 10 stand-up comedy specials.\u201cTo put it into perspective, you would have to watch Netflix for 25 days straight to consume all of its new original content next year,\u201d Mr. Schindler wrote.But Netflix isn\u2019t an ordinary TV producer. Like Amazon, it is amassing a cache of intelligence on what customers want, and it\u2019s using that data to create content that appeals to a wide range of demographics globally. In his CES speech, Mr. Sarandos argued that Netflix\u2019s business model and its data allowed it to produce shows that wouldn\u2019t have existed in traditional TV.\u201cTo make a baseball analogy, linear TV only scores with home runs,\u201d Mr. Sarandos said. \u201cWe score with home runs, too, but we also score with singles and doubles and triples.\u201dAnd finally, Netflix, like Amazon, is a flywheel that keeps spinning faster: As it gets more subscribers, it gets more data and more money to fund more content, which in turn helps it bring in more customers, and on and on, ever faster. Netflix barely ekes out a profit now, but the bulls say that as the flywheel spins, it will eventually begin earning enormous sums.They argue that Netflix will gain enough power in the content business to demand favorable pricing on content. Analysts also expect Netflix to begin raising its subscription fees, which are currently the most attractive in the media business. Customers streamed 12 billion hours of Netflix video during the last three months of 2015, the company says. That means customers paid around 14 cents per hour of Netflix, according to Rob Sanderson, an analyst at MKM Partners.\u201cCable is between 25 and 30 cents an hour \u2014 so Netflix is basically half,\u201d Mr. Sanderson said. \u201cIf you look at the dollars per hour of Netflix, there\u2019s nothing even close.\u201dAnd then there is Netflix\u2019s demonstrated ability to surprise with new ventures. Like Amazon\u2019s expansion from books to everything, Netflix grew from delivering DVDs to streaming old-run movies to, now, producing movies and TV shows. Some expect Netflix to keep moving deeper into the industry \u2014 to build its own studio, for instance. One day, if things keep going the way they are, maybe it, too, can have theme-park castles.There are Netflix skeptics, of course. Mr. Pachter argues that Netflix will have a difficult time lowering its content costs. As media giants realize Netflix is pulling away their best customers from cable, they will begin demanding more for licensing deals. He also predicted Netflix would have trouble raising subscription prices given increased competition from Amazon, which offers original programming as part of its Prime subscription service. (Prime costs $99 a year, about $20 less than a year of Netflix, and it includes free shipping.)Considering these hurdles, Mr. Pachter believes Netflix can create a modestly profitable business, just not a spectacular one. \u201cThese guys aren\u2019t going away \u2014 I just think the stock will drop to about $70 or $75,\u201d he said, from its current price of around $115. (In an email after the interview, Mr. Pachter revised his price target to \u201caround $60\u201d per share.) \u201cOtherwise, things just don\u2019t make sense. Because really, for Netflix to win, everyone else has to lose.\u201dAnd that can\u2019t happen. Right?Email: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjoo Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft Profit and Revenue Fall, but Cloud Computing Grows", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byOn Thursday the company said its revenue and profit fell in the last quarter. But it mattered little, as Microsoft made more from cloud computing, and its stock jumped more than 5 percent immediately after the numbers were released.The success of Microsoft\u2019s cloud business under Mr. Nadella, its new chief executive, has put the company\u2019s stock back in favor with investors. Even with recent anxiety in the stock market, Microsoft\u2019s shares are up more than 28 percent for the last year, while shares in rivals like Apple, Oracle and IBM have declined by double digits.By most analysts\u2019 estimates, Microsoft is in second place in the most prominent segment of the cloud services market \u2014 in which computer storage and other services in data centers are rented to customers \u2014 after Amazon. IBM and Google are next.For its second fiscal quarter, which ended on Dec. 31, the company reported net income of nearly $5 billion, or 62 cents a share, compared with $5.86 billion, or 71 cents a share, during the same period a year earlier.Revenue fell to $23.8 billion, down from $26.47 billion a year ago.The figures in the recent quarter reflected a huge deferral of revenue, almost $1.9 billion, related to Windows 10, the company\u2019s latest operating system. Although it collects all the cash up front from selling the software to PC makers and others, accounting rules dictate that the company has to spread its recognition of the money over the life of the product.Without that deferral, Microsoft had $25.69 billion in revenue and 78 cents a share in earnings, better than the average forecast of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters of 71 cents a share in earnings and $25.26 billion in revenue.Even without the Windows deferral, Microsoft\u2019s numbers declined from the previous year, in large part because the company in July sharply scaled back the ambitions of its money-losing smartphone business, acquired from Nokia. The company\u2019s phone revenue plummeted 49 percent when excluding foreign currency fluctuations as a result of the changes, which included cutting the number of smartphones it sells.Microsoft\u2019s cloud business encouraged investors. The company\u2019s intelligent cloud group, which includes its Azure service, rose 5 percent to $6.3 billion. It now has 20.6 million consumer subscribers to Office 365, the cloud version of its productivity applications, up from 9.2 million a year earlier.Last July, Microsoft introduced Windows 10, raising some hope in the industry of a rebound in PC sales. That rebound has not materialized yet.Global shipments of new PCs declined 8.3 percent during the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier, the research firm Gartner recently reported.The revenue Microsoft gets from PC makers for Windows declined 5 percent in the quarter, excluding foreign currency impacts. Revenue from its own Surface line of computers and tablets rose to $1.35 billion from $1.1 billion a year earlier.The company no longer charges most customers to upgrade existing computers to Windows 10, hoping to get as many people as possible running the latest operating system and wooing developers back to Windows. The company has lost considerable influence among developers, who have gravitated to Apple\u2019s iOS and Google\u2019s Android operating systems.In a phone interview, Amy Hood, Microsoft\u2019s chief financial officer, said Microsoft was not yet predicting a turnaround in the PC market. \u201cOur expectation for the PC market is roughly in line with most analysts,\u201d Ms. Hood said. \u201cFor the next year, we understand the market is not likely to grow, but we can still grow.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "She? Ze? They? What\u2019s In a Gender Pronoun", "Date": "2016-01-30", "News": "Supported byCommand ZWASHINGTON \u2014 What happens when 334 linguists, lexicographers, grammarians and etymologists gather in a stuffy lecture hall on a Friday night to debate the lexical trends of the year?They become the unlikely heroes of the new gender revolution.\u201cFunction words don\u2019t get enough love,\u201d a man argued from the floor. (Function words, I would later learn, are words that have little lexical meaning but serve to connect other words \u2014 or \u201cthe basic building blocks in language,\u201d according to Ben Zimmer, the event\u2019s M.C.)\u201cWe need to accept \u2018they,\u2019 and we need to do it now,\u201d shouted another linguist, hidden behind the crowds.\u201cAs a gender neutral pronoun, \u2018they\u2019 has been useful for a long time,\u201d said Anne Curzan, an English professor at the University of Michigan. ( \u201cThey\u201d can be found in the works of literary greats like Chaucer and Jane Austen.) \u201cBut I think we\u2019ve seen a lot of attention this year to people who are identifying out of the gender binary.\u201dGender binary: That\u2019s the idea that there are two distinct genders, one male and one female, with nothing in between.\u201cI think we, and particularly young people, increasingly view gender not as a given, but as a choice, not as a distinction between male and female, but as a spectrum, regardless of what\u2019s \u2018down there,\u2019\u201d said Julie Mencher, a psychotherapist in Northampton, Mass., who conducts school workshops on how to support transgender students. \u201cMany claim that gender doesn\u2019t even exist.\u201dIt does exist when it comes to language, though. He, she, hers, his, male, female \u2014 there\u2019s not much in between. And so has emerged a new vocabulary, of sorts: an attempt to solve the challenge of talking about someone who identifies as neither male nor female (and, inevitably, the linguistic confusion that comes along with it).These days, on college campuses, stating a gender pronoun has become practically as routine as listing a major. \u201cSo it\u2019s like: \u2018Hi, I\u2019m Evie. My pronouns are she/her/hers. My major is X,\u2019\u201d said Evie Zavidow, a junior at Barnard.Those are just the pronouns, of course.To use them, you need to have at least some knowledge of the identities to which they correspond \u2014 beginning with an understanding of the word \u201cidentity,\u201d along with its sister verb, \u201cidentify\u201d (as in: \u201cI identify as female\u201d or \u201cI identify as mixed-race\u201d).Among the additional words and terms the dictionary was updating for the year ahead: \u201ccode-switching,\u201d or modifying of one\u2019s behavior to adapt to different sociocultural norms; \u201csapiosexual,\u201d for a person who finds intelligence the most sexually attractive feature; and \u201cgender expression,\u201d or an expression of one\u2019s gender identity.\u201cIt\u2019s like the hyper-individuation of identity,\u201d said Micah Fitzerman-Blue, a writer and producer on \u201cTransparent,\u201d who calls himself cisgender (\u201ccis\u201d for short), meaning he identifies with the sex (male) he was assigned at birth (or A.A.B.). \u201cIs there such a thing as too many pronouns? Possibly. But who am I to pick and choose? Language has a way of sorting this stuff out.\u201dDoes it, though?In the second-to-last episode of last season\u2019s \u201cTransparent,\u201d there was a blip of a scene that perhaps crystallized this moment in time: Ali, played by Gaby Hoffmann, stood in front of a bulletin board in the gender studies department of a university campus, waiting to speak with a professor. Tacked to the wall was a flier illustrated with a pair of boxing gloves. \u201cGender Pronoun Showdown!\u201d it declared.It was prescient.And yet the learning curve remains.As for the pronouns: \u201cThey\u201d may or may not correspond with these identities \u2014 which is why it\u2019s in anybody\u2019s best interest to simply ask. But when you do, don\u2019t make the common mistake of calling it a preferred pronoun \u2014 as it is not considered to be \u201cpreferred.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not intuitive at all,\u201d her girlfriend, the lesbian poet Eileen Myles, said in the article.\u201cI think there are a lot of people who want to do the right thing but are struggling to play catch-up with this new gender revolution,\u201d said Ms. Mencher, a former transgender specialist at Smith College, which is one of a handful of historically women\u2019s colleges to begin accepting transgender students.\u201cI begin all my trainings with an invitation for participants to stumble over language, to risk being politically incorrect, to bungle their pronouns \u2014 in the service of learning,\u201d Ms. Mencher said.\u201cWhether it\u2019s the feminist movement of the 1970s or expressions of non-binary gender identities today,\u201d said Mr. Zimmer of the American Dialect Society, \u201csocial changes can help power these changes.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Netflix\u2019s Opaque Disruption Annoys Rivals on TV", "Date": "2016-01-17", "News": "Supported byPASADENA, Calif. \u2014 Tensions between Netflix and traditional television networks escalated this weekend after industry executives expressed mounting frustration over Netflix\u2019s refusal to disclose ratings. At a Television Critics Association event, NBC Universal introduced viewership figures last Wednesday provided by an outside firm that suggested several of Netflix\u2019s shows fall in line with broadcast and cable shows, implying that traditional television remains vibrant. On Saturday, John Landgraf, the chief executive of the cable network FX, picked up the theme, saying it was \u201cridiculous\u201d that Netflix did not release viewership numbers. Netflix\u2019s chief content officer, Ted Sarandos, shot back on Sunday, saying the numbers provided by NBC were \u201cremarkably inaccurate\u201d and asking why NBC would spend time and energy to \u201ctalk about our ratings.\u201d\u201cMaybe because it\u2019s more fun than talking about NBC ratings,\u201d he said.The pitched back-and-forth occurred as ratings are falling for broadcast and cable networks while Netflix\u2019s offerings of original programs are growing. Mr. Sarandos said that the streaming service would spend $6 billion on content this year, and original scripted programming would be part of that budget.Television executives have been frustrated because Mr. Sarandos has at times suggested Netflix shows would fare better than what is on cable and broadcast television. Last month, for instance, he said the Netflix show \u201cNarcos\u201d would be the most-viewed show on cable, not HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d\u201cNetflix brought it on themselves when they make assertions like their show would be the highest-rated cable show,\u201d Gary Newman, co-chief executive of the Fox Television Group, said in an interview. Likewise, Mr. Landgraf said in an interview, \u201cIf Ted doesn\u2019t give ratings, he shouldn\u2019t then be saying, \u2018This is the biggest hit in the history of blah blah blah.\u2019 He shouldn\u2019t say something is successful in quantitative terms unless you\u2019re willing to provide data and a methodology behind those statements. You can\u2019t have it both ways.\u201dThe battle over ratings began when Alan Wurtzel, NBC Universal\u2019s head of research, said on Wednesday that he was confronting the \u201c800-pound gorilla\u201d and gave the news media what he described as a \u201cNetflix reality check.\u201dRatings, particularly among 18- to 49-year-olds, dictate how much money cable and broadcast networks make from advertisers.Mr. Wurtzel provided data from a firm named Symphony Advanced Media, which uses audio content recognition installed on phones to recognize what is being watched and when. According to Symphony\u2019s data, the Netflix show \u201cJessica Jones\u201d was viewed by 4.8 million people within the first 35 days of its premiere in the 18- to 49-year-old bracket important to advertisers. In that demographic, Mr. Wurtzel said that, according to Symphony\u2019s data, \u201cMaster of None\u201d had 3.9 million viewers, \u201cNarcos\u201d had 3.2 million and Amazon\u2019s \u201cThe Man in the High Castle\u201d had 2.1 million viewers. Mr. Wurtzel said the data showed that when streaming-service shows debut, viewership is strong and then peters out after a few weeks before viewers return to watching cable or network television. \u201cMy only point is I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s enough stuff on Netflix that is broad enough and is consistent enough to affect us in a meaningful way on a regular basis,\u201d Mr. Wurtzel said.Mr. Newman, of Fox, was particularly interested in this.\u201cIf you look at the data, it\u2019s very compressed and it falls off,\u201d he said. \u201cOur shows tend to be in the cultural conversation for three to four months at a time. And I think that\u2019s powerful to our advertising partners.\u201dHe also said that the numbers were \u201cwithin the mid- to upper level of cable dramas and within the ballpark of what I\u2019d expect.\u201d Mr. Landgraf said that the data did not \u201cfeel rigorous enough.\u201d And Mr. Sarandos pushed back hard on Symphony\u2019s data, particularly its focus on 18- to 49-year-olds since Netflix sells subscriptions, not advertising based on a specific demographic. \u201cThe methodology and the measurement and the data itself don\u2019t reflect any sense of reality of anything that we keep track of,\u201d Mr. Sarandos said. \u201cThat could be because 18- to 49-year-old viewing is so insignificant to us I can\u2019t even tell how many 18- to 49-year-old members we have. We don\u2019t track it.\u201dMr. Sarandos, instead, pointed to the number of Netflix subscribers, which he said is about 70 million worldwide, and 43 million in the United States. In keeping with his public stance that Netflix would never release ratings, he said he did not want to engage in a \u201cweekly arms race.\u201d\u201cOnce we give a number for a show, then every show will be benchmarked off of that show even though they were built sometimes for very specific audiences,\u201d he said.He added: \u201cThere is a very natural inclination to say, \u2018Relative to this show, this show is a failure.\u2019 That puts a lot of creative pressure on the talent.\u201dMeanwhile, Mr. Landgraf said on Saturday that FX pursued \u201cMaster of None\u201d and Netflix\u2019s coming show, \u201cThe Crown,\u201d but the free-spending streaming service \u201coverwhelmed us with sort of shock\u2013and-awe levels of money and commitment.\u201d FX, he said, has to be profitable whereas Netflix does not have to worry about that now.\u201cI mean, basically, we are competing against payrolls \u00e0 la the Oakland A\u2019s and the New York Yankees that are three, four times ours,\u201d he said. He called it a \u201clittle frustrating\u201d because \u201cFX\u2019s earnings alone are many, many times higher than Netflix\u2019s globally, many times higher.\u201dAs for NBC\u2019s ratings numbers, Mr. Landgraf said that at some point Netflix\u2019s viewership levels would be reliably revealed.\u201cI think the national security apparatus of the United States has the right to secrecy,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a strategic need to that and what\u2019s at stake is the security of America. I don\u2019t think Netflix has that high a call on secrecy. If they\u2019re willing to be judged on merit and truth, they should put the information out there.\u201dAdvertisement"}

You can also search entries to locate a keyword.Momento is easy to use and offers plenty of on-screen guidance to help manage its more complicated features (such as backing up diary entries to iCloud). The app can automatically prompt you to write a diary entry, and you can set up several reminders, each with its own prompt, like \u201cTake a daily photo.\u201dYou can share entries with family and friends by iMessage or in an email, or even share online with a bigger audience on Facebook or elsewhere.Writing an entry in Askt is straightforward: It has a large empty page where you can type and embed photographs.

There is no search feature.The bells and whistles in this app are limited to setting a daily reminder, choosing the color scheme and exporting entries to a PDF file.

I\u2019ve got to say, I love earnings season. It\u2019s the one time we get a peek at some of the actual numbers that are often hidden in the murk of Silicon Valley puffery. And this week brought some big reversals.I wonder if we\u2019re witnessing what could be a long-term shift in Wall Street\u2019s attitude toward Jeff Bezos\u2019s shopping engine. For two decades, investors have been willing to let Bezos reinvest every penny Amazon makes into building out a bigger and bigger company. But last year, Amazon started to show investors some skimpy profits \u2014 which are, like, the actual point of running a business \u2014 and to everyone\u2019s surprise, people on Wall Street seemed to like the money, and now they seem to keep wanting more.So it will be interesting to watch Amazon\u2019s fortunes over the next year.

And if they do, will Jeff Bezos care?But you covered the earnings, so I\u2019ll let you take it away.No one was ready for it, as we spent years just building out advertising for larger screens. Entire companies were destroyed. There were ripple effects in adjacent companies that were deeply connected to Facebook. (Go look at Zynga before and after its I.P.O.) It was a total mess.Facebook went heads down and figured out how to create ads that aren\u2019t terrible and conform to a screen the size of a smartphone. And lo and behold, the company did it in an amazingly fast amount of time. In 2012, Facebook\u2019s mobile advertising revenues represented roughly 20 percent of the company\u2019s overall ad revenue. As of last quarter, that number has quadrupled to 80 percent. It\u2019s astounding how fast it was able to do it.That\u2019s why I always try to keep people\u2019s expectations of me incredibly low.

{"Headline": "The Eight Best Films T Saw at Sundance This Year", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Supported byEach year, there is a moment at Sundance when the murmurs begin and a narrative develops around a single film. Increasingly, this groundswell of admiration happens on Twitter, where one can either participate in the discourse or miss it completely. This year, however, it was hard to miss Sundance\u2019s big story. On Monday, Nate Parker\u2019s \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d premiered to rapturous applause \u2014 and by Tuesday morning, it had been rewarded with a blockbuster deal. Fox Searchlight bought the film for a reported $17.5 million, besting the previous Sundance record \u2014 held by 2006\u2019s \u201cLittle Miss Sunshine\u201d \u2014 by over $7 million. And by noon that day, after waiting in line for over an hour at a press screening of the film only to be stopped tantalizingly close to the front, I had missed the movie completely.Thankfully, there was plenty of good to go around at Sundance 2016. Here, a look at some favorites, as well as a preview of things to come in the year ahead.Philip Roth\u2019s books have proven particularly difficult to adapt, with the possible exception of the filmmaker Alex Ross Perry\u2019s 2014 Sundance film \u201cListen Up Philip,\u201d which \u2014 while not based on any one Roth novel \u2014 borrowed liberally from the author\u2019s ethos. That James Schamus does such a nimble job with this one, let alone in his directorial debut, is a tremendous feat. Schamus, the former Focus Features C.E.O. whose previous screenwriting output includes \u201cThe Ice Storm\u201d and \u201cCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,\u201d works wonders with the story of Marcus Messner, a fervent atheist who is admitted to a Christian college in Ohio during the Korean War. Logan Lerman, so good in 2012\u2019s \u201cThe Perks of Being a Wallflower,\u201d shines as the protagonist, but it\u2019s a nearly 15 minute t\u00eate-a-t\u00eate between Messner and the school\u2019s dean (a terrific Tracy Letts) \u2014 adapted by Schamus with an almost Tarantino-like zeal \u2014 that really steals the show.The best horror movie at Sundance may not explicitly be identified as such, but Andrew Neel\u2019s story (co-written with David Gordon Green and Mike Roberts) of masculinity run amok is nevertheless chilling. Nick Jonas shows surprising depth as a college student forced to confront the brutal realities of hazing after his 19-year-old brother pledges his fraternity. The film can be hard to watch as things spiral to a grisly ending, but there are important lessons to be learned for those who can hold on.13-year-old Morris (newcomer Markees Christmas) and his dad (Craig Robinson) are the only black people in Heidelberg, Germany. That could be the setup for a simple comedy of errors \u2014 instead, director Chad Hartigan (whose previous Sundance outing, \u201cThis Is Martin Bonner,\u201d won the Audience Award in the NEXT category in 2013) deftly combines Morris\u2019s fish-out-of-water experience with a coming-of-age story that is equal parts salty and sweet. Also of note: the pulsing hip-hop and electronic score by Keegan DeWitt \u2014 who is quickly becoming the go-to composer of Sundance \u2014 and the cinematographer Sean McElwee\u2019s gorgeous, textured shots of Heidelberg that set the scene.Casey Affleck is staggeringly good in this Kenneth Lonergan-helmed feature, which simmers along for nearly two hours before a devastating final act that raises questions about whether one can truly move on from unspeakable tragedy. Affleck plays Lee Chandler, a Boston handyman who must return to his childhood home after his 16-year-old nephew (Lucas Hedges, also excellent) is left without a guardian. The film sold to Amazon for a reported $10 million, setting up what should be a generous awards push in the fall.Over the years, Ira Sachs has become as close to a sure thing as there is at Sundance, and his latest effort is no different. Following in the wake of 2012\u2019s \u201cKeep the Lights On\u201d and the criminally underseen 2014 relationship drama \u201cLove Is Strange,\u201d \u201cLittle Men\u201d returns to Sachs\u2019s New York, this time with a focus on the city\u2019s rapid gentrification. By establishing tension between the film\u2019s adults, who quarrel over rent increases in a newly emerging Brooklyn neighborhood, and their sons, who just want to hang out and play video games, Sachs proves a keen observer of the impact that parents\u2019 decisions can have on their kids. He also infuses the proceedings with great warmth and humor, including what may well be the only scene set at a middle-school dance club this year.A mild sense of panic sets in the moment you hit \u201cplay\u201d on this mobile VR experience, which places the viewer inside a prison solitary confinement unit with little more than a cot and a toilet. The Guardian-produced film runs only seven minutes, but it makes each moment count: While actual inmates speak to you directly, the film begins to emulate the kind of psychological effects \u2014 blurred vision, hallucinations, a sense of floating \u2014 that may occur after long-term sensory deprivation. The resulting experience is especially timely in light of the recent ban on solitary confinement for juveniles, and a compelling case for the use of virtual reality as a tool for empathy.As often as Sundance movies can be uplifting, they can also be challenging and difficult to watch. After six hours of the latter on Sunday, the premiere of \u201cSing Street\u201d \u2014 the latest musical effort from the Irish filmmaker John Carney, of \u201cOnce\u201d acclaim \u2014 was a breath of fresh air. Set in 1980s Dublin, the film follows a down-on-his-luck 14-year-old named Conor (the singer-songwriter Ferdia Walsh-Peelo, making his feature debut) who forms a band to win the girl of his dreams (Lucy Boynton). The laughs come hard and fast when Conor and his friends start showing up for school dressed like Duran Duran and the Smiths, and the songs \u2014 written by Carney with \u201980s hitmaker Gary Clark \u2014 should have audiences singing long after they leave the theater. Acquired by the Weinstein Company in 2014, the film should be released later this year.Advertisement"}

Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, as well as top executives from Facebook, Twitter and Google. \u201cGiven the way the technology works these days, there surely are ways that we can disrupt paths to radicalization, to identify recruitment patterns and to provide metrics that allow us to measure the success of our counter-radicalization efforts,\u201d Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said before the meeting began in California.A task force will be created in the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department to coordinate the government\u2019s new effort. The State Department announced the creation of a center to respond to disinformation from extremist groups by highlighting their misdeeds and creating positive images of the West. It hopes to cultivate a global network of governments and nongovernmental organizations to help the effort. After the terrorist attack last year that killed 130 people in Paris, President Obama delivered a series of speeches seeking to reassure the country while demanding rapid changes within the administration to improve responses to jihadist propaganda. But the State Department has largely foundered in its efforts to fashion the kind of war room that would effectively counter the propaganda flowing out of the Islamic State, which is widely seen as adept at using social media to recruit and inspire followers.For help with these challenges, the administration turned on Friday to Silicon Valley. \u201cI do have a lot of confidence that those companies that are run by patriotic Americans are not interested in seeing their tools or their technology used by terrorists to harm innocent Americans,\u201d Mr. Earnest said.Those executives, however, are in charge of global corporations whose revenues are increasingly derived from people outside the United States. The executives have long pushed back on demands by governments to censor posts, provide access to user accounts, or hand over the keys to encryption technologies. If the companies begin to work with the government to monitor and remove posts or create antiterrorism counternarratives, they might have a harder time resisting similar requests from foreign governments.\u201cIt\u2019s a slippery slope with free speech where if you start making exceptions, where do you stop and where do you draw the line?\u201d said Emma Llanso, a director at the Center for Democracy in Technology, a think tank. She said the consequence could be an erosion of trust by consumers. That erosion of trust began in the wake of revelations from Edward J. Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor, who showed previous coordination among some technology companies with American surveillance efforts. Executives are eager to avoid a repeat.There is also the technological challenge of sifting through vast amounts of user-generated content in different languages on a growing number of platforms.Law enforcement officials for years have expressed frustration that technology companies are increasingly creating products like smartphones with encryption technologies that make it difficult, if not impossible, for the government to monitor conversations. But the discussion on Friday, while touching on encryption issues, was expected to focus largely on how social media companies could more effectively police their platforms. Some former top administration officials now work at prominent technology firms, including Jay Carney, a former White House press secretary, who is now a senior vice president at Amazon. Megan Smith, the administration\u2019s chief technology officer, who worked at Google, and Alexander Macgillivray, the administration\u2019s deputy chief technology officer, who worked at Twitter, both attended the meeting on Friday in California.\u201cThis meeting is the latest in the administration\u2019s continuing dialogue with technology providers and others to ensure we are bringing our best private and public sector thinking to combating terrorism,\u201d said Melanie R. Newman, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Adele Album Resists the Streaming Trend in Music Sales", "Date": "2016-01-05", "News": "Supported byFor the last few years, the prevailing theme in the recorded music business has been that CD and download sales were plunging while streaming has shot up quickly, as listening habits shift online.Last year, 241.4 million albums were sold in the United States, down 6 percent from 2014, according to data released on Tuesday by Nielsen. CDs, once the music industry\u2019s most powerful profit engine, declined to just 125.6 million units last year, a decline of 11 percent from 2014 and 82 percent from their peak in 2001. Nielsen tracks the number of units sold, but not their sales revenue.Downloads of complete albums last year dropped 3 percent to 103.3 million, and downloads of individual songs fell 12.5 percent to 964.8 million, dipping below one billion for the first time since 2007.At the same time, streaming activity nearly doubled in 2015. On-demand audio and video streams on outlets like Spotify, YouTube and Apple Music \u2014 which, unlike radio services, allow users to pick exactly what songs to listen to \u2014 were up 93 percent, to 317.2 billion songs played. Of those, 144.9 billion were audio-only streams. These services, which also include Tidal, Rhapsody and Google Play, let people listen online to millions of songs for subscriptions of $10 or less, or free with advertising.The album was Adele\u2019s first in nearly five years, and was promoted through television appearances, but \u2014 in another break with what has become standard practice in pop \u2014 the singer herself was relatively quiet on social media.

{"Headline": "\u2018Mein Kampf,\u2019 Hitler\u2019s Manifesto, Returns to German Shelves", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "Supported byThe effort by the Institute of Contemporary History in Munich to publish the new, critical edition was the subject of debate almost as soon as it was announced, with some seeing it as an important step toward illuminating an unsavory era in Germany, never to be repeated, while others argued that a scholarly edition would legitimize the rantings of a sociopath who led the country down the path of evil.Andreas Wirsching, the director of the institute, acknowledged that debate at a news conference on Friday in Munich, where Hitler staged the unsuccessful Beer Hall Putsch in 1923, landing him in jail, where he passed the time working on the book.\u201cNevertheless, there is widespread agreement on a decisive point,\u201d Mr. Wirsching said. \u201cIt would be completely irresponsible to allow this jumble of inhumanity to be released into the public domain without commentary, without countering it through critical references that put the text and its author in their place.\u201dSome historians and education experts welcomed the new edition as part of modern Germany\u2019s pledge to \u201cnever forget, never repeat\u201d the atrocities committed under Hitler, through education and critical examination.\u201cWe concern ourselves with clarification,\u201d said Winfried Nerdinger, the director of the Documentation Center for the History of National Socialism in Munich, which opened last year. \u201cOur understanding of the critical publication is that it will do the same.\u201dCritics argue that issuing a new edition, even one that contains thousands of painstaking historical notes, is but a further step in a process to defang Hitler and lessen the crimes for which he bears responsibility.\u201cIt\u2019s probably inevitable \u2014 the process of \u2018normalizing\u2019 Hitler into just another tyrant, whose words are to be parsed and contextualized,\u201d said Ron Rosenbaum, the author of \u201cExplaining Hitler,\u201d considered one of the definitive examinations of the Nazi dictator\u2019s mind. \u201cNonetheless, it feels deeply disturbing, especially when Hitler\u2019s image has returned in hate rallies around the world.\u201d\u201cFor many survivors, a new publication is a fresh slap in the face that damages Germany\u2019s international reputation,\u201d said R\u00fcdiger Mahlo, the German representative of the claims conference. \u201cSuch irrational racist slogans should not be spread anywhere, least of all in Germany.\u201dThe introduction to the new edition describes Hitler\u2019s writing as \u201chalf-baked, incoherent and difficult to read,\u201d partly because of the many grammatical errors. It goes on to examine how the work laid out the four ideas on which Hitler based his worldview and that later formed the basis of Nazi ideology: race, space, violence and dictatorship.Christian Hartmann, the leader of a team of five historians at the Institute of Contemporary History, described the annotation process as a painstaking and difficult \u201cmetamorphosis\u201d from the original to the critical edition. Each historian was assigned a chapter, he said, but the final notations were discussed and agreed on by the group.\u201cOf course there were differences of opinion, but these were mostly productive,\u201d Mr. Hartmann said, crediting the assistance of dozens of international experts.For example, a passage in which Hitler refers to \u201cthe black-haired Jewish boy,\u201d is marked with a reference to a historical note that remarks, \u201cThe image of the \u2018black-haired Jew\u2019 was a widespread clich\u00e9.\u201d It goes on to cite other authors who used the phrase in the early 1930s, as well as a clinical study by the anthropologist Rudolf Virchow from the late 19th century that sought to debunk the myth.\u201cI think that German society is really ready for such a critical examination of the work,\u201d Mr. Hartmann said, adding that despite the intellectual nature of the new edition, the historians made an effort to ensure that it be accessible for a wide readership, whether in schools or society.Excerpts from \u201cMein Kampf,\u201d as well as letters and other Nazi texts, similarly critically annotated, have long been taught in German schools. Last month, the president of the German Association of Teachers, Josef Kraus, argued for integrating the new edition into high school classrooms, as part of efforts to educate young Germans about the dangers of extremist thinking and the atrocities carried out by previous generations.\u201cSchools cannot ignore \u2018Mein Kampf,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Kraus said, noting that forbidding the work would only drive up interest in the original volume, easily available online. \u201cIt is far better they be introduced to \u2018Mein Kampf\u2019 by trained, experienced history and political teachers.\u201dDespite the edition\u2019s heft \u2014 the two volumes together weigh more than 10 pounds \u2014 and an announced price of 59 euros, or about $64, sales have already exceeded expectations. The Institute of Contemporary History had to increase its initial run of 4,000 copies after receiving about 15,000 pre-orders before Friday\u2019s release, Mr. Wirsching said.Ian Kershaw, a British historian who has written about Hitler, noted the importance of finally having an annotated version of the work for German and historical studies, but cautioned against expecting too much from the new edition. Calling the interest surrounding its publication a \u201cnine-day wonder,\u201d he said it would not have a lasting impact on the myth surrounding the original in many parts of the world.\u201cThe countries that abuse \u2018Mein Kampf\u2019 will continue to do so,\u201d Mr. Kershaw added. \u201cI don\u2019t think this edition will discourage or prevent that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Global Tensions Threaten to Upstage World Economic Forum in Davos", "Date": "2016-01-18", "News": "Supported byTensions reminiscent of the Cold War keep flaring with Russia and in the Middle East \u2014 not to mention over the Korean Peninsula. Europe is struggling to cope with a refugee crisis that risks fracturing the European Union, even as the bloc tries to counter a rising security threat from the Islamic State. Britain may vote this year on whether to leave the European Union altogether. And China\u2019s growth slowdown could prompt the second global financial crisis within a decade.Given those strains, the official Davos theme this time \u2014 \u201cMastering the Fourth Industrial Revolution\u201d \u2014 may sound oddly out of tune, and the various panels on the topic could prove to be little more than sideshows.Klaus Schwab, the World Economic Forum\u2019s founder and one of the best-connected men on the planet, is nonetheless using the forum\u2019s website to urge the cadre of bankers, politicians, tech executives and trend makers to ponder \u201cthe fusion of technologies across the physical, digital and biological worlds, which is creating entirely new capabilities and dramatic impacts on political, social and economic systems.\u201dThe big-thought themes of Davos often billow above current events. Last year, the topic was \u201cThe New Global Context,\u201d a reference to shifting political, economic and social forces in the world. The year before focused on the \u201cReshaping of the World.\u201d If such banners are somewhat elusive, so, too, is the gathering\u2019s ability to map solutions to more immediate problems.But then, problem-solving is not really the point. More than anything, Davos, at about 5,120 feet, is about high-altitude networking.The forum is where hedge fund managers, central bankers, chief executives, social-media magnates, heads of state, self-help gurus, artists, celebrities, fashion models and even archbishops engage in the equivalent of intellectual or corporate speed dating. If all goes well, they may pry open a possible business deal, pad out a contact list or maybe receive enlightenment about affairs outside their professional expertise.Many deal makers retreat to hotel suites for much of the conference, forsaking the official program in favor of a whirl of meetings, emerging only to attend private parties in exclusive chalets on the Davos slopes or invitation-only power dinners.This year\u2019s tech luminaries are to include Jack Ma, the head of China\u2019s online retail giant Alibaba; John T. Chambers, the chief of Cisco Systems, the Internet hardware maker; Eric E. Schmidt, executive chairman of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company; and Sheryl K. Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook.And then there are the captains of the financial industry, including Jamie Dimon, the head of JPMorgan Chase; Gary D. Cohn, Goldman Sachs\u2019s chief operating officer; and top executives from most of the world\u2019s major banks.Also on hand will be a host of regulators who oversee the big banks, including Jacob J. Lew, the United States Treasury secretary, as well as an influential coterie of central bankers who determine monetary policy, including Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank.Foremost among their concerns this year may be whether problems in China, whose rapidly slowing economy has rattled stock and commodity markets around the world, could cause a relapse into global financial instability just as Europe and the United States are recovering from the last crisis. No clear remedies are likely to emerge from Davos, though, because top leaders from China, as in years past, will not be present.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France are conspicuously avoiding the gathering this year, judging it more effective to grapple with pressing problems back home.And then there is the controversy surrounding North Korea. Last fall, the conference organizers took the unusual step of inviting a delegation from Pyongyang. But shortly after North Korea trumpeted a nuclear bomb test on Jan. 5, the Davos organizers disinvited the delegates \u2014 prompting North Korean officials to declare the snub \u201cseriously unjust.\u201dAnd yet, in the honeycomb of private side rooms inside the old nuclear bunker where the main conference takes place, or on the leather couches of the nearby five-star Belvedere Hotel, a favorite place for private dinners and parties, there are always opportunities for key players to make progress on thorny subjects.This year, for instance, Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, is expected to meet on the sidelines with Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece, who defied the fund and Europe\u2019s political elite for many months last year over the terms of a multibillion-euro bailout, risking his country\u2019s exit from the eurozone. More recently, Mr. Tsipras, having turned from a defender of the poor to a mainstream leader eager to save Greece from further financial turmoil, is expected to try to persuade Ms. Lagarde to send more of the fund\u2019s money to Athens.And even if no big policy breakthroughs are achieved, at least there will be star power. Justin Trudeau, the youthful new Canadian prime minister, will give a keynote address aiming to sell a fresh image of Canada to the world.The stalwarts will continue to show up, including Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, who may be pressing his case that Britain should stay in the European Union if the bloc is willing to cut his country a new deal. From the United States, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is leading a delegation including Secretary of State John Kerry and Ashton Carter, the secretary of defense.As for the movers and shakers who have not had time to brush up on this year\u2019s official theme \u2014 how artificial intelligence and robotics are changing humanity \u2014 Mr. Schwab, the forum\u2019s founder, has conveniently published a new book, \u201cThe Fourth Industrial Revolution.\u201dA link on the World Economic Forum\u2019s website whisks readers to Amazon, where the 4,300-kilobyte e-book can be purchased for about $8 \u2014 a digital value that no billionaire should be able to resist.Advertisement"}

And in many of the 190 countries where Netflix now is available \u2014 including Turkey, Russia and Poland \u2014 the service is available in English, but not the local language.\u201cWe still have a lot of work to do,\u201d Reed Hastings, chief executive of Netflix, said in a telephone interview Wednesday afternoon. \u201cBecause of the number of countries, it seems like we are ahead of plan. But we still have China \u2014 we still have a quarter of the world to go.\u201d\u201cRight now, you are witnessing the birth of a global TV network,\u201d Mr. Hastings said from the stage in a keynote address. A montage of global flags scrolled in the background followed by a map of the world emblazoned with the hashtag #netflixeverywhere.\u201cWhether you are in Sydney or St. Petersburg, Singapore or Seoul, Santiago or Saskatoon, you now can be part of the Internet TV revolution,\u201d Mr. Hastings added.The proclamation was a bold move from Netflix to address growing skepticism about whether it can sustain its breakneck expansion and deliver on its promises.Costs are running high for Netflix. In addition to its global rollout, the company plans to spend more than $6 billion in cash on programming in 2016, offering more than 600 hours of original series, films and other content. And after running roughly at break-even profitability through this year, Netflix has pledged to deliver material global profits starting in 2017.International expansion is increasingly crucial for the company as growth slows in the United States. The opportunity is big. While the United States has about 100 million broadband households, according to SNL Kagan, that is just a fraction of the 730 million total global broadband households.Yet there are steep challenges, including whether Netflix will be able to land programming rights to series that appeal to customers around the globe and compete with local streaming rivals.\u201cInternational is really the place where people have a bigger sense of debate,\u201d said Michael Nathanson, a media analyst with MoffettNathanson Research. \u201cIt has never been attempted before.\u201dMr. Hastings said that Netflix was now in about 70 million homes and he expected the number of customers outside the United States to surpass the number domestically at some point in 2017. Netflix\u2019s long-term goal is to reach 60 million to 90 million subscribers in the United States, but has yet to set a similar target internationally.Around the globe, Netflix will be available for one monthly price \u2014 in India that is 500 rupees, or about $7.50 \u2014 and global subscribers will be able to watch Netflix original series as well as a library of licensed television shows and movies. Netflix said that in 2016 it planned to release 31 new and returning original series, 24 films and documentaries, 30 original children series and stand-up comedy specials. They will become available to all subscribers at the same time around the world.Netflix also announced that it was including Arabic, Korean and simplified and traditional Chinese to the 17 languages already available.The service will not be available in Crimea, North Korea and Syria because of United States government restrictions on American companies.China remains the major unanswered question, analysts said. \u201cThat is the big wild card that Netflix and investors are waiting for,\u201d said William V. Power, analyst at Baird Equity Research. \u201cThe questions are: Just how do you tackle that market with the various governmental or regulatory obstacles? Can they go it alone or do they partner with somebody?\u201dMr. Hastings said that Netflix continued to explore its options in China but that establishing a service there could take many months or even some years. \u201cWe are building relationships and trying to be very patient,\u201d Mr. Hastings said. \u201cThe strategy is to think very long term, to be like Disney, Apple or Starbucks in China.\u201dWall Street is watching Netflix\u2019s moves carefully. The company\u2019s share price surged 135 percent in 2015, making it the top performer on the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. But some analysts question whether the company can maintain the momentum. On Monday, Netflix shares dropped after an analyst downgraded the company\u2019s stock, citing concerns over weaker-than-expected subscriber growth in the United States.Mr. Power, the analyst at Baird who downgraded the stock, outlined other risks, including escalating content costs, international expansion and rising competition from Amazon, Hulu and YouTube.\u201cGiven Netflix\u2019s high valuation, any missteps could prompt outsize movement in the stock,\u201d Mr. Power said.On Wednesday, Netflix shares increased about 9 percent.Advertisement"}

He pronounced himself mystified by the likes of Mr. Shkreli. \u201cWhat\u2019s the first line of the Miranda warning? \u2018You have the right to remain silent.\u2019\u201dMr. O\u2019Connor said that when police officers say, \u201cAnything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law,\u201d they really mean it. \u201cWhy would you want to go on social media, where they don\u2019t even need a subpoena, and say things that could be used against you?\u201dIt\u2019s great for clients\u2019 lawyers and friends to say how wonderful they are, but as for the executives facing legal trouble themselves, he says, \u201cYou want to keep your mouth shut.\u201dThere is nothing novel about this advice, he said: \u201cI\u2019ve never been in a situation where a lawyer or P.R. counsel says, \u2018Hey, get out there and open your yap.\u2019\u201dWhat does this mean for the future? I wonder whether the quiet period before an initial public offering of stock \u2014 a blessedly silent interlude when executives are prohibited from speaking out and influencing public opinion \u2014 is doomed.More generally, many corporate espionage strategies, and sophisticated market research programs, could become utterly pointless. Just check a C.E.O.\u2019s Pinterest and Instagram accounts. Maybe Tinder, too. It\u2019s all out there, baby!Vanity might finally lead to true corporate transparency. How wonderful if corporate America used Twitter even more!All of it, eventually, would be a guide for investors. Give money to this company? To this entrepreneur or that one? Well, how do they sound online? I can only imagine what the real Steve Jobs would have done with a Twitter account by now. Or how Henry Ford would have fared if he had committed anti-Semitic gaffes in a social media world.Yes, strip away the layer of handlers and let us see what these giants are really like and what we think of their judgment and boldness then. We will make decisions accordingly.Of course, if Twitter leads C.E.O.s to actually start losing money \u2014 well, that\u2019s when they will finally put a sock in it. Silence will once again be golden when not being silent means having less gold.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "G.E. Is Moving Headquarters to Boston and Itself Into the Digital Era", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported byYet Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chief executive, predicted last September that G.E. would be a \u201ctop 10 software company\u201d by 2020. In recent years, the company has steadily built up its software business, and its industrial products are increasingly loaded with digital sensors, all part of an effort to be a leader in the \u201cindustrial Internet.\u201dNow, in its latest step to remake itself \u2014 and its public image \u2014 as an industrial company for the digital era, G.E. said it was moving its headquarters from its longtime sprawling suburban home in Fairfield, Conn., to the high-tech environs of Boston.The relocation by G.E., long a bellwether of the American economy, illustrates how much old-line companies in nearly every industry have been forced to rethink their businesses for a digital age. It is an opportunity, but also a threat. So Walmart is investing heavily in online commerce to meet the challenge from Amazon, and Ford and General Motors are retooling to keep up with innovators like Tesla and Google.The Boston region, Mr. Immelt said, is \u201can ecosystem that shares our aspirations.\u201dThe area is crowded with 55 colleges and universities, including research centers like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard and Northeastern University. G.E. said it was also attracted by the area\u2019s thriving venture capital and start-up community, and pro-business state and local government.In Fairfield, G.E. has about 800 employees, a tiny percentage of its 360,000 employees worldwide. In Boston, G.E. will also have 800 people, but it will have a different kind of headquarters setting, the company said.Only about 200 will be corporate staff, G.E. said, while the remaining 600 will be mainly \u201cdigital industrial product managers, designers and developers\u201d in a variety of disciplines including data analysis, life sciences and robotics.The new headquarters will be leaner, faster and more open with a constant flow of industry partners, customers and innovators, G.E. executives say. The intent, they say, is that it will be more like walking into a start-up in an urban setting than the remote suburban headquarters of the past.The move fits the recent pattern at G.E., analysts say. \u201cIt affirms G.E.\u2019s digital technology orientation and that strategic commitment for decades ahead,\u201d said Steven Winoker, an analyst at Bernstein Research.For years already, G.E. has been at the forefront of industrial companies seeking to use sensor data and clever software to make its machines smarter, using less fuel and predicting when they need maintenance before breakdowns occur. Executives routinely call it \u201can industrial digital business.\u201dG.E.\u2019s digital push is part of the company\u2019s evolution, as it has focused its investment on the industrial side of its business while sharply cutting its once-huge finance arm in the wake of the financial crisis. In 2011, G.E. opened a separate software unit in San Ramon, Calif., which employs 2,000.The company moved to Fairfield in 1974, when many major companies were leaving New York City for suburbia with its lower taxes and living costs, and good public schools. G.E. first said it was weighing moving its headquarters last June, after Connecticut proposed raising taxes on businesses to close the state budget gap.That prompted G.E. to address the issue with urgency but, in its statement on Wednesday, G.E. said its senior management had been considering the appropriate role and location of its headquarters for more than three years.G.E. has not identified the address of its new headquarters, but the company said it would be in the Seaport District in South Boston, which is becoming a hub for investment by technology, biomedical and pharmaceutical companies.Massachusetts and Boston are offering an ample package of incentives. In news releases welcoming G.E., Gov. Charlie Baker and Mayor Martin J. Walsh said the state offered incentives of as much as $120 million through grants and other programs, and the city offered as much as $25 million in property tax relief.The city and state also agreed to make transportation improvements in the Seaport District and to build an innovation center where G.E. and university researchers can collaborate.Employees will move to a temporary location in Boston starting this summer, G.E. said, with the permanent move completed by 2018.G.E. said that the financial incentives from state and city governments vying for its headquarters were competitive. In the financial negotiations, G.E. wanted incentives and grants to make the move itself essentially cost-free for the company, said a person involved in the talks who was not authorized to speak publicly. But G.E. did not seek tax deals that would continue year after year, he said.In its statement, G.E. said it began its search with an initial list of 40 locations. San Francisco was ruled out partly because of its high living costs, and the longer time difference \u2014 by three hours, compared with the East Coast \u2014 in communicating with G.E.\u2019s units in Europe, where the company has a sizable business. Other cities, including New York, made strong bids, but in the end it was Boston, the person involved in the talks said. G.E. did not estimate the extent of the job losses in Connecticut as a result of the move. The company employs 5,000 people in the state, including the 800 at its headquarters.Jess Bidgood contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Belgium\u2019s Tax Break to Multinational Companies Is Ruled Illegal", "Date": "2016-01-11", "News": "Supported byAnheuser-Busch also uses a range of other tax benefits in Belgium, where the parent company has its headquarters, and paid a tiny fraction of 1 percent on its reported profit there of $1.93 billion in 2014. The European Commission said on Monday that the Belgian government would be required to recover the unpaid taxes from the companies involved, which the commission said it might identify at a later date. Although the financial amounts are unlikely to pose a hardship to the companies that would be forced to pay back taxes, Monday\u2019s decision would put big companies and European governments on further notice that the European Commission means to crack down on special tax arrangements with companies.Other international companies that took advantage of the Belgian tax break included the British oil giant BP and the German chemicals group BASF, according to a person with direct knowledge of the investigation who spoke only on the condition of anonymity. Others, this person said, included Atlas Copco, a Swedish tool and equipment company, and Wabco, an American maker of vehicle parts.The ruling, part of a series of investigations led by the European Union\u2019s competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, found that Belgium had given unfair tax advantages to certain companies \u2014 advantages that were not available to other companies doing business in Belgium.Ms. Vestager\u2019s effort is part of the commission\u2019s response to the economic problems in Europe that have left many governments struggling to balance their budgets \u2014 leaning on small taxpayers impatient with what they perceive as loopholes given to big businesses. Other governments in the 28-nation European Union have accused smaller players like Belgium of dangling tax deals to attract big multinational companies in ways they say end up driving down tax revenue throughout the bloc.And in some cases, United States tax officials and lawmakers have criticized some European countries\u2019 tax arrangements as enabling multinationals to illegally shield profit on which the companies should be paying American taxes.The ruling on Monday leaves Belgium in an awkward position.Johan Van Overtveldt, the Belgian finance minister, said he would take careful account of the decision even as he told investors that he would defend their interests. He also cited \u201cthe possibility of an appeal against the decision.\u201d\u201cWhile we are disappointed by this decision, we remain confident that our tax rulings are in full compliance with the E.U. jurisprudence on state aid and that we have always complied with Belgian and international tax provisions,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe will consider our options, taking into account the reactions by the Belgian authorities.\u201dThe commission opened a formal investigation into the Belgian arrangements in February 2014. At issue is a so-called excess profits tax break given to multinational companies that move businesses to Belgium. The idea, according to the Belgian authorities, is to ensure that companies do not end up paying taxes on the same profits more than once.Belgium set up the system about a decade ago, partly to persuade companies to relocate a substantial part of their activities there or to make significant investments in the country. The deductions were based on reducing the amount of taxable profits of the companies involved, usually by 50 to 90 percent. The tax break was marketed by the Belgian tax authority under the logo \u201cOnly in Belgium,\u201d according to the European Commission.\u201cThe scheme does not even require companies to demonstrate any evidence or even risk of double taxation,\u201d the commission said in a statement on Monday. \u201cInstead of preventing double taxation, in reality the scheme gives a \u2018carte blanche\u2019 to double nontaxation.\u201dMs. Vestager said at a news conference on Monday, \u201cI must say, when I see the material used to promote the scheme, that it is understandable that a company would like to use the scheme.\u201dShe urged Belgium to change its tax treatment so that multinationals are taxed like \u201cthe rest of companies being taxed in Belgium.\u201dMr. Van Overtveldt said the government had already suspended the system by granting no more excess-profit tax breaks since February last year. If the company does not appeal the ruling, he said the next stage would be a period of \u201cfurther negotiations with Europe regarding the possible reimbursements.\u201dIf such payments are necessary, \u201cthe consequences for the companies concerned would be considerable and the reimbursement itself would be particularly complex,\u201d Mr. Van Overtveldt said.Advertisement"}

But this is an era in which executives are increasingly reluctant to cancel a show quickly.\u201cWe believe in the show,\u201d Mr. Pedowitz said. \u201cWe stand by the show.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re going to give it a chance to get seen.\u201dAline Brosh McKenna, the show\u2019s co-creator, suggested that binge viewing could help it find an audience.\u201cIt\u2019s an unusual show,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of my favorite shows are shows that took a little while to catch on, or maybe people discovered a little bit later they had bought the season pass from iTunes.\u201dGlenn Geller, the new president of CBS Entertainment, presented at the event for the first time last week and said that he was going to pick right up at the network where his predecessor, Nina Tassler, left off.Mr. Geller said Ms. Tassler \u201cliked strong and narrative stories just like I do. She loved strong central characters just like I do. I don\u2019t think that will ever change. Our brand works. Our audience loves it, and I love our shows too.\u201dCase in point: As serialized programming becomes more and more popular on television, and procedurals are falling out of favor, CBS won\u2019t be abandoning its bread-and-butter programming, even in the era of bingeing.\u201cThe No. 2 show on television is a regular old procedural in \u2018NCIS,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Geller said. \u201cThere\u2019s a great interest in shows that are about the good guys putting the bad guys away.\u201dMr. Geller did make a strong defense for Stephen Colbert, whose \u201cLate Show\u201d has struggled to find a devoted viewership.\u201cI think the show is fantastic, and we want Stephen to be Stephen. And that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s doing,\u201d he said. \u201cI think he is clearly the pre-eminent interviewer in late night.\u201dAt the Golden Globes last week, Amazon became the first programmer in nine years to win the best comedy series award for two consecutive years for two different shows. The streaming service won last year for \u201cTransparent,\u201d and this year for the relatively obscure \u201cMozart in the Jungle.\u201d (ABC won consecutively in 2005-6 with \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d and \u201cUgly Betty.\u201d)\u201cI think that\u2019s the good part about the Globes,\u201d said Joe Lewis, Amazon\u2019s head of comedy, at the company\u2019s post-awards party. \u201cThey are able to look at shows that might not get the broadest audience, and that\u2019s what we try to do. We\u2019re not trying to make everyone\u2019s third-favorite show.\u201dThe next morning, Roy Price, the head of Amazon Studios, said in an interview that Woody Allen\u2019s much-anticipated show for the streaming service would begin filming in the spring and would debut later this year.There are cord-cutters and cord-nevers, and now Showtime\u2019s president, David Nevins, has added a new term to the television industry lexicon: Cord-cobblers. To recap: A cord-cutter is someone who has cable and cancels; a cord-never is usually a younger person who has no intention of ever subscribing to cable. So what exactly is a cord-cobbler?Mr. Nevins \u2014 who said someone else came up with this term \u2014 explained that a cord-cobbler is \u201cmuch more likely to have Hulu, Netflix, Amazon, and so you\u2019re seeing a phenomenon of a lot of people putting things together that they care about.\u201d(Showtime has its own stand-alone app, too.)And Showtime\u2019s shows are now going to be staggered throughout the year, less concerned with, say, making sure \u201cHomeland\u201d is a lead-in for \u201cThe Affair.\u201dMr. Nevins said that David Lynch was more than halfway through his shooting schedule for the much-anticipated revival of \u201cTwin Peaks.\u201d It will debut in the first half of next year, he said. And, he added, the sixth season of \u201cHomeland\u201d will be filming in and around New York City.Fox is jumping on the live-musical bandwagon, with \u201cGrease: Live,\u201d broadcasting this month, and, in March, \u201cThe Passion,\u201d a musical about Jesus Christ\u2019s final days. And later this year, it will unveil another musical, \u201cThe Rocky Horror Picture Show.\u201dNBC unleashed the live-musical genre in recent years with its productions of \u201cThe Sound of Music,\u201d \u201cPeter Pan,\u201d and, most recently, \u201cThe Wiz.\u201d But Fox sees the musical business as true to its brand.\u201cMusic is so much a part of the Fox DNA,\u201d said Dana Walden, co-chief executive of Fox Television Group. Gary Newman, the other chief executive, pointed to \u201cGlee\u201d and \u201cEmpire\u201d as examples that illustrate Fox\u2019s music bona fides.These sort of musicals generally lose money, But in creating live television events in an industry hungry for them, they serve as important promotional platforms for other shows on the network.In the meantime, NBC Entertainment\u2019s chairman, Robert Greenblatt \u2014 who announced that \u201cHairspray\u201d would probably be the network\u2019s next live musical \u2014 made reference to the fact that ABC is working on a \u201cDirty Dancing\u201d musical and took a small victory lap at his Television Critics Association session: \u201cIf we spawned a little kind of uprising of musicals,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\u2019s great.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Macy\u2019s to Cut 4,500 Jobs, After Holiday Sales Slump ", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byMacy\u2019s said on Wednesday that it would eliminate about 4,500 jobs, or about 3 percent of its work force, in a major restructuring drive. It said slumping holiday season sales had hurt its bottom line.The department store chain\u2019s holiday woes were a harbinger of what could be a difficult winter for retailing. The consumer electronics and home furnishings merchant Hhgregg reported an 11 percent plunge in sales in the fourth quarter at stores open for at least a year.Macy\u2019s said sales at its Macy\u2019s and Bloomingdale\u2019s stores fell 4.7 percent in November and December, partly because unseasonably warm weather across much of the country discouraged shoppers from buying coats and other outerwear. The company also blamed a stronger dollar, saying that weighed on spending by international tourists.\u201cThe holiday selling season was challenging, as experienced throughout 2015 by much of the retailing industry,\u201d Terry J. Lundgren, Macy\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.Four-fifths of the company\u2019s sales declines could be traced to a drop in demand for coats, sweaters, boots, hats, gloves and scarves, Mr. Lundgren said.Macy\u2019s aims to save $400 million a year from various cutbacks and a streamlining of its store operations into five regions, down from seven. About 3,000 of the jobs being eliminated are store employee positions, the retailer said, while 165 senior executive posts are being trimmed. It will also cut 650 back-office jobs, and close a call center in St. Louis.The retailer said that it would also push ahead with the previously announced closing of 36 stores in the early spring. Macy\u2019s operates about 900 stores in the United States.In a bid to better compete with discounters and fast fashion brands, Macy\u2019s said it would open about 50 off-price locations under the Macy\u2019s Backstage banner, which it introduced last year. That will add to the six Macy\u2019s discount stores the retailer has opened so far, all in the New York area.Macy\u2019s is also extending its overseas reach, with new Macy\u2019s and Bloomingdale\u2019s stores in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, which are expected to open in 2018.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wall St. Slides After Chinese Stocks Plunge", "Date": "2016-01-04", "News": "Supported byOn the first trading day of the new year, investors\u2019 old worries flooded back.Global stock markets tumbled on Monday, as further fears about a slowdown in China\u2019s economy reignited concerns about global growth.The selling on Monday started after China released a weak manufacturing report, and continued after the United States did the same. Chinese stocks lost nearly 7 percent of their value, although they appeared to stabilize Tuesday morning. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, the main benchmark for the United States stock market, posted a decline of 1.5 percent, while European stocks also fell.The sharp drops bring back memories of the sell-off last summer. China\u2019s surprising decision in August to devalue its currency prompted concerns about the health of the country\u2019s economy and helped ignite a global rout.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.But there was a new twist to investors\u2019 anxieties. Measures to help steady stocks that were put in place after the market turmoil last year now appear to be exacerbating the selling in China.\u201cThis will be the theme for the year,\u201d said Devendra Joshi, an HSBC Asia equity strategist. \u201cThere will be more volatility.\u201dThe market volatility, if it continues, may create headaches for the Federal Reserve, which in December raised interest rates for the first time in over nine years. The Fed chose not to raise rates in September, in part because it was concerned that the turbulence of the summer would weigh on the United States economy.The manufacturing data released on Monday could strengthen the arguments of some economists who say the Fed was too quick to raise interest rates. The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s measure of manufacturing activity fell to 48.2 in December, its lowest reading since 2009. (A number below 50 signals that the manufacturing sector is contracting.)Chinese manufacturing has been steadily contracting for 10 straight months. The Caixin purchasing managers\u2019 index for December fell to 48.2, well below expectations and lower than the reading in November.\u201cIt was a one-two punch from the manufacturing sector,\u201d said Gina C. Martin Adams, institutional equity strategist at Wells Fargo Securities. Some of the stocks that soared in 2015 were among the hardest hit on Monday. Netflix, the top-performing stock in the S.&P. 500 last year, declined by almost 4 percent, while Amazon, the second-biggest gainer last year, plunged 5.8 percent. Investors also appeared to seek some safety in government bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which falls as its price rises, declined slightly to 2.25 percent, from 2.27 percent.The oil markets shrugged off increased tensions in the Middle East. Early in the day, the conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran, two major oil producers, sent the price of crude soaring. But oil ultimately ended down, as concerns about the Chinese slowdown crimped commodity prices.Analysts cautioned that it would be a mistake to read too much into one day\u2019s trading, and they pointed out that markets around the world rallied strongly after the sell-off in the summer. The outlook for Europe appears to be stronger than it was a year ago. And the United States economy has proved its resilience in recent years, growing even as the dollar increased in value and as the plunge in oil prices damaged the prospects of the energy sector.Still, China\u2019s challenges will most likely unsettle investors for a while. As the world\u2019s second largest economy, China is a critical piece of the growth puzzle. If China decelerates markedly, Chinese companies and consumers buy less in goods and services from other countries.Chinese demand is particularly worrisome for commodity producers around the world, which have been hurt by the country\u2019s slowdown. On Monday, Anglo American\u2019s shares fell about 7 percent, while Glencore\u2019s were off 5.8 percent. The pressures on the Chinese currency add to the global worries.The Chinese government is allowing the value of its currency, the renminbi, to decline as a way of spurring its own economy. On Monday, the central bank set the renminbi at its lowest level since May 2011.But this approach risks fanning market tumult and trade tensions.Companies and individuals have moved their money overseas, prompted by economic weakness and the fear that the renminbi will lose more value. Those outflows further weigh on the value of the currency.\u201cThe People\u2019s Bank of China needs to be careful,\u201d said Li-Gang Liu, the chief economist for greater China at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group. \u201cIt cannot create a one-way bet for renminbi depreciation. If they were to do that, we would run into an out-of-control scenario like we saw in the second half of last year.\u201dFrom a trade perspective, China\u2019s policy can prompt other countries to devalue their currencies to try to regain competitiveness. Some Asian countries have already moved in that direction.It is also a challenge for American companies. As other currencies have weakened, the dollar has remained relatively strong. That makes it harder for United States companies to export and it forces them to cut prices to compete \u2014 all of which potentially drags down earnings.The Chinese government\u2019s stock stabilization plan is also playing into the market sell-off.A new rule, which went into effect on Monday, suspends trading in the major mainland markets when the CSI 300 index of blue-chip shares falls 5 percent during a session. The circuit breaker kicked in Monday, setting off a temporary halt. Analysts indicate that the suspension might have led investors to later dump shares, which then brought on a halt for the day.Another measure, a six-month ban on major shareholders\u2019 offloading stocks in Chinese-listed companies, expires at the end of this week. The policy was imposed to stabilize share prices last summer. But now it could be having the reverse effect, leading those with smaller holdings to sell before larger shareholders do. After opening lower on Tuesday, shares in Shanghai wavered between small gains and losses. Hao Hong, chief strategist at the Bank of Communications International, predicted that the tough start to 2016 could continue. \u201cVolatility tends to beget volatility,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will more likely than not spill over to other asset classes. Given we had such dramatic volatility, it\u2019s really too early to see the bottom, especially now that the fundamentals are looking so ugly.\u201dDavid Jolly contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The revelations were scandalous when published, in large part because the pseudonyms Ms. Tindall used barely veiled her paramours. She burned so many bridges then, it seemed the only people willing to embrace her worked in Hollywood.Producers agonized over whether the show would reflect the author\u2019s singular experience or embrace a more contemporary New York sensibility. They arrived at something in between: a whimsical drama exploring a competitive world.The producers have hired New York musicians as on-screen extras, making for a fun peer-spotting exercise. The second season is studded with classical-world celebrity cameos, including musicians like Joshua Bell and Lang Lang, and the Grammy-winning pianist Emanuel Ax, who played the interactive video game \u201cDance Dance Revolution\u201d at a dive bar during one episode. Gustavo Dudamel, the wunderkind Venezuelan conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, makes an appearance as a backstage handler.\u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot of colleagues describe it as a guilty pleasure,\u201d said Lara St. John, a Canadian-born violinist who has played with many of the major symphony orchestras. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see the guilt.\u201dMs. St. John has watched the show since its premiere in 2014 and said the overall story is compelling, despite a few artistic liberties. \u201cI too know people who do multiple gigs a night to make money,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we all know people like Pembridge,\u201d referring to an egomaniacal former conductor played by Malcolm McDowell. But Ms. St. John conceded that she has the luxury of professional distance. \u201cI\u2019m not familiar with the people in the book, so it doesn\u2019t bother me,\u201d she said.Jason Schwartzman, one of the show\u2019s producers, said it wasn\u2019t trying to recreate New York in the 1980s, nor were they aiming for a documentary about Ms. Tindall\u2019s life. AIDS had a sweeping impact on the Broadway community in that era. And drug use and casual sex were prevalent. \u201cOur show is not an adaptation, but the book is the touchstone for this whole thing,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cBlair\u2019s book was a moment when the sheen on classical music was lifted.\u201dMarilyn Cole, a freelance oboist, was hired to train Ms. Kirke for her role as Hailey Rutledge, the New York City comer with dreams of joining a world-class orchestra. Ms. Cole, who has played in Broadway shows and numerous orchestras, said her primary concern was that the producers would portray her New York peers as petty and backbiting. They didn\u2019t. \u201cI came here and found an oboe community that is really a community,\u201d she said.She oversees Ms. Kirke\u2019s \u201coboe playing\u201d on set. (With a few exceptions for credits and selected scenes, the music is from existing recordings that have been licensed.) And, as one might expect, oboe players are the most nitpicky about the actress\u2019s performance. \u201cA lot of the time they say she needs more of a roundness in the pursing of her lips,\u201d Ms. Cole said. \u201cBut the comment I hear from non-oboists is that they are happy with her work.\u201dIndeed, everyone has an opinion. Mr. Weitz grew up in New York City and heard from Orin O\u2019Brien, a family friend who in 1966 was the first woman to become a member of the New York Philharmonic. \u201cShe took me to task for all the swearing,\u201d he said, laughing.Journalists critical of the show have also caused her tsoris. Last year, Ms. Tindall sparred online with Margaret Lyons, a television columnist from New York magazine, after Ms. Lyons tweeted that the oboe playing looked fake. \u201cIt was an observation,\u201d Ms. Lyons said. \u201cThe veracity of that kind of thing doesn\u2019t make or break a show.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad she likes it better,\u201d Ms. Tindall said. \u201cI hope she realizes now I\u2019m not a monster.\u201dBut some musicians from the author\u2019s era have a hard time watching the show or have avoided it altogether. \u201cIt is not that I hate Blair,\u201d said Randall Ellis, the principal oboist of the Mostly Mozart Festival. \u201cI just resent some of the things she wrote in the book.\u201d He gave up, mostly, after the pilot, irked by a scene early on in which a cellist breezed in late for a performance. \u201cYou either don\u2019t go into the pit or get fired the next day,\u201d he said.But Victoria Paterson, a violinist who worked on the show \u201cSmash\u201d and toured with Barbra Streisand, said she had seen several episodes of \u201cMozart in the Jungle\u201d and liked it. \u201cThe television show is so fleshed out,\u201d she said. \u201cClassical music isn\u2019t so nerdy.\u201d She did take issue with some of Ms. Tindall\u2019s characterizations in the book, like one flute player she worked with on \u201cPhantom of the Opera.\u201d \u201cBlair pooh-poohed her and made her look lame,\u201d Ms. Paterson said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t see her that way.\u201dBut what galls her most are colleagues who suggest \u201cMozart in the Jungle\u201d doesn\u2019t reflect their everyday lives. \u201cOf course it\u2019s not like that,\u201d Ms. Paterson said she told a friend. \u201cYou have two kids and you are 40. You have to pick up your kids after school. No one is going to make a show about that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cancer and Climate Change", "Date": "2016-01-16", "News": "Supported byOpinionI\u2019M a climate scientist who has just been told I have Stage 4 pancreatic cancer.This diagnosis puts me in an interesting position. I\u2019ve spent much of my professional life thinking about the science of climate change, which is best viewed through a multidecadal lens. At some level I was sure that, even at my present age of 60, I would live to see the most critical part of the problem, and its possible solutions, play out in my lifetime. Now that my personal horizon has been steeply foreshortened, I was forced to decide how to spend my remaining time. Was continuing to think about climate change worth the bother?After handling the immediate business associated with the medical news \u2014 informing family, friends, work; tidying up some finances; putting out stacks of unread New York Times Book Reviews to recycle; and throwing a large \u201cLimited Edition\u201d holiday party, complete with butlers, I had some time to sit at my kitchen table and draw up the bucket list.Very quickly, I found out that I had no desire to jostle with wealthy tourists on Mount Everest, or fight for some yardage on a beautiful and exclusive beach, or all those other things one toys with on a boring January afternoon. Instead, I concluded that all I really wanted to do was spend more time with the people I know and love, and get back to my office as quickly as possible.I work for NASA, managing a large group of expert scientists doing research on the whole Earth system (I should mention that the views in this article are my own, not NASA\u2019s). This involves studies of climate and weather using space-based observations and powerful computer models. These models describe how the planet works, and what can happen as we pump carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The work is complex, exacting, highly relevant and fascinating.Last year was the warmest year on record, by far. I think that future generations will look back on 2015 as an important but not decisive year in the struggle to align politics and policy with science. This is an incredibly hard thing to do. On the science side, there has been a steady accumulation of evidence over the last 15 years that climate change is real and that its trajectory could lead us to a very uncomfortable, if not dangerous, place. On the policy side, the just-concluded climate conference in Paris set a goal of holding the increase in the global average temperature to 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, above preindustrial levels.While many have mocked this accord as being toothless and unenforceable, it is noteworthy that the policy makers settled on a number that is based on the best science available and is within the predictive capability of our computer models.It\u2019s doubtful that we\u2019ll hold the line at 2 degrees Celsius, but we need to give it our best shot. With scenarios that exceed that target, we are talking about enormous changes in global precipitation and temperature patterns, huge impacts on water and food security, and significant sea level rise. As the predicted temperature rises, model uncertainty grows, increasing the likelihood of unforeseen, disastrous events.All this as the world\u2019s population is expected to crest at around 9.5 billion by 2050 from the current seven billion. Pope Francis and a think tank of retired military officers have drawn roughly the same conclusion from computer model predictions: The worst impacts will be felt by the world\u2019s poorest, who are already under immense stress and have meager resources to help them adapt to the changes. They will see themselves as innocent victims of the developed world\u2019s excesses. Looking back, the causes of the 1789 French Revolution are not a mystery to historians; looking forward, the pressure cooker for increased radicalism, of all flavors, and conflict could get hotter along with the global temperature.The initial heavy lifting will have to be done by policy makers. I feel for them. It\u2019s hard to take a tough stand on an important but long-term issue in the face of so many near-term problems, amid worries that reducing emissions will weaken our global economic position and fears that other countries may cheat on their emissions targets.Where science can help is to keep track of changes in the Earth system \u2014 this is a research and monitoring job, led by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and their counterparts elsewhere in the world \u2014 and use our increasingly powerful computer models to explore possible futures associated with proposed policies. The models will help us decide which approaches are practicable, trading off near-term impacts to the economy against longer-term impacts to the climate.Ultimately, though, it will be up to the engineers and industrialists of the world to save us. They must come up with the new technologies and the means of implementing them. The technical and organizational challenges of solving the problems of clean energy generation, storage and distribution are enormous, and they must be solved within a few decades with minimum disruption to the global economy. This will likely entail a major switch to nuclear, solar and other renewable power, with an electrification of our transport system to the maximum extent possible. These engineers and industrialists are fully up to the job, given the right incentives and investments. You have only to look at what they achieved during World War II: American technology and production catapulted over what would have taken decades to do under ordinary conditions and presented us with a world in 1945 that was completely different from the late 1930s.What should the rest of us do? Two things come to mind. First, we should brace for change. It is inevitable. It will appear in changes to the climate and to the way we generate and use energy. Second, we should be prepared to absorb these with appropriate sang-froid. Some will be difficult to deal with, like rising seas, but many others could be positive. New technologies have a way of bettering our lives in ways we cannot anticipate. There is no convincing, demonstrated reason to believe that our evolving future will be worse than our present, assuming careful management of the challenges and risks. History is replete with examples of us humans getting out of tight spots. The winners tended to be realistic, pragmatic and flexible; the losers were often in denial of the threat.As for me, I\u2019ve no complaints. I\u2019m very grateful for the experiences I\u2019ve had on this planet. As an astronaut I spacewalked 220 miles above the Earth. Floating alongside the International Space Station, I watched hurricanes cartwheel across oceans, the Amazon snake its way to the sea through a brilliant green carpet of forest, and gigantic nighttime thunderstorms flash and flare for hundreds of miles along the Equator. From this God\u2019s-eye-view, I saw how fragile and infinitely precious the Earth is. I\u2019m hopeful for its future.And so, I\u2019m going to work tomorrow.Advertisement"}

You roll up your sleeves, you redouble your commitment to those ideals in a changing world, and you fight.\u201dHe put the magazine up for sale, throwing up his hands in frustration. \u201cI underestimated the difficulty of transitioning an old and traditional institution into a digital media company in today\u2019s quickly evolving climate,\u201d he wrote.Welcome to the age \u2014 and whimsy \u2014 of the new billionaire class and the precariousness of vanity projects. With so much money sloshing around, and more and more of the superwealthy pushing into areas beyond their expertise, it is likely we will see more headlines about the failure of some of these fanciful investments and philanthropic experiments.Just over the weekend, the Russian billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov completed a major shake-up of the Brooklyn Nets, a team he bought five years ago that has struggled both on and off the court. It lost a reported $144 million last season.Of course, there have been success stories. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, bought The Washington Post, which so far has had success under his stewardship and he appears to be a long-term investor in the business.Dov Seidman, the founder of LRN, a firm that advises companies on their cultures and how they can translate them into better performance, said that earning gobs of money could often give billionaires a false sense of omniscience.\u201cSometimes if you create wealth and value quickly in one domain with one set of skills, however gifted and talented you are, it can give you the sense that you can apply it to any domain,\u201d Mr. Seidman said.That\u2019s not to take away from some of the most successful philanthropists, like Bill Gates, a co-founder of Microsoft who has spent years devoting himself to learning everything about polio and malaria, for example, and working toward eradicating them. (Though, in truth, he has spent a lot of money on projects that didn\u2019t work along the way.)Still, as more billionaires are minted amid a ferocious debate about inequality, and the superwealthy continue to buy up trophy assets and seek to sway public policy, it has created a backlash and some are questioning whether they are amassing too much influence.\u201cThe megarich increasingly use their foundations and their celebrity as philanthropists to mold public policy to an extent not possible for other citizens,\u201d Joanne Barkan, who has long been a critic of big philanthropy, wrote in The Guardian.That could turn out to be true for new money coming out of Silicon Valley, which has created a generation of young, idealistic entrepreneurs who want to get involved in transforming businesses and institutions at early ages. There are about 40 men and women under the age of 40 who are worth at least a half-billion dollars, according to Forbes.\u201cA lot of young people aren\u2019t waiting their turn to lead,\u201d Mr. Seidman said, suggesting that successful executives used to wait until retirement to try their hand at new projects. He added: \u201cTheir intent is going to get revealed. Are you deeply committed? How will you act when the path isn\u2019t linear?\u201dAnd praying for a wealthy benefactor to save a business is also a flawed business model. John Henry, the billionaire owner of the Boston Red Sox, bought The Boston Globe in 2013 from The New York Times Company. He has invested in The Globe, though it continues to struggle in the challenging newspaper business. Last year, another round of layoffs hit the newsroom. Of course, Mr. Henry can afford to take a risk on a declining business that requires a turnaround.For Mr. Hughes and The New Republic, that may be what happened. He seemed well intentioned. He talked about reviving the publication and restoring its glory, and yes, even making it profitable. He sought to remake the magazine for a digital age. But in the process, much of his staff left the publication and today the business is worth less than when he started.\u201cI bought this company nearly four years ago to ensure its survival and give it the financial runway to experiment with new business models in a time of immense change in media,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAfter investing a great deal of time, energy, and over $20 million, I have come to the conclusion that it is time for new leadership and vision at The New Republic.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fund Managers Win With Tech Stalwarts and Burly Brand Names", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byBets on the biggest purveyors of technology \u2014 companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft \u2014 powered three of the top-performing funds of the fourth quarter.Mr. Baker, who has managed the fund since 2009, said he believed that the best companies combined top technology with burly brand names and large scale. Take Alphabet, he said. \u201cNot only does it have a great brand, but every day it does seven to eight times as many searches as all of its competitors combined. So every day its search accuracy is improving that much faster than competitors\u2019.\u201dAs befits a growth investor, Mr. Baker is a technophile. He will riff at length about the technological themes that undergird his picks, like the omnipresence of cloud computing, the maturation of solar power and the promise of artificial intelligence. Skeptics complain the information age isn\u2019t yielding benefits comparable to the industrial revolution, but that is humbug, he says.\u201cThe steam engine, to take advantage of that, you needed to dig canals and put in railroads. The peak change was 75 to 100 years after the invention.\u201d As far as the microchip goes, he said, \u201cAll of the infrastructure is in place, and we\u2019re entering the period of peak economic and social change.\u201dEven video game makers are benefiting, he said. Consider Activision Blizzard, another top holding and the producer of Call of Duty and Guitar Hero. A decade ago, its market comprised a few million game consoles and personal computers, Mr. Baker said. \u201cNow you have a billion smartphones, all of which you can play a video game on.\u201d And Activision Blizzard is trying to broaden its share of the mobile market with its pending acquisition of King Digital Entertainment, maker of the game Candy Crush.Mr. Baker\u2019s fund, with an expense ratio of 0.83 percent, returned 13.34 percent for the quarter, compared with 7.04 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.\u201cBrands hold their value, and a global brand isn\u2019t dependent on one geography,\u201d she said. Est\u00e9e Lauder, Starbucks and Nike were all among her fund\u2019s recent stakes. \u201cTheir markets are growing because they address the whole world,\u201d she said.Sturdy brands also drew her to Constellation Brands, which owns the United States rights to popular Mexican beers like Corona, Modelo and Pacifico, as well as a groaning cellar of wines. \u201cIn good times and bad, people still drink wine and beer,\u201d she said.Ms. Starke took over her fund about a year and a half ago. It then held more than 80 stocks. She set about paring that number, with an aim of keeping the portfolio at 30 to 50 holdings. \u201cIn large-cap growth, it\u2019s hard to outperform with a big portfolio,\u201d she said. \u201cA concentrated portfolio is the way to do it.\u201d With too many holdings, a fund can end up looking too much like the broader market and merely matching its return.She also plowed a greater portion of the fund\u2019s money into her top picks. Previously, the top 10 holdings accounted for about 14 percent of the portfolio, she said. Now they are more than 40 percent.The fund\u2019s biggest sector weightings are information technology, health care and consumer discretionary. Those tend to produce the best earnings growth, she said. \u201cI\u2019m looking for healthy earnings growth and healthy sales growth,\u201d she said.Ms. Starke\u2019s fund, with an expense ratio of 1.12, returned 9.92 percent in the fourth quarter.Like Mr. Baker\u2019s fund, it lately held shares of Microsoft. Mr. Kleinschmidt said the fund had owned the stock for about a decade, even as the company was seen as falling behind competitors like Apple and Google. But Microsoft kept putting up strong numbers, he said.\u201cForget the name,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I just gave you their market share, their cash flow, their return on equity, if I showed you all of that, would you be interested? Yes. Most people would be.\u201dFacebook, an overlap with both Mr. Baker\u2019s and Ms. Starke\u2019s top holdings, is a more recent purchase. Mr. Kleinschmidt said he was attracted to the social network\u2019s enormous customer base, about 600 million people when the company went public in 2012. Tocqueville bought shares in the months after Facebook\u2019s initial public offering, when the stock sagged. \u201cI reasoned a smart management team would be able to figure out how to make money on 600 million users,\u201d Mr. Kleinschmidt said. Facebook says its network has grown and estimates more than a billion people use its service daily.Mr. Kleinschmidt has patience. As he has with Microsoft, he will stick with a stock for years. His fund\u2019s annual turnover ratio is 15 percent. In contrast, the average actively managed stock fund tracked by Morningstar turns over about two-thirds of its portfolio annually.\u201cOne of the hardest things to do in this business \u2014 and yet one of the best things \u2014 can be to sit on your hands and not let the market\u2019s noise convince you that you have to do something,\u201d he said.Mr. Kleinschmidt cautioned that his turnover might increase in coming months. As a contrarian, he said he often finds buying opportunities when the market sags, as it has lately. \u201cThe essence of a contrarian thinker is to lean against the wind. You do that by looking into situations where the prevailing feeling is, \u2018Oh, my God.\u2019\u201dMr. Kleinschmidt\u2019s fund, with an expense ratio of 1.25 percent, returned 10.97 percent in the fourth quarter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Experience David Bowie\u2019s New York", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Supported byWhere to Go NowDavid Bowie was a New Yorker for over 20 years. In Bowie years, that is practically an eternity considering the multitude of lives he lived \u2014 musically, geographically and otherwise \u2014 since he set out to become a star in the late 1960s.\u201cJust as each and every one of us found something unique in David\u2019s music, we welcome everyone\u2019s celebration of his life as they see fit,\u201d Mr. Bowie\u2019s family wrote in a statement.Should you be looking for a way to honor the musician in the city he called home, there is no shortage of activities to partake in, many of which Mr. Bowie enjoyed doing himself.Walking in general (the earlier in the day the better) was a preferred way for Mr. Bowie to experience city life.Numerous tributes at city music venues have sprouted up since Mr. Bowie\u2019s death, and are likely to continue in the coming months.Nino Perez of Bleecker Street Records said the store quickly sold out of most titles in the days after his death and it did not expect to have more copies of \u201cBlackstar\u201d until the end of February, because of the high demand.Before stocks are replenished, consider taking home one of Mr. Bowie\u2019s contemporaries, like Iggy Pop or Lou Reed, both of whom he met and befriended during a 1971 visit to Manhattan.Mr. Bowie relished his ability to blend in and not be bothered by his fans and fellow New Yorkers during his years in the city.Other Bowie-related titles available to stream include \u201cThe Hunger\u201d (1983), \u201cThe Last Temptation of Christ\u201d (1988) and \u201cThe Prestige\u201d (2006).An earlier version of this article \u200bmisidentified the cafe that David Bowie used to frequent in SoHo.

It was a particularly striking achievement for USA, a network that has been known for big ratings, but not for avant-garde or critically acclaimed programming in an era that is rife with them. Awards nights have not been USA nights.But these are different times in the TV industry. There is more programming than ever, ratings are in free fall and award winners can come from producers of any conceivable stripe. That included relatively obscure shows like Amazon\u2019s \u201cMozart in the Jungle,\u201d which won the best TV comedy award, the second consecutive year the streaming service took that category.66 Photos\u201cIf you\u2019re going to get into the zone of being in the top five shows out of 400? Well, if you talk with everybody you know and everybody thinks your show is a fantastic idea, you\u2019re probably a little behind the curve and should get a different idea,\u201d Roy Price, the head of Amazon Studios, said.That is essentially what USA executives did. \u201cMr. Robot,\u201d a drama that embraces of-the-moment themes like hacking and the isolating effects of digital life, is darker than the so-called blue skies programming that helped propel USA to the most-viewed cable channel in the last decade.\u201cThe show is a weird, subversive, tiny little show,\u201d said Sam Esmail, the creator, holding his Golden Globe. \u201cThe best I could think of for its potential was a cult hit. That was the thing I was dreaming about.\u201dInstead it became more than that. The nearly three million viewers who tune in \u2014 about half of them in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic important to advertisers \u2014 made it one of the top new drama cable series of the year.The first step toward the success of \u201cMr. Robot\u201d was taken a couple of years ago, when Ms. Hammer and the USA Network\u2019s president, Chris McCumber, noticed that the programming that was once so successful for USA was starting to show signs of wear and tear.\u201cWe had a filter where it had to be flawed-but-likable characters, drama with a dollop of humor,\u201d Ms. Hammer said, referring to a longtime strategy that helped fuel shows like \u201cBurn Notice\u201d and \u201cPsych.\u201d \u201cAnd then we realized that many of those who watched USA for years basically aged out of the demo. The 40-somethings were now 50-somethings. We had to say, \u2018O.K., we get it. We have to look at the 30-somethings and the millennials. What are they going to watch?\u2019 \u201dMs. Hammer and Mr. McCumber realized what that group wanted was not what USA had on the air.\u201cThe world isn\u2019t blue skies, it\u2019s very complicated,\u201d Ms. Hammer said. \u201cThe generation that is growing up right now is willing to accept that life is complicated, that decisions aren\u2019t easy. They don\u2019t tune in because it\u2019s fun. Anything that hits an honest authentic nerve, they\u2019ll basically embrace it.\u201dThere was also the matter of the show\u2019s connection with real-life events. Even though \u201cMr. Robot\u201d focuses so much on hacking, the pilot had already been shot when news of the Sony hacking became public. And the season finale was postponed by a week in August after a scene involving a live-on-video suicide was deemed insensitive after the on-air shooting of a television reporter and her cameraman in Virginia.\u201cThe show in a really uncanny way, sometimes tragically, mirrored what was going on in the world right now,\u201d Mr. McCumber said.Mr. Esmail said working with a network that was suddenly open to a new creative approach presented a golden opportunity.\u201cIf I went with another network that had a certain style and voice to their network they\u2019re going to want to impose this on the show, there might have been more compromise,\u201d Mr. Esmail said. \u201cHere was an opportunity to define what that could be.\u201dThe awards for \u201cMr. Robot\u201d were welcome news for USA, especially because, like many cable channels, its viewership dropped sizably this year. Ratings were down about 15 percent in total viewers and 20 percent in the 18-to-49 demographic. Ms. Hammer said that scrutinizing the ratings was a backward way of thinking now, and that was one of the reasons USA had changed its game plan.\u201cFor a long time we wanted to do great business in linear television and we did it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe accepted we weren\u2019t going to get a ton of awards. Now we\u2019re in a different business. Now it\u2019s no longer just competing in the linear business, it\u2019s competing for great content.\u201dAnd if the ratings continue to fall, will advertisers still be around to spend money on that so-called great content?\u201cI sure as hell hope so or I\u2019m going to be fired,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

In the European Union, an individual\u2019s right to privacy is viewed on par with other fundamental rights like freedom of expression.\u201cIf a few companies control the data you need to cut costs, then you give them the power to drive others out of the market,\u201d Ms. Vestager said at the DLD conference, a gathering of digital executives and policy makers.She said that \u201cit\u2019s hard to know\u201d how much data is given up when using an online messaging service. \u201cBut it\u2019s a business transaction, not a free giveaway,\u201d she continued. \u201cAs consumers, we need to be treated fairly.\u201dMs. Vestager\u2019s warning shot in the often-rancorous privacy debate comes ahead of a Jan. 31 deadline for Europe and the United States to reach a new data-sharing agreement.\u201cIf someone like Google or Facebook has all of the data, then that\u2019s not good,\u201d Mr. Samwer said here on Sunday.But for Ms. Vestager, a 47-year-old Danish politician who has garnered both fans and detractors for her ambitious competition activities, adding data protection to her portfolio could prove difficult.On Sunday, Ms. Vestager denied claims that Europe was unfairly targeting American tech companies, although some executives in the United States have claimed that European officials are trying to bolster local technology companies at the expense of their large American rivals.Ms. Vestager added that she was not against further consolidation within the industry, despite European antitrust officials\u2019 balking at a number of recent proposed takeovers in the region\u2019s telecommunications sector that they said would reduce competition at the consumer level. Future mergers, she said, should not reduce consumer choice and worsen market competition.\u201cYou can\u2019t just go out there and buy yourself a monopoly,\u201d Ms. Vestager said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Challenging Uber, Lyft Bets on a Road Wide Enough for Two", "Date": "2016-01-09", "News": "Supported byThe word \u201cmonopoly\u201d has a distinctly nefarious ring to it, conjuring up images of thuggish industrialists in smoky rooms, scheming to undermine their rivals.Yet in Silicon Valley, it\u2019s not at all uncommon for one company to dominate a particular field. Google is the runaway leader in online search. Facebook is the largest social network in the world by a wide margin. Amazon is far and away the biggest e-commerce site.But while market dominance is hard to break, that doesn\u2019t stop upstarts from trying. In the case of Uber, it is Lyft that is doing its best to keep up.\u201cWe\u2019re gaining share in the United States,\u201d said John Zimmer, Lyft\u2019s president and co-founder. \u201cThat\u2019s not what happens when one player has a complete monopoly.\u201d\u201cThe mere possession of monopoly power, and the concomitant charging of monopoly prices, is not only not unlawful; it is an important element of the free-market system,\u201d Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in that opinion. \u201cThe opportunity to charge monopoly prices \u2014 at least for a short period \u2014 is what attracts \u2018business acumen\u2019 in the first place; it induces risk-taking that produces innovation and economic growth.\u201dIn the book \u201cZero to One,\u201d which he wrote with Blake Masters, the investor and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel offers tips on how to create monopolies, arguing that once achieved, they lead to more innovation.\u201cMonopolies drive progress because the promise of years or even decades of monopoly profits provides a powerful incentive to innovate,\u201d he writes. \u201cThen monopolies can keep innovating because profits enable them to make the long-term plans and to finance the ambitious research projects that firms locked in competition can\u2019t dream of.\u201dAnd regulators have not been cracking down on Silicon Valley. Given how many big technology companies loom large in their respective markets, there have been relatively few big antitrust actions brought against tech giants.\u201cThis is different from the old monopolies of the industrial age,\u201d Robert Reich, the former labor secretary, said of technology companies.Unlike United States Steel or Standard Oil, two of corporate history\u2019s biggest brutes, today\u2019s tech monopolies are rarely the exclusive provider of an essential commodity. Instead, many achieve their initial dominance by distinguishing themselves in a crowded marketplace, then rapidly taking market share thanks to the power of network effects \u2014 that is, the more people use a service, the more valuable that service becomes to other people, who join in and make the service all the more popular.Network effects helped Google, Facebook and Amazon run away from their competitors, and are helping Uber today. Google wasn\u2019t the first search engine, Facebook wasn\u2019t the first social network, and Amazon wasn\u2019t the first to sell goods online. There are still many other sites for search, social and e-commerce. But despite an array of options, users keep coming back to the market leaders.Some argue, however, that the regulatory framework needs to adjust for a new kind of market dominance.Along with network effects, another hallmark of today\u2019s tech monopolies is that, perhaps fearing obsolescence, they diversify. While Microsoft still makes its Windows and Office software, it also owns Skype and has a big video gaming business. Google is now a subsidiary of Alphabet, a new parent company that is also home to a health care company, a self-driving-cars division and a venture capital firm. Amazon is expanding its cloud computing and streaming-media businesses. And Facebook has diversified into messaging with WhatsApp, photos with Instagram, and virtual reality with Oculus Rift.This, too, creates challenges for regulators. When mergers and acquisitions are part of the natural life cycle of start-ups and venture capital, it isn\u2019t easy to block deals that might hypothetically reduce competition down the road. As a result, regulators have blessed many acquisitions that, to critics, appear to be deeply anticompetitive.Gary Reback, a lawyer who helped prompt a landmark antitrust investigation into Microsoft and is now pursuing Google in Europe, makes the case that Google bought its way to dominance in online advertising through the acquisition of DoubleClick, bought its leadership in mobile by purchasing Android and bought its strong mapping franchise in the deal for Waze. Similarly, Facebook bought two of its nearest rivals, WhatsApp and Instagram. If any of those deals had been blocked, Mr. Reback argues, behemoths like Google and Facebook might today be facing more concerted competition.\u201cOnce one of these companies gets a monopoly, it\u2019s easy to spread the monopoly to adjacent markets by acquisition,\u201d Mr. Reback said. \u201cYou would think antitrust enforcers would know this by now.\u201dWhile monopolies in the tech industry are perhaps easier than ever to achieve, industry experts contend they are also more vulnerable than ever before. The advent of the smartphone and widespread access to broadband Internet connectivity have democratized access to creative new technologies.\u201cSun Microsystems. EMC. Cisco. All these were considered the dominant market players in their category at the time,\u201d said Rich Wong, a venture capitalist at Accel Partners. \u201cThen the vast majority of them got whacked by this thing called the cloud.\u201dAnd of course, billions of people browse the web without Google, use other social networking apps besides Facebook, and shop on websites besides Amazon. Though no upstarts have replaced them yet, none are immune to disruption.As for Uber, if it\u2019s not a monopoly already, it is the giant in the ride-hailing market, at least in the United States. One rival, Sidecar, shut down last month, and Lyft is its last meaningful competitor on a national scale. (Uber faces a tougher road abroad, where it is tangling with regulators in Europe, recently withdrew from Frankfurt and is fighting against entrenched rivals in China and other international markets.)As the underdog, Lyft is trying to put more drivers on the road and acquire new users. Like Uber, the company is private, and neither shares much information about performance. But Mr. Zimmer said the company was quickly increasing market share in the United States. He also sees the on-demand ride business as different from search or social media and more like telecommunications companies, where several big competitors can compete on service.\u201cJust like AT&T and Verizon need three bars of coverage,\u201d he said, \u201cwe get down to two to three minutes of wait time for a vehicle to arrive. Once it gets to that point, there\u2019s no difference in behavior between services. That\u2019s when you compete on experience.\u201dStill, Lyft will be hard pressed to unseat Uber.\u201cThe network effects hold competition at stiff arm\u2019s length,\u201d said Steve Cheney, an entrepreneur and co-founder of Estimote, a micro-location platform for mobile developers.Or perhaps the ride-hailing market is big enough for both Uber and Lyft. Monopolies don\u2019t necessarily mean there is no competition whatsoever. While a company like Uber may take a huge lead in market share, others, like Lyft, may still have room to profit and even prosper. Even Google has not managed to squash every other search engine.\u201cMicrosoft has a decent search business. A lot of Yahoo\u2019s profits still come from searches on Yahoo properties,\u201d said Roelof Botha, a partner at Sequoia Capital, which has investments in WhatsApp and Airbnb. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a \u2018winner takes most\u2019 than a \u2018winner takes all\u2019 phenomenon.\u201dShould that be the case in the ride-hailing industry, Uber and Lyft may become something truly competitive by Silicon Valley standards: a duopoly.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alphabet Shakes Up Its Robotics Division", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byOver the last two months, Alphabet, the new holding company that separated Google from its collection of speculative projects, has reframed the robots effort, moving it from a stand-alone division inside Google to a piece of the X research division. The company has also hired Hans Peter Brondmo, a technology industry veteran who last worked at Nokia, to help with management.Courtney Hohne, an X spokeswoman, confirmed the moves, but declined to comment further.A reorganization of the robots group is one of several recent moves inside the X division, which used to be called Google X but was rebranded with the Alphabet reorganization and recently unveiled a new logo.A range of companies, including tech competitors like Amazon and car manufacturers, are signaling their interest in robotics.\u201cEverything is happening, from industry manufacturing to self-driving cars to drones to personal robots to A.I. systems,\u201d said Fei-Fei Li, director of Stanford University\u2019s artificial intelligence laboratory.X has several projects in varying degrees of completion, but has lately been \u201cgraduating\u201d them as stand-alone companies or preparing them for such a move. The life sciences group, for example, is now called Verily. X also recently hired an auto industry veteran to lead its self-driving car effort \u2014 called Chauffeur internally \u2014 and noted that the project was a good candidate to be spun out.Robotics has gone in the opposite direction for reasons that are personal and practical. The division was created in 2013 by Andy Rubin, who led the development of the widely used Android operating system software, and it has been without a leader since Mr. Rubin left in 2014 to start a technology incubator that helps young start-ups turn their ideas into businesses.So in December, the division was moved inside X. The X team will first have to review the various projects and refocus them toward solving specific problems that would be reframed as a particular moonshot effort, according to Ms. Hohne.The group\u2019s most recent hire, Mr. Brondmo, will help with that process. He has a background as a product manager. He graduated from M.I.T. and has led successful Internet start-ups, including an early digital video company, an Internet marketing firm and Plum, a social networking company, which was acquired by Nokia in 2009. At Nokia, he developed an unannounced camera project until it was canceled in 2014.Mr. Brondmo declined to comment.After starting the robotics division, Mr. Rubin quickly went on a buying spree, purchasing a number of promising companies, including Boston Dynamics, the maker of experimental military robots, and Schaft, an elite group of Japanese roboticists from the University of Tokyo.The effort was called Replicant internally \u2014 a nod to \u201cBlade Runner,\u201d the 1982 science fiction film \u2014 and at one point was considering deals to supply robots to load and unload trucks for a major package delivery company.But while the companies were promising, Mr. Rubin invested in several technologies that had industry observers scratching their heads about his overall direction. Mr. Rubin originally said that the robotics division would be a 10-year moonshot, and when he was in negotiations to acquire companies he talked about the possibility of the driverless Google car rolling up to your house and the Google robot jumping off the back bumper.\u201cAndy Rubin acquired some of the best, innovative companies out there, but also a mix that leaves one wondering about how he imagined it all fitting together,\u201d said Tandy Trower, founder and chief executive of Hoaloha Robotics, which is developing robots to help older people and people with disabilities.Mr. Rubin now directs an artificial intelligence-oriented investment incubator called Playground Global. It is based in Palo Alto, Calif., a few miles from his old offices, and has received investments from Google, Foxconn and others.Mr. Rubin did not respond to emails seeking comment.Google\u2019s robotics effort stalled after his departure, going through a variety of leaders, including James Kuffner, a Carnegie Mellon roboticist who has since joined Toyota\u2019s research and development laboratory in Palo Alto, and Jonathan Rosenberg, who is a troubleshooter for Larry Page, the Google co-founder who is Alphabet\u2019s chief executive.Many in the industry say it is likely to be awhile before companies, Alphabet included, can get through the many technological and regulatory hurdles that stand in the way of robots becoming a huge business.\u201cDespite the acceleration of robotics technology, accessibility to it may take longer than we anticipate,\u201d said Mr. Trower. \u201cOther examples are the new regulations that are being put in place to address the use of autonomous cars or flying drones.\u201dAn article on Saturday about a revitalization of Google\u2019s robotics division misstated part of the background of Hans Peter Brondmo, who has been hired to help manage the unit, now part of the X research division of the Alphabet holding company. He graduated from M.I.T., not the M.I.T. Media Lab.Advertisement"}

He doesn\u2019t do much of either anymore \u2014 he mostly uses his smartphone to pay for things.Mr. Craine\u2019s money choices point to the millennial-led shift toward new digital financial services, a change in behavior that threatens to upend the consumer banking industry. The popularity of the services has left the major banks rushing to adapt, even as they have regained their footing after the financial crisis.Americans in their 20s and early 30s, analysts say, offer a glimpse of tomorrow\u2019s banking market. \u201cTheir relationship with the financial system is very different \u2014 it\u2019s an electronic one, on their smartphones,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cThat can and will be very disruptive to the banking system.\u201dInvestment worldwide in start-ups focused on retail banking markets rose to nearly $6.8 billion in 2015, according to CB Insights, a research firm. That is more than triple the $2.2 billion in 2014.The major banks have all taken steps to address the new reality. Citigroup, for example, has teamed up with Lending Club, an online lender. In October, the bank set up a separate unit, Citi FinTech. In a memo to the staff, Stephen Bird, the new chief executive of global consumer banking, said the bank had reached a \u201cpivotal point,\u201d when \u201ctechnological change is intensifying\u201d and \u201ccompetitors are everywhere.\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Bird called the new unit the \u201cspearhead\u201d of the bank\u2019s move into the future. The long-range goal, he said, is to provide an array of banking and money management services that are as effortless to use as ordering and paying for a ride on Uber.\u201cIt\u2019s a big opportunity for us if we can move fast enough,\u201d Mr. Bird said. \u201cIt\u2019s both an opportunity and a threat.\u201dWhile the fintech insurgents are moving and growing quickly, they must overcome big challenges of their own before reshaping the industry. They are still relatively small and niche players in the sprawling retail banking business. They are not deposit-taking institutions, where consumer savings are insured by the government.They also lack the legal and regulatory apparatus that traditional banks have built over many decades. Already, some of the new services are facing regulatory scrutiny. In November, Apple, Google, Amazon, PayPal and Intuit formed a Washington-based advocacy group, Financial Innovation Now, to promote policies to \u201cfoster greater innovation in financial services.\u201dStill, some banking habits are changing across the population. In 2010, 40 percent of Americans with bank accounts visited a physical branch once a week, while only 9 percent made a mobile transaction weekly, according to survey research by Javelin Strategy and Research. By 2014, the percentage reporting weekly visits to bank branches fell to 28 percent, while the weekly mobile banking share tripled, to 27 percent.Vanessa Montes de Oca, 20, lives in Covina, Calif., and she combines being a college student with part-time work at a nearby Sam\u2019s Club. She has an account at Chase Bank, but uses it only to receive her direct-deposit paychecks and to make debit payments. She has no credit cards, viewing them a path to overspending and financial peril.So Ms. Montes de Oca chose a new credit card alternative, Affirm, to make purchases at an online clothing retailer, UNIF. In the last year, she has made five purchases, ranging up to $460. She pays Affirm in installments over three to 12 months.She used the Affirm smartphone app without qualms. It seemed, she said, a \u201csolid service\u201d \u2014 smooth and fast, with the payment amounts and terms clearly stated. That screen in her hand, she added, is where she pays bills, communicates and seeks answers. \u201cMost of the business of my life is on my phone,\u201d said Ms. Montes de Oca, who is also a Venmo user.The migration to mobile computing may well work to the advantage of the digital-only entrants as people of all ages become more comfortable using a smartphone as the remote control for their finances.Wealth management services, for example, skew toward an older demographic. At SigFig, a San Francisco start-up that offers an online investment advisory service, the average user is 47 years old. Still, the share of SigFig users tapping in from mobile devices has increased steadily, to 50 percent.\u201cPeople have such a daily relationship with their smartphones now, almost no matter what their age,\u201d said Mike Sha, chief executive of SigFig.Venmo is riding a surge of popularity, mostly among millennials. The volume of payments through Venmo, a unit of PayPal, more than tripled in the most recently reported quarter, to $2.1 billion.Venmo, according to William Ready, senior vice president for products and engineering at PayPal, is beginning to cross generations, as younger adults persuade their parents to use the smartphone app for sending money and splitting payments.Yet the cross-generational embrace seems to be going slowly. Mr. Craine, the tech support worker, urged his parents, who are in their mid-50s, to use Venmo. But they are not yet converts.\u201cI tried,\u201d Mr. Craine recalled, \u201cbut they are reluctant to deal with money that way on a smartphone.\u201dMadeleine Fleming, 25, an online product manager who lives in Brooklyn, ran into the same obstacle when she tried to persuade her mother, who is in her late 50s. \u201cShe\u2019s a lot less tied to her phone than I am,\u201d Ms. Fleming said.Ms. Fleming frequently sends small, monetary gifts to friends and relatives with get-well or cheer-up messages. For example, she says, a cousin who is a teacher in New Orleans had a tough week recently. Ms. Fleming sent her $10 via Venmo, with a note of encouragement that urged her to buy herself a drink.\u201cIt\u2019s a small thinking-of-you gesture,\u201d Ms. Fleming said. \u201cI think it\u2019s the next level of thoughtfulness.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here, she recounts the significance behind a ceramic cat from her childhood in Syracuse, N.Y., that temporarily takes the place of an actual, living pet.My grandmother lived a mile away from me growing up in Syracuse. She would just drop by, pop in the back door, ask me what I had eaten for lunch, and if I had any friends. She was the archetypal overbearing Jewish grandmother. She grew up on Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights, Brooklyn \u2014 the daughter of immigrants, a child of the Great Depression. When I\u2019m reading scripts for \u201cTransparent,\u201d every time there\u2019s a line from Shelly, Judith Light\u2019s character, I always imagine my grandmother. They had the same style of peppering Yiddish into whatever they were saying.Since my grandmother lived nearby, I spent a lot of time at her house. I have really early memories of this cat she had on the landing at the top of her stairs. It always sparked excitement for me, even as a toddler.When my grandmother got older, she encouraged all of her children and grandchildren to put our names on the bottom of whatever we wanted of hers. At the time I thought it was really morose and resisted putting my name on anything. Except for the ceramic cat. All I really wanted was that cat. So she got out the masking tape and Sharpie pen and put my name on it.My grandmother died in 2011, and my grandfather died nine months later. My parents and aunts and uncles sorted through their house and allocated everything to different family members. They came across the cat with my name on it and my mother shipped it to me in California. It actually broke when it was shipped \u2014 the whole back half cracked off. I just glued it right back together.Of all the objects in my home, it\u2019s one of the only things from my childhood. I think of it as a kind of anchor \u2014 a fractured anchor. And it\u2019s also a surrogate for the cat I\u2019d like to have some day. I\u2019ve had cats as pets all my life, but right now, because I travel so much, having a pet would be unfair to the animal. I\u2019m not worried about becoming a cat lady but I\u2019ll definitely have cats in my house again. For now, my grandmother\u2019s ceramic cat sits next to the front door and it\u2019s like she greets me when I\u2019m coming and going.This interview has been edited and condensed.

{"Headline": "For Gadget Geek in the Oval Office, High Tech Has Its Limits", "Date": "2016-01-24", "News": "Supported byWhite House LetterWASHINGTON \u2014 In this always-on, always-connected world, what good is a Fitbit with no GPS or an iPad that can\u2019t connect to the cloud?Hint: Ask President Obama.Mr. Obama is the first true gadget geek to occupy the Oval Office, and yet his eagerness to take part in the personal technology revolution is hampered by the secrecy and security challenges that are daily requirements of his job.What counts as must-have features for many people \u2014 high-definition cameras, powerful microphones, cloud-connected wireless radios and precise GPS location transmitters \u2014 are potential threats when the leader of the free world wants to carry them around.And so using the latest devices means more than merely ordering one on Amazon for delivery to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. It means accepting the compromises imposed by White House technology experts, whose mission is to secure the president\u2019s communications, and by the Secret Service agents who protect him.\u201cI am not allowed, for security reasons, to have an iPhone,\u201d Mr. Obama conceded at a youth summit in 2013.He has not given up, though. Mr. Obama is the first commander in chief to regularly carry a specially secured BlackBerry. He reads briefings and checks scores from ESPN on an iPad (the first of which was given to him by Steve Jobs before its public release). And recently he has been seen wearing the Fitbit Surge, a fitness band packed with all the latest technology, on his left wrist.That raises the question: How many of the device\u2019s features have been purposely disabled?Fitbit\u2019s website, which calls the Surge model \u201cthe ultimate fitness super watch,\u201d trumpets \u201cGPS tracking\u201d and \u201cwireless syncing\u201d as two key features \u2014 both of which could be problematic for security officials who are not keen on broadcasting the president\u2019s location and condition at any moment. The website notes the presence of Bluetooth communications and eight sensors, including a heart-rate monitor.White House officials repeatedly declined to comment on any of the security issues regarding the president\u2019s personal technology. Officials at Fitbit did not respond to emails requesting information about his use of their device.Still, from the experiences of others inside the White House, it is easy to conclude that Mr. Obama is not having a typical out-of-the-box experience with his electronic toys.James E. Cartwright, a retired Marine general who served as the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during part of Mr. Obama\u2019s first term, was one of the administration\u2019s earliest tech adopters. Eager for a better way to have information at his fingertips in top-secret meetings, General Cartwright was dazzled by the possibilities when the first iPad was unveiled early in 2010.\u201cIf nothing else, in the physical sense, not having to have large binders and four lieutenants to carry them for me,\u201d General Cartwright said of his decision to carry his briefing documents on an iPad. \u201cAs soon as people saw it, the race was on: \u2018How do I get one?\u2019\u201dBut it wasn\u2019t that easy, he recalled. The general\u2019s iPad was essentially a prototype modified at his direction by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the military\u2019s high-tech lab that helped develop weather satellites, the Internet, GPS, and stealth technology.The agency made physical alterations to the iPad, removing the cameras, wireless chips, location sensors and microphones. Briefing documents were loaded onto the device every morning via a secure cable. Anything General Cartwright wanted to save came off the device the same way in a process he called \u201cstore and dump.\u201d\u201cWhat I ended up with was a pretty dumb iPad,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t connected to anything. Anything was removed that could transmit.\u201dWithout such alterations, the general would not have been allowed to take the iPad into the White House Situation Room or other secured rooms known as SCIFs (Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities). Baskets sit outside such rooms so that White House staff members or other attendees can drop their iPhones before walking in.General Cartwright declined to say if the president\u2019s iPad had been altered, though others who are familiar with Mr. Obama\u2019s technology said it would not be a stretch to assume that similar precautions had been taken for the commander in chief.The president has acknowledged that his BlackBerry is enhanced with security features that ease fears of his emails being hacked or intercepted. Even so, his communications are severely limited \u2014 only a small number of designated people are even allowed to send him email.Such precautions are seen as vital in an era when cyberattacks from the nation\u2019s adversaries are common. Chinese hackers are suspected of having breached millions of records at the Office of Personnel Management, and officials believe Russian hackers penetrated an unclassified White House email system \u2014 though apparently not Mr. Obama\u2019s BlackBerry.Mr. Obama is not the first person inside the White House to take precautions against high-tech dangers.Mostly, though, Mr. Obama is just intent on being plugged in the way most Americans are these days.

That, some argue, makes them prime targets at a time when governments are grasping for revenue to fill budget deficits and trying to address populist concerns about inequality.The divide, long present in Europe, is playing out with new intensity.European Union officials in Brussels are intent on imposing a blocwide standard for taxation and clawing back what they consider to be improper tax breaks granted by national governments to multinational companies.While some countries like France and Germany are happy to see back taxes collected from big corporations as a result of the effort, others are essentially saying they would rather the companies keep all or some of their tax breaks as long as they bring prosperity.The difference in approach may not rank with more existential problems for the European Union, like how to control the migrant influx without sacrificing open borders across much of the Continent. But it shows how tax policy cuts to the core of economic competitiveness for most countries in Europe, where sustained growth and balanced budgets have been hard to achieve lately.Ms. Vestager made her comments about Britain\u2019s deal with Google on the same day that the European commissioner for financial affairs and taxes, Pierre Moscovici, proposed measures meant to close a number of corporate tax loopholes across the European Union.The European Union wants no member state to use tax policy to achieve an unfair business advantage over its neighbors. But the ability of European countries to tailor tax practices to their own purposes is a matter of national sovereignty that many leaders are unwilling to cede to Brussels. That is true for the countries that are trying to compete for jobs and foreign investment brought by multinational titans like Google, Apple or Facebook as well as for those trying to wring more tax revenue from rich companies to help support a struggling economy.\u201cNational governments have competing objectives here,\u201d Neal Todd, an international tax expert and partner at the law firm Berwin Leighton Paisner, wrote in an email message to reporters on Thursday. \u201cWhilst nearly all governments want multinationals in general (and U.S. tech groups in particular) to pay more tax,\" he wrote, \"none of them want to change their own rules only to find that businesses simply relocate to warmer fiscal climes.\"Although the British prime minister, Mr. Cameron, defended his Google deal, his political opponents have criticized it as too generous to the company and not reflective of the full magnitude of its British revenue for the 10 years it covers.In studying the Cameron-Google agreement, Ms. Vestager may follow up on a request of the Scottish National Party, a British opposition party, which has sent a letter to the European Commission criticizing the tax deal with the search giant. A spokesman for Ms. Vestager\u2019s office said on Thursday that the complaint would need to be studied to see if it warranted a formal investigation.The issue could be particularly delicate, coming as Mr. Cameron has been trying to negotiate better terms for Britain within the European Union. As soon as June, Britain may hold a referendum in which voters would be asked whether they want to remain in the bloc or leave it.But Christian Cubitt, a Cameron spokesman, declined on Thursday to elevate the tax dispute to the level of the debate on Britain\u2019s place in the European Union. He said simply that it was \u201ca decision for the commission\" to decide whether to investigate, although he stressed that Google had agreed to pay all the tax that is due.Britain is by no means alone in seeking to handle corporate tax matters on its own terms.Italian financial police officials were to issue an investigative report to Google on Thursday, indicating whether the company has paid sufficient taxes in Italy since 2008. Although Google has not been accused of wrongdoing, tax officials say the delinquent amount could be about 300 million euros, or about $325.3 million.Google is also in discussions with France over back taxes. Last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the company\u2019s executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, met with the French economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, to discuss the matter.There has been no public discussion of how much in back taxes is being sought by France\u2019s Socialist government, but local news reports have placed the figure as high as \u20ac500 million.Google\u2019s official response to reports of those negotiations has been the same, which it repeated yesterday: \u201cGoogle complies with the tax laws in every country where we operate. We continue to work with the relevant authorities.\u201dThe biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Ms. Vestager is also investigating tax arrangements between Ireland and Apple, and Luxembourg and Amazon over whether the companies received preferential tax deals that broke the European Union\u2019s state-aid rules. A decision in the Apple case is expected in March, at the earliest; the Amazon case could also be decided in the coming months. The companies and governments say they have done nothing wrong.In previous cases where Ms. Vestager has ruled that corporate tax arrangements violated European Union law by favoring certain companies, governments have been ordered to recoup back taxes that they would rather not collect lest they signal to other multinationals that their countries are not business-friendly.While Ms. Vestager is investigating cases where countries might have let companies pay too little tax, the proposals by Mr. Moscovici on Thursday are meant to prevent tax avoidance before it happens by closing gaps in cross-border rules to channel profit to subsidiaries in lower-tax countries.In a news conference, Mr. Moscovici said losses from the loopholes amounted to nearly \u20ac70 billion a year, discriminated against small business and angered ordinary citizens.His proposals mean to deter European governments from, for example, letting companies shift profit to low-tax jurisdictions. Mr. Moscovici said his proposals also showed Europe\u2019s eagerness to put into effect international standards endorsed by the leaders of Group of 20 major economies last year.Mr. Moscovici\u2019s measures would also require corporations to fully disclose all of their taxes, profit, revenue and other financial data to the administrations of all countries where they operate.The proposals, though, might be hard to turn into law. They would require the unanimous approval of European Union governments, and some could balk. And the measures would not affect the low across-the-board corporate tax rates that countries like Ireland use as an inducement to attract foreign companies.Oxfam, an antipoverty group, criticized Mr. Moscovici as taking an ineffective \u201clowest common denominator approach\u201d to the tax overhaul.British lawmakers aligned with Mr. Cameron\u2019s government were wary of Mr. Moscovici\u2019s proposals.\u201cGlobally, there is a battle raging for jobs and growth,\u201d said Ashley Fox, the leader of the delegation of British Conservatives at the European Parliament. \u201cThe E.U. must ensure that its proposals do not act as a deterrent to international investment and employment.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Friday about divisions in Europe over the taxing of multinational corporations misidentified the recipients of written comments about European tax policies from Neal Todd, an international tax expert. They were sent to the news media, not to Mr. Todd\u2019s clients.James Kanter reported from Brussels, and Mark Scott from Rome. Stephen Castle contributed reporting from London, Elisabetta Povoledo from Rome, and Aurelien Breeden from Paris.Advertisement"}

The L\u2019Or\u00e9al incubator is about three and a half years old (it is based in New Jersey and has a sister lab, the California Research Center, in San Francisco) and it started talking to PCH about teaming up 18 months ago.The patch, which can be worn from the shower to the beach, lasts five days and can then be peeled off and tossed in the garbage (it is environmentally safe, Mr. Balooch said). It is used with an app that will be available for iOS as well as Android devices; you scan the patch with your phone, and can find out when you are at greatest risk of too much exposure, and what you might do about it.You could also theoretically wear a few of the patches on different parts of your body to find out where you are most at risk to exposure, but that might look a little weird. Any exposed skin will do, though Mr. Balooch recommends using the patch on the back of the hand.As to why they started with a patch, \u201cWe know from our consumer insight research that UV exposure is a big issue for people,\u201d Mr. Balooch said. \u201cWe really only wanted to make products that would disrupt the industry.\u201dThe patch is scheduled to come to market at the end of this year. At the moment, Mr. Balooch said, the plan is to give it away with products from the L\u2019Or\u00e9al brand La Roche-Posay, a midpriced line that is sold in 60 countries at outlets as varied as Target and Amazon. Presumably, the idea being: 1.) The patch creates a halo effect around La Roche Posay; and 2.) Part of the education is that people need to apply more sunscreen, which could lead to an uptick in sales, which would ultimately benefit L\u2019Or\u00e9al.\u201cCreating something that enhances consumer experience is what drives business,\u201d Mr. Balooch said.And according to Mr. Casey, beauty brands have a leg up in this area over tech brands, because consumers already trust the products they make to put on their skin. The answer? Cross-industry pollination.The one drawback I see is that, as a woman in middle age, I might not want to wear a heart on the back of my hand while at work. It might be the sort of talking point I don\u2019t want, and it is a little childish for my personal style \u2014 which would mitigate against one of its more potentially useful lessons: How much UV exposure we get in the course of a normal working day, when we are not thinking about sun and skin protection but rather about memos and meetings.Indeed, when I showed the heart to my teenage daughter, she also thought it looked a little \u201csweet\u201d for her taste (she liked the idea of a bull\u2019s eye). A few other patch options \u2014 a ring? a bat? \u2014 might be useful. According to Mr. Balooch, they are in the pipeline.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Everybody\u2019s a Critic. And That\u2019s How It Should Be.", "Date": "2016-01-30", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisNEXT month, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will complete its annual ritual of designating the best in two dozen cinematic categories. The Oscars have come under fire this year for the predictable, shameful racial homogeneity of their nominations, but that is not the only reason to complain.Meanwhile, the pantheon of all-time great films is largely a roster of the snubbed, from \u201cCitizen Kane\u201d to \u201cDo the Right Thing\u201d to \u201cBoyhood.\u201d The best film in any given year is almost guaranteed to be one that didn\u2019t win, or one that wasn\u2019t nominated at all.That much is obvious. The Oscars are silly. Why should we suppose that 6,000 members of an insular and entitled professional association would be reliable judges of quality? A show-business oligarchy can\u2019t seriously be in the business of legislating taste.But neither can the public. Box-office data is hardly an answer to industry-insider cluelessness. \u201cAvatar\u201d has made more money than any other movie ever, but does anyone think that makes it the best movie of all time?Then again: Who am I to talk? I make my living sorting, ranking and judging movies, part of a professional guild devoted, precisely, to the legislation of taste and the denomination of excellence. If the academy is out of touch, what does that make me? A dinosaur. A stagecoach driver in the age of Uber. An old man yelling at a cloud.On the Internet, everyone is a critic \u2014 a Yelp-fueled takedown artist, an Amazon scholar, a cheerleader empowered by social media to Like and to Share. The inflated, always suspect authority of ink-stained wretches like me has been leveled by digital anarchy. Who needs a cranky nag when you have a friendly algorithm telling you, based on your previous purchases, that there is something You May Also Like, and legions of Facebook friends affirming the wisdom of your choice?The days of the all-powerful critic are over. But that figure \u2014 high priest or petty dictator, destroying and consecrating reputations with the stroke of a pen \u2014 was always a bit of a myth, an allegorical monster conjured up by timid artists and their insecure admirers. Criticism has always been a fundamentally democratic undertaking. It is an endless conversation, rather than a series of pronouncements. It is the debate that begins when you walk out of the theater or the museum, either with your friends or in the private chat room of your own head. It\u2019s not me telling you what to think; it\u2019s you and me talking. That was true before the Internet, but the rise of social media has had the thrilling, confusing effect of making the conversation literal.Like every other form of democracy, criticism is a messy, contentious business, in which the rules are as much in dispute as the outcomes and the philosophical foundations are fragile if not vaporous. We all like different things. Each of us is blessed with a snowflake-special consciousness, an apparatus of pleasure and perception that is ours alone. But we also cluster together in communities of taste that can be as prickly and polarized as the other tribes with which we identify. We are protective of our pleasures, and resent it when anyone tries to mock or mess with them.Obsessives and dilettantes, omnivores and geeks, highbrow and low, we are more likely to seek affirmation than challenge. Some people love opera. Others love hip-hop. Quite a few are interested in both. \u201cIt\u2019s all good!\u201d you might say. But you don\u2019t believe that, any more than I do. Some of it is terrible. There is, axiomatically, no disputing taste, and also no accounting for it.Or maybe that\u2019s just me. This newspaper, after all, pays me to turn my personal impressions of movies into persuasive arguments \u2014 not only to share my feelings about movies but also to assess them and provide some useful counsel to readers. So it might seem as if I\u2019m setting out here to make a self-serving point. Don\u2019t trust the Hollywood insiders who control the Oscars! Ignore the quantified peer pressure of Rotten Tomatoes or Box Office Mojo! Listen to me!And sure: I do have a stake in defending the relevance of my own job, even as I grant that it\u2019s kind of a ridiculous way to pay the rent. Critics are sometimes appreciated \u2014 or even, in rare cases, admired, like Roger Ebert \u2014 but we are more often feared, resented or ignored altogether. In the popular mind, critics are haters and killjoys. Maybe we\u2019re sadists, like the viperous, martini-swilling New York Times theater reviewer in \u201cBirdman.\u201d Or maybe we\u2019re masochists: In spite of that cruel caricature, \u201cBirdman,\u201d an Oscar best picture, is \u201cCertified Fresh\u201d by Rotten Tomatoes (I think it\u2019s vastly overrated, by the way, but that\u2019s just my opinion).The ability of critics to make a living may be precarious, but criticism remains an indispensable activity. The making of art \u2014 popular or fine, abstruse or accessible, sacred or profane \u2014 is one of the glories of our species. We are uniquely endowed with the capacity to fashion representations of the world and our experience in it, to tell stories and draw pictures, to organize sound into music and movement into dance. Just as miraculously, we have the ability, even the obligation, to judge what we have made, to argue about why we are moved, mystified, delighted or bored by any of it. At least potentially, we are all artists. And because we have the ability to recognize and respond to the creativity of others, we are all, at least potentially, critics, too.This means, above all, that our job is to think. As consumers of culture, we are lulled into passivity or, at best, prodded toward a state of pseudo-semi-self-awareness, encouraged toward either the defensive group identity of fandom or a shallow, half-ironic eclecticism. We graze, we binge, we pick up and discard aesthetic experiences as if they were cheap toys. Which they frequently are \u2014 mass-produced widgets from the corporate assembly line.Meanwhile, in our roles as citizens of the political commonwealth we are conscripted into a polarized climate of ideological belligerence. Bluster substitutes for argument. Important political divisions are at once magnified and trivialized. There is little room for doubt and scant time for reflection as we find ourselves buffeted by sensation and opinion.How do we sort through it all? How do we manage the prodigious too-muchness of the demands on our attention? The incentives not to think \u2014 to be one of the many available varieties of stupid \u2014 are powerful. But there is also genius around us, and within us. There is \u201cHamilton\u201d and \u201cTo Pimp a Butterfly,\u201d \u201cTransparent\u201d and the novels of Elena Ferrante. Take your pick! Make your case!We are far too inclined to regard art as a frivolous, ornamental undertaking and to perceive taste as a fixed, narrow track along which we stumble, alone or in like-minded company. At the same time, we too often seek to subordinate the creative, pleasure-giving aspects of our lives to supposedly more consequential areas of experience, stuffing the aesthetic dimensions of existence into the boxes that hold our religious beliefs, our political dogmas or our moral certainties. We belittle art. We aggrandize nonsense. We can\u2019t see beyond the horizon of our own conventional wisdom.Enough of that! It\u2019s the mission of art to free our minds, and the task of criticism to figure out what to do with that freedom. That everyone is a critic means that we are each capable of thinking against our own prejudices, of balancing skepticism with open-mindedness, of sharpening our dulled and glutted senses and battling the intellectual inertia that surrounds us. We need to put our remarkable minds to use and to pay our own experience the honor of taking it seriously.The real culture war (the one that never ends) is between the human intellect and its equally human enemies: sloth, clich\u00e9, pretension, cant. Between creativity and conformity, between the comforts of the familiar and the shock of the new. To be a critic is to be a soldier in this fight, a defender of the life of art and a champion of the art of living.It\u2019s not just a job, in other words.A.O.

{"Headline": "Payment Processor to Stop Working With Daily Fantasy Sports Clients", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Supported byA payment processing company that handles a significant number of transactions for the two dominant daily fantasy sports companies notified the operators this week that it would no longer handle their payments and in fact was leaving the industry altogether. It is perhaps the biggest blow yet to an industry that has been pummeled by legal challenges in recent months.Vantiv Entertainment Solutions, the processing company, told its daily fantasy clients, which include FanDuel and DraftKings, that it would \u201csuspend all processing for payment transactions\u201d related to daily fantasy sports in the United States and its territories on Feb. 29.The company cited the unfavorable opinions that have been issued by state attorneys general in recent months. Seven states, including Mississippi on Friday, have concluded that daily fantasy games were a form of gambling or were illegal under their current laws.\u201cAs you are aware, an increasing number of state attorneys general have determined that daily fantasy sports (\u2018D.F.S.\u2019) constitute illegal gambling,\u201d Jonathan Ellman, chief transaction and marketing counsel at Vantiv, wrote in a letter obtained by The New York Times. \u201cAlthough in recent weeks D.F.S. operators have raised numerous arguments to the contrary, to date those arguments have been unsuccessful and/or rejected.\u201dMr. Ellman did not return a phone call for comment, nor did the spokesman for the Cincinnati-based company, Andrew D. Ciafardini.\u201cWe are not aware of what Vantiv may or may not have told other industry participants about its plans,\u201d David Boies, a lawyer for DraftKings, said in a statement. \u201cHowever, to be clear, first, Vantiv has not told DraftKings that it plans to cease fulfilling its contractual obligations as of \u2018Feb 29, 2016\u2019 (or any other date). Second, Vantiv is under court order to continue to fulfill its contractual obligation to DraftKings.\u201dA spokeswoman for FanDuel said the company had no comment.The daily fantasy sports sites do not handle players\u2019 deposits and withdrawals, leaving that to payment processors like Vantiv. Without them, sites like FanDuel and DraftKings are essentially unable to operate.It is not known what percentage of payments Vantiv handles in the industry, but it is seen as a major player. PayPal Holdings Inc. also processes payments for daily sports companies.If another company does not step in to handle the tens of millions of dollars in transactions, or if major banks and credit card companies follow Vantiv\u2019s lead, it could have crippling consequences for a $2 billion industry under siege by state attorneys general across the nation.\u201cWe are aware of Vantiv\u2019s recent decision to discontinue processing payments for Daily Fantasy Sports services,\u201d PayPal spokeswoman Martha Cass said in a statement. \u201cWe continue to review and consider ongoing developments in relation to daily fantasy sports.\u201dSarah Jane Hughes, an expert on banking and payment systems, said Vantiv was a dominant player in the online gaming industry and its abandonment of daily fantasy sports was a severe blow.\u201cThis is a game changer because I\u2019m not sure who will touch this industry if Vantiv won\u2019t,\u201d said Hughes, a professor at the Indiana University Maurer School of Law.Legal experts have said that under the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006, when a state says that a sports website is offering gambling services unlawfully, the onus is on payment providers like Vantiv to prohibit restricted transactions or risk steep civil or criminal penalties. The companies then have to decide if they are willing to risk losing retail businesses like Amazon and others that provide online services.Players of daily fantasy sports assemble their own teams of professional athletes and engage in competition based on the players\u2019 statistical performances in games. The recent spate of attorney general opinions that have acknowledged there is an element of chance in daily fantasy sports appears to have shaken Vantiv\u2019s belief that the games were not violating the law.\u201cVantiv remains firmly committed to the online gaming and fantasy gaming segments,\u201d the Vantiv letter said. \u201cAs payments experts in the online gaming space, Vantiv will continue to work with stakeholders for a long-term solution to the ongoing D.F.S. controversy. When there is better clarity and long-term certainty around the regulatory and judicial landscape related to D.F.S., Vantiv may decide to resume processing these types of payment transactions.\u201dIn November, Vantiv, a publicly traded company, told its daily fantasy sports clients that it must stop accepting players from New York in light of the cease-and-desist order from the state attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, who said daily fantasy sports contests constituted illegal gambling under state law. In December, Justice Manuel J. Mendez of State Supreme Court granted that request from Mr. Schneiderman. But hours later, an appellate judge granted FanDuel and DraftKings a stay of that decision, allowing them to continue to operate while their appeal was being considered.In a lawsuit subsequently filed in New York State Supreme Court, Vantiv said it was caught in the middle of conflicting court rulings and asked a judge to decide whether it could continue its work for daily fantasy sports companies.In its filing, Vantiv said it could not comply with both a temporary order from a Massachusetts judge that it process payments for DraftKings customers and a preliminary injunction from a New York judge that bars DraftKings from doing business in that state. It has resulted in a \u201csubstantial uncertainty,\u201d Vantiv argued, over what the company should do regarding payment processing.Last week, the Texas attorney general joined New York and Illinois, saying that daily fantasy sports are not legal under its state law. These rulings have prompted FanDuel and DraftKings to initiate costly and probably lengthy litigation.With Texas accounting for more than 5 percent of those companies\u2019 players, FanDuel and DraftKings are at risk of losing more than 25 percent of their customers, according to Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, a research firm focused on the gaming industry.New York, with more than 1.2 million customers, is the largest market, and the companies will lose a combined $35 million to $40 million annually, according to Eilers. Illinois is the third-largest market, with 6.7 percent of the industry\u2019s customer base.As important as a customer base is for daily fantasy sports, it is perhaps rivaled by the ability to collect deposits.\u201cI don\u2019t know if it was a regulator or a shareholder,\u201d Hughes said, \u201cbut something spooked Vantiv to bail out of what was certainly a very lucrative business.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But now she\u2019s so desperate to have a girls\u2019 weekend that she\u2019s willing to be swept up in a liberation anthem she doesn\u2019t even know. At this awkward point in her nascent womyn-hood, she\u2019s all feet.The whole scene should be the height of embarrassment: two grown women rocking out to folk music in a suburban car with their earth-mother \u201cMoppa.\u201d The song rolls into the credits, which on boutique cable and streaming shows typically feature a pop song that sums up, with a wink of irony, the last shot or the mood of the entire episode. It\u2019s music that doesn\u2019t so much tell you how to feel as much as it tells you how the show feels: cool. But what makes this scene transcendent is the proud reclamation of the uncool, of obviousness. It clears out all of the self-conscious noise of being cool and concentrates instead on being free.And without exactly realizing it, I was also free. I was in the grip of an emotional force, of an exhilaration that has taken decades to come back to popular culture and now feels profoundly, perhaps inexorably, here. Presently, the beautiful mess of what it means to be alive, what it means to be human, is being staged almost entirely within the realm of women\u2019s sexuality.The improvement isn\u2019t a matter of occupation; many of the women in these shows don\u2019t have one. It\u2019s a matter of behavior. These are messed-up, funny, unhappy, vulnerable, yet indomitable, people. They can feel anything and everything. So, by extension, can you.Then, at the movies, there\u2019s \u201cCarol,\u201d Todd Haynes\u2019s lesbian romance, which is hampered by its sense of discretion.In Mr. Haynes\u2019s film, set in the early 1950s, a strapping, affluent housewife named Carol Aird (Cate Blanchett) locks eyes across a busy Manhattan department store with a petite cashier named Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara). They fall for each other, hit the road and have a less blissful time in Carol\u2019s car than the Pfeffermans do in theirs. Carol and Therese are ruing the consequences of their love, fleeing the hurt of a morality clause in a legal judgment that, under the circumstances, sounds more horrific: morality claws. In discovering Therese, Carol stands to lose custody of her daughter, Rindy.Working from an adaptation by Phyllis Nagy of Patricia Highsmith\u2019s 1952 novel, \u201cThe Price of Salt,\u201d Mr. Haynes is back in the mannerist mode of another of his period studies of sexual awakening and repression, the crest of which is \u201cFar From Heaven\u201d from 2002, a masterly conflation of film history and feminist tragedy. This time, he\u2019s just as interested in sexuality and the cinematic past. But where in \u201cFar From Heaven\u201d his strategy was to unpack and reveal, with \u201cCarol,\u201d he has decided to conceal.The camera obscures its two women in the glare of windshields and windows. You see the backs of their heads almost as frequently as you see their faces. \u201cKeep this room orderly,\u201d reads a sign in the staff cafeteria at Therese\u2019s department store, and on that front Mr. Haynes\u2019s doesn\u2019t disappoint. This is a work of respectful restraint. The film\u2019s lone sex scene is shot in part from abstracting angles and fades into a writhing blur. The weather is so gray and wet that \u201crindy\u201d also might describe the film\u2019s look.This movie is the opposite side of transparent. It\u2019s opaque.Mr. Haynes\u2019s movie works best, for me, on Ms. Mulvey\u2019s terms. Can a man \u2014 even a gay man, like Mr. Haynes \u2014 have a female gaze? Should he? The way he and Ms. Nagy present it, lesbianism obviates a male gaze. Therese turns to leave a record shop and notices a pair of women, standing intimately close, noticing her. The movie makes her a photographer, and many of her early pictures are of Carol, which means we\u2019re watching a romance about, among other things, a woman watching a woman. That shouldn\u2019t be intriguing; it\u2019s not even new. (There\u2019s Lisa Cholodenko\u2019s \u201cHigh Art\u201d from 1998, for one thing.) And yet it is.Ms. Soloway and her collaborators (including many lesbians, trans and cisgender women) also seem acutely aware of the implications of all that gazing. But Ms. Soloway\u2019s show seems allergic to the tentative politeness of Mr. Haynes\u2019s artistry. Dreamy flashbacks to Maura\u2019s mother and grandmother in Weimar Berlin, with their strategic inattention to language, accents and period accuracy, feel vividly like now.In the Dec. 14th issue of The New Yorker, Ariel Levy dropped in on planet Soloway and wove a report of the preciousness, eccentricity, academia and pre-emptive, presumptive femaleness that fuels the creation of the show. All the waves of feminism and queer theory seemed to have Ms. Levy questioning, understandably, whether to put on a wet suit. But to the extent that activist ideology operates within the actual show, it\u2019s presented as unsettled and up for debate. Ali\u2019s exploratory, politicized lesbianism offends her more traditional girlfriend (Carrie Brownstein, who also shows up for a minute in \u201cCarol\u201d) and amuses the roving, rapacious Sarah, who, while stewing in a sauna, basically says that she couldn\u2019t care less about the patriarchy.The show makes it look easy to not care less, even though caring is a key to why \u201cTransparent\u201d works so powerfully. Like any good drama, it keeps inventing problems for itself to solve, in matters of religion, Jewishness, class and snobbery (though not so much on race \u2014 not yet). The show is a whirlpool, pulling in characters from other places and other eras, subtly psychologizing their behavior and revelations. The farther out it spins \u2014 juxtaposing the present and the past; history and \u201cherstory\u201d \u2014 the stronger it seems to get.Mr. Haynes, by contrast, has built an island for two. His lesbians are ambiguously adrift in some queer, icy before that makes you wonder if they\u2019ll experience \u2014 or help instigate \u2014 a version of Ms. Soloway\u2019s emphatically self-actualized after.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Happiness Code", "Date": "2016-01-14", "News": "FeatureA new approach to self-improvement is taking off in Silicon Valley: cold, hard rationality.Supported byThe goal of the \u2018\u2018CoZE\u2019\u2019 exercise, Smith explained, was to \u2018\u2018peek over the fence\u2019\u2019 to a new self; by doing something that makes you uncomfortable and then observing the result. There was an anticipatory hush, and then the room erupted. One person gave a toast. A product manager at Dropbox broke into song. In a corner, a programmer named Brent took off his shirt, revealing a milky chest and back, then sat with his head bowed. (He would later walk around wearing a handwritten sign that read, \u2018\u2018Please touch me.\u2019\u2019)The exercise went on for an hour, and afterward, participants giddily shared their stories. One person described going onto the patio and watching everyone else through the window, in order to experience a feeling of exclusion. Another submerged his hand in a pan of leftover chicken curry, to challenge his natural fastidiousness. Unexpectedly, he enjoyed the experience. \u2018\u2018It felt playful,\u2019\u2019 he said.Some of these problems are byproducts of our brain\u2019s reward system. We cash checks quickly but drag our feet paying credit-card bills, no matter the financial cost, because cashing a check generates a surge of dopamine but paying a bill makes us stressed. Other mistakes are glitchier. A person who owes back taxes might avoid talking to the I.R.S. because of a lingering monkey-brain belief that avoiding bad news keeps it from being true. While such logical errors may be easy to spot in others, the group says, they\u2019re often harder to see in ourselves. The workshop promised to give participants the tools to address these flaws, which, it hinted, are almost certainly worse than we realize. As the center\u2019s website warns, \u2018\u2018Careful thinking just isn\u2019t enough to understand our minds\u2019 hidden failures.\u2019\u2019Most self-help appeals to us because it promises real change without much real effort, a sort of fad diet for the psyche. (\u2018\u2018The Four-Hour Workweek,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up.\u2019\u2019) By the magical-thinking standards of the industry, then, CFAR\u2019s focus on science and on tiresome levels of practice can seem almost radical. It has also generated a rare level of interest among data-driven tech people and entrepreneurs who see personal development as just another optimization problem, if a uniquely central one. Yet, while CFAR\u2019s methods are unusual, its aspirational promise \u2014 that a better version of ourselves is within reach \u2014 is distinctly familiar. The center may emphasize the benefits that will come to those who master the techniques of rational thought, like improved motivation and a more organized inbox, but it also suggests that the real reward will be far greater, enabling users to be more intellectually dynamic and nimble. Or as Smith put it, \u2018\u2018We\u2019re trying to invent parkour for the mind.\u2019\u2019This is all the more surprising given that the workshops, which cost $3,900 per person, are run like a college-dorm cram session. Participants stay on-site for the entire time (typically four days and nights), often in bargain-basement conditions. In San Leandro, the organizers packed 48 people (36 participants, plus six staff members and six volunteers) into a single house, using twin mattresses scattered on the floor as extra beds. In the kitchen, I asked Matt O\u2019Brien, a 30-year-old product manager who develops brain-training software for Lumosity, whether he minded the close quarters. He looked briefly puzzled, then explained that he already lives with 20 housemates in a shared house in San Francisco. Looking around the chaotic kitchen, he shrugged and said, \u2018\u2018It\u2019s not really all that different.\u2019\u2019Those constraints produced a peculiar homogeneity. Nearly all the participants were in their early- to mid-20s, with quirky bios of the Bay Area variety. (\u2018\u2018Asher is a singing, freestyle rapping, former international Quidditch All-American turned software engineer.\u2019\u2019) Communication styles tended toward the formal. When I excused myself from one conversation, my interlocutor said, \u2018\u2018I will allow you to disengage,\u2019\u2019 then gave a courtly bow. The only older attendee, a man in his 50s who described himself as polyamorous and \u2018\u2018part Vulcan,\u2019\u2019 ghosted through the workshop, padding silently around the house in shorts and a polo shirt.If the demographics of the workshop were alarmingly narrow, there was no disputing the group\u2019s studiousness. Over the course of four days, I heard not a single scrap of chatter about anything unrelated to rationality. Nor, so far as I could discern, did anybody ever leave the house. Not for a quick trip to the Starbucks a mile down the road. Not for a walk in the sprawling park a half-mile away. One participant, Phoenix Eliot, had recently moved into a shared house where everyone was a \u2018\u2018practicing rationalist\u2019\u2019 and reported that the experience had been positive. \u2018\u2018We haven\u2019t really had any interpersonal problems,\u2019\u2019 Eliot told me. \u2018\u2018Whereas if this were a regular house, with people who just like each other, I think there would have been a lot more issues.\u2019\u2019When I first spoke to Galef, she told me that, while the group tends to attract analytical thinkers, a purely logical approach to problem-solving is not the goal. \u2018\u2018A lot of people think that rationality means acting like Spock and ignoring things like intuition and emotion,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018But we\u2019ve found that that approach doesn\u2019t actually work.\u2019\u2019 Instead, she said, the aim was to bring the emotional, instinctive parts of the brain (dubbed \u2018\u2018System One\u2019\u2019 by Kahneman) into harmony with the more intellectual, goal-setting parts of the brain (\u2018\u2018System Two\u2019\u2019).At the orientation, Galef emphasized this point. System One wasn\u2019t something to be overcome, she said, but a wise adviser, capable of sensing problems that our conscious minds hadn\u2019t yet registered. It also played a key role in motivation. \u2018\u2018The prefrontal cortex is like a monkey riding an elephant,\u2019\u2019 she told the group. \u2018\u2018System One is the elephant. And you\u2019re not going to steer an elephant by telling it where it should go.\u2019\u2019 The challenge, Galef said, was to recognize instances in which the two systems were at war, leading to a feeling of \u2018\u2018stuckness\u2019\u2019: \u2018\u2018Things like, \u2018I want to go to the gym more, but I don\u2019t go.\u2019 Or, \u2018I want my Ph.D., but I don\u2019t want to work on it.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 She sketched a picture of a duck facing one way and its legs and feet resolutely pointed in the opposite direction. She called these problems \u2018\u2018software bugs.\u2019\u2019Afterward, I chatted with O\u2019Brien and Mike Plotz, a circus juggler-turned-coder, about the program\u2019s appeal. When I asked Plotz why he thought the workshops attracted so many programmers, he glanced at O\u2019Brien. \u2018\u2018I think most of us are fairly analytical,\u2019\u2019 he began. \u2018\u2018We like to think about how complex systems work and how they can be optimized.\u2019\u2019 Because of this, Plotz added, he tends to notice patterns of behavior, in himself and in others. \u2018\u2018When you realize that people are complex systems \u2014 that we operate in complicated ways, but also sort of follow rules \u2014 you start to think about how you might tweak some of those variables.\u2019\u2019Deliberately or not, CFAR\u2019s application process also filters out many of the less committed. There is an extensive, in-person interview, conducted by an instructor. Afterward, participants are required to fill out an elaborate self-report, in which they\u2019re asked to assess their own personality traits and behaviors. (A friend or family member is given a similar questionnaire to confirm the accuracy of the applicant\u2019s self-assessment.) \u2018\u2018We get a fair number of people who say, \u2018I want to come to the workshop because everybody I work with is really irrational and I want to fix them,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Anna Salamon told me. \u2018\u2018Which is not what we are looking for.\u2019\u2019Despite this rigorous vetting, Salamon acknowledged that the center\u2019s aims are ultimately proselytic. CFAR began as a spinoff of MIRI, which Yudkowsky created in 2000, in part to study the impending threat posed by artificially intelligent machines, which, he argued, could eventually destroy humanity. (Yudkowsky\u2019s concern was that the machines could become sentient, hide this from their human operators and then decide to eliminate us.) Over the years, Yudkowsky found that people struggled to think clearly about A.I. risk and were often dismissive of it. In 2011, Salamon, who had been working at MIRI since 2008, volunteered to figure out how to overcome that problem.When I spoke with Salamon, she said that \u2018\u2018global catastrophic risks\u2019\u2019 like sentient A.I. were often difficult to assess. There wasn\u2019t much data from which to extrapolate; this not only made the threats harder to evaluate but also discouraged researchers from digging into the question. (Studies have shown that people are more likely to avoid thinking about problems that feel depressing or vague and are also more likely to engage in mental \u2018\u2018discounting\u2019\u2019 \u2014 assuming that the risk of something bad happening is lower than it actually is.) CFAR\u2019s original mandate was to give researchers the mental tools to overcome their unconscious assumptions. Or as Salamon put it, \u2018\u2018We were staring at the problem of staring at the problem.\u2019\u2019Like many in the community, Salamon believes that the skills of rational thought, as taught by CFAR, are important to humanity\u2019s long-term survival, in part because they can help us confront such seemingly remote catastrophic risks, as well as more familiar ones, like poverty and climate change. \u2018\u2018One thing that primates tend to do is to make up stories for why something we believe must be true,\u2019\u2019 Salamon told me. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s very rare that we genuinely evaluate the evidence for our beliefs.\u2019\u2019It was a point of view that nearly everyone at the workshop fervently shared. As one participant told me: \u2018\u2018Self-help is just the gateway. The real goal is: Save the world.\u2019\u2019As a lecturer, Smith had a messianic quality, gazing intensely at students and moving with taut deliberation, as though perpetually engaged in a tai-chi workout. Goal factoring, Smith explained, is essentially a structured thought exercise: a way to analyze an aspiration (\u2018\u2018I want to be promoted to manager\u2019\u2019) by identifying the subgoals that drive it. While some of these may be obvious, others (\u2018\u2018I want to impress my ex-girlfriend\u2019\u2019) might be more embarrassing or less conscious. The purpose of the exercise, Smith said, was to develop a process for seeing your own motivations honestly and for spotting when they might be leading you astray. \u2018\u2018These are blind spots,\u2019\u2019 Smith warned. \u2018\u2018Blind spots that can poison your ability to keep track of what\u2019s truly important to you.\u2019\u2019To begin the factoring process, Smith asked each of us to choose a goal, list all the things we believed would come from accomplishing it and then brainstorm ways to achieve each thing. If you wanted a promotion to make more money, was there another way to get a higher salary \u2014 say, by asking for a raise or changing jobs? Finally, Smith said, we should imagine having achieved each of those subgoals. Were we satisfied? If not, that indicated the presence of a hidden motive, one that we had either overlooked or didn\u2019t want to acknowledge.Though the exercise didn\u2019t strike me as especially penetrating \u2014 garden-variety introspection made punctilious \u2014 it was hugely popular. My group in the goal-factoring session included Ben Pace, a sweetly lumbering 18-year-old in a suit jacket and running shoes, who tended to balance his notepad on his knee like an old-timey newspaper reporter. Pace had flown over from Britain for the workshop, which he discovered at 15 by reading the LessWrong blog. He had applied to Oxford for the fall, and was hoping to attend. \u2018\u2018I was feeling very worried about it,\u2019\u2019 he confided, \u2018\u2018but then I goal-factored it and realized that I could get many of the same things I want from Oxford in other ways.\u2019\u2019While Pace said that he had come to the workshop to practice the techniques of rationality, others had more pressing worries. During one break, I chatted with Andrew, a software developer specializing in mobile platforms who asked to be identified only by his first name to protect his privacy. Andrew acknowledged that he tended to struggle in social situations and suffered from depression and anxiety. \u2018\u2018My brain has a lot of ridiculous social rules,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018I tend to be very closed off. And then there\u2019s a switch where I\u2019m almost completely open. It\u2019s this binary transition.\u2019\u2019Andrew said that he had initially been dubious of applied rationality, which he first heard about in a Reddit philosophy forum. Over time, though, he found that using the techniques made it easier to catch himself in the act of rationalizing a bad decision or avoiding an unpleasant task, like applying for a job. Initially, Andrew said, he assumed that he was simply afraid of rejection. But when he used aversion factoring \u2014 like goal factoring, but focused on what makes you avoid an unpleasant but important task \u2014 he made a surprising discovery. While visualizing how he would feel about applying for jobs if there were no chance of rejection, he realized that he still found the task aversive. In the end, he determined that his reluctance was rooted in a fear not of rejection but of making a bad career choice.It was a significant insight, the kind more typically won through hours of talk therapy. And indeed, some participants reported that the techniques had genuinely changed their lives, either by helping them with mental-health issues like attention deficit or obsessive-compulsive disorder or simply by allowing them to recognize unquestioned assumptions. For a few \u2014 especially a set of high achievers for whom success hadn\u2019t brought happiness \u2014 that process had been nearly tectonic. \u2018\u2018For most of my life, I believed \u2018If I do a good job, good things will happen,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 one person told me. \u2018\u2018Now I ask, \u2018If I do a good job, what does that mean?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019Others, though, seemed to see rationality less as a fundamental recalibration and more as a tool to be wielded. One participant, Michael Gao \u2014 who claimed that, before he turned 18, he made $10 million running a Bitcoin mine but then lost it all in the Mt. Gox collapse \u2014 seemed appalled when I suggested that the experience might have led him to value things besides accomplishment, like happiness and human connection. The problem, he clarified, was not that he had been too ambitious but that he hadn\u2019t been ambitious enough. \u2018\u2018I want to augment the race,\u2019\u2019 Gao told me earnestly, as we sat on the patio. \u2018\u2018I want humanity to achieve great things. I want us to conquer death.\u2019\u2019Given that I had already undergone a fair amount of talk therapy myself, I didn\u2019t expect the workshop to bring me much in the way of new insights. But then, at one point, Smith cited the example of a man with a potentially cancerous mole who refuses to go see the doctor. It was part, he said, of \u2018\u2018a broader class of mental errors\u2019\u2019 we\u2019re all prone to: the belief that avoiding bad news will keep it from becoming true. While this didn\u2019t strike me as particularly revelatory at the time, it turned out to be a stealthy insight. For an exercise the next day, I listed all the reasons I was avoiding talking with a financial planner, something I had intended to do for months. Many of them were pedestrian. Getting my financial records together would be tedious, and I was also mildly embarrassed by my income, which is on the low side. Working through the problem, though, I realized that the actual reason was humiliatingly simple: I was afraid of hearing that I needed to spend less and save more. Like mole man, I was afraid of what I might learn.But are such realizations alone enough to create change? Fears can be stubborn and not particularly easy to argue with. When I mentioned this to Smith, he shrugged. \u2018\u2018Hiding from the painful states of the world doesn\u2019t prevent them from happening,\u2019\u2019 he said. Then, like a strict parent telling a sniffling child to shape up, he added: \u2018\u2018The point isn\u2019t just \u2018How do I get myself to go to the doctor this time?\u2019 It\u2019s \u2018How do I make it so that I will never be susceptible to that type of thinking error again?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019Among other things, they found that people are typically both risk-averse and loss-averse: more likely to choose a guaranteed payout of $1,000 than to gamble on winning $1,400 when there\u2019s a 20 percent chance they could end up with nothing. They also discovered that people tend to underestimate the chance of a low-probability event occurring, thus inadvertently exposing themselves to terrible risks. (The 2011 tsunami, for example, caught the Japanese off guard and devastated parts of northeastern Japan.)In the past few decades, psychologists have identified dozens of cognitive biases, including \u2018\u2018gambler\u2019s fallacy\u2019\u2019 (believing that a coin toss is more likely to come up heads if the previous five flips were tails); \u2018\u2018anchoring\u2019\u2019 (the tendency to rely heavily on one piece of information \u2014 usually the first thing we learn \u2014 when making a decision); the \u2018\u2018Ikea effect\u2019\u2019 (disproportionately valuing things that you\u2019ve labored over); and \u2018\u2018unit bias\u2019\u2019 (assuming that a \u2018\u2018portion\u2019\u2019 is the right size, which accounts for our tendency to finish off an opened bag of cookies).What makes CFAR novel is its effort to use those same principles to fix personal problems: to break frustrating habits, recognize self-defeating cycles and relentlessly interrogate our own wishful inclinations and avoidant instincts. Galef described \u2018\u2018propagating urges\u2019\u2019 \u2014 a mental exercise designed to make long-term goals feel more viscerally rewarding \u2014 as an extension of operant conditioning, in which an experimenter who hopes to increase a certain behavior in an animal will reward incremental steps toward that behavior. Goal factoring and aversion factoring, she added, came out of behavioral economics, as well as research on a cognitive bias known as \u2018\u2018introspection illusion\u2019\u2019: thinking we understand our motives or fears when we actually don\u2019t. (That illusion is why the factoring process begins with listing every reason you\u2019re either avoiding something or pursuing a goal, and then uses a second round of thought experiments to ferret out hidden factors.)Figuring out how to translate behavioral-economics insights into a curriculum involved years of trial and error. Salamon recruited Galef, a former science journalist, in 2011, and later hired Smith, then a graduate student in math education at San Diego State. (Smith first met Yudkowsky at a conference dedicated to cryonics, in which a deceased person\u2019s body is stored in a supercooled vat, to be resuscitated in a more advanced future.) In early 2012, the group began offering free classes to test its approach and quickly learned that almost none of it worked. Participants complained that the lectures were abstract and confusing and that some points seemed obvious while others simply felt wrong. A session on Bayes\u2019s Theorem was especially unpopular, Salamon recalled, adding, \u2018\u2018People visibly suffered through it.\u2019\u2019The group also discovered a deeper problem: No one was very motivated to make his or her thinking more accurate. What people did want, Salamon recalled, was help with their personal problems. Some were constantly late to things. Others felt trapped by their own unproductive habits. Nearly everyone wanted help managing their email, eating better and improving their relationships. \u2018\u2018Relatively early on,\u2019\u2019 Salamon said, \u2018\u2018we realized that we had to disguise the epistemic rationality content as productivity advice or relationship advice.\u2019\u2019In the end, the group built a curriculum largely from existing research into human behavior, but the goal of Applied Rationality remained the same: to provide tools, not advice. \u2018\u2018Unlike a lot of self-help programs, we don\u2019t advocate particular things that people should do,\u2019\u2019 Galef told me. \u2018\u2018We just encourage them to look at the models that are driving their choices and try to examine those models rationally.\u2019\u2019 She shrugged. \u2018\u2018People are already making predictions, whether or not they\u2019re aware of it. They\u2019re already saying \u2018I\u2019ll be miserable if I leave this relationship\u2019 or \u2018I won\u2019t be able to make any difference in this big global problem because I\u2019m just one person.\u2019 So a lot of what we do is just trying to make people more aware of those predictions and to question whether they\u2019re actually accurate.\u2019\u2019The TAPs session was led by Salamon, a thin, muppety woman with a corona of brown hair. As a graduate student, Salamon studied the philosophy of science, and her lectures often seemed to take the wry view of humans as only marginally more evolved chimps. Involuntary TAPs already drive much of our behavior, she said \u2014 \u2018\u2018Like: See open bag of Cheetos. Put in hand\u2019\u2019 \u2014 but could also be made intentional and productive.My partner for the TAPs exercise, a soft-spoken engineer who works at Google, told me that he had tried TAPs before, but with limited success. \u2018\u2018For a while, I was trying to drink more water, so I set up a TAP to drink a glass of water the minute I got to work,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018It worked for a few weeks, but then I stopped. I started just wanting to get to work.\u2019\u2019 Now, he said, he was considering changing his TAP, to cue himself to drink water when he wanted a break. \u2018\u2018Maybe it\u2019ll help me stop reading Reddit,\u2019\u2019 he added.If TAPs felt slightly gimmicky, like rat-maze training for adults, other techniques seemed more profound. My favorite was propagating urges, the one that focused on motivating yourself to reach long-term goals. What makes things like weight loss or learning to play the violin difficult, Salamon said, is that they often conflict with System One-driven urges (wanting a nap, craving a cookie). And because long-term goals typically require sticking it out through a series of unpleasant intermediate steps (eating less, practicing the violin), it can be easy to lose the original motivation. \u2018\u2018Things we feel rewarded by, we do automatically,\u2019\u2019 Salamon added. \u2018\u2018When I want Thai food, I\u2019ll drive there, look at the menu, go inside, order. I don\u2019t have to convince myself to take those steps. But in other cases, the connection is lost.\u2019\u2019The solution, she said, is finding a way to make long-term goals feel more like short-term urges, especially because our brains are wired to associate actions and rewards that follow closely in time. (To discourage bad habits, conversely, you should stretch out the time between an action and its reward. \u2018\u2018If you want to stop reading stuff online instead of working, have the pages load more slowly,\u2019\u2019 Salamon advised.) Because of this powerful association, small but immediate negative experiences can have disproportionate impact: the aversive moment of getting into a cold swimming pool can overwhelm the delayed rewards of doing morning laps. To override that resistance, she said, you need to associate the activity with a powerful feeling of reward, one with a stronger neurochemical kick than the virtuous goals (\u2018\u2018being healthier\u2019\u2019) that we normally aspire to. The next step is to come up with a mental image that vividly captures that feeling and that you can summon in moments of weakness. \u2018\u2018It has to be a very sticky image,\u2019\u2019 Salamon said. \u2018\u2018If it isn\u2019t, you won\u2019t experience that gut-level surge of motivation.\u2019\u2019 She told a story about how Smith overcame his aversion to doing push-ups, which made him feel unpleasantly hot and sweaty, by tapping into his obsession with longevity: now he pictured the heat from the exercise as a fire that burned away cell-damaging free radicals.What made propagating urges so compelling, at least for me, was that it cut to the heart of a fundamental internal struggle: the clash between the shortsighted impulses that drive our daily behavior (checking email until it becomes \u2018\u2018too late\u2019\u2019 to go to the gym) and the long-term aspirations that might make us genuinely happier if we could only persuade the petulant toddler in our minds to get onboard.In a practice session, I paired up with Brian Raszap, a programmer at Amazon with a gentle smile and empathic manner. The aim of the exercise was to troubleshoot a long-term goal that we had each been struggling with and then create a new, sticky image to use as motivation. Raszap went first. He explained that he and some co-workers go to a Brazilian jujitsu class during lunch, usually once or twice a week. \u2018\u2018When I go, I love it,\u2019\u2019 Raszap told me. \u2018\u2018I feel so good. But half the time, I don\u2019t go.\u2019\u2019We talked through the problem for a while, then I asked Raszap to describe the feeling that he got from the class. He brightened. After working out, he told me, he is very relaxed, filled with a deeply pleasurable lassitude. When I asked if he could tap into that for motivation, Raszap nodded. \u2018\u2018Maybe that would work,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I usually think about wanting to get better at jujitsu. But maybe instead, I can think about feeling really good this afternoon.\u2019\u2019Many of CFAR\u2019s techniques resemble a kind of self-directed version of psychotherapy\u2019s holy trinity: learning to notice behaviors and assumptions that we\u2019re often barely conscious of; feeling around to understand the roots of those behaviors; and then using those insights to create change. But there was something unsettling about how CFAR focused on superficial fixes while overlooking potentially deeper issues. While talking with Raszap, I began by asking why, if he truly wanted to go, he often skipped the jujitsu class. Raszap listed practical obstacles: Sometimes he doesn\u2019t want the interruption; sometimes he just has a lot to do. But he also said that even the idea of attending the class more regularly makes him feel anxious. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s a feeling of not doing enough,\u2019\u2019 Raszap told me. Perversely, the workout only heightened his fear of failing, of missing the next class. This was coupled with a claustrophobic sense of obligation, what Raszap called \u2018\u2018a fear of foreverness\u2019\u2019 \u2014 \u2018\u2018Like, if I go today, I\u2019ll have to keep going forever.\u2019\u2019When I told Raszap that these last anxieties sounded like the sort of thing that might benefit more from psychotherapy than from behavior-modification techniques, he agreed. \u2018\u2018I do have a good therapist, and we do talk about this,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018But it\u2019s a different approach. Therapy is more about grand life narratives. Applied rationality is more practical, like, \u2018What if you went to jujitsu in the evening, rather than at lunch?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019Yet applied rationality doesn\u2019t typically acknowledge this gap. Proponents of rationality tend to talk about the brain as a kind of second-rate computer, jammed full of old legacy software but possible to reprogram if you can master the code. The reality, though, is almost certainly more complex. We often can\u2019t see our biggest blind spots clearly or recognize their influence without outside help.Several weeks after the workshop, I asked Salamon whether CFAR was intended to be a kind of D.I.Y. therapy, because that seemed to be how some participants were using it. She demurred, saying that the instructors have occasionally recommended counseling to participants who exhibit truly alarming behaviors and beliefs. But she considered therapy-grade problems to be relatively rare. \u2018\u2018Ninety percent of the time, when people aren\u2019t remembering to fill out their expense forms, there\u2019s nothing deep there,\u2019\u2019 Salamon said. Even when a participant does have a deep-seated issue, she added, the techniques can still be effective. \u2018\u2018You just have to give things a bit more space,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018And not expect that they\u2019ll yield to hacks.\u2019\u2019And while some exercises seemed useful, other parts of the workshop \u2014 the lack of privacy or downtime, the groupthink, the subtle insistence that behaving otherwise was both irrational and an affront to \u2018\u2018science\u2019\u2019 \u2014 felt creepy, even cultish. In the days before the workshop, I repeatedly asked whether I could sleep at home, because I lived just a 15-minute drive away. Galef was emphatic that I should not. \u2018\u2018People really get much more out of the workshop when they stay on-site,\u2019\u2019 she wrote. \u2018\u2018This is a strong trend ... and the size of the effect is quite marked.\u2019\u2019As it turns out, I wasn\u2019t the only one to find the workshop disorienting. One afternoon, I sat on the front steps with Richard Hua, a programmer at Microsoft who was also new to CFAR. Since the workshop began, Hua told me, he had sensed \u2018\u2018a lot of interesting manipulation going on.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018There\u2019s something about being in there that feels hypnotic to me,\u2019\u2019 he added. \u2018\u2018I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a social pressure, exactly, but you kind of feel obliged to think like the people around you.\u2019\u2019 Another woman, who recently left her software job in Portland, Ore., to volunteer with CFAR, said her commitment to rationality had already led to difficulties with her family and friends. (When she mentioned this, Smith proposed that she make new friends \u2014 ones from the rationalist community.)But there was also the fact that the vibe was just a little strange, what with the underlying interest in polyamory and cryonics, along with the widespread concern that the apocalypse, in the form of a civilization-destroying artificial intelligence, was imminent. When I asked why a group of rationalists would disproportionately share such views, people tended to cite the mind-expanding powers of rational thought. \u2018\u2018This community is much more open to actually evaluating weird ideas,\u2019\u2019 Andrew told me. \u2018\u2018They\u2019re willing to put in the effort to explore the question, rather than saying: \u2018Oh, this is outside my window. Bye.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 But the real reason, many acknowledged, was CFAR\u2019s connection to Yudkowsky. Compulsive and rather grandiose, Yudkowsky is known for proclaiming the imminence of the A.I. apocalypse (\u2018\u2018I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if tomorrow was the Final Dawn, the last sunrise before the earth and sun are reshaped into computing elements\u2019\u2019) and his own role as savior (\u2018\u2018I think my efforts could spell the difference between life and death for most of humanity\u2019\u2019).When I asked Galef and Smith whether they worried that the group\u2019s association with Yudkowsky might be off-putting, they seemed genuinely mystified. Galef said the group designed its own curriculum, without consulting Yudkowsky, and also worked hard to remain \u2018\u2018value neutral,\u2019\u2019 emphasizing the techniques of rational thought rather than focusing on MIRI. Smith was more direct. Yudkowsky, he said, is \u2018\u2018entangled in our origins.\u2019\u2019 Then he shrugged. Newton was a jerk, he pointed out, \u2018\u2018but that doesn\u2019t affect physics.\u2019\u2019To keep people on track, CFAR holds online practice sessions for 10 weeks after a workshop and also assigns \u2018\u2018accountability buddies\u2019\u2019 to encourage participation. The center is debating whether to develop an online version of its workshops that anyone can access. At the same time, it is also considering whether it would be \u2018\u2018higher impact\u2019\u2019 to focus on teaching rationality to a small group of influential people, like policy makers, scientists and tech titans. \u2018\u2018When I think about the things that have caused human society to advance, many of them seem to stem from new and better ways of thinking,\u2019\u2019 Galef added. \u2018\u2018And while the self-help function of the workshops is great, I wouldn\u2019t be devoting my life to this if that was all that I thought we were doing.\u2019\u2019I hadn\u2019t planned to practice the techniques myself, but in the weeks after the workshop ended, I found myself using them often. I began to notice when I was avoiding work \u2014 \u2018\u2018finishing\u2019\u2019 a section of the newspaper (unit bias!) or doing other unproductive foot-dragging \u2014 and then rationalizing the lost time as mental \u2018\u2018preparation.\u2019\u2019 I also found myself experimenting more and noting the results: working in a library rather than a coffee shop (more effective); signing up and paying for spin classes in advance (ditto); going to a museum on the weekend rather than doing something outdoors (so-so). Against all odds, the workshop had cracked open a mental window: Instead of merely muddling through, I began to consider how my habits might be changed. And while it was hard to tell whether this shift was because of the techniques themselves or simply because I had spent four days focusing intensely on those habits, the effect was the same. Instead of feeling stuck in familiar ruts, I felt productive, open and willing to try new things. I even felt a bit happier.When I emailed some of the other participants, most reported a similar experience. Mike Plotz, the juggler turned coder, told me that he had recently done \u2018\u2018a flurry of goal-factoring.\u2019\u2019 Among other things, he wanted to understand why he spent so much time checking Facebook every morning before work. Plotz said that he knew the Facebook habit wasn\u2019t helping him and that he often ended up running late and feeling harried. After goal-factoring the problem, Plotz said, he realized that what he really wanted was autonomy: the feeling of being able to choose what he did each morning. Now, he said, rather than passively resisting work through Facebook, he gets up an hour earlier and does whatever he wants. \u2018\u2018This morning I got up, made coffee and listened to \u2018Moby-Dick,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Plotz said when we spoke. \u2018\u2018So I\u2019d say that, so far, it\u2019s going well.\u2019\u2019I asked Plotz if he could tell whether the changes he made were due to the applied-rationality techniques or simply the product of a more active, problem-solving mind-set. \u2018\u2018In some ways, I think the techniques are that: a way to kick you into a more productive state of mind,\u2019\u2019 he told me. But he also noted that they supplied a framework, a strategy for working through the questions that such a mind-set might raise. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s one thing to notice your thoughts and behaviors,\u2019\u2019 Plotz said. \u2018\u2018Turning that into a technique that actually lets you accomplish stuff? That\u2019s hard.\u2019\u2019Jennifer Kahn is a contributing writer for the magazine.

{"Headline": "Tessa Hadley: By the Book", "Date": "2015-12-31", "News": "Supported byBy the BookThe author, most recently, of \u201cThe Past\u201d finds it \u201cfrightening to think about the books that form us. It\u2019s not just Emma Bovary who makes her life decisions .\u2008.\u2008. based on something that she\u2019s read.\u201dWhat books are currently on your night stand?On top, a copy of Henry James\u2019s \u201cWings of the Dove,\u201d for my Henry James reading group; just the first 30 pages for this week, the marvelous slow opening where Kate Croy waits for her father, walking up and down in his grubby lodgings, hating the fraudulent thing he is. She looks at herself in the mirror, seeing her beauty as her great good luck, her chance for escape. But her father is beautiful too, and he hasn\u2019t escaped. Why should a set of people have been put in motion, on such a scale and with such an air of being equipped for a profitable journey, only to break down without an accident? The excited sense, as always with James at his best, that words are freedom, anything is possible. And the exact realism of the detail; her father\u2019s lie about his illness, the armchair upholstered in a glazed cloth, slippery and sticky at once.Also, a little book someone gave me, probably in vain, called \u201cSeven Brief Lessons on Physics,\u201d by Carlo Rovelli. James\u2019s sentences are more or less transparent to me these days \u2014 most of them \u2014 but I\u2019m bewildered by the mysteries in here: energy quanta, which are localized at points in space, which move without dividing. I sense their beauty, but they\u2019re closed to me, my mind is the wrong shape, and I can\u2019t take them in.Also, a subtle and tender book by Alexander Nemerov, \u201cSilent Dialogues,\u201d about the relations, or nonrelations, between his father, the poet Howard Nemerov, and his aunt, the photographer Diane Arbus. Howard couldn\u2019t bear the photographs; he kept the one Diane gave him in a drawer. But Alexander traces deep connections between the two artists.What\u2019s the last good book you read?A new novel, \u201cPlaythings,\u201d by Alex Pheby, which I finished yesterday. It\u2019s based on the life of Schreber, one of Freud\u2019s patients, and I opened it warily, thinking it might be too clever and self-conscious. Hasn\u2019t that material been worked to death? Well, \u201cPlaythings\u201d is certainly clever, but I also thought it was marvelously surprising and vivid, something new. Somehow inside the shape of an old story he traces fresh experiences as if for the first time. The detail is so sensuously precise. Impressed as I haven\u2019t been by a new novel for a while.What moves you most in a work of literature?Is it just too obvious to say, the words? Because those come first, rather than the themes or the stories or the analysis. When you\u2019re standing in a bookshop opening up a novel or book of short stories by someone you\u2019ve never read before, there\u2019s a period of rapid testing, where you enter into the sentences. It\u2019s in the arrangements of the language that the intelligence and the taste show up. Are those words, in that sequence, clumsy? Banal? Hyped-up, or showing off? And then, if not, if the book\u2019s good, you settle into trusting it. If the book\u2019s good, each successive sentence adds something you\u2019ve never known before.Tell us about your favorite poem.(There isn\u2019t just one favorite poem, of course. There couldn\u2019t be.) Pasted inside the trains on the London Tube, amongst the advertising, we have Poems for the Underground. A few months ago they used a bit of Yeats which I didn\u2019t recognize (it comes from a longer poem, \u201cVacillation\u201d). \u201cMy fiftieth year had come and gone,\u2009/\u2009I sat a solitary man,\u2009/\u2009In a crowded London shop,\u2009/\u2009An open book and empty cup\u2009/\u2009on the marble table-top.\u201d There\u2019s more; it\u2019s about one of those blazes of irrational well-being, occurring in the midst of ordinary life. My 50th year had certainly gone, and I was going shopping \u2014 the mythic and the everyday seemed to collide, which is what I love in Yeats. I\u2019m loving Louise Gl\u00fcck\u2019s latest collection too, \u201cFaithful and Virtuous Night\u201d (gorgeously funny title). There\u2019s a short prose poem in there about \u201cA Work of Fiction.\u201d Reading a novel is like smoking a cigarette, she says. How small it was, how brief .\u2008.\u2008. but inside me now.And your favorite movie adaptation of a book?I\u2019m a great fan of Rumer Godden, whose novels were often made into films, because the plots are so rich, so good. Not only \u201cBlack Narcissus\u201d \u2014 I\u2019m not sure about that film, Powell and Pressburger make me uneasy (Godden hated it). But there\u2019s also \u201cThe Greengage Summer,\u201d and \u201cThe River,\u201d made into an odd and beautiful film by Jean Renoir. Last Christmas my stepson gave me a charming little British film from the \u201950s, \u201cInnocent Sinners,\u201d directed by Philip Leacock and based on Godden\u2019s \u201cAn Episode of Sparrows.\u201d It\u2019s about children playing in the ruins of the bomb damage in postwar London; perhaps it\u2019s as close as British cinema gets to Italian neorealism, though being British, it\u2019s much safer, less searing.Who is your favorite fictional hero or heroine? Your favorite antihero or villain?I\u2019ve drawn great comfort from Alice Munro\u2019s drifting heroines, messing up their lives, wanting more than they have, drawn fatally to the men who won\u2019t give it. In the background of their imagination, inherited from their past, there\u2019s a different universe of hard work and discipline and dutiful routine. Her heroines feel the power of those possibilities, but can\u2019t seriously consider putting the genie of their freedom back in its bottle. And yet they don\u2019t quite trust their freedom either.No one writes plausibly evil characters quite like Paula Fox. They\u2019re usually mothers. The mother in \u201cThe Widow\u2019s Children\u201d is one of literature\u2019s convincing monsters \u2014 and we feel her monstrousness from the inside, as well as watching her perform it, tyrannizing everyone around her. What power in her cruelty, in her ruthless play, teasing with her favor and then snatching it back. And how awful it feels to be monstrous. Monstrosity is such a reality in psychology, but perhaps most novelists flinch from writing it head-on, in case it comes out as caricature. The drunk husband in that novel is brilliantly awful too. So difficult to write that drunkenness, petulant and terrifying, lurching among perceptions, awash with panic.What kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and authors stick with you most?Did I live to read? That\u2019s almost how I remember it now. I didn\u2019t possess all that many books \u2014 not many children did. But I went with my class to the local library every Friday afternoon and took out my three books, and if I\u2019d finished them before the week was up I turned to an old favorite for rereading. I loved the promise of books that came in whole series, taking up half a library shelf, like \u201cAnne of Green Gables\u201d or \u201cSwallows and Amazons.\u201d I think I was really afraid of each book coming to its end (like Louise Gl\u00fcck\u2019s cigarette); behind each particular volume in a series there stretched a reassuring hinterland. When I read E. Nesbit\u2019s \u201cThe Wouldbegoods,\u201d I had no sense of distance between my own 1960s world and her Edwardian one. Those children seemed to live in the next room, their idiom and their moral code seemed as natural as my own.What book read for school had the greatest impact on you?Once I got to secondary school, the books we read seemed to be spoiled for us. Was it something to do with that horrible pedagogical pattern where questions lay in wait on the last page, spoiling everything? I wasn\u2019t happy at that school. I vividly remember reading through Frost\u2019s \u201cMending Wall\u201d and seeing the stodgy questions looming up ahead, making my heart heavy. Why does the man say good fences make good neighbors? What is it that \u2018doesn\u2019t love a wall\u2019? The questions stopped me being able to read. My strongest instinct was that reading ought to be freedom; it belonged at home, in precious irresponsibility. At that school we read through one masterpiece after another \u2014 \u201cKim,\u201d and \u201cSilas Marner,\u201d and \u201cCranford,\u201d and \u201cNorthanger Abbey.\u201d Now, I\u2019m impressed by what they chose. But at the time, I hated every one, and it was years before I could return to any of those books.If you had to name one book that made you who you are today, what would it be?It\u2019s quite frightening to think about the books that form us. It\u2019s not just Emma Bovary who makes her life decisions \u2014 rather seriously unwise ones (or are they?) \u2014 based on something that she\u2019s read. I suspect that Lawrence\u2019s \u201cThe Rainbow\u201d had a significant impact on the way I was when I was 20. It made me pretty casual, for instance, about higher education \u2014 I believed that, like Ursula Brangwen, I\u2019d seen through the fake prophets in their false priesthood. Or something of the sort.What author, living or dead, would you most like to meet, and what would you like to know?I\u2019ve never really been desperate to meet the writers I most admire. What is there to say to them that isn\u2019t just embarrassing adulation? Superficial social relations can\u2019t hope to match the intimacy you have with an author in their words on the page. Having said that, there is a magical power in actual presence. When I was very young and hadn\u2019t published anything, I once sat in the back of a radio studio to hear Nadine Gordimer give an interview. Her glance fell on me accidentally in passing, and I haven\u2019t forgotten it.Whom would you want to write your life story?No one. It isn\u2019t really very interesting. Interesting to me, of course \u2014 but really a fairly quiet life, ordinary. I don\u2019t very often like biographies; they\u2019re so sad: so much youthful hope and then the inevitable ending. The rhythms of fiction are more mysterious; they hold out more promise, and consolation. The best biographies read something like fictions (like Penelope Fitzgerald\u2019s biography of Charlotte Mew).What do you plan to read next?Maybe I\u2019d better read the next (short) chapter of my physics book. It\u2019s called \u201cProbability, Time and the Heat of Black Holes.\u201d I know this stuff is stunning. I know it transforms everything. And I know the little simplifying book is a lovely idea. I\u2019m perplexed by my own failure to understand.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Intel\u2019s Earnings Fall in Fourth Quarter, but Beat Expectations", "Date": "2016-01-14", "News": "Supported byA lot has changed in recent years. The PC market has been in a long, slow decline, and Intel does not have the same clout with companies that build smartphones, which are today\u2019s hottest gadgets.But even if some of its financial clout has waned, Intel\u2019s spending continues to be a key indicator of the health of the tech world. Intel is still \u2014 by a good stretch \u2014 the world\u2019s biggest semiconductor maker and perhaps the only company of its kind with the resources to keep improving chip technology.If computer chips do not continue to improve, the entire tech industry stalls. Semiconductors have leapt from computers and mobile phones to all sorts of devices, including cars, appliances and toys. They are increasingly connected to the fast-growing computer \u201cclouds\u201d of companies like Amazon and Google, which are powered by vast data centers of computer servers that mostly use Intel chips.Intel\u2019s financial results are a sort of proxy for growth in cloud-based services, said Thomas Kurian, the president of product development at Oracle, one of the world\u2019s largest software companies. \u201cIf they ship a lot, it means a huge growth in new cloud projects,\u201d he said.In quarterly earnings reported by Intel on Thursday, the company\u2019s revenue was up slightly from the same period last year, but money from data center chips was up markedly.Intel reported that its net income in the fourth quarter of 2015 fell 1 percent to $3.6 billion, or 74 cents a share, from the year-earlier quarter. The company said revenue climbed 1 percent, to $14.9 billion.The net income was above the expectations of Wall Street analysts. They had anticipated 63 cents a share on revenue of $14.8 billion, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters.For all of 2015, Intel revenue was $55.4 billion, down 1 percent from 2014. Net income was $11.4 billion, down 2 percent.Intel\u2019s share price was down about 4 percent in after-hours trading Thursday evening.No doubt, Intel\u2019s influence has changed in recent years.Intel still gets 59 percent of its revenue from chip sales to PC makers like HP Inc. and Dell, just as Microsoft and other makers of PC software count on the demand for new PCs to sell their products. Now PCs are a tough business: On Tuesday, the market research firm IDC said 276 million PCs were shipped worldwide in 2015, a drop of 10.4 percent from 2014.\u201cPCs don\u2019t matter as much as they used to,\u201d said Jay Chou, an analyst with IDC. \u201cThey\u2019re only part of the story that includes mobile devices and cloud computing.\u201dOn Thursday, Intel said data center chip sales, not just to clouds but to older kinds of computing, rose 4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015. Along with Intel\u2019s much smaller businesses in memory and sensor chips for devices, data center chips accounted for than 60 percent of the company\u2019s operating profit margin.Since the PC industry is sliding, using Intel as an indicator of the health of the rest of tech is not as easy as it used to be. Analysts say the number to watch now is Intel\u2019s investment in Moore\u2019s Law. Named for an Intel co-founder, Gordon Moore, that is the observation that computing power, figured in the density of transistors on a chip, tends to double every 18 to 24 months. That effectively means that $2 of computing power today will cost $1 in 2018.Keeping up with Moore\u2019s Law is increasingly expensive. In 2001 research and development, along with marketing and sales, cost Intel about $8 billion. In 2015, Intel said Thursday, it cost $20.1 billion.As a percentage of revenue, the number has crept up too, and on both counts it is at a cost few companies could manage. Besides Intel, which develops new chips ahead of everyone, the last big semiconductor makers are GlobalFoundries, Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Each has to invest billions to stay in the game.\u201cIntel can decide if Moore\u2019s Law is 18 or 24 or 36 months long,\u201d said Amit Daryanani, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets.Last year, Intel scared many technologists when it announced that a critical next step in delivering on Moore\u2019s Law would happen about a year later than expected. The company has since released numerous charts showing this was a temporary blip.If it was more than a blip, developers of those self-driving cars, connected drones and other new devices will also struggle to make improvements.Relax, said Stacy Smith, the chief financial officer of Intel.\u201cMoore\u2019s Law is the heartbeat of our company,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the core of our competitive advantage.\u201dIndeed, Intel\u2019s corporate identity is wrapped up in this concept of ever-improving chips.\u201cThey can\u2019t risk not being seen as the leading engineering company,\u201d Mr. Daryanani said. \u201cThe beauty of this thing is that this way, they are in control of their own destiny, and not a lot of tech companies can say that.\u201dAnd if that costs billions, so be it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook to Shut Down Parse, Its Platform for Mobile Developers", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Most of what Parse does involves things most people will never see. Parse helps developers with support and tools, so that independent programmers can spend more time writing code and less time on keeping up the back end. Developers who use Parse include those at Quip, a productivity app, and Expedia\u2019s Orbitz, a travel website. Facebook would make money from Parse by storing data from developers and sending customers product notifications.Achieving that goal, however, would be no easy feat. Microsoft, Google and Amazon have similar developer offerings, along with a much richer set of other computing tools and services that developers need. Amazon Web Services, in particular, has in the past two years stressed both its developer tools and analytic services, so companies can think about what to build next. In every case, these companies can also benefit by selling other computing services, like complex commercial databases, which Facebook does not provide.Parse seemed like a good opportunity for expansion. At the time, Internet businesses were in the midst of a major industry change, as users were shifting away from desktop computing and increasingly relying on mobile devices. Parse, the thinking went, could provide Facebook the opportunity to be the foundation of a whole new generation of developers building mobile apps in the age of the smartphone.Facebook also would have had to invest untold millions of dollars in capital and, more importantly, engineering talent, to get the Parse business fully off the ground to have a better chance at making a dent in competitors like Amazon, Microsoft and Google.Moreover, Facebook has already made two big, risky bets in Oculus, the virtual reality platform, and WhatsApp, the messaging service. Neither service currently generates material revenue for Facebook.Parse may have touched millions of people through the apps that developers built there, but that mattered little against Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s size. With more than 1.5 billion registered users, a population of even 15 million customers is not 1 percent of Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s audience. Building up Parse, it seems, eventually became more of a distraction than it was worth.\u201cMoving forward we want to dedicate more resources to high-impact products and services in areas like analytics, monetization, discovery, and authentication,\u201d Michael Kirkland, a Facebook spokesman, said in a statement. \u201cAs a result, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made the difficult decision to wind down support for Parse.\u201dOther Silicon Valley companies have encountered similar difficulties. Inside Cisco Systems, in its heyday, there was pressure to build businesses that yielded $1 billion or more in revenue, since anything less could not affect the overall company. Facebook, which unlike other clouds has not sought to rent computing and software to businesses, must essentially find this from social networking.Developers who used Parse will have a set of tools and a year-long window to be able to migrate their data off of the platform to other services.\u201cWe\u2019re proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished together with the Parse community, and we thank them for their support,\u201d Mr. Kirkland said.FollowAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stocks Slide as Worries Persist Over Global Growth", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported byHopes for a recovery in the United States stock market were dashed on Wednesday as investors\u2019 deepening fears about the strength of the world\u2019s largest economies drove another wave of selling.The 2.5 percent slide in the market\u2019s main benchmark, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, was the worst so far this year, and came after two days of slight gains that had suggested some confidence was returning after a rocky start to the year. The index is now in what Wall Street calls a correction: a decline of 10 percent or more from its most recent high.The market decline indicates that investors still see plenty of risks lurking, many of them stemming from China\u2019s slowing economy. The persistent weakness in the price of oil is another market indicator that has raised questions about global growth.The United States economy has been showing some signs of steady growth. But investors are concerned that problems in China\u2019s economy, and the stress that creates for other countries, could unleash forces that ultimately weigh on the United States.\u201cWhen you change perceptions for the growth rate of the third-largest economic region in the world,\u201d said Jim Vogel, interest rates strategist at FTN Financial, \u201cyou have to reprice across all financial markets to account for that slowing growth.\u201dThe last time stocks slid into a correction was in August, when a small but surprising devaluation of China\u2019s currency rattled investors.Stocks rallied after the summer rout, as a recovery in Europe appeared to take hold and the Chinese currency steadied. As the year closed, most Wall Street analysts released mildly optimistic forecasts for the stock market in 2016.But it didn\u2019t take long for the fear to return.One of the headwinds that investors now face is higher interest rates in the United States. The Federal Reserve in December raised interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. Higher rates can tighten financial conditions in markets and push the dollar up against other currencies, which can in turn make it harder for United States companies to compete.Some economists, fearing that the markets are giving an early signal of a slowdown, may now call on the Fed to hold off on any further interest rate increases.And China is again unsettling investors. Figures show that capital is continuing to rush out of the country, a phenomenon that can add downward pressure to its currency, the renminbi.One of the ways that China\u2019s slowing can hurt the United State is through energy prices. As China has less demand for commodities, their prices have fallen. Oil-producing countries have continued to oversupply the markets with cheap crude.Lower oil prices lead to cheaper gasoline prices, which can prompt consumers to increase their spending on other goods and services, usually a fillip for the wider economy. But lower energy prices are hurting the United States companies that produce oil and gas.Energy stocks generally performed poorly on Wednesday. The Williams Companies tumbled 17.7 percent, while ConocoPhillips closed down more than 3 percent.Some of the fiercest selling took place in technology stocks that did extremely well in 2015. Netflix, for instance, plummeted 8.6 percent on Wednesday. Amazon declined 5.8 percent. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index ended down 3.4 percent.Stocks of consumer companies whose products or services are considered nonessential were among the hardest hit on Wednesday. Shares of the hotel chain Marriott closed down 6.3 percent, while Royal Caribbean Cruises ended down 5.3 percent.The market decline has been broad and even some of Wall Street\u2019s most successful and sophisticated investors have not been spared the downturn. William A. Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square Holdings, for example, has already lost 11.4 percent through Jan. 12In this fraught environment, investors are looking for any early clues on how the global economy is performing. They are now scouring the fourth-quarter earnings of large companies, which are starting to come out.\u201cThe low gas prices, the low commodity prices, the strength of the dollar \u2014 all three of those together are really pushing,\u201d he said.Investors will most likely listen carefully to the earnings calls of the large banks, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo included, that will report results on Thursday and Friday.Since the financial crisis of 2008, the major banks have built up buffers that help them withstand turbulent markets. But their earnings are always vulnerable if consumers and companies demand fewer loans and struggle to pay back existing ones. Senior bank executives most likely will be called upon to give their impressions of financial conditions.If the stock market continues to fall and deplete households\u2019 savings, consumers may then pull back on their spending, which can weigh on the economy. Already this year, the value of the companies in the S.&P. 500 has fallen by $1.3 trillion, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.Still, the selling may pass. Many Wall Street analysts say there are reasons a bear market \u2014 a decline of more than 20 percent from a high \u2014 will not occur. Stocks, they say, aren\u2019t wildly overvalued. Jobs growth in the United States is starting to create competition for hiring, which could push up wages, giving consumers more money to spend. Europe appears to have stabilized.But few analysts are expecting a big bounce in the stock market. Investors may now have to get used to lower returns from stocks, after several years of strong gains.\u201cWe believe this year is going to look very much like 2001, 2002,\u201d said Mark Yusko, the chief investment officer at Morgan Creek Capital Management. \u201cPeople forget the markets basically went down for 30 months and the economy slowed and eventually went into a mini-recession.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the decline in the Dow. It closed down 9.9 percent on Wednesday from its most recent high, not 10 percent or more, which would have put it in correction territory.Stanley Reed and Alexandra Stevenson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

It did not give updated estimates on drone sales on Wednesday, nor did it say how many users may not be registered yet.But at a news conference at the International CES in Las Vegas, Michael Huerta, the agency\u2019s administrator, indicated that many users had not registered their drones and said he recognized the difficulty in informing the public about the requirement.

{"Headline": "Barbie Adds Curvy and Tall to Body Shapes", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byWhen it comes to Barbie\u2019s body, it will no longer be one size fits all.On Thursday, Mattel unveiled curvy, petite and tall versions of its iconic fashion doll whose unrealistically thin shape has attracted criticism for decades. The three body types will also be sold in an assortment of skin tones, eye colors and hairstyles.The move is about more than just making Barbie look different. While Barbie was once Mattel\u2019s powerhouse brand, sales have plummeted in recent years as the doll has struggled to remain relevant to little girls who do not look like her and who play with toys other than dolls.\u201cThis is about drawing a wider demographic that had turned away from Barbie back to Barbie,\u201d said Jim Silver, the editor of TTPM, a toy review website.Barbie\u2019s latest makeover began in a big way last year, when Mattel released a broad assortment of dolls in a greater number of skin tones, eye colors and even facial structures as part of its Fashionistas line.\u201cI think today, frankly more so than any other time, Barbie is truly representing what girls see,\u201d said Richard Dickson, who is Mattel\u2019s president and chief operating officer and the executive in charge of Barbie\u2019s reinvention.But some industry experts and academics have long doubted that cosmetic changes \u2014 whether racial or ethnic or body shapes \u2014 can revive the popularity of the 57-year-old Barbie, whose sales have been declining by double-digits in recent years.Executives like Mr. Dickson have been optimistic, pointing to signs that Barbie\u2019s in-store sales began picking up last year. Still, third-quarter sales in 2015 \u2014 the most recent figures available \u2014 showed that Barbie sales declined 14 percent from the same period a year earlier.\u201cThe ones in multiple skin tones did phenomenal for Mattel, and it showed them that people wanted much more than the blonde blue-eyed Barbie,\u201d Mr. Silver said. (Mattel unveiled an African-American Barbie in the late 1960s, and the first Asian Barbie appeared in 1980 as part of its \u201cdolls of the world\u201d collection.)Still, Mattel executives have struggled to rebrand Barbie as an aspirational figure, one not so closely identified with her unnatural body measurements.\u201cIt\u2019s hardly a bolt of genius to say let\u2019s make dolls that look different,\u201d said Sean McGowan, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Company. \u201cIt\u2019s more like saying \u2018Yeah, we stuck with that one single iconic image for too long, let\u2019s try multiple ones.\u2019 \u201dOn Twitter, reactions were mixed.\u201cI think as a woman it\u2019s about time, and as a physician, I strongly support that,\u201d said Dr. Kelli Harding, assistant professor of psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center, who has a background in body dysmorphic disorder. \u201cFor a little girl, it\u2019s important to have diversity in what they\u2019re playing with.\u201dMattel is remaining tight-lipped about how it came up with Barbie\u2019s new proportions. It\u2019s part of the \u201cart and the science,\u201d as Mr. Dickson put it, of creating any toy.But a curvy, or more full-figured, Barbie doll is about more than just reshaping one brand. The initiative is part of a broader cultural shift at Mattel, where executives have been trying to transform the company into a 21st century toymaker.Faced with weakening sales in its core brands like Barbie and Fisher-Price, and criticism that it was too slow to pick up on trends, Mattel has undertaken a number of efforts to improve innovation.And some parents, concerned about negative gender stereotypes (a racecar for a son, a princess doll for a daughter), have pushed retailers into more gender-neutral territory.\u201cI think that this is bigger than Barbie\u2019s shape, because this really gets at gender inequality in the United States as well,\u201d Dr. Harding said.Advertisement"}

For companies like Square and Twitter, which no one would accuse of doing extraordinarily well, 2016 has been even tougher. And for Jack Dorsey, the chief executive of both companies, recent stock drops have resulted in paper losses that have pushed him out of the billionaire\u2019s club.Twitter dropped dramatically Wednesday morning, only to spike dramatically around midday \u2014 thanks to what some reports said was a single, large transaction \u2014 and to close up 4.1 percent for the day.

Filmmakers, once dismissive of streaming companies, have been looking at the struggling art-house box office and deciding that getting their work seen by the widest possible audience \u2014 while being handsomely paid, of course \u2014 may be what matters most.\u201cYou always want your film to be shown on a big screen with perfect sound and the best projection,\u201d said Sian Heder, who wrote and directed \u201cTallulah,\u201d a comedic drama that had its premiere here on Saturday and sold to Netflix for about $5 million. \u201cBut that\u2019s not always the reality anymore. The way that people consume media is changing.\u201dA look at select films screening at the Sundance Film Festival.In other words, Mr. Price\u2019s Sundance purchases will arrive on the Amazon Prime streaming platform only after playing in theaters (for varying periods).In addition to buying \u201cTallulah,\u201d which stars Ellen Page and Allison Janney, Netflix paid $7 million for the global streaming rights to \u201cThe Fundamentals of Caring,\u201d a Sundance road movie starring Paul Rudd, Craig Roberts and Selena Gomez. Other Netflix purchases include \u201cUnder the Shadow,\u201d a horror movie set in Iran.\u201cWe\u2019re in the market for enjoyable films that have a great creative vision and that we can show to our members in 190 countries,\u201d said Jonathan Friedland, Netflix\u2019s chief communications officer.Roadside Attractions, co-founded by Howard Cohen and Eric d\u2019Arbeloff, will work with Amazon to distribute \u201cLove & Friendship\u201d in theaters. \u201cThe theatrical model continues to have a lot of value, especially because it means something to viewers when films play in theaters,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. In his view, releasing films simultaneously in theaters and on video-on-demand platforms, streaming or otherwise, leaves consumers with a bad impression. \u201cIt has somehow become a signal that the movie isn\u2019t any good,\u201d he said.A decade ago, before the digital entertainment boom vastly expanded viewing options, independent films were routinely able to break through in theaters. \u201cLittle Miss Sunshine,\u201d for instance, bought at Sundance in 2006 by Fox Searchlight, collected about $70 million at theaters in North America, after adjusting for inflation. At its widest release, the movie played in 1,602 locations.But smaller films today are having a more difficult time selling tickets. Now, a movie like \u201cBrooklyn\u201d is considered a success. Fox Searchlight bought it at Sundance last year and it has taken in about $27.5 million since its release in November, playing in 906 theaters at its peak. Of the films sold at Sundance in 2015, only a handful took in more than $1 million at the domestic box office.As a result, some sales agents say, traditional distributors are being more selective at Sundance. \u201cEvery year we have a little bit of that syndrome,\u201d said Jessica Lacy, head of independent and international film at ICM Partners. \u201cThis time around, the breakout potential of some films in the lineup is not as obvious. That can be challenging for a traditional studio as it tries to figure out what deals make sense.\u201dMs. Lacy continued, \u201cThat said, there are still quite a few promising films to debut.\u201d A premiere is scheduled on Tuesday, for instance, for \u201cThe Intervention,\u201d about a fumbled attempt by a group of friends to halt a marriage.\u201cThe market is a bit slower this year than last, but that is also because filmmaker teams have to sort through more options and decide what\u2019s most important to them,\u201d said Paul Davidson, senior vice president for film and television at the Orchard, an entertainment company known for movies like \u201cCartel Land,\u201d an Oscar-nominated documentary. \u201cFor some, it\u2019s the largest check,\u201d Mr. Davidson said. \u201cFor some, it\u2019s a real theatrical release.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Oscar voters selected \u201cBirdman\u201d as best picture. Globe voters are also notoriously quirky; this year, for instance, they rather bizarrely classified \u201cThe Martian\u201d as a comedy.Globe nominations were announced before \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens\u201d was screened, so that blockbuster\u2019s absence on Sunday said nothing about its Oscar prospects. A snub last Tuesday by the Producers Guild of America, which did not count \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d among 10 best picture nominees, was perhaps more telling. But the Producers Guild also left out the Weinstein Company\u2019s \u201cCarol.\u201dBehind the scenes, stylists spent last week fretting about weather. Rainstorms started pounding the Los Angeles area on Tuesday, threatening a repeat of the 2010 Globes ceremony, when the red carpet turned into a lake and golf umbrellas and bedraggled assistants became the accessories of choice. On Sunday the weather was chilly for Los Angeles (mid-50s) and overcast.Inside the hotel, waiters scrambled to serve dinners that went largely uneaten, at least at the starrier tables. (On the menu: \u201csalt-baked heirloom sweet potatoes with creamed corn glaze.\u201d) Once upon a time, the Globes were a boozy spectacle, but most nominees \u2014 heeding the scolding eyes of their handlers \u2014 also avoided the plentifully available Mo\u00ebt & Chandon Champagne. One exception: Mr. DiCaprio, a best actor nominee, who arrived and knocked back a Ruby Red, a brightly colored mixture of Champagne and vodka.As ever, the ceremony\u2019s success will be determined by the Nielsen ratings. Last year, about 19.3 million people watched the Globes telecast, a 7 percent decline from 2014. Among adults 18 to 49, the group that advertisers pay a premium to reach, viewership fell by 11 percent. (NBC aggressively promoted the show in recent weeks, even though it was the only broadcast network not to receive a single nomination. Awkward.)Mr. Gervais, who hosted the Globes for three consecutive years starting in 2010, has previously said that he would like to host the Oscars. But an unwritten rule has generally kept the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences from employing an M.C. who has sharpened his or her teeth at the competing Globes.Advertisement"}

He was 90.The cause was pancreatic cancer, his family said.Mr. Weissman, who started at a time when publicity meant hot tips for newspaper reporters, worked for television networks and movie studios. But he was best known for having ushered in the era of focused campaigning for movie prizes, and particularly for Oscars \u2014 which has become a distinct Hollywood industry, with its own rules, rewards and legends.In the late 1980s and early 1990s, he worked in partnership with Tony Angellotti in Weissman/Angellotti Public Relations. When the two split, he formed other partnerships, always remaining heavily focused on the pursuit of prizes.Mr. Weissman, one of that pursuit\u2019s storied players, worked on behalf of at least 38 best-picture nominees, according to a biography circulated by his family. \u201cDances With Wolves,\u201d \u201cThe English Patient,\u201d \u201cShakespeare in Love,\u201d \u201cChicago\u201d and \u201cCrash\u201d were among the Oscar-winning movies backed by his campaigns.Mr. Weissman often worked under contract to Miramax Films, as that company, under its founders, Harvey and Bob Weinstein, became an awards powerhouse.Born on Dec. 23, 1925, in Brooklyn, Mr. Weissman moved to Los Angeles with his family at the age of 10.

{"Headline": "F.C.C. Proposes Changes in Cable Set-Top Box Market", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The cable set-top box, long a scourge of consumers and a moneymaker for cable companies, appears set for a makeover.The move could have broad implications for the industry, allowing Google, Amazon and Apple, for instance, to expand their footprints in the media industry with devices that would blend Internet and cable programming in a way the television industry has resisted. The reactions on Wednesday reflected those possibilities: The technology industry widely cheered the proposal, while the cable industry criticized it.The F.C.C., though, said its focus was on improving people\u2019s television experience. The clunky technology of cable boxes, and the burdensome requirements of long-term contracts, have long been a source of customer complaints. Tech companies like Apple and Amazon make devices that connect to televisions and have new interfaces, but they provide streaming Internet video and do not replace the cable box.The F.C.C. said the agency\u2019s five commissioners would vote on the proposal on Feb. 18. The proposal will most likely have the support of the three Democratic commissioners, including Mr. Wheeler, and will be opposed by the two Republican commissioners.Tech companies have pushed a vision of TV viewing that would look and feel more like a smartphone interaction, with users selecting and using apps rather than scrolling through hundreds of channels on cable TV. Netflix and Amazon have also challenged the industry head-on, offering original programming and streaming-video packages that have led consumers to cut their cable subscriptions all together.The proposed rule would require cable and satellite providers to give device makers access to cable and satellite programming. While that is possible today, cable and satellite companies often impose restrictions on third-party device makers. As a result, there has been a virtual lock on the set-top box market by cable and satellite companies, with 99 percent of their users leasing one or more boxes from them.\u201cConsumer choice should fuel the video box market, not cable company control,\u201d Senator Markey said on Wednesday. \u201cI commend Chairman Wheeler for his proposal to help ensure that consumers are not captive to bloated rental fees forever.\u201dSenior officials at the agency said the plan would not affect contracts between cable and media companies. Consumers would still have to pay their satellite and cable provider for their programming. The cable bundle, in which people pay for dozens or hundreds of stations or none at all, is expected to remain in place.Still, media executives expressed concern that the change could undermine the foundation of their businesses. The concern is that the new arrangement could negate contracts between cable companies and entertainment companies, in which the cable companies pay television groups billions of dollars a year for the rights to distribute programming. Those contracts stipulate how the programming can be distributed, for instance, whether it is included in video-on-demand packages, how it is branded, certain copyright protections and the treatment of advertising.The executives said the proposal could allow a new set of companies, like Google or Apple, to step in to distribute and sell ads in and around television programming that they neither paid to create, or license. A set-top box can control the flow of data on users\u2019 viewing habits, the sort of information that is at the heart of Google\u2019s business.\u201cDistributors will be forced to reconsider what they pay for programs that can be siphoned off, repackaged and resold, drying up the revenue needed to underwrite quality shows,\u201d said Alfred C. Liggins, the chief executive of TV One, a digital cable and satellite network that serves 57 million households. \u201cThese arrangements \u2014 including critical terms such as channel placement, advertising, scheduling and more \u2014 are the lifeblood of the video marketplace today.\u201dAt the same time, television networks like HBO, Showtime and CBS have introduced a range of \u00e0 la carte offerings that allow people to subscribe to an individual network without paying for the full cable bundle.Efforts to hand over programming to tech firms would \u201cslam the brakes on this progress and harm consumers,\u201d Nomi Bergman, president of Bright House Networks, said. \u201cIt\u2019s the ultimate example of the government trying to fix something that isn\u2019t broken.\u201dTrade groups representing Google, Amazon and TiVo say the set-top-box industry would inject fresh competition into the TV market, leading to more options and lower prices for consumers. Mr. Wheeler, who has favored rules that support streaming-video providers, is expected to act with haste to make sure the rules are adopted before he leaves his job. His term could end next year. If approved, consumers will most immediately see its effects in their pocketbooks, advocates say. They could start using just one device to access video content \u2014 whether it be Internet streaming or cable television.Marta Tellado, president and chief executive of Consumer Reports, said the changes were long overdue.\u201cWith the ever-increasing price of cable and all of the advances in technology,\u201d she said, \u201cwhy should consumers have to keep renting a set-top box?\u201dCecilia Kang reported from Washington, and Emily Steel from New York.Advertisement"}

In Bowie years, that is practically an eternity considering the multitude of lives he lived \u2014 musically, geographically and otherwise \u2014 since he set out to become a star in the late 1960s.\u201cJust as each and every one of us found something unique in David\u2019s music, we welcome everyone\u2019s celebration of his life as they see fit,\u201d Mr. Bowie\u2019s family wrote in a statement.Should you be looking for a way to honor the musician in the city he called home, there is no shortage of activities to partake in, many of which Mr. Bowie enjoyed doing himself.Walking in general (the earlier in the day the better) was a preferred way for Mr. Bowie to experience city life.Numerous tributes at city music venues have sprouted up since Mr. Bowie\u2019s death, and are likely to continue in the coming months.Nino Perez of Bleecker Street Records said the store quickly sold out of most titles in the days after his death and it did not expect to have more copies of \u201cBlackstar\u201d until the end of February, because of the high demand.Before stocks are replenished, consider taking home one of Mr. Bowie\u2019s contemporaries, like Iggy Pop or Lou Reed, both of whom he met and befriended during a 1971 visit to Manhattan.Mr. Bowie relished his ability to blend in and not be bothered by his fans and fellow New Yorkers during his years in the city.Other Bowie-related titles available to stream include \u201cThe Hunger\u201d (1983), \u201cThe Last Temptation of Christ\u201d (1988) and \u201cThe Prestige\u201d (2006).An earlier version of this article \u200bmisidentified the cafe that David Bowie used to frequent in SoHo.

So would we.Mr. Gervais, hosting for his fourth time, seemed to realize he had a character he was now expected to play. \u201cShut up, you disgusting, pill-popping, sexual deviant scum,\u201d Mr. Gervais told the crowd. He cracked transgender jokes about Caitlyn Jenner, the \u201cTransparent\u201d star Jeffrey Tambor and the movie \u201cThe Danish Girl.\u201dHe delivered the expected Donald Trump gag. He brought out Mel Gibson for some awkward joking about the actor\u2019s history of anti-Semitic comments. There was even a Charlie Sheen crack that the dry cleaner might have left in his pocket after his last hosting gig.66 PhotosSome of the best performances surrounding this year\u2019s Globes were in the prebroadcast promotion, which acted as if Hollywood were quaking at the thought of Mr. Gervais\u2019s scathing return. But this was, after all, a host who was invited back, repeatedly, last in 2012.What\u2019s changed since? Mr. Gervais was followed by awards season\u2019s favorite buddy comedy, the three-year run of Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, who managed to be sharply funny but not nasty for its own sake. More broadly, there\u2019s been a greater sensitivity around diversity in Hollywood (if not always more actual representation).When Mr. Gervais eventually made reference to Ms. Fey and Ms. Poehler \u2014 mocking Hollywood\u2019s gender-unequal pay by saying he was being paid as much as them combined \u2014 it felt dissonant. Satirically pointed but slathered in the same vinegar as the rest of his jabs, it felt like part of the same sour meal. Mr. Gervais is a funny and creative comic, but as host he risks becoming a Ricky Gervais tribute band dutifully smashing his guitar on cue.The ceremony tried to work surprise into the presentations. Presenting the award for best score, Jamie Foxx spoofed Steve Harvey\u2019s snafu at the Miss Universe pageant, announcing the winner as \u201cStraight Outta Compton\u201d instead of Ennio Morricone for \u201cThe Hateful Eight.\u201dThe broadcast-delay mute button also came into liberal use. It obliterated presenters\u2019 and Mr. Gervais\u2019s patter, turned a bit with Jonah Hill as the bear from \u201cThe Revenant\u201d into a virtual silent movie, and treated home viewers as if we were exiled to the kids\u2019 table. (This is a good argument for simply moving the awards from NBC to cable, or watching with a lip-reader.)Awards surprises are plenty at the Golden Globes, which particularly in TV has a long track record of rewarding newcomers. Rachel Bloom, the effervescent star of the CW\u2019s musical comedy \u201cCrazy Ex-Girlfriend,\u201d followed in the footsteps of her network-mate Gina Rodriguez, who won last year for her first season on \u201cJane the Virgin.\u201d Taraji P. Henson won her first Globe for \u201cEmpire,\u201d handing out cookies for her character, Cookie Lyon, and waving off an order to \u201cPlease wrap\u201d her speech: \u201cI\u2019ve waited 20 years for this \u2014 you going to wait!\u201dIn the TV comedy category, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association honored the under-the-radar Amazon comedy \u201cMozart in the Jungle,\u201d which just started its second season; best drama went to the rookie \u201cMr. Robot.\u201d Even Lady Gaga won something.There were wry moments: As the best actor in a TV comedy nominees were announced, Aziz Ansari read from a book titled \u201cLosing to Jeffrey Tambor With Dignity.\u201d (He ended up losing to Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal of \u201cMozart.\u201d) There was sweetness: Sylvester Stallone, winning for \u201cCreed,\u201d called his longtime character, Rocky Balboa, \u201cthe best friend I ever had.\u201d (He didn\u2019t, however, remember to thank the director Ryan Coogler or his co-star Michael B. Jordan for the cameras.)But there were few of the truly loopy, memorable moments the Globes is known for. So you can see the incentive to invite Mr. Gervais back to try to create them. TV thrives on virality now, and the Globes almost beg for deflation. Even Denzel Washington, emotionally accepting the Cecil B. DeMille Award, reminisced about the glad-handing that goes into an award campaign.A well-run, fun Globes \u2014 privileged people toasting their terrific success with bottomless Mo\u00ebt \u2014 is its own corrective to Hollywood self-seriousness.

{"Headline": "Looking Beyond the Internet of Things", "Date": "2016-01-01", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 If you have sent email on Google or used Microsoft\u2019s browser or databases, you have touched the technology handiwork of Adam Bosworth.Mr. Bosworth, a tall and grizzled but still trim 60-year-old, is a Johnny Appleseed of sorts in the tech industry, with a penchant for being intimately involved in the creation of generations of widely used technology.While it is never easy to predict what the next big thing will be, identifying what Mr. Bosworth is working on is always good for clues. Right now, along with competitors at companies like Amazon and Google, he is building what some call a \u201cdata singularity.\u201dAll those devices and sensors would also wirelessly connect to far-off data centers, where millions of computer servers manage and learn from all that information.Those servers would then send back commands to help whatever the sensors are connected to operate more effectively: A home automatically turns up the heat ahead of cold weather moving in, or streetlights behave differently when traffic gets bad. Or imagine an insurance company instantly resolving who has to pay for what an instant after a fender-bender because it has been automatically fed information about the accident.Think of it as one, enormous process in which machines gather information, learn and change based on what they learn. All in seconds.It is lofty language, no doubt, but he and others believe they are on the brink of one of the next big shifts in computing, perhaps as big as the web browser or the personal computer.But building an automated system that can react to all that data like a thoughtful person is fiendishly hard \u2014 and that may be Mr. Bosworth\u2019s last great challenge to solve.It is difficult to say just how big this business could be, but there are two good indicators: Analysts at Gartner estimate that by 2019 retail cloud computing \u2014 the data center side of the equation Mr. Bosworth is working on \u2014 will double in size, to $314 billion. The sensors on objects will be a $2.6 trillion business, an increase of 250 percent, Gartner estimates.Mr. Bosworth went to Harvard with Bill Gates, where he took just one class in computers while studying Asian history. He nonetheless landed a job on Wall Street, where he persuaded his bosses to give him $1 million for minicomputers \u2014 the cutting edge of computing before personal computers \u2014 that could deliver the first instant reports on how business was doing.He got interested in tech\u2019s next big thing, PCs, and wrote an early spreadsheet program. He joined Microsoft in 1989. His first years there were spent on databases, but as the Internet got big he helped turn browsers from software that looks up web pages to software that interacts with the web.He and Mr. Gates repeatedly argued over the importance of the Internet, according to people there at the time. Mr. Gates may also have goaded Mr. Bosworth, knowing he is the sort who does not like to be told something is not possible.\u201cHe sees out into the future, but not too far that you can\u2019t build something,\u201d said Brad Silverberg, a Seattle venture capitalist who has known Mr. Bosworth since 1981 and was his boss at Microsoft. \u201cIf you want to make sure something gets done, tell him not to do it.\u201dThe son of a demanding private school headmaster, Mr. Bosworth also clashed with Larry Page, Google\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, while working there on interactive software and a failed effort to build online health services.\u201cWe had styles that weren\u2019t synergistic,\u201d said Mr. Bosworth. \u201cHe looks intensively at massive amounts of data-gathering, and assumes he\u2019ll be able to do something with it using math. I was focused on getting people to communicate with other people.\u201dMarc Benioff, the chief executive at Salesforce and a friend of Mr. Bosworth, asked him to look at the technology being used at the San Francisco company, which was founded in 1999 and was one of the first to use cloud computing technology.Over lunch a few months later, Mr. Bosworth told Mr. Benioff that his once-revolutionary company was in peril.\u201cComputers are 50 times faster than when Salesforce started,\u201d he said. \u201cI told Marc, \u2018There is a whole new technology that is going to overtake you, the way the web overtook Microsoft.\u2019\u201dThat technology \u2014 the data singularity \u2014 is what Mr. Bosworth is now working on at Salesforce.If he is right, this new era in computing will have effects far beyond a little more efficiency. Consumers could see a vast increase in the number of services, ads and product upgrades that are sold alongside most goods. And products that respond to their owner\u2019s tastes \u2014 something already seen in smartphone upgrades, connected cars from BMW or Tesla, or entertainment devices like the Amazon Echo \u2014 could change product design.Analysts foresee a scramble to own and manage these systems and their data, and ever more power accruing to just a few companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft, which already have the global computing systems and reach to make it happen.Few outfits have the engineering talent to manage this sort of thing. One year after starting the business, for example, Microsoft\u2019s cloud handles a trillion sensor messages a week.Salesforce, which is worth $54 billion, is an underdog compared to that tiny group of tech behemoths. It lacks global data centers, but does control important data, like information about what customers are buying.Who will ultimately control that data, from the sensors to the cloud and back, is one of the most contentious questions in tech.\u201cYou\u2019ve got Amazon knowing everything about purchasing, Google knowing everything about what people do on the Internet, and Salesforce knowing everything about the revenue side of a business,\u201d said Scott Raney, a venture capitalist at Redpoint Ventures who invests in companies related to what Mr. Bosworth is working on.\u201cLay computer processing on all that, and it\u2019s powerful to a point where a little creepiness sets in; no one else will have the data,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m buying the stock of all the companies. I just hope they\u2019ll be benevolent dictators.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Since my husband, a Navy helicopter pilot, deployed in early October, moments like these have been rare. While I was surrounded by family, laughing with abandon, it felt as if he were simply in the next room watching the Chiefs game with some of the guys, instead of on a ship, somewhere in the Middle East. As my aunt told a story, my newly turned 5-year-old climbed on my lap. She quietly slid my phone off the table, and asked in a whisper if she could look at pictures. I kissed her head and nodded as I laughed along with the other adults. Moments later, we were all interrupted as my daughter started to cry. Not sniffling. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m talking lose-your-mind-something-is-really-wrong-wailing-hysterically kind of cry. I looked down at my phone and saw what stared back at her: a \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoday in history\u00e2\u0080\u009d picture of my husband holding her in the hospital, his face full of the wonder and joy that new parenting brings. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDaddy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, sobbing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI miss my daddy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I scooped her up and carried her upstairs to a rocking chair to console her. My father (her Papa) and her cousin Finley came up to help soothe her, but she wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t having it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want YOUR daddy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried to me. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot Finley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daddy, or Addie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daddy, I want MY daddy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Over, and over again she said it, until a funny video of her playing at the pool with my husband (accompanied by promises of doing that again soon) consoled her.

Finally calm, we walked downstairs to find a quiet dining room, where the tears of laughter in everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes had quickly been replaced by ones of deep sympathy and palpable sadness.Later that night, once the children were asleep, I found my generally stoic brother (Addie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daddy) in the basement, also in tears. As he wrapped his arms around me, he offered: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis just seems so hard for you guys. Is it really worth it?\u00e2\u0080\u009dMy husband and I started dating while he was in flight school; there has never been a version of us where he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in the military. We\u2019ve been together for 10 years, all of it colored by his service. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to focus on the bad, the hard and the tragic that comes with being a military family. The missed birthdays, anniversaries, holidays. The back-to-back deployments. The pacing when the news reports a helicopter down, or sailors detained in Iran, and you haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t received an \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m O.K.\u00e2\u0080\u009d message yet. The awful, guilt-ridden relief you experience when you learn that your spouse will come home to you and your two children, when you know there are others who won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. The waiting, the praying, the wishing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 no, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not worth it. Not even a little. But those bad moments are just one piece of it. We\u2019ve been to Japan, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Singapore and all over the world. We have visited places I had only read about. I stood on a stage in Pensacola, Fla., and pinned wings of gold to his uniform for the first time. One night in Guam, he gave me a flag that had flown over his base in Iraq and thanked me for loving and supporting him. We have made countless, incredible friends we never would have met without the Navy. Even the hard parts  (like now) have their sweetness. A few days ago, my husband called our daughter on her birthday. Because he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get her a gift this year, he said, he learned to play her favorite song on the ukulele. Thousands of miles away, as he sang, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI lava you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she sat at the kitchen table, beaming from ear to ear.Years from now, our two children may remember how hard this deployment was for them. They may recall the heartache, the sadness and the occasional tears. I hope not. Instead, I hope they remember the joy they felt on Christmas when they found Santa left a \u00e2\u0080\u009chug\u00e2\u0080\u009d from Daddy (traced paper hands held together by ribbon) in their stockings. I hope they remember writing him love letters and looking forward to him coming home. I want them to remember the bedtime snuggles with me telling them goofy stories about their father that make them giggle. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll bet our 5-year-old always remembers the birthday her daddy called from his faraway ship, just to sing her a song.Is it worth it? I tell my brother I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure. But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure I would have it any other way. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Meredith Wild, a Self-Publisher Making an Imprint", "Date": "2016-01-30", "News": "Supported byOne chilly morning this month, Meredith Wild, the best-selling romance novelist, was sitting in her library in Destin, Fla., wrapped in a loose black sweater in front of a crackling fire. Most mornings, Ms. Wild writes her novels in this spot after her children leave for school, but that day she had other business to attend to. She had a call with a reality TV production company that is developing a show about her, and later, a conference call with a team at Waterhouse Press, the small imprint that is publishing her new novel in June.Ms. Wild has an unusual amount of sway for an author, owing to her high-profile position at Waterhouse: She founded the company. After sales of her self-published erotic novels took off on Amazon and other sites, Ms. Wild created the press partly as a way to get print versions into bookstore chains and big-box stores.\u201cI wanted something that sounded like it was a real imprint, because nobody takes you seriously as an independent author,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt I was being discriminated against as an indie.\u201dHer marketing abilities proved so effective \u2014 she sold 1.4 million print and digital copies \u2014 that she decided to expand her business by taking on other authors, in essence becoming a publisher herself.Last year, Ms. Wild began quietly acquiring works by other self-published romance writers, including Helen Hardt and Audrey Carlan, and publishing their books under her Waterhouse imprint. The press will release at least nine novels this year, including two in Ms. Wild\u2019s current series. She\u2019s become a kind of value investor in erotic prose, pinpointing undervalued writers and backing their brands.\u201cWe\u2019re hoping to discover the next big person and replicate some of the success we had building the visibility of my books,\u201d Ms. Wild said. \u201cWe\u2019re interested in taking these diamond-in-the-rough type people and building their brands.\u201dThe fledgling imprint is already off to a promising start. One of the series it acquired, Ms. Carlan\u2019s \u201cCalendar Girl,\u201d has sold more than a million copies since Waterhouse rereleased it last summer, and it recently appeared on the USA Today and New York Times best-seller lists.Ms. Wild\u2019s path from becoming a self-publishing star to operating her own small imprint is the latest sign that independent authors are catching up to publishers in the sophistication of their marketing and the scope of their ambitions. Self-published authors can negotiate foreign-rights deals and produce audiobooks. A handful of the most successful independent writers sell print copies of their books in physical retail stores like Barnes & Noble, Walmart and Target, giving them access to a market that traditional publishers have long dominated.Now enterprising authors like Ms. Wild are forming their own small publishing houses. Just like the old-guard editors and publishing companies that they once defined themselves against, these new imprints promise to anoint fledgling authors with legitimacy and give them an edge in a flooded and cutthroat marketplace.In a sense, these authors-turned-publishers are thriving because the self-publishing ecosystem has become oversaturated. Amazon has more than four million e-books in its Kindle store, up from 600,000 six years ago, making it harder for new authors to find an audience. Building your own brand may sound appealing and empowering, but only a small fraction of self-published authors sell enough books to make a living, and many are put off by the drudge work and endless self-promotion involved.\u201cAuthors are hungry to try to find new methods to crack the market, and if someone is saying, \u2018I did it, come work with me, and I\u2019ll teach you the secret sauce,\u2019 that sounds like an interesting proposition,\u201d said Peter Hildick-Smith, founder of the Codex Group, which analyzes the book industry.Standing in front of a bookcase in her library, where she has prominently displayed books by Ms. Hardt and Ms. Carlan, Ms. Wild seemed to derive equal satisfaction from the books of others she has published as from those she has written herself. The bottom shelves remained empty, reserved for future acquisitions.\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to filling them up,\u201d she said.Later that morning, Ms. Wild and her husband, Jonathan, sat on the couch in front of the fireplace, each holding a printed agenda. It was time for the conference call with David Grishman, Waterhouse\u2019s chief executive, and three other Waterhouse employees. A former firefighter, her husband now works at Waterhouse on the marketing team. Floor-to-ceiling windows looked out onto a swimming pool and beyond it, the choppy, blue-gray water of Choctawhatchee Bay.They discussed Ms. Wild\u2019s writing schedule and the marketing strategy for Ms. Hardt\u2019s next novel, an erotic romance set in the Victorian era. Then the conversation shifted to Ms. Carlan. Barnes & Noble had just placed a paperback order for her \u201cCalendar Girl\u2019\u2019 series, about a young woman who becomes a high-priced escort to settle her father\u2019s gambling debts.\u201cWe\u2019re at the top of Nook, iBooks and Kindle,\u201d Mr. Grishman said. \u201cWe\u2019re selling a lot. We should look at another print run.\u201d He suggested printing an additional 30,000 books of the first two volumes.When the call ended, the mood was giddy.For decades, the literary world dismissed self-published authors as amateurs and hacks who lacked the talent to land a book deal. But that attitude gradually began to change with the rise of e-books and the arrival of Kindle from Amazon, which gave authors direct access to millions of readers. Over the last five years, close to 40 independent authors have sold more than a million copies of their e-books on Amazon, the company said.After Ms. Wild\u2019s self-published \u201cHacker\u201d series took off in 2014, she was bombarded with offers from publishers, agents and film producers. She was earning so much by then that she told her agent she would entertain only eight-figure offers. She eventually settled for a bit less, agreeing to a $6.25 million advance from Forever, a Grand Central Publishing imprint, for five books.Forever has sold nearly 500,000 digital and print copies of the \u201cHacker\u201d series \u2014 a healthy sum, but far less than the 1.4 million digital and print books Ms. Wild had sold on her own, without any of the editorial guidance, marketing muscle or sales and distribution channels of an established publisher.Perhaps that\u2019s why Ms. Wild opted not to sell the rights to her other books. Instead, she\u2019s publishing her current series through her own imprint.\u201cI\u2019m more comfortable being in control of my successes and failures,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to be on the sidelines.\u201dEditors and publishers are adjusting to a new power dynamic, one in which even multimillion-dollar advances aren\u2019t enough to ensure an author\u2019s loyalty.\u201cIt\u2019s a challenge, because a lot of the ones who are very successful at it are making a lot of money, which in all honesty can be hard to match with the traditional publishing royalty structure,\u201d said Leah Hultenschmidt, the Forever editor who acquired the Hacker series from Ms. Wild.Publishers fighting to recruit top-selling authors have other reasons to be alarmed by the growth of self-publishing. As independent authors grab a bigger slice of the e-book market, digital sales by traditional publishers fell by 11 percent in the first nine months of 2015, according to data gathered from more than 1,200 publishers by the Association of American Publishers.Last year, a third of the 100 best-selling Kindle books were self-published titles on average each week, an Amazon representative said. Some analysts attribute the dip in publishers\u2019 e-book revenue in part to the glut of cheap self-published books, which often sell for as little as $1.Independent authors are now moving beyond e-books and making inroads into the physical retail market. A handful of the top-selling self-published authors, among them Ms. Wild, Barbara Freethy, H.M. Ward, C J Lyons and Bella Andre, have struck distribution deals with Ingram Content Group, a major book printer and distributor, allowing them to sell their novels in bookstore chains, big-box stores and airports. Thirty-six percent of book buyers read only print books, according to a 2015 survey conducted by the Codex Group.\u201cI can sell my books exactly as if I was Random House or Simon & Schuster,\u201d said Ms. Freethy, who started self-publishing romance novels in 2011 and said she had sold more than five million copies. \u201cThere\u2019s been no pushback from booksellers.\u201dWith all the tools of a publisher at their disposal, it\u2019s no surprise that a few of the most ambitious authors \u2014 among them the paranormal suspense writer J.R. Rain and the mystery writer Gemma Halliday \u2014 are forming their own imprints and recruiting other writers. The business models for author-led imprints vary, but most of them buy publication rights to the books and take a cut of royalties in exchange for editing, formatting, packaging and marketing the books, much like a traditional publisher. Some offer a modest advance. The biggest draw for struggling authors, though, is the chance to be associated with a more successful author\u2019s brand.After selling three million copies of her own books, Liliana Hart, a high school band teacher turned mystery writer, started her own imprint, SilverHart last year and acquired works by four other authors.\u201cThey don\u2019t want the headache of being their own publisher,\u201d Ms. Hart said.When Ms. Wild started writing several years ago, it was mainly to escape the pressures of a day job running her own web design and software development company. She never intended to become a publisher, but seemed unable to resist the entrepreneurial urge. \u201cI can\u2019t do anything without turning it into a business,\u201d said Ms. Wild, 33, who is blond with icy blue eyes and sharp, pixielike features.As a girl growing up in Fulton, Ill., a small town of about 3,500 people, Ms. Wild was a voracious reader. She was the only child of free-spirited, hippie parents \u2014 her mother and stepfather ran an auction company \u2014 and entertained herself with paperback bodice-rippers she bought at the grocery store. She started writing her own elaborate stories on her mother\u2019s computer.She moved east to attend Smith College, where she majored in English and met her husband at a fraternity party at a nearby university. They married when she was 20 and moved to Destin, where he was stationed in the Air Force. Ms. Wild had studied graphic design, so she decided to start her own company. Within a few years, it had 10 employees.The experience of starting and running a business gave Ms. Wild the idea for her first novel in the \u201cHacker\u201d series, \u201cHardwired,\u201d which is about a young Harvard graduate, Erica Hathaway, who is raising money from investors for her start-up. During a pitch meeting to a group of angel investors, she meets Blake Landon, a handsome billionaire, who later seduces her at a tech conference. Erica\u2019s focus on building her company, a fashion-themed social networking site, is occasionally derailed by her torrid relationship with Blake, who introduces her to an array of sexual kinks.Ms. Wild never bothered trying to find a traditional publisher.\u201cI came from such an entrepreneurial background,\u201d Ms. Wild said. \u201cI knew I could market them myself.\u201dShe chose Meredith Wild as a pen name. (She asked that her real name and her husband\u2019s last name not be used to protect their children\u2019s privacy, citing the news coverage of her multimillion-dollar book deal.) She hired an editor to help shape the story and clean up the prose, and published the first novel in September 2013.Ms. Wild\u2019s success wasn\u2019t accidental, but grew out of a meticulously planned marketing campaign. Before the book was even released, she began buying online ads targeting erotic romance readers. Her husband took out 10 credit cards and a personal loan to pay for advertising. They borrowed $70,000 from Mr. Grishman, a former banker who is Ms. Wild\u2019s brother-in-law. They eventually raised enough to fund a six-figure national marketing campaign, which included paid posts on social media and movie theater ads promoting \u201cHardwired\u201d that played before the \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d movie.\u201cHardwired\u201d took off instantly, and sales snowballed when the second and third novels were released.By that summer, Ms. Wild was making $500,000 a month in royalties. Her books were selling briskly through Amazon and Barnes & Noble. She arranged her own audiobook deal with Audible, forgoing an advance in exchange for higher royalties. She sold translation rights to publishers in several countries.Ms. Wild sold her web design company. She hired Mr. Grishman to run Waterhouse, so that she could focus on writing. As the company grew and her sales surged, she realized she already had the infrastructure for a publishing house of her own. She just needed more authors.The first author she signed was Ms. Hardt, who had been writing romance novels for a decade but never did much to market them. Waterhouse is acquiring all her books \u2014 more than 30 titles. \u201cI thought it could get my name out there better than I had been able to do for myself,\u201d she said, \u201cand it certainly has.\u201dA few months later, Waterhouse discovered Ms. Carlan. \u201cWe found her through her Amazon ranking, not because she was doing well but because she wasn\u2019t doing very well,\u201d Ms. Wild said. Ms. Carlan had great reviews but low Amazon sales rankings, suggesting that she was talented but lacked marketing skills.Ms. Carlan, a mother of two who lives in Northern California, had been self-publishing romance novels for about a year, charging 99 cents and selling about 1,000 copies a month. She was dubious at first when she got an email from a marketing manager, who asked her if she wanted to publish her books with Meredith Wild\u2019s imprint.\u201cWhen she said \u2018Meredith Wild\u2019 I thought, \u2018You\u2019re full of it,\u2019\u201d Ms. Carlan said. \u201cI\u2019d read all her books.\u201dWaterhouse bought all of Ms. Carlan\u2019s existing books and signed her to a 27-book deal. Ms. Carlan said she was paid a few thousand dollars per book, plus a percentage of royalties. Waterhouse raised the price of her novellas to $2.99 and toned down the sexy covers on her \u201cCalendar Girl\u201d series so that it could be marketed to mainstream retailers. It promoted the books through paid web advertising, and Ms. Wild endorsed them on her Facebook and Twitter feeds.In December and January, the first book in the series shot up the USA Today and New York Times best-seller lists. The novellas have sold more than 800,000 copies in January. In December, Ms. Carlan says, she made about $20,000 in royalties.Ms. Carlan, whose contract calls for a book every two months, said it was a relief to be able to focus on writing sex scenes.\u201cI\u2019m not interested in designing websites and formatting my books,\u201d she said. \u201cI just want to write wicked hot books.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Personalized Diet, Better Suited to You", "Date": "2016-01-11", "News": "But the advice is likely to be ignored by much of the I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll-have-fries-with-that citizenry. Moreover, recent scientific findings are beginning to lend support to a new approach to diet, one personalized to the individual.Research increasingly suggests that each of us is unique in the way we absorb and metabolize nutrients. This dawning realization has scientists, and entrepreneurs, scrambling to provide more effective nutritional advice based on such distinguishing factors as genetic makeup, gut bacteria, body type and chemical exposures.But the Weizmann team took their findings a step further.By combining data gleaned from subjects\u00e2\u0080\u0099 glucose responses with information about their gut bacteria, medications, family histories and lifestyles, the scientists devised an algorithm that accurately predicted blood sugar responses to foods the participants hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t yet eaten in the study.Further, with the algorithm the scientists were able to prescribe personalized diets to a group of 100 prediabetic patients that significantly moderated their blood sugar following meals and boosted levels of good bacteria in their guts.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe algorithm is similar to what Amazon uses to tell you which books you want to read,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Eran Segal, a computer scientist at the Weizmann Institute and co-author of the study. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe just do it with food.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAlthough they have more fine-tuning to do, Dr. Segal said his group hope to eventually use this algorithm to customize dietary advice to the public. Indeed, personalized nutritional counseling is a burgeoning field. Several companies, including Vitagene, Nutrigenomix and DNAFit, are already offering individualized dietary counseling.More research is needed, he and other experts say, because the interactions among one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s genes, microbiome, diet, environment and lifestyle are so infinitely complex.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re starting to see what links there are between food, microbiota, individual genetic makeup and our health,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Mathers said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese different lines of work are beginning to come together now partly because we have the technology to cope with the big data issues.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhile the results haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been published yet, Dr. Mathers said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe bottom line is those who were in the personalized diet cohort did better than those in the one-size-fits-all diet group, making us pretty confident personalized diets are the way forward.\u00e2\u0080\u009dCompanies that provide personalized dietary counseling counter that there is at least enough evidence to improve upon all-purpose dietary recommendations, which have proved largely unsuccessful.So buyers beware. Discuss any prescribed dietary changes with a doctor or registered dietitian.Tellingly, many of the experts who champion the future of personalized nutrition have not been genetically tested themselves, nor have they had their own microbiota analyzed.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI like to enjoy my food,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Mathers said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where I start.\u00e2\u0080\u009dRelated:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "Liz Pearce of LiquidPlanner: Solving the Rubik\u2019s Cube of Leadership", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Supported byCorner OfficeQ. What were you like as a child?The nursery school teacher also said I had strong leadership skills, which I think was her way of saying I was really bossy. I\u2019m the oldest of three girls, and I was not the kindest sister in my younger years, although I\u2019ve turned things around now as an adult, and my sisters have forgiven me for all my sins of the past.I was also geeky and a bit nerdy as a kid. My mother is a devout Catholic, and I grew up going to church every Sunday, and went to Catholic elementary school. There was a time where I thought that I had to become a nun. I was relieved when I learned that was not the case.How do you think your parents have influenced your leadership style?One thing that was a steady current through my childhood was that my mother was politically conservative and, for a while, socially conservative. And my dad was very liberal. They were the two ends of the political spectrum.I remember sitting at the dinner table, and it was like watching a tennis match. They would debate back and forth. And it made me naturally inclined to look at everything from both sides, to understand the different angles.It\u2019s made me a bit more apolitical as an adult because I really want to understand the issues before I form an opinion, and it\u2019s so hard to get enough information to really understand the issues. But it has also really impacted the way I look at problems in business. I have all of these sources of data about the company, and I look at them a lot. It\u2019s almost like channel surfing for me. And I just remember the numbers. It freaks our employees out a bit.And tell me about your college years.I was way more interested in my jobs than I was in my coursework. I was a graphic designer in the student services organization, and I thought, \u201cThese are my people.\u201d I could combine my love of art with technology, and I was learning computer programs. I got a lot of exposure to leaders in the university through that work.Then after graduation in 2003, I learned about a job at Google as a marketing coordinator. I was there for only nine months, but they were like dog years. The company was exploding. I was working 17-hour days. I was running 200 projects at a time. I would break my day down into 15-minute increments and ask, \u201cWhat is the most important thing to do in these 15 minutes?\u201dAfter a brief stint at Amazon, I started consulting, and that\u2019s what led to working for LiquidPlanner, and I eventually joined them as director of marketing in 2008. Four years later, I became C.E.O. When the board approved my new role, it just hit me like a ton of bricks that this is really happening.What do you like about being C.E.O.?I like to put all the pieces together. It\u2019s like a Rubik\u2019s Cube. When you\u2019re running a start-up, you have this finite set of resources, and you have this huge goal. So you look at all the angles, and twist things this way and that as you\u2019re thinking, \u201cWhat if we did it this way?\u201dAnd every new employee who comes in is like Christmas morning. What are they going to bring to the table? What do they know that can help us? How can we help them?The job has a lot of pressure, too. The perfectionist student in me wants to hit every single number every single month. And that\u2019s been a big part of my evolution as a leader \u2014 to be O.K. if we don\u2019t execute perfectly every month, and to keep people focused on tomorrow and moving the business forward.Any surprises in the role?I\u2019ve had light-bulb moments when I realized I have to be really thoughtful about what I ask for and how I ask for it, because people are watching and listening closely, and caring in a way that they didn\u2019t when I didn\u2019t have this title. That\u2019s always been a little bit uncomfortable for me. I don\u2019t have this grand image of myself. I\u2019m just like everybody else.How do you hire?With some people, I\u2019ll ask questions like, \u201cWhen nobody is watching you, outside of work, what do you do to be great that is only for you and that no one else will ever see?\u201d I\u2019m just looking for that internal drive.I\u2019ll also ask people to tell me about times when they have been on a path to failure, and what their mental dialogue was to reset that. Because I want to understand their psychology a little bit. How do you give yourself a pep talk? What do you say to yourself? What are the games you play in your head to right things? Because you will encounter those moments when a task just seems insurmountable.I also really want to understand people\u2019s intentions, and why they do the things they do. For example, I\u2019ll ask about the thought process behind taking different jobs they\u2019ve had.What career advice do you give to new college grads?I give them my mom\u2019s advice: Don\u2019t worry about the money, don\u2019t worry about the title, don\u2019t worry about the company. Just take the job where you can learn the most.And if people are early in their career and they desperately want to change, I coach them to not change everything all at once. Change one dimension, or maybe two \u2014 like the industry or the size of the company \u2014 but give yourself some advantage going into the next job that will set you up for reaching your goal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As \u2018The X-Files\u2019 Returns, Do We Still Want to Believe?", "Date": "2016-01-21", "News": "Supported byIN 2002, after 202 episodes of government conspiracies, bright lights in the sky, black oil, creepy monsters and sexual tension, \u201cThe X-Files\u201d said goodbye. On Sunday on Fox, the F.B.I. agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) return for a six-part mini-series.The New York Times TV critics James Poniewozik and Mike Hale emailed over encrypted lines from undisclosed locations to discuss the new series and the legacy of the original.Not at first, not at all. The first episode is called \u201cMy Struggle,\u201d which aptly describes the experience of sitting through it. It lumbers. It plods. The actors chew sawdusty mouthfuls of expository dialogue. It introduces an Alex-Jones-like conspiracy-talk-show host (Joel McHale), who\u2019s meant to be played straight but comes off like parody. Above all, it\u2019s handicapped by the fact that it has to tear down much of the show\u2019s mythology and construct a new one in an hour. It\u2019s like rebuilding a sports car just to back it down the driveway.Test your knowledge of \u201cX-Files\u201d monsters-of-the-week in this interactive quiz.Thankfully, the second episode shakes the dourness and gives Mulder and Scully more room to breathe. But it\u2019s the third \u2014 a comic palate-cleanser in the \u201cmonster of the week\u201d vein \u2014 that finally recreates the show\u2019s oddball delights. As Scully says, in one of the script\u2019s many meta comments, \u201cI forgot how much fun these cases could be.\u201d She\u2019s right. Still, while \u201cThe X-Files\u201d has a great legacy \u2014 on serial TV, on sci-fi and, thematically, on television at large \u2014 I wonder if its time has passed. Has the show changed, or have we?To your question: \u201cThe X-Files\u201d was a show about a certain mode of fear and style of conspiracy, and in the 14 years since it ended our culture has been overtaken by a new, more grim, more literal sense of fear. (The last season started on Nov. 11, 2001.) In the opening episode, the extended U.F.O. history lesson feels like a wrongheaded attempt to explain what all the excitement used to be about. In the exponentially better second and third episodes, the writers mostly ignore the time lapse, except to poke fun at Mulder\u2019s incompetence with personal electronics. They\u2019re confident that the show\u2019s structure still stands up.As a fan I loved the self-referentiality of the third episode \u2014 my favorite line was probably Mulder\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m just looking for some internal logic\u201d \u2014 but as a critic I wondered how interesting the episode would be for someone who hadn\u2019t watched the show before. It was really heavy on the in-jokes. Did that bother you at all? Does it matter?Which is interesting, because there\u2019s something very prebinge about its structure \u2014 a ratio of a couple of stand-alone episodes for every mythology episode. That\u2019s very much an artifact of the TV business of the \u201990s. Before Netflix, before \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d before \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d (from Vince Gilligan of \u201cThe X-Files\u201d), complicated serial TV was considered a risk. (\u201cTwin Peaks\u201d was an exception, but also a cautionary tale.) Before DVRs and streaming made catching up easier, you might permanently lose viewers every time they missed an episode, so older TV was aimed at making every installment accessible to a brand-new audience. \u201cThe X-Files,\u201d appropriately, was a DNA-engineered hybrid. Part of the time it was a complex sci-fi saga. Other times, it was an anthology \u2014 part \u201cTwilight Zone,\u201d part buddy-cop show. It contributed to the show\u2019s surreal atmosphere, but I wonder if Mr. Carter would make the same show starting today \u2014 if an \u201cX-Files\u201d of 2016 would be \u201cLost\u201d or \u201cBlack Mirror.\u201dAnother thing I appreciated about that third episode (titled \u201cMulder and Scully Meet the Were-Monster\u201d) was that it allowed Mr. Duchovny and Ms. Anderson to be a little silly. Humor, and those actors\u2019 comic talents, were an important ingredient in the mix of the original series that gets overlooked. Mr. Duchovny, especially, is a natural comedian with a genius for self-deprecation. He still gives just the right note of innocent vanity to a line like: \u201cI\u2019m a middle-aged man, Scully. No, I am.\u201d Like you, I\u2019ve forgotten a lot, but it\u2019s my sense that in general, mythology worked against humor \u2014 the serialized episodes had a severity to them, a \u201cwe\u2019re being serious now\u201d tone.When the new episodes work, it\u2019s because Mulder and Scully work. One thing I like about the new stand-alone episodes is that they\u2019re not entirely static; they carry the weight of history between these characters. (Oh yeah, remember that they had a kid together?) Even the lighter third episode reminds us how experience has changed their perspectives. Mulder has been burned enough to be dubious, while Scully has seen enough to be open to the impossible.It\u2019s especially good to see Ms. Anderson, such a beacon of intensity in \u201cThe Fall,\u201d get to flex her dry humor again. When she pulls an obscure fact out of thin air, as Scully is wont to do, she shrugs it off in a way that both acknowledges how much time has passed and tells us the important things haven\u2019t changed. \u201cI\u2019m old school, Mulder,\u201d she says. \u201cPre-Google.\u201dMany shows have tried to follow the \u201cX-Files\u201d template to one degree or another, but they\u2019re always missing that Mulder-Scully umami. \u201cFringe\u201d tried to reconstitute it with Anna Torv and Joshua Jackson as an F.B.I. agent and a skeptical civilian. \u201cSupernatural\u201d cut women out of the equation and made the show\u2019s demon hunters two brothers whose devotion was to each other.Chris Carter was reviving a television tradition of science-fiction-inflected horror (or horror-inflected science fiction) that ran from \u201cThe Twilight Zone\u201d to \u201cNight Gallery\u201d to \u201cKolchak: The Night Stalker,\u201d but his and his writers\u2019 great contribution was the addition of flirtatiousness and genuine adult emotion to the mix. The legacy of \u201cThe X-Files\u201d may be that it made TV hospitable again to a range of genre shows after the sitcom domination of the 1980s, helping pave the way for future fantasists like J. J. Abrams and Joss Whedon. But when it was at its best, the show was equal parts suspense, horror, science fiction \u2014 and romance.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Transcript of the Main Republican Presidential Debate", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byBRET BAIER: Nine p.m. on the East Coast. Eight o\u2019clock here in Des Moines, Iowa. Welcome to the seventh Republican presidential debate of the 2016 campaign. I\u2019m Bret Baier, along with my comoderators Megyn Kelly and Chris Wallace. KELLY: Tonight, we are coming to you live from the Iowa Event Center in downtown Des Moines, in the shadow of the Iowa state capitol. In just four days, people here in the Hawkeye State will caucus and cast the first votes of the 2016 election.CHRIS WALLACE: Tonight, we\u2019re partnering with Google for an exclusive second-screen experience. Search Fox News debate on Google any time in the next two hours to access exclusive content.BAIER: Google sees political searches spike during televised presidential debates \u2014 no surprise there. But they spike by more than 440 percent on average, as voters across America seek to learn more about what\u2019s happening on the live debate stage.MEGYN KELLY: Seven candidates are on that stage tonight, their position on the stage determined by their standing in the latest national polls, as well as polls in Iowa and New Hampshire. And here they are.Texas Senator Ted Cruz.(APPLAUSE)Florida Senator Marco Rubio.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson.(APPLAUSE)Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush.(APPLAUSE)New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Ohio Governor John Kasich.(APPLAUSE) And Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Apparently Iowa\u2019s near Kentucky.BAIER: Tonight\u2019s rules are simple. Up to 60 seconds for each answer, 30 seconds for each follow-up response. And if a candidate goes over the allotted time, you will hear this.(BELL RINGS)Double.KELLY: Wow.BAIER: I think the double is the one we want. Very pleasing.(LAUGHTER)We have a crowd of about 1,600 here, and while they have agreed to respect the candidates and listen intently, we can tell you they are very excited to be here. Am I right?(APPLAUSE)KELLY: So let\u2019s get started.Senator Cruz, before we get to the issues, let\u2019s address the elephant not in the room tonight.(LAUGHTER)Donald Trump has chosen not to attend this evening\u2019s presidential debate. What message do you think that sends to the voters of Iowa?CRUZ: Well, Megyn, let me say at the outset to the men and women of Iowa, thank you for the incredible hospitality over this past year.By Monday, you will have welcomed me into all 99 counties in Iowa. You will have welcomed my dad to preach at your churches. You will have welcomed Heidi and our girls, Caroline and Catherine, into your homes. And I\u2019m so grateful for the diligence, for the seriousness with which the men and women of Iowa approach this process.If I am elected president, keep an eye on the tarmac, because I\u2019ll be back, because Iowa in 2017 will not be fly-over country. It will be fly-to country.(APPLAUSE)Now, secondly, let me say I\u2019m a maniac and everyone on this stage is stupid, fat, and ugly. And Ben, you\u2019re a terrible surgeon.(LAUGHTER) Now that we\u2019ve gotten the Donald Trump portion out of the way...(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)I want to thank everyone here for showing the men and women of Iowa the respect to show up and make the case to the people of this state and the people of the country why each of us believe we would make the best commander in chief.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: The divide between you and Mr. Trump has turned into one of the biggest stories in the country. And for six months that \u2014 your campaign, during this campaign, you praised Mr. Trump as somebody who you thought was an effective voice against the Washington cartel. You said you were glad that he was running as a Republican.But when he started to criticize you, your message changed, and you suddenly started to portray him as the voice of the Washington cartel, and suggested he would do the Democrats\u2019 bidding. Which is it?CRUZ: Well, let me be clear, if Donald engages in insults or anybody else, I don\u2019t intend to reciprocate. I have not insulted Donald personally and I don\u2019t intend to.I am glad Donald is running. I\u2019m glad he has produced enormous enthusiasm, and, every Donald Trump voter or potential voter, I hope to earn your support. I know everyone else on this stage hopes to earn your support.Now, there is a difference between personal insults and attacks \u2014 between going into the mud with ad hominems and focusing on issues and substance. CRUZ: I think issues and substance, policy and vision and record should be the meat of politics. That\u2019s fair game but that\u2019s where I\u2019m going to focus. That\u2019s how I focused from the beginning of the campaign and it is how I intend to continue going forward.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Senator Rubio, I want to explore this sort of larger issue. The campaign has in a sense turned into a battle for the soul of the Republican party: establishment versus grassroots, pragmatic versus principle. You say that you can unite all of the factions inside the GOP. How?RUBIO: Chris, let\u2019s begin by being clear what this campaign is about. It\u2019s not about Donald Trump. He\u2019s an entertaining guy. He\u2019s the greatest show on earth. This campaign is about the greatest country in the world and a president who has systematically destroyed many of the things that made America special.You see, we usually elect presidents in America that want to change the things that are wrong in America. Barack Obama wants to change America. Barack Obama wants America to be more like the rest of the world. We don\u2019t want to be like the rest of the world. We want to be the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: That is why Hillary Clinton cannot win this election. Hillary Clinton this week said Barack Obama would make a great Supreme Court justice. The guy who systematically and habitually violates the constitution on the Supreme Court? I don\u2019t think so. If I\u2019m our nominee, I will unite this party and we\u2019ll defeat Hillary Clinton and we will turn this country around once and for all, after seven years of the disaster that is Barack Obama.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Governor Bush, it\u2019s hard for anyone of your pedigree to avoid being called establishment. But isn\u2019t that part of the problem in this race, that three others on this stage are splitting the main stream Republican vote and there by possibly handing this nomination over to an anti-establishment candidate?BUSH: Bret, we\u2019re just starting. The first vote hasn\u2019t been counted. Why don\u2019t we let the process work. I trust Iowans, Granite staters (ph), people in South Carolina, people in Nevada, to start this process out. I kind of miss Donald Trump. He was a little teddy bear to me.(LAUGHTER)We always had such a loving relationship in these debates and in between and the tweets. I kind of miss him. I wish he was here. Everybody else was in the witness protection program when I went after him on behalf of what the Republican cause should be: conservative principles, believing in limited government, believing in accountability. Leading by fixing the things that are broken.Look, I am in the establishment because my dad, the greatest man alive was president of the United States and my brother, who I adore as well as fantastic brother was president. Fine, I\u2019ll take it. I guess I\u2019m part of the establishment Barbara Bush is my mom. I\u2019ll take that, too.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: But this election is not about our pedigree, this is an election about people that are really hurting. We need a leader that will fix things and have a proven record to do it. And we need someone who will take on Hillary Clinton in November. Someone who has a proven record, who has been tested, who is totally transparent. I released 34 years of tax returns...(BELL RINGS)... and 300,000 e-mails in my government record. To get the information from Hillary Clinton, you need to get a subpoena from the FBI.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Thank you governor.KELLY: Senator Christie, you began this campaign touting your record as a Republican from a blue state who knows how to get things done and reach across the aisle. However, many Republicans feel that reaching across the aisle and getting things done isn\u2019t great if you get the wrong things done. And they prefer to stand on principle rather than compromise. Why are they wrong and you\u2019re right?CHRISTIE: They\u2019re not wrong. But what\u2019s wrong is your premise in the question. You can do both. There is no reason why you can\u2019t stand for principles, go and fight for them and be able also, to have to get things done in government.You know, what people are frustrated about in Washington, D.C.., and I know the folks out there tonight are incredibly frustrated because what they see is a government that doesn\u2019t work for them. You know, for the 45-year-old construction worker out there, who is having a hard time making things meet.He\u2019s lost $4,000 in the last seven years in his income because of this administration. He doesn\u2019t want to hear the talk about politics Megyn and who is establishment and who is grassroots. And who\u2019s compromised and who is principled. What he wants is something to get done.And that\u2019s the difference between being a governor and having done that for the last six years in New Jersey and being someone who has never had to be responsible for any of those decisions. Barack Obama was never responsible for those decisions.Hillary Clinton has never been responsible for those kind of decisions where they were held accountable. I\u2019ve been held accountable for six years as the governor of New Jersey and with a Democratic legislature, I\u2019ve gotten conservative things done. That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ll do as president of the United States.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Senator Paul, you are definitely not in the establishment category. But at the beginning of this campaign, you said you were your own man when asked about your father, former Texas Congressman and three-time presidential candidate Ron Paul.Senator Cruz\u2019s campaign is out with a video saying that Cruz is the intellectual and political heir to your father\u2019s 2012 campaign and the liberty movement. And your father now says it\u2019s realistic that Donald Trump will be your party\u2019s nominee.So did you make a mistake by not fully \u2014 more fully embracing your father politically at the beginning of this campaign?PAUL: You know, I\u2019ve always had a great deal of respect. There\u2019s probably no person I respect more in the country or in recent history than my father. I think he was probably the most honest man in politics that we\u2019ve ever seen in a generation.And so in no way have I ever said that I don\u2019t embrace my father or love my father or appreciate everything that he has done for the country. I think what\u2019s interesting about where that liberty vote goes that my father brought to the Republican Party is, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re necessarily going to go for Ted.You know, Ted didn\u2019t show up. We had an audit-the-Fed vote, which was the biggest thing my dad had been advocating for, for 30 years, Ted didn\u2019t have time to show up. He was the only Republican that didn\u2019t show up for it.And so I think really that vote is going to stay in the Paul household. I think more of it is coming and it\u2019s going to grow.The NSA is another big issue. Ted said he was for NSA reform, but then he told Marco Rubio, no, no, no, I voted for the bill because I\u2019m for the government collecting 100 percent of your cell phone records.I don\u2019t think Ted can have it both ways. They want to say they\u2019re getting some of the liberty vote. But we don\u2019t see it happening at all. We think we\u2019re going to do very well in Iowa with the liberty vote.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Senator Cruz, your response to that?CRUZ: Well, I agree with Rand that I very much respect Ron Paul and that I think anyone who is able to win in the Republican Party has to be able to bring together the disparate elements of the Reagan coalition. You\u2019ve got to be able to bring together conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians, and stitch together a winning majority.When it comes to the audit the Fed bill, as Rand knows well, I was an original sponsor of the bill, I\u2019m strongly supportive of it. It didn\u2019t have the votes to pass. And I had commitments to be at a town hall in New Hampshire.But I look forward to signing that bill into law as president and auditing the Fed and providing needed accountability at the Federal Reserve.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Senator Rubio?RUBIO: I think, you know, Rand and I have some significant issues on policy, but I respect Rand. He believes everything he stands for.(APPLAUSE)I do respect Rand.But I want to be frank about what I stand for. I believe the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest power in the world. And I believe only with a strong America will we defeat this radical group, this apocalyptic group called ISIS.That\u2019s why when I\u2019m president we are going to rebuild our intelligence capabilities. And they\u2019re going to tell us where the terrorists are. And a rebuilt U.S. military is going to destroy these terrorists.And if we capture any of these ISIS killers alive, they are going to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we\u2019re going to find out everything they know, because when I\u2019m president, unlike Barack Obama, we will keep this country safe.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Thank you, Senator.PAUL: May I respond?(CROSSTALK)BAIER: We\u2019ll come back to...PAUL: Well, I mean, I was talked about in the question.BAIER: OK. Go ahead, go ahead. PAUL: Just very quickly, I would like to respond.The bulk collection of your phone data, the invasion of your privacy did not stop one terrorist attack. I don\u2019t think you have to give up your liberty for a false sense of security.When we look at this bulk collection, the court has looked at this. Even the court declared it to be illegal. If we want to collect the records of terrorists, let\u2019s do it the old fashioned way. Let\u2019s use the Fourth Amendment. Let\u2019s put a name on a warrant, let\u2019s ask a judge for it. Let\u2019s respect the history of our country.John Adams said that we fought a War for Independence because we wanted to fight against generalized warrants. Let\u2019s don\u2019t forget that.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Governor Kasich, I want to get back to this question of where conservatives are this year. You call yourself a, quote, \u201cinside-outside guy, a reformer who knows how to get things done,\u201d but you reject the establishment label.First question is why do you reject it? And secondly, what do you say to Republican voters this year who view practical government experience as a liability and not an asset?KASICH: Well, first of all, I had a national reporter say, you know, there\u2019s three lanes. There\u2019s the establishment lane, the anti- establishment lane, and then there\u2019s the Kasich lane.And the reason is, is that I\u2019ve been a reformer all of my career, fighting to reform welfare, fighting to reform the Pentagon, also being in a position to balance the budget, because that is very, very hard to do.And then in Ohio, of course, I had to bring about big reform, again, because we were so far in the hole and now we just found out we are up over 400,000 jobs since I took over as governor.KASICH: You know, the situation is this. We cannot fix things in this country \u2014 the Social Security, the border, balancing the budget, getting wages to grow faster \u2014 unless we lead as conservatives, but we also invite people in from the other party. We have to come together as a country. And we have to stop all the divisions.And, you know, that\u2019s been my message in New Hampshire. And having been in New Hampshire and here in Iowa, but in New Hampshire, I just received the support of seven out of eight of the newspapers in that state because they see positive, they see unity, they see coming together, and they see a record of change and a record of accomplishment.And it isn\u2019t because I\u2019m all that great. It\u2019s because I\u2019ve been assembling a team of people who want to be involved in something that\u2019s a little bigger than themselves. I\u2019ll keep \u2014 I\u2019ll keep heading in that direction, believe me.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Dr. Carson, I want to pick up on that with you. Governor Kasich likes to say he knows how to land the plane. You\u2019ve landed a lot of planes in the O.R. But what about the idea of running for president with no experience in government at all?CARSON: Well, I will gladly confess that I\u2019m the only one on this stage with no political title. You\u2019re not going to hear a lot of polished political speech from me, but you will hear the truth. And I don\u2019t think you have to be a politician to tell the truth. In fact, sometimes it\u2019s not that way...(APPLAUSE)... and I\u2019ve had more two a.m. phone calls than everybody here put together, making life and death decisions, put together very complex teams to accomplish things that have never been done before. And we are in a situation right now in our country that we have never been in before. We need people who think out of the box and can solve problems; can utilize the resources around them; very smart people, to focus on the problem and solve the problem.The American people are terrified. That\u2019s why we have this abnormal situation going on right now. We don\u2019t need more of the same solutions. We need different solutions to solve the problems and to save our nation. (APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Gentlemen, we\u2019re now going to start to drill down into specific issues that are on voters\u2019 minds. I\u2019m going to start with one of the biggest ones, which is foreign terror.According to Google, ISIS was by far the most searched foreign policy topic over the last year. Senator Cruz, you talk tough about fighting terrorism. You talk about carpet bombing into oblivion. You talk about seeing if the sand will glow at night. But critics say that your record does not match up to that. You opposed giving President Obama authority to enforce his red line in Syria. Three years in a row now, you have voted against the Defense Authorization Act.How do you square your rhetoric with your record, sir?CRUZ: Well, Chris, I will apologize to nobody for the vigorousness with which I will fight terrorism, go after ISIS, hunt them down wherever they are, and utterly and completely destroy ISIS.(APPLAUSE)You know, you claim it is tough talk to discuss carpet bombing. It is not tough talk. It is a different, fundamental military strategy than what we\u2019ve seen from Barack Obama. Barack Obama right now, number one, over seven years, has dramatically degraded our military. You know, just two weeks ago was the 25th anniversary of the first Persian Gulf war. When that war began, we had 8,000 planes. Today, we have about 4,000. When that war began, we had 529 ships. Today, we have 272.You want to know what carpet bombing is? It\u2019s what we did in the first Persian Gulf war; 1,100 air attacks a day, saturation bombing that utterly destroyed the enemy. Right now, Barack Obama is launching between 15 and 30 air attacks a day. He\u2019s not arming the Kurds. We need to define the enemy. We need to rebuild the military to defeat the enemy. And we need to be focused and lift the rules of engagement so we\u2019re not sending our fighting men and women into combat with their arms tied behind their backs.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Senator Rubio, does Senator Cruz\u2019s record match his rhetoric?RUBIO: Well, again, I mean, obviously, as already has been pointed out, the only budget that Ted has ever voted for is a budget that Rand Paul sponsored that brags about cutting defense spending. And I think that\u2019s a bad idea for the following reason.ISIS is the most dangerous jihadist group in the history of mankind. ISIS is now found in affiliates in over a dozen countries. ISIS is a group that burns people alive in cages; that sells off little girls as brides. ISIS is a group that wants to trigger an apocalyptic showdown in the city of Dabiq \u2014 not the city of Dubuque; I mis-said \u2014 mis-said that wrong once (inaudible) time \u2014 the city of Dabiq in Syria. They want to trigger an apocalyptic Armageddon showdown.RUBIO: This group needs to be confronted and defeated. They are not going to go away on their own. They\u2019re not going to turn into stockbrokers overnight or open up a chain of car washes. They need to be defeated militarily, and that will take overwhelming U.S. force.Today, we are on pace to have the smallest Army since the end of World War II, the smallest Navy in 100 years, the smallest Air Force in our history. You cannot destroy ISIS with a military that\u2019s being diminished. When I\u2019m president, we are rebuilding the U.S. military because the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest military in the world.(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: Senator Cruz, you\u2019ve got 30 seconds. You were mentioned.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: Chris, in 1981, when Ronald Reagan came to the Oval Office, he encountered a military that had been debilitated just as the current military has, just like Jimmy Carter weakened our readiness, undermined our ability to defend this country, so too has Barack Obama. Just as morale in the military has plummeted in the last seven, so it had then.What Reagan did is he began with tax reform and regulatory reform, unleashing the engine of the American free enterprise system. It brought booming economic growth and that growth fueled rebuilding the military. I intend to do the exact same thing to defeat radical Islamic terrorism \u2014WALLACE: Gentlemen.CRUZ: ... and to devote the resources from the booming economy to rebuilding our Navy, rebuilding our Air Force, rebuilding our Army and ensuring we have the capacity to keep this country safe.PAUL: My budget was mentioned. My budget was mentioned.WALLACE: May I \u2014 may I just say, we are going to continue the questions about foreign terror, gentlemen, right after this break.BAIER: Welcome back. Let\u2019s get right back to the questions. Chris.WALLACE: Thank you. Governor Christie, you have compared both Senators Cruz and Rubio to Barack Obama, saying that we cannot afford another inexperienced President. You\u2019ve also said that Senator Cruz\u2019s vote to curtail the NSA surveillance program made America less safe. Is either of them ready to be Commander in Chief?CHRISTIE: Well, let me say that I do believe that the vote on NSA made the country less safe. Well, let me tell you what the country should really be worried about. I watched that town hall meeting with the Democrats the other night, and I heard Hillary Clinton asked a direct question by an Iowan, and that\u2019s what Iowans like to do. They like to ask direct questions.And, they asked about her email situation. And, here\u2019s what she said to the American people. She did it for convenience. For her convenience. She put America\u2019s secrets at risk for her convenience. She put American intelligence officers at risk for her convenience. She put American strategy at risk for her convenience.Let me tell you who\u2019s not qualified to be President of the United States, Chris. Hillary Rodham Clinton did that to our country. She is not qualified to be President of the United States.(CHEERING)The fact is what we need is someone on that stage who has been tested, who has been through it, who has made decisions, who has sit (ph) in the chair of consequence and can prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton on...(BELL RINGING)CHRISTIE: ... that stage, and that is exactly what I am ready to do.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Governor Bush...CRUZ: Chris? Chris I was mentioned in that question.BUSH: No, you weren\u2019t. Your name wasn\u2019t mentioned, Ted.CRUZ: ... Actually, I was...BUSH: ... Chris, keep it coming...WALLACE: ... I don\u2019t think that your name was mentioned...CRUZ: ... Chris, your questions that you...WALLACE: ... Sir, I think \u2014 I think the question was...CRUZ: ... What was your question...WALLACE: ... It\u2019s not my question that you get a chance to respond to, it\u2019s his answer.(LAUGHTER)WALLACE: You don\u2019t get 30 seconds to respond to me...CRUZ: ... Your question was you have disagreed...(AUDIENCE REACTION)WALLACE: ... You don\u2019t get 30 seconds to respond to me...CRUZ: ... (inaudible) opening statement.WALLACE: ... If I could go on. Sir, I know you like to argue about the rules, but we\u2019re going to conduct a debate...BUSH: ... Thank you Chris...WALLACE: ... Governor Bush...CRUZ: ... This entire question was an attack, but that\u2019s (inaudible)WALLACE: Governor Bush, here\u2019s the question \u2014 I\u2019m going to ask Governor Bush the question.You criticized several candidates in this field on this stage for what you call unrealistic ideas about how to fight terrorists, including Rubio, and Cruz on the issue of their refusing to give the President authority to enforce the redline in Syria.But, given the fact that your brother got us into two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that have still not ended.That have still not ended, what lessons have you learned from his mistakes, sir?BUSH: Well, first, I was critical of the Senators not giving the authorization for the use of military force. They should have made it more open ended for the next president. We shouldn\u2019t have the war fighters have their arms tied behind their back as President Obama wanted to do, but they had a chance to show support and it wasn\u2019t popular at the time. It became popular after the attack in Paris, and San Bernardino. Now we hear the tough talk.Prior to that, in the Reagan Library, I gave a detailed plan. Exactly what to do as it relates to ISIS. And it is from the lessons from history that we do this because if we allow this to fester, we\u2019re going to have Islamic terrorism, multi-generations of it all across this country. The caliphate of ISIS has to be destroyed, which means we need to arm directly to Kurds, imbed our troops with the Iraqi military, re engage with the Sunni tribal leaders. Get the lawyers off the damn backs of the military once and for all.(CHEERING)BUSH: Have a no fly zone in Syria and create safe zones to deal with the refugees. But, more importantly, to train a Sunni-led force in Syria to take out ISIS with our support...(BELL RINGING)BUSH: ... ground and air. That\u2019s what we need to to, and I laid that out prior to the crisis with the advice of a lot of people, including 12 Medal of Honor recipients that I\u2019m proud that they\u2019re supporting my campaign.History suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Senator Cruz, now you get a chance to respond.CRUZ: Chris, I would note that that the last four questions have been, \u201cRand, please attack Ted. Marco, please attack Ted. Chris, please attack Ted. Jeb, please attack Ted...\u201d(AUDIENCE)CRUZ: Let me just say this...WALLACE: ... It is a debate, sir.CRUZ: ... Well, no, no. A debate actually is a policy issue, but I will say this. Gosh, if you guys ask one more mean question I may have to leave the stage.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: Chris, the most important determination any voter is going to make in this election is who\u2019s best prepared to be Commander in Chief. Who has the experience, who has the knowledge, who has the judgement, who has the clarity, and vision and strength of resolve to keep this country safe. That is what this debate is all about, and I would suggest let\u2019s stay focused on those issues \u2014 rather than just attacks directed at each other.WALLACE: I think the questions were about issues. Senator Rubio, what would you like to respond sir...(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)PAUL: ... Senator Cruz, I\u2019d like to respond...RUBIO: ... First of all \u2014 Let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after.(LAUGHTER)RUBIO: First of all...PAUL: ... and I\u2019d like to respond.RUBIO: ... do I go \u2014 let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after. But...(LAUGHTER)... first of all...WALLACE: Thank you.PAUL: Thank you, Marco.RUBIO: ... first of all, I\u2019m \u2014 don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not leaving the stage no matter what you ask me.WALLACE: Good.RUBIO: And second of all...(APPLAUSE)... and I think \u2014 you know, Governor \u2014 Jeb, you \u2014 the attack that \u2014 the authorization that Barack Obama asked for was not against ISIS. It was against Assad. And John Kerry described it as attacks that would be unbelievably small.I don\u2019t think the United States should be engaged in symbolic military activity. So it was not against ISIS, it was against \u2014 it was against Assad.I think the United States military is operating under rules of engagement that are too strict...(BELL RINGS)...and that do not allow us to pursue victory. When I\u2019m president, that will change.(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: Senator Paul, go ahead. PAUL: Thank you.The issue in Syria\u2019s a very important one, and it\u2019s one we need to get right. The question is, should we be bombing both sides of the war? Some want (ph) to topple Assad. In fact, they want to bomb ISIS and Assad simultaneously.I think that\u2019s a really, really bad idea. In fact, I\u2019ve said for several years that arming the allies of ISIS will make the situation worse, That what we really need to do is defeat ISIS.But if you defeat Assad, what you will wind up with is a larger and more powerful ISIS that occupies that space. You might \u2014 you may well see an ISIS that takes over all of Syria.(BELL RINGS)KASICH: Chris...(APPLAUSE)... there was a question about foreign policy, by the way, and experience. And I \u2014 I thought, if I didn\u2019t jump in, I might not be able to tell everybody this. I think they\u2019d want to hear it.Look, I served on...WALLACE: Well...(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: ... we\u2019ll be talking about foreign policy a little bit later. We\u2019re going to talk...KELLY: We have a lot \u2014 we have a lot to cover. But we want to \u2014 we want to turn the page to domestic...(CROSSTALK)KASICH: ... but wait a minute...KELLY: No, no. No.KASICH: ...the only reason is \u2014 look...KELLY: No no no, because we want to turn the page to domestic terror, and let me tell you why: we\u2019re partnering with Google on this debate, and they\u2019re telling us...KASICH: OK.KELLY: ... that their search results have gone through the roof on \u2014 on people...KASICH: I\u2019ve always listened to you, Megyn. Go ahead.KELLY: ... you\u2019re a good man, Governor Kasich.KASICH: Yes \u2014 thank you.KELLY: People \u2014 the search results \u2014 the searches for terror issues, for safety issues in America have gone through the roof, increased over 400 percent since 2008.People are worried. They\u2019re worried about what\u2019s happening in the country and about a domestic terror attack, as all of you know. Now, when combating this threat, Senator Rubio, you\u2019ve advocated closing down mosques \u2014 we\u2019ll get back to you.Well, you have advocated closing down \u2014 closing down mosques, diners, any place where radicalization is occurring. You told me that. But the Supreme Court has made clear that hateful speech is generally protected by the First Amendment.In other words, radical Muslims have the right to be radical Muslims, unless they turn to terror. Doesn\u2019t your position run afoul of the First Amendment?RUBIO: Megyn, that\u2019s the problem. Radical Muslims and radical Islam is not just hate talk. It\u2019s hate action. They blow people up. Look what they did in San Bernardino.Look at the attack they inspired in Philadelphia, that the White House still refuses to link to terror, where a guy basically shot a police officer three times.He told the police, \u201cI did it because I was inspired by ISIS,\u201d and to this day, the White House still refuses to acknowledge it had anything to do with terror.Look, the threat we face from ISIS is unprecedented. There has never been a jihadist group like this. They have affiliates in over a dozen countries now.They are the best funded radical jihadist group in the history of the world, and they have shown a sophisticated understanding of the laws of other countries on how to insert fighters into places, and they are actively plotting to attack us here at home and around the world.We must keep America safe from this threat. And yes, when I am president of the United States, if there is some place in this country where radical jihadists are planning to attack the United States, we will go after them wherever they are, and if we capture them alive, they are going to Guantanamo.(APPLAUSE)PAUL: (inaudible).KELLY: Senator Paul, do you agree with that? We\u2019re gonna close down mosques, we\u2019re gonna close down diners where we think radical thinking\u2019s (ph) occurring? (CROSSTALK)PAUL: Yeah (ph), no, I think that\u2019s a \u2014 that\u2019s a huge mistake, to be closing down mosques. But I would say that if you want to defend the country, it begins with border security. And this is where I\u2019ve had my disagreement with Senator Rubio.When he brought forward the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d bill to give citizenship to those who came here illegally, I put forward an amendment that says we should have more scrutiny on those who are coming as students, those who are coming as immigrants, those who are coming as refugees, because we had two refugees come to my town in Bowling Green and try to attack us.Marco opposed this because they made a deal. He made a deal with Chuck Schumer that he would oppose any conservative amendments. And I think that\u2019s a mistake, and I just don\u2019t think Marco can have it both ways. You can\u2019t be in favor of defend us...(BELL RINGS)... against Islam \u2014 radical Islam \u2014 if you\u2019re not for border security.RUBIO: Might I respond?(APPLAUSE)The first thing \u2014 I don\u2019t know of anyone who\u2019s not in favor of fully vetting people that are trying to come into this country, other than perhaps Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. I think we all support that. Rand\u2019s amendment was not the right way to do it.I do believe that people who are trying to come to the United States \u2014 this country has a right to know who they are and why they are coming. And that\u2019s why I\u2019ve been clear, when I am the president of the United States of America, we don\u2019t know who you are, and we don\u2019t know why you\u2019re trying to come to the United States, you are not going to get in, because the radical threat that we now face from ISIS is extraordinary and unprecedented...(BELL RINGS)... and when I\u2019m president, we are keeping ISIS out of America.KELLY: Governor Christie, let\u2019s talk about profiling.(APPLAUSE)In December...CHRISTIE: Talk about what? I...KELLY: ... profiling. Profiling. In December, two radical Muslims killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California. Neighbors of the terrorists said that they did not report the couple to law enforcement prior to the crime, because they were afraid that they would be accused of profiling.Now, you have said that we should not profile. How do you square that with the San Bernardino case?CHRISTIE: Well, because you can do it without profiling, Megyn, when you do it on the facts. What those facts knew was that these folks had weapons. They knew that they were talking about trying to take our country and attack it.That\u2019s not profiling, that\u2019s law enforcement. And that\u2019s the difference between somebody who knows how to do this and somebody who\u2019s never done it before.KELLY: They didn\u2019t know they were going to attack the country.CHRISTIE: They knew they were talking about the issues of attacking people, Megyn. They knew that.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: That\u2019s not true. The neighbors said they saw men going in and out of the garage. They saw packages being delivered. They saw Muslims, and they did not think that was enough to call the cops. Do you?CHRISTIE: Listen, I think that what people should do is use their common sense. And the fact is, let law enforcement make those decisions. I\u2019ve told people that from the time I was U.S. attorney 13 years ago.It\u2019s not for them to make those decisions about whether or not something is legal or illegal, or profiling or not. You see something that\u2019s suspicious, you call law enforcement and let law enforcement make those decisions.That\u2019s what should be done. That can be done. That can be done without profiling people. What that is, is just common sense. They thought something was wrong.And here\u2019s the problem in this country right now. The problem is that Barack Obama has made law enforcement the enemy, Hillary Clinton has made law enforcement the enemy.They\u2019re not supporting our law enforcement officers, it\u2019s making everybody nervous to get out of their cars, if you\u2019re a law enforcement officer. It\u2019s making... (BELL RINGS)CHRISTIE: ... everybody nervous to get out of their cars if you\u2019re a law enforcement officer.(BELL RINGS)It\u2019s making people in neighborhoods nervous to go to law enforcement. As president, I will support law enforcement and we\u2019ll stop radical terrorist attacks in this country by supporting our intelligence community and law enforcement community.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Dr. Carson, this week a female Muslim who served in the U.S. Air Force asked Hillary Clinton the question, she asked whether the United States is still the best place in which to raise her three Muslim children. Given what she perceives as a rise in Islamaphobia in this country. Do you think the GOP messaging on Muslims has stoked the flames of bias on this as the Democrats suggest, and how would you answer this veteran?CARSON: Well, I don\u2019t know about the GOP messaging, but I can tell you about my messaging. You know, need to stop allowing political correctness to dictate our policies, because it\u2019s going to kill us if we don\u2019t.(APPLAUSE)CARSON: And in the Holy Land Foundation trial in 2006 in Texas, they had a memorandum, an explanatory memorandum that talked about the fact that Americans would be easy to overcome and to commit civilization jihad because they were going to be trying to protect the rights of the very people who were trying to subvert them.But I believe in the Teddy Roosevelt philosophy. Teddy Roosevelt said, we are a nation of immigrants. As such, everybody is welcome from any race, any country, any religion, if they want to be Americans. If they want to accept our values and our laws. If not, they can stay where they are.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Governor Kasich, stand back. You appear to back in another debate, a so-called back door to encrypted cell phone technology, which protects most smartphones that we all have from hacking. And it includes our phones and it also protects the cell phones of the terrorist.Now the tech companies and a group of MIT scientists, smart guys, right, warn that if they create a way for the FBI to have a back door into our encrypted communications, then the bad guys will exploit it too. And they say that this is going to cause more security problems than it would solve for everyday Americans. Are they wrong?KASICH: Well, look the Joint Terrorism Task Force needs resources and tools. And those are made up of the FBI, state and local law enforcement. And Megyn, it\u2019s best not to talk anymore about back doors and encryption, it will get solved, but it needs to be solved in the situation of the White House with the technology folks.MEGYN: But this is public testimony.KASICH: But I just have to tell you that it\u2019s best with some of these things not be said. Now I want to go back something. See, I was there when Reagan rebuilt the military. I was there in \u201989 when the wall came tumbling down because we were strong.And I was there when we went into the Gulf War. We didn\u2019t win that war just from the air, we won that war by assembling a group of Arab leaders who stood in the Rose Garden and stood with America. We want to destroy ISIS, it has to be in the air and on the ground. It has to be with our friends in the Arab world and our friends in Europe, the coalition that we had when we went to the first Gulf War.And then when we win that, and we will win that against ISIS as it settles down, and we should leave. Because we shouldn\u2019t be policemen of the world. But what we need to do is turn it over to the regional powers to be able to handle that.KASICH: But we have a unique time in America to connect with people all around the world that understand that there\u2019s an existential threat against all of them, the Arabs, the Jordanians, the Saudis, the Egyptians, our friends in Europe, including the Turks. So we have a unique opportunity to bring everybody together.I saw Reagan do it, I\u2019ve seen other presidents do it. And frankly, if you want to be commander in chief, you have to have the experience. At the same time we\u2019re doing all that, the Pentagon must be reformed so we get what we need for our men and women in uniform. All of that together, we\u2019re going to be just fine and America is going to continue to lead the world.KELLY: Governor, thank you.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Governor Bush, just today, a wounded warrior organization designed to help wounded veterans and their families is coming under fire for raising tens of millions of dollars, but spending almost half of that on travel and hotels and dinners and luxury, lavish conferences. So taking care of veterans is obviously a huge issue in the country that has asked so many to serve and sacrifice so much.If you were president. would you police these charity organizations that say they\u2019re helping vets?BUSH: Of course. And there\u2019s all sorts of ways that can be done at the state, local and federal level to do that. But the first duty of the next president of the United States is to fix the mess at the Department of Veterans Affairs. That\u2019s his first responsibility.(APPLAUSE)Look, we have waiting lists for veterans that are \u2014 that are leaving because of the sequester where we\u2019re gutting the military. More and more military personnel are leaving becoming veterans, and the waiting list grows. They\u2019ve given out $140 million of bonuses to Veterans Department employees, including reducing the waiting lists, without giving veterans care. People died, and only three people have been fired.I will make sure that we fire the sheer incompetence inside the Department of Veterans Affairs and then we\u2019ll give veterans a choice card so that they don\u2019t have to travel hours and hours to get care if they want to go to their private provider. You want to make the Veterans Administration do a better job, give them \u2014 give veterans choices and you\u2019ll get a much better result. And as it relates to all the other organizations, let me give you a good example.In Houston, Texas, there\u2019s an organization in place because someone acted on their heart, wanted to make sure that there\u2019s no homeless veterans in Houston. And they\u2019ve come pretty close to that without federal government assistance. We need to mobilize the entire country to treat our veterans and treat them with much more respect than they get today.BAIER: Governor Bush, thank you.(APPLAUSE)Speaking of veterans, we have a question from a veteran who is one of the top Youtube creators. Over the course of the evening, gentlemen, we will hear from some of Youtube\u2019s most followed stars. And here\u2019s one of them.QUESTION: I\u2019m Mark Watson. I\u2019m known for my (inaudible) views on Youtube, but I\u2019m also a veteran who served in the Army for eight years.As an African-American living near Ferguson, I\u2019ve seen the strain between police officers and the communities they serve firsthand. Now, there are great tools like body cameras that \u2014 to protect both officers and citizens, but we all currently have better cameras in our pockets than in our precincts. Why aren\u2019t we using the technology available to better protect our communities?BAIER: Senator Paul, that question to you.PAUL: You know, I\u2019ve supported legislation to allow body cameras. I\u2019ve been to Ferguson, I\u2019ve been trying to look for solutions to our criminal justice problem.One thing I discovered in Ferguson was that a third of the budget for the city of Ferguson was being reaped by civil fines. People were just being fined to death. Now you and I and many of the people in this audience, if we get a $100 fine, we can survive it. If you\u2019re living on the edge of poverty and you get a $100 fine or your car towed, a lot of times you lose your job.I also think the war on drugs has disproportionately affected our African-American community, and what we need to do is make sure that the war on drugs is equal protection under the law and that we don\u2019t unfairly incarcerate another generation of young African-American males.In Ferguson, for every 100 African-American women, there are only 60 African-American men. Drug use is about equal between white and black, but our prisons \u2014 three out of four people in prison are black or brown. I think something has to change. I think it\u2019s a big thing that our party needs to be part of, and I\u2019ve been a leader in Congress on trying to bring about criminal justice reform.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Senator Paul, thank you.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Welcome back, everybody. We are live in Des Moines, Iowa. And let\u2019s get right back to the questions \u2014 Bret.BAIER: Thank you, Megyn.Gentlemen, I\u2019ll ask you some questions about federal spending and the role of the federal government. Everybody always said they want to cut federal spending and usually they start by saying they\u2019ll cut waste, fraud, and abuse, but that really doesn\u2019t ever materialize. We all know that.Governor Christie, you talk a lot about entitlement reform and you say that that\u2019s where the federal government can get savings needed to balance the budget. But can you name even one thing that the federal government does now that it should not do at all?CHRISTIE: Yes. You want one?(LAUGHTER)BAIER: I want one. Yes.(LAUGHTER)CHRISTIE: How about one that I\u2019ve done in New Jersey for the last six years. That\u2019s get rid of Planned Parenthood funding from the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Anything bigger than that?CHRISTIE: Bigger than that? Let me tell you something, when you see thousands upon thousands upon thousands of children being murdered in the womb, I can\u2019t think of anything better than that.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: And, Governor, I realize everyone on this stage opposes Obamacare and you\u2019re not alone. Google Data shows that in the last month when people searched \u201cpolicy repeals,\u201d that there were a lot of them. Obamacare took the top two spots. But today there are millions of people who gained health insurance from Obamacare and they now rely on it.So the question, Senator Cruz, if you repeal Obamacare, as you say you will, will you be fine if millions of those people don\u2019t have health insurance? And what is your specific plan for covering the uninsured?CRUZ: Sure. Well, let\u2019s take it one at a time. First of all, we have seen now in six years of Obamacare that it has been a disaster. It is the biggest job-killer in this country. Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work, have lost their health insurance, have lost their doctors, have seen their premiums skyrocket.If I\u2019m elected president, we will repeal every word of Obamacare. (APPLAUSE)CRUZ: Now, once that is done, everyone agrees we need healthcare reform. It should follow the principles of expanding competition, empowering patients, and keeping government from getting in between us and our doctors.Three specific reforms that reflect those principles. Number one, we should allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines. That will create a true 50-state national marketplace which will drive down the cost of low-cost, catastrophic health insurance.Number two, we should expand health savings accounts so people can save in a tax-advantaged way for more routine healthcare needs. And number three, we should work to de-link health insurance from employment so if you lose your job, your health insurance goes with you and it is personal, portable and affordable.And I\u2019ll tell you, Bret, I think that\u2019s a much more attractive vision for healthcare than the Washington-drive, top-down Obamacare that is causing so many millions of people to hurt.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Senator Cruz, thank you.Governor Bush, you\u2019ve advocated for statehood for Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rican economy is collapsing under unsustainable debt burden. Only about 1 million of its 4 million residents are currently employed. So should American citizens who you say are already overtaxed, bail out Puerto Rico as well?BUSH: No, they shouldn\u2019t. And I believe that Puerto Rico ought to have the right of self-determination. If I was a Puerto Rican, I\u2019d vote for statehood so that they have full citizenship. They serve in the military. They would have to pay federal taxes. They would \u2014 they would accept the responsibilities of full U.S. citizenship. But they should have the right of determine \u2014 self-determination.Before you get to that, though, Puerto Rico is going to have to deal with the structural problems they face. You know, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a fact that if you can pay for a $79 one-way ticket to Orlando, and you can escape the challenges of a declining economy and high crime rates, you move to Orlando.And a lot of people are doing that. And the spiraling out-of- control requires Puerto Rico to make structural reforms. The federal government can play a role in allowing them to do that, but they should not \u2014 the process of statehood or the status of Puerto Rico won\u2019t be solved until we get to the bigger issue of how you deal with the structural economic problems they\u2019re facing right now.BAIER: Governor Kasich, you\u2019re one of two remaining sitting governors still in the race. Your colleague, Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan is under fire \u2014 he and his administration \u2014 for the Flint, Michigan water crisis and the botched response to it. How would you have handled that?KASICH: Well, you\u2019ve got to be on top of it right away. And, you know, I don\u2019t know all the details of what Rick Snyder has done. I know there have been people who have been fired; people who are being held accountable. But the fact is, every single engine of government has to move when you see a crisis like that.And I\u2019ve had many situations in the state of Ohio where we\u2019ve had to move, whether it\u2019s storms, whether it was a horrible school shooting. There are many crises that come \u2014 a water crisis in Toledo. You\u2019ve got to be on top of it. You\u2019ve got to go the extra mile. You\u2019ve got to work with local communities and you\u2019ve got to work with the federal government.Because you realize that people depending on you. And so, you go the extra mile. But people have to be alert. They have to be alert to problems. And when you see a problem, you must act quickly to get on top of it. And people at home are saying they\u2019ve got a problem, listen to them. Because most of the time, they\u2019re absolutely correct.So the fact is that we work for the people. The people don\u2019t work for us. And we have to have an attitude when we\u2019re in government of serving-hood. That\u2019s what really matters. We serve you. You don\u2019t serve us. We listen to you and \u2014 and then we act.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Senator Rubio, on the issue of climate change, in 2008, you wanted Florida to get ahead of other states and establish a cap- and-trade system, a program for carbon emissions, which many Republicans thought at the time would hurt the Florida economy. Now, you\u2019re a skeptic of climate change science. And in fact, you warn that federal efforts to fight climate change will cost U.S. jobs and hurt the U.S. economy.So why the change?RUBIO: Well, Bret, first that\u2019s not entirely the story. At the time, the liberal governor of Florida, who claimed he was a Republican \u2014 his name was Charlie Crist \u2014 he wanted to impose cap-and-trade on Florida. And I opposed it. I was the first person out of the box that opposed him on it.And then we saw that the leading candidates for president at the time, both the Republican and the Democrats, all supported it. And what we said is, if they\u2019re going to impose this on us, we better prepare to protect the state from it. But I have never supported cap- and-trade and I never thought it was a good idea. And I was clear about that at the time.And I do not believe it\u2019s a good idea now. I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment. And especially what these programs are asking us to pass that will do nothing to help the environment, but will be devastating for our economy.When I am president of the United States of America, there will never be any cap-and-trade in the United States.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Thanks, Senator.KELLY: All right. We\u2019re going to move on. Because coming up, immigration, and something you\u2019ve never seen before.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.Stay tuned, right after this break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Welcome back everyone. Live, in Des Moines, Iowa. Now, we move onto the topic of immigration. Senator Rubio, we\u2019ll start with you. When you ran for Senate in 2010, you made clear that you opposed legalization and citizenship for illegal immigrants. You promised repeatedly that you would oppose it as a U.S. Senator as well. Here are just a few examples. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUBIO: Never support. Never have and never will support any effort to grant blanket legalization amnesty to folks who have entered, or stayed in this country illegally.(END VIDEO CLIP)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUBIO: First of all, earned path to citizenship is basically code for amnesty. It\u2019s what they call it. And, the reality of it is this, it is unfair to the people that have legally entered this country to create an alternative for individuals who entered illegally, and knowingly did so.(END VIDEO CLIP)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUBIO: You cannot grant amnesty. If the American people see us granting amnesty they will never again believe in legal immigration. They will never again support it, and that\u2019s wrong for our country, bad for our future.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Within two years of getting elected you were co-sponsoring legislation to create a path to citizenship, in your words, amnesty. Haven\u2019t you already proven that you cannot be trusted on this issue?RUBIO: No, because if you look at the quote, and it\u2019s very specific. And, it says blanket amnesty, I do not support blanket amnesty...KELLY: ... But, you went on from there...RUBIO: ... I do not support amnesty...KELLY: ... You said more than that, Senator...RUBIO: ... No, I said I do not support blanket amnesty...KELLY: ... You said earned path to citizenship is basically code for amnesty. You...RUBIO: ... It was...KELLY: ... supported earned path to citizenship...RUBIO: ... It absolutely has been, and at the time in the context of that was in 2009, and 2010, where the last effort for legalization was an effort done in the Senate. It was an effort led by several people that provided almost an instant path with very little obstacles moving forward.What I\u2019ve always said is that this issue does need to be solved. They\u2019ve been talking about this issue for 30 years, and nothing ever happens. And, I\u2019m going to tell you exactly how we\u2019re going to deal with it when I am president.Number one, we\u2019re going to keep ISIS out of America. If we don\u2019t know who you are, or why you\u2019re coming, you will not get into the United States.RUBIO: Number two, we\u2019re going to enforce our immigration laws. I am the son and grandson of immigrants. And I know that securing our borders is not anti-immigrant and we will do it.We\u2019ll hire 20,000 new border agents instead of 20,000 new IRS agents. We will finish the 700 miles of fencing and walls our nation needs. We\u2019ll have mandatory E-verify, a mandatory entry/exit tracking system and until all of that is in place and all of that is working and we can prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control, nothing else is going to happen.We are not going to round up and deport 12 million people, but we\u2019re not going to hand out citizenship cards, either. There will be a process. We will see what the American people are willing to support. But it will not be unconstitutional executive orders like the ones Barack Obama has forced on us.KELLY: Governor Bush, do you agree Senator Rubio has not reversed himself on his immigration promise?BUSH: Well, I\u2019m kind of confused because he was the sponsor of the Gang of Eight bill that did require a bunch of thresholds but ultimately allowed for citizenship over an extended period of time. I mean, that\u2019s a fact. And he asked me to support that. And I \u2014 I supported him because I think people, when you\u2019re elected, you need to do things.And he led the charge to finally fix this immigration problem that has existed now for, as Marco says, for 30 years. And then he cut and run because it wasn\u2019t popular amongst conservatives, I guess.Here\u2019s what I believe. And I wrote a book about this called Immigration Wars. You can get it at $2.99 on Amazon. It\u2019s not a bestseller. I can promise you.(LAUGHTER)There won\u2019t be any \u2014 you can get it. It\u2019s affordable for everybody. We should have a path to legal status for the 12 million people that are here illegally. It means, come out from the shadows, pay a fine, earn legal status by working, by paying taxes, learning English. Not committing crimes and earn legal status where you\u2019re not cutting in front of the line for people that are patiently waiting outside.(APPLAUSE) I think that is the \u2014 I think that\u2019s the conservative consensus pragmatic approach to how to solve this problem.RUBIO: May I respond?KELLY: Go ahead, senator.RUBIO: It\u2019s interesting that Jeb mentions the book. That\u2019s the book where you changed your position on immigration because you used to support a path to citizenship.BUSH: So did you.(LAUGHTER)RUBIO: Well, but you changed the \u2014 in the book...BUSH: Yeah. So did you, Marco.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: You wrote a book where you changed your position from a path of citizenship to a path of legalization. And the bottom line is this, we are not going to be able to do anything on this issue until we first bring illegal immigration under control. The American people have been told for 30 years they\u2019re going to enforce the border, they\u2019re going to build a wall and it never gets built and it never happens.It is very clear there will be no progress on this issue in any way, shape or form, until you prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control. And when I\u2019m president, we are going to bring it under control once and for all after 30 years of talking about it.BUSH: Marco, Marco \u2014 he brought up my name. I have supported a consensus approach to solving this problem wherever it came up. and in 2007 it almost passed when my brother was president of the United States. A bipartisan approach got close. Barack Obama actually had the poison pill to stop it then.And when you led the charge with the Gang of Eight, I supported it because you asked me to. I think it\u2019s important for people in elected office to try to forge consensus to solve problems. There\u2019s never going do be perfect bill.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: All right.BUSH: But when you didn\u2019t do that and you ask people to support, you shouldn\u2019t cut and run.RUBIO: But Megyn...BUSH: You should stick with it and that\u2019s exactly what happened. He cut and run. And that\u2019s a tragedy because now...(BELL RINGS)... it\u2019s harder and harder to actually solve this problem.KELLY: All right. This will be the last one.RUBIO: There\u2019s not going to be consensus on this issue until we enforce our immigration laws. That is abundantly clear. You\u2019re not going to be able to ram down the throat of the American people your approach. The only way we\u2019re are going to be able to move forward after two migratory crises with minor, after two unconstitutional executive orders, the only way forward on this issue is to first bring illegal immigration under control. And until that happens there\u2019s not going to be consensus on this issue.KELLY: OK. Let\u2019s move on. Senator Cruz, when Senator Rubio proposed that bill creating a path to citizenship, you proposed an amendment. It would have allowed for legalization but not citizenship. Yes, it would.Pressed last month on why you supported legalization, you claimed that you didn\u2019t. Right? Like you just did. Saw that.(LAUGHTER)You argued that this was just a poison pill amendment, basically it\u2019s something designed to kill the bill and not actually get it through. But that is not, however, how it sounded at the time. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CRUZ: I want this bill to be voted down. I don\u2019t want immigration reform to fail. I want immigration reform to pass. I believe if this amendment were to pass, the chances of this bill passing into law would increase dramatically.I believe if the amendments I introduced were adopted, that the bill would pass. And my effort in introducing them was to find a solution that reflected common ground and that fixed the problem.CRUZ: If the proponents of this bill actually demonstrate a commitment not to politics, not to campaigning all the time, but to actually fixing this problem, to finding a middle ground. That would fix the problem, and also allow, for those 11 million people who are here illegally, a legal status, with citizenship off the table.KELLY: Was that all an act? It was pretty convincing.CRUZ: You know, the amendment you\u2019re talking about is one sentence \u2014 it\u2019s 38 words. Anyone can go online at tedcruz.org and read exactly what it said. In those 38 words, it said anyone here illegally is permanently ineligible for citizenship. It didn\u2019t say a word about legalization. I introduced...KELLY: But the bill allowed both. The bill you were amending allowed citizenship and legalization.CRUZ: But \u2014 but Megyn, the bill was 1,000 pages. I introduced a series of amendments, each designed to fix problems in the bill. The fact that each amendment didn\u2019t fix every problem didn\u2019t mean that I supported the rest of the bill.And I\u2019ll tell you who supported my amendment \u2014 Jeff Sessions, the strongest opponent of amnesty in the United States Congress. And he did so because taking citizenship off the table was important, and it revealed the hypocrisy of the proponents of this bill, who were looking for votes.(APPLAUSE)... we have the tools in federal law to do this now. We can build the fence. We can triple the border patrol. We can end sanctuary cities by cutting off...(BELL RINGS)... funding to them. We can end welfare for those here illegally. And what is missing is the political will, because too many Democrats and, sadly, too many Republicans don\u2019t want to solve this problem. If I am elected president...(BELL RINGS)... we will secure the border...KELLY: OK, sir.CRUZ: ... and we will end the illegal immigration.KELLY: Senator Paul.(APPLAUSE)You know how Washington works. Do you buy that?PAUL: I was there and I saw the debate. I saw Ted Cruz say, \u201cwe\u2019ll take citizenship off the table, and then the bill will pass, and I\u2019m for the bill.\u201dThe bill would involve legalization. He can\u2019t have it both ways. But what is particularly insulting, though, is that he is the king of saying, \u201cyou\u2019re for amnesty.\u201d Everybody\u2019s for amnesty except for Ted Cruz.But it\u2019s a falseness, and that\u2019s an authenticity problem \u2014 that everybody he knows is not as perfect as him because we\u2019re all for amnesty. I was for legalization. I think, frankly, if you have border security, you can have legalization. So was Ted, but now he says it wasn\u2019t so. That\u2019s not true.KELLY: Go ahead, sir.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: You know, John Adams famously said, \u201cfacts are are stubborn things.\u201d The facts are are very, very simple. When that battle was waged, my friend Senator Rubio chose to stand with Barack Obama and Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer and support amnesty.And I stood alongside Jeff Sessions and Steve King, and we led the fight against amnesty. And if you want to know who\u2019s telling the truth, you should look and ask people like Jeff Sessions and Steve King and Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin, all of whom say, as Jeff Sessions said, responding to these false attacks just recently in Alabama \u2014 he said, \u201cif it wasn\u2019t for Ted Cruz, the Gang of Eight Rubio/Schumer bill would have passed. But because Ted stood up and helped lead the effort, millions rose up to kill it.(BELL RINGS)(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Senator Rubio, even Chuck Schumer, your co-sponsor of that bill...RUBIO: Yeah, but let me respond...KELLY: ... agrees with Ted Cruz on this. RUBIO: ... no, I understand, but let me respond. I (ph) was mentioned on this \u2014 in this answer, and so I\u2019m going to respond this way.This is the lie that Ted\u2019s campaign is built on, and Rand touched upon it \u2014 that he\u2019s the most conservative guy, and everyone else is a \u2014 you know, everyone else is a rhino.The truth is, Ted, throughout this campaign, you\u2019ve been willing to say or do anything in order to get votes. Ted, you worked for George W. Bush\u2019s campaign...(BOOING)You \u2014 you \u2014 you helped design George W. Bush\u2019s \u2014 you helped design George W. Bush\u2019s immigration policy. And then, when you got to the Senate, you did an interview with CBS News \u2014 I (ph) wasn\u2019t even part of the video \u2014 where you said, on the issue of people that are here illegally, \u201cwe can reach a compromise.\u201dAnd then in the committee, you said, \u201cI want to bring people out of the shadows.\u201d(BELL RINGS)Now you want to trump Trump on immigration. But you can\u2019t \u2014 we\u2019re not gonna beat Hillary Clinton with someone who\u2019s willing to say or do anything to win an election.KELLY: Go ahead, Senator Cruz.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: You know, I like Marco. He\u2019s very charming. He\u2019s very smooth. But the facts are simple. When he ran for election in the state of Florida, he told the people of Florida, \u201cif you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty.\u201dWhen I ran in Texas, I told the people of Texas, \u201cif you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty.\u201d We both made the identical promises. But when we came to Washington, we made a different choice.Marco made the choice to go the direction of the major donors \u2014 to support amnesty because he thought it was politically advantageous.(BELL RINGS)I honored my commitments, and as president, I will honor every commitment that I make to the men and women of this country.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: All right.CHRISTIE: Megyn? KELLY: Go ahead, Governor Christie.CHRISTIE: I want to ask the people of the audience. Like, I\u2019m standing here, I \u2014 I watched the video of Senator Cruz. I watched the video of Senator Rubio. I heard what they said. And this is why you need to send someone from outside of Washington to Washington. (APPLAUSE)CHRISTIE: I feel like...(APPLAUSE)... I feel like I need \u2014 I feel like I need a Washington to English dictionary converter, right?(LAUGHTER)I mean, I heard what they both said, I saw it on the video. And the fact is this is what makes a difference when you\u2019re a governor. You can change your mind. Ted can change his mind. Marco can change his mind. It\u2019s perfectly legal in this country to change your mind. But when you\u2019re a governor, you have to admit it. You can\u2019t hide behind parliamentary tricks. That\u2019s the difference, and that\u2019s the kind of leader we need in the White House. Stop the Washington bull and let\u2019s get things done.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Let\u2019s go to a Youtube question. Let\u2019s get to a Youtube question. This is a question from a Youtube creator with over 2 million subscribers. Watch.QUESTION: I\u2019m Dulce Candy, a Youtube creator who immigrated to the United States from Mexico when I was a little girl. Since then, I am proud to say I served in the armed forces in Iraq, became a citizen and I am now an entrepreneur.There are many immigrants who contribute positively to the American economy, but some of the comments in the campaign make us question our place in this country. If America does not seem like a welcoming place for immigrant entrepreneurs, will the American economy suffer?KELLY: Dr. Carson, that\u2019s one \u2014 that one\u2019s for you.CARSON: Oh, great.(LAUGHTER)As I said before, we are a land of immigrants, but we have to be intelligent about the way that we form our immigration policies, and that\u2019s one of the reasons that I have called on us to declare war on the Islamic State because we need to reorient our immigration policies and our visa policies for people who are coming into this country because there are many people out there who want to destroy us.Now, I recognize that the vast majority of people coming in here probably are not those kinds of people, but that\u2019s not good enough. If you\u2019ve got 10 people coming to your house and you know one of them is a terrorist, you\u2019re probably going to keep them all out.You know, we probably have to figure out a way to make sure that we keep America safe.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: Can I \u2014 can I \u2014 I just...KELLY: Go ahead.BUSH: That beautiful young woman who\u2019s an entrepreneur who served in the military, first of all, is deserving of our respect for service in the military and the fact that she\u2019s an entrepreneur.(APPLAUSE)And we should be a welcoming nation. Our identity is not based on race or ethnicity, it\u2019s based on a set of shared values. That\u2019s American citizenship. And Dulce Candy \u2014 a pretty cool name, actually \u2014 that is now an entrepreneur over Youtube is part of that American spirit, and we should celebrate it as conservatives. That\u2019s what we believe in.You can \u2014 you can deal with the threat of terror and also recognize that this country should be aspirational across the board.RUBIO: And I think that\u2019s the false choice...(APPLAUSE)... that\u2019s the \u2014 that\u2019s the false choice in this whole debate about immigration. Of course, we\u2019re going to be a nation of immigrants. By the way, no nation on earth is more generous than America is. Every single year close to a million people emigrate to the United States legally. There\u2019s no nation on earth that comes close to that number.I think the only argument is are we a sovereign country, are we not allowed to choose who comes in, when they come in and how they come in? And that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening now.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: All right.RUBIO: I think the other problem is we have a legal immigration system that\u2019s outdated, it\u2019s primarily based on whether you have family members living here. In the 21st century, it has to be more of a merit-based system, and that is why our legal immigration system is in need of modernization. And we will always celebrate legal immigration like Dulce\u2019s great story.KELLY: All right. We\u2019re moving on.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Gentlemen, we\u2019re going to turn now to what we call electability, issues that you\u2019re either facing in the primaries or issues that you\u2019re certainly going to face in a general election. So you may not be altogether unhappy if you\u2019re not included in this round.(LAUGHTER)Senator Cruz, you pride yourself on standing up to the D.C. cartel, but as we\u2019ve seen to a certain degree tonight, there\u2019s a price for standing up to the D.C. cartel. Thirteen Republican senators have endorsed other candidates, none have endorsed you.You \u2014 twice last year, you asked for a colleague to second a motion, a routine courtesy on the Senate floor, and no senator would do it. Top GOP officials worry that if you\u2019re at the top of the ticket \u2014 some officials \u2014 that not only will you lose the White House, but it will tank the ticket all the way down the line.The question is does your style sometimes get in the way of your ability to get things done, sir?CURZ: Well, Chris, you are exactly right that I am not the candidate of career politicians in Washington. (APPLAUSE)This is a grassroots campaign and, you know, when I ran for senate in Texas, I told the people of Texas that I\u2019m not going there to go along to get along. Washington is broken.And the people I have been accountable to every single day in the Senate are the 27 million Texans who I represent and I made a promise to them that I make to you today, which is, if I am elected, every single day I will do two things: tell the truth, and do what I said I would do.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Thank you.KELLY: Governor bush, poll after poll shows you running among the worst in your party against Hillary Clinton. Even Mitt Romney said that a Bush v. Clinton head-to-head would be too easy for the Democrats.Yet still you and the super PACs supporting you continue to blanket the airwaves with cutting ads, not against Mrs. Clinton, but against your fellow Republicans, especially Senator Rubio.Do these attacks do more harm than good by targeting those candidates who appear to have the best chance of defeating Mrs. Clinton?BUSH: Well, first of all, I\u2019ve seen polls where I\u2019m beating Hillary Clinton pretty regularly.And I believe I can, because I have a proven record, a record of accomplishment, a record of cutting taxes, of shrinking the government, of reforming education, of challenging the status quo, eliminating career civil service protections, shrinking the government workforce by 11 percent, but leading the nation in job growth. That\u2019s the record of accomplishment that should be taken to Hillary Clinton, who has no record of accomplishment. So I\u2019m confident if I win this nomination, I will aggressively go against her and beat her.As it relates to the super PACs, I have no control over that. And this is beanbag compared to what the Clinton hit machine is going to do to the Republican nominee. The simple fact is, we all have a record. It all will be scrutinized. There\u2019s give and take. It\u2019s called the politics. And that\u2019s the way it is.I\u2019m running hard and I believe I\u2019ll be the Republican nominee and I\u2019ll be the one best suited to beat Hillary Clinton, who should not be president of the United States.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Senator Rubio, first before I ask you a question, any response to Governor Bush?RUBIO: Well, I believe, and I know that if Iowa helps make me the Republican nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton. Hillary doesn\u2019t want to run against me, but I cannot wait to run against her. And I cannot wait to earn the opportunity to do it because she cannot be the president of the United States.She wants to put Barack Obama on the Supreme Court of the United States of America. She said that here in Iowa just two days ago. That would be a disaster for this country.So I hope and pray and cannot wait until this state and others give me an opportunity to serve this party as its nominee because I will defeat Hillary Clinton.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)BAIER: Now let\u2019s talk about electability, Senator. TIME magazine once called you \u201cthe Republican savior.\u201d Rush Limbaugh and others said you likely will be president some day.But if you look at the recent average of polls in your home state of Florida, you\u2019re in third trailing Donald trump by 24 points. If the people who know you best have you there, why should the rest of the country elect you?RUBIO: Well, let me be clear about one thing, there\u2019s only one savior and it\u2019s not me. It\u2019s Jesus Christ who came down to earth and died for our sins.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: And so \u2014 and I\u2019ve always made that clear about that cover story.As far as the polls are concerned, Iowa, on Monday night you\u2019re going to go to a caucus site and you\u2019ll be the first Americans that vote in this election. You will be the first Americans that get to answer the fundamental question, what comes next for this country after seven disastrous years of Barack Obama?And let me tell you what the answer better not be. It better not be Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders is a socialist. I think Bernie Sanders is good candidate for president of Sweden.(LAUGHTER)We don\u2019t want to be Sweden. We want to be the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)And Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being the commander-in-chief of the United States. In fact, one of her first acts as president may very well be to pardon herself because Hillary Clinton...(LAUGHTER)Hillary Clinton stored classified information on her private server. And Hillary Clinton lied to the families of those four brave Americans who lost their life in Benghazi. And anyone who lies to the families of Americans who have died in the service of this country can never be commander-in-chief of the United States.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Thank you, Senator.WALLACE: Governor Christie, two of your former top aides go on trial in May for fraud and conspiracy in the \u201cBridge-gate\u201d case, the politically motivated closure of lanes to the George Washington Bridge.Another former aide who has already pleaded guilty and will likely testify for the government, as you know, says that you knew about this whole deal. Can the GOP take the chance of nominating you with this scandal still out there, sir?CHRISTIE: Sure, because there has been three different investigations and proven that I knew nothing. And the fact is that what I did do, what I did do from the beginning, Chris, as soon as I found out about it, I fired the people who were responsible. And that\u2019s what you expect from a leader.CHRISTIE: And, I\u2019ll tell you something else. I inherited a state in New Jersey that was downtrodden, and beaten by liberal democratic policies, high taxation, high regulation. And, this year, in 2015, New Jersey\u2019s had the best year of job growth that our state has ever had in the last 15 years. That\u2019s because we\u2019ve put conservative policies in place.And, I\u2019ll tell you one other thing, you know why the Republican party will want to take a chance on me? Because they know that Hillary Clinton will never be prosecuted by this justice department, and they\u2019re going to want to put a former federal prosecutor on the stage to prosecute her next September. And, there is no one on this stage better prepared to prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton than I am.I will be ready. I will take her on, and when I take her on I guarantee you one thing, she will never get within 10 miles of the White House. The days for the Clintons in public housing are over.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Welcome back, everybody. Let\u2019s get back to the questions. Chris?WALLACE: Gentlemen, almost 60% of Republican caucus-goers identify themselves as Evangelicals, so I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes exploring social issues.Governor Kasich, you talk a good deal about your faith. In fact, you say it played a role in your decision to expand Medicaid, and you say that when you meet Saint Peter at the Pearly Gates, he\u2019s going to ask what you did for the poor, not what you did to keep government small.Senator Cruz is on the opposite side of this issue from you, so does that mean that you\u2019re getting in and he isn\u2019t?(LAUGHTER)KASICH: No. You know, Chris, here\u2019s what happened with Medicaid in my state. We took the growth of Medicaid from over 10 percent in my second budget to 2.5 percent, without cutting off one person or cutting one benefit, because we \u2014 we innovated the government.And now mom and dad can stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home. And then we decided we could bring $14 billion of our money \u2014 I mean, Washington doesn\u2019t have any money. It was our money, and we brought them back to tend to the mentally ill. Because I don\u2019t think they ought to live in prison or live under a bridge; to treat the drug-addicted so they\u2019re not in an in-and-out-of- the-door policy out of the prisons; and to help the working poor so they don\u2019t live in emergency rooms.How has it worked? Well, we have treated the drug-addicted in our prisons and we released them in to the community, and our recidivism rate is less than 20 percent. That\u2019s basically bordering on a miracle because of our great prison director. The mentally ill? They\u2019ve been stepped on for too long in this society, and we are beginning to treat them.In terms of my faith, look, all I say is that when I study scripture, I know that people who live in the shadows need to have a chance. But I\u2019m not deciding that anybody\u2019s got to make these decisions the way that I do, on the basis of what I do. But what \u2014 I will tell you this. The time has come to stop ignoring the mentally ill in this country and begin to treat them and get them on their feet, along with, of course, with treating the drug-addicted.(APPLAUSE)Because we don\u2019t want them in and out \u2014 we don\u2019t want them in and out of the prisons. Give people a chance. We talked about criminal justice reform. We\u2019ve enacted it in our state. Look, the conservative message is economic growth and along with economic growth goes opportunity for everybody in America. Everybody ought to have a chance to be able to rise to their God-given purpose.And that is what we have done in Ohio. We\u2019re running surpluses. We\u2019re up 400,000 jobs. And guess what? The formula is working. I\u2019d suggest people take a look at it.Thank you.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Gentlemen, we had a case study on religious liberty just this last summer. A county clerk in Kentucky named Kim Davis refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples after the Supreme Court ruling, saying that it violated her religious beliefs.Governor Christie, you said that she must follow the law or be moved to another job that would be in keeping with her conscience. But some conservatives say that that violates her religious liberty.CHRISTIE: No, what I said, Chris, was that the law needs to be followed. And that someone in that office has to do their job. So if Ms. Davis wanted to step aside and get rid of her ability to be able to do that, there should be someone else in that office who it didn\u2019t violate their conscience so they could follow the law of the state of Kentucky.I never said that Ms. Davis should either lose her job or that she had to do it. But what I did say was that the person who came in for the license needed to get it. And so if there\u2019s someone in that organization, and it turns out there was, who was willing to be able to do that, that\u2019s what we should do.But just as importantly, and I agree with what John said. You know, we all have our own individual interpretations of our faith. And here\u2019s the problem with what\u2019s going on around the world. The radical Islamic jihadists, what they want to do is impose their faith upon each and every one of us \u2014 every one of us. And the reason why this war against them is so important is that very basis of religious liberty.They want everyone in this country to follow their religious beliefs the way they do. They do not want us to exercise religious liberty. That\u2019s why as commander in chief, I will take on ISIS, not only because it keeps us safe, but because it allows us to absolutely conduct our religious affairs the way we find in our heart and in our souls. As a Catholic, that\u2019s what I want to do. And no matter what your faith is, that\u2019s what I want you to be able to do.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Thank you, sir.Senator Rubio, during the last debate, you said Governor Christie had changed his position and his mind on gun control, on common core, and backing President Obama\u2019s nomination of Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court. He said you\u2019re wrong on the facts and you can\u2019t, quote, \u201cslime your way to the White House.\u201d I assume in the last two weeks, you\u2019ve done some fact-checking. Do you want to take anything back?It is not because of the tax writeoff. It is because in this nation, we are influenced by Judeo-Christian values that teach us to care for the less fortunate, to reach out to the needy, to love our neighbor. This is what\u2019s made our nation so special.And you should hope that our next president is someone that is influence by their faith. Because if your faith causes you to care for the less fortunate, it is something you want to see in your public figures. And when I\u2019m president, I can tell you this, my faith will not just influence the way I\u2019ll govern as president, it will influence the way I live my life.RUBIO: Because in the end, my goal is not simply to live on this earth for 80 years, but to live an eternity with my creator. And I will always allow my faith to influence everything I do.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Thank you, senator.Senator Paul, in May on the campaign trail you, said you didn\u2019t get into politics to fight about abortion. You said you were more concerned about the national debt. Your answer is to turn abortion back to the states the way it was before Roe v. Wade.Does that mean that if a liberal state, let\u2019s say, wants to make abortion legal, that you\u2019re okay with that and what do you say to conservative voters who believe deeply that abortion is murder?PAUL: You know, I think abortion is always wrong. I\u2019ve supported a variety of solutions, both state as well as federal. In fact, just last week, I introduced the Life at Conception act, which would say that the 14th amendment would defend an individual even in the womb.But I think on the broader question of religion and politics, you know, I think liberty, itself requires a virtue \u2014 requires a virtuous people. In fact, Washington said that democracy requires a virtuous people.Oz Guinness, the theologian, said that liberty requires restraint but the only restraint consistent with liberty is self-restraint. There\u2019s a lot packed into that statement. But the bottom line is we must have virtue, we must have a religious bearing as a nation. The government is not always going to save us and it\u2019s not always going to come from government.But if we don\u2019t know right and wrong, I think we have lost our way. I think we become unmoored and I think without the religious foundation that guides us all, I think we have a great risk of going horribly in the wrong direction.WALLLACE: Sir, just 30 seconds to answer my specific...(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Just 30 seconds to answer my specific question. Do you favor the idea that abortion should be a states\u2019 rights issue and if a liberal state wants to make it legal, that that\u2019s their choice? Yes or no?PAUL: Both. No, both the federal and a state approach. I have said that we could leave it to the states but I\u2019ve also introduced a federal solution as well. So the federal solution would be the Life at Conception act which is an act that would federalize the issue.But I\u2019ve also said for the most part, these issues would be left back to the states. So there might be an occasion if we did overturn Roe v. Wade \u2014 Roe v. Wade nationalized the issue. If you had the court reverse Roe v. Wade, it would become a state issue once again.I think it would be better the more \u2014 the less abortions we have, so the more states that we have that made abortion illegal, the better, as far as trying to save and preserve lives.WALLACE: Thank you, sir.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Gentlemen.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: I\u2019d like to ask you a few questions about foreign policy broadly.Dr. Carson, many experts believe Russian leader Vladimir Putin has greater ideas, bigger designs for the region beyond Russia\u2019s actions inside Ukraine. Fast forward to February 2017 and it is President Carson, and Russian uniformed commandos cross the Estonian border and they occupy a city in Estonia. Estonia, a member of NATO, essentially invokes Article IV, an attack on one is an attack on all. What do you do?CARSON: Look, first of all, I recognize that Vladimir Putin is an opportunist and he\u2019s a bully, and we have to face him down. And I would \u2014 first of all, face him down in that whole region, the whole Baltic region. I think we need to put in some armored brigades there. We only have one or two. We need much more than that. We need to be doing military exercises if not only Estonia but Latvia and Lithuania. They\u2019re terrified by the saber rattling. I think we ought to put in our missile defense system.I think we ought to give Ukraine offensive weapons and I think we ought to fight them on the economic basis because Putin is a one- horse country: oil and energy. And we ought to fight them on that level.We ought to be helping in terms of the technology for fracking, keeping the price low, quite frankly, because that\u2019s what\u2019s keeping him contained. So, yes, I\u2019d absolutely would go in if he attacked. I think on Article IV of NATO, we would definitely protect all of our allies.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Gentlemen, you\u2019ve all said that the Iran nuclear deal is a bad one.Senator Rubio, you were among the candidates who\u2019ve said you would tear it up on day one. But as you know, Iran has already received tens of millions of dollars \u2014 tens of billions of dollars in this deal and has quickly reestablished ties economically with Europe.The major concessions, in other words, are up front in this deal. So should you win by the time you take office, the remaining parts of the deal would be the constraints on Iran. So why blow up those constraints on day one, letting Iran off the hook?RUBIO: Well, let me first describe Iran because they\u2019re not just a normal nation state. And we have no quarrel with the Iranian people. But the Iranian leader, their supreme leader is a radical Shia cleric who has an apocalyptic vision of the future. RUBIO: He views himself not simply as the leader of Iran, but as the leader of all Muslims \u2014 all Shia Muslims on the planet. And they have a desire not simply to conquer the Middle East and to become the dominant power in that region, but ultimately to be able to hold America hostage.That is why they\u2019re building an \u2014 right now, developing long- range missiles capable of reaching the United States, and that is why there\u2019s going \u2014 they\u2019re going to use those $100 billion to expand their conventional capabilities and to one day buy or build a nuclear weapon.We will \u2014 when I am president of the United States, on my first day in office, we are canceling the deal with Iran, and nations will have to make a choice. They can do business with Iran, or they can do business with America, and I am very confident they\u2019re going to choose America before they choose the Iranian economy.BAIER: Governor Kasich, you\u2019ve said that Marco Rubio is wrong...(APPLAUSE)... that Senator Rubio is wrong with tearing it up on day one.KASICH: Look, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in ten months. And if I were president of the United States right now, I\u2019d be lining up our allies to say that, if one crossed T or one dotted I does not occur, they are \u2014 violate the agreement, we slap back on sanctions.We can slap on sanctions alone, on day one, but it\u2019s not gonna be anywhere near as effective. But the president needs to be laying the groundwork right now for the ability to slap those sanctions back on worldwide.And I\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019m worried about \u2014 I\u2019m worried about money. You read about all the companies now that are doing business \u2014 about to do business in Iran, and if we don\u2019t get this settled now, with other countries in the world, about sanctions, then Iran could violate that agreement, and we\u2019re the only ones putting the sanctions on.We need to move aggressively now. But I would say this to you, Bret. Number one, if they violate it, we need to move against them. And number two, if we find out they\u2019re developing a nuclear weapon and we know how to get to it, we\u2019re gonna go take it out. That is what we have to do. We cannot let things get farther down the road, like we did with North Korea.BAIER: But Governor Kasich, you know that the most powerful sanctions are the multilateral ones.KASICH: That\u2019s right. Yes.BAIER: And these European countries are already reestablishing these ties.KASICH: I know, Bret.BAIER: They don\u2019t want...KASICH: But Bret, here\u2019s the problem. You take a look at the \u2014 at Belgium. I talked to a diplomat from Belgium. I said, \u201chow\u2019s it going?\u201d He said, \u201cwe have the military in the streets right now. We never dreamt we\u2019d ever see it.\u201dSee, I think there is an opportunity to bring the world together. The Turks are being threatened. We know about the French. We know about the Belgians. We know about the Brits. Everybody is under fire and under attack, and we have to stand together as an alliance.So actually, the opportunity is there, because of the threat to all of these countries, to bring all of us together...(BELL RINGS)... and say there is something more important than money. It is the future of the world and the future of our children and grandchildren. That\u2019s the kind of leadership this country needs. It has not been in effect during the administration of Barack Obama.And that\u2019s only the beginning of the failures that they have committed, not only in the Middle East, but all over the world, including Russia and China.BAIER: Governor, thank you. Governor Christie...(APPLAUSE)... Libya is the newest base for ISIS. Just today, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said ISIS is consolidating their footprint there and also setting up training facilities.So if you were president, would you deploy U.S. troops to Libya to take out ISIS there?CHRISTIE: Bret, let me tell you, this is another one of those places where Hillary Clinton has so much to answer for, and why she is completely unqualified to be commander in chief.In a previous Democratic debate, Martha Raddatz, three times, asked Hillary Clinton about the failure in Libya, a policy that she took credit for, and said, \u201cwhat is your measure of responsibility, Madam Secretary, for the failure in Libya?\u201d Three times, she refused to answer the question, because she refuses to be held accountable for anything that goes wrong. If it had gone right, believe me, she would have been running around to be able to take credit for it.Here\u2019s what I\u2019d do. This is about the bigger, broader war against ISIS. We need to bring together our European and our Sunni Arab allies, and we need to develop a strategy together to take on ISIS every place that it is around the world, so that together, all of us can take ISIS out, destroy it, and then move on to come back to our country, protect our homeland security and make sure that the American people are safe.As president of the United States, that is exactly what I will do.BAIER: Thank you, Governor.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Welcome back to Des Moines. Let\u2019s resume the debate. Megyn?KELLY: Senator Paul, you have suggested that former President Bill Clinton\u2019s history with women is fair game in this campaign. How do you answer those who say you don\u2019t hold the sins of the husband against the wife?PAUL: You know, I\u2019ve never really brought this up unless asked the question, but I have responded to the question. I don\u2019t blame Hillary Clinton at all for this. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s responsible for his behavior. But I do think that her position as promoting women\u2019s rights and fairness to women in the workplace, that if what Bill Clinton did any CEO in our country did with an intern, with a 22-year- old, 21-year-old intern in their office, they would be fired. They would never be hired again.(APPLAUSE)Fired, never hired again and probably shunned in their community. And the thing is, she can\u2019t be a champion of women\u2019s rights at the same time she\u2019s got this that is always lurking out there, this type of behavior. So it is difficult.KELLY: Of her husband\u2019s?PAUL: Yeah. But I combine this also with the millions upon millions of dollars they\u2019ve taken from regimes in the Middle East who treat women like cattle.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: We have another question from one of Youtube\u2019s top creators. Here it is.QUESTION: I\u2019m Nabela Noor. I\u2019m a Muslim American born and raised in the U.S. who creates beauty and lifestyle videos on Youtube.In 2015, the number of hate crimes against Muslims in the U.S. has tripled, and on social media, where I spend a lot of time, I\u2019ve seen many attacks directed towards fellow Muslims. This culture of hatred is only driving ISIS to radicalize, recruit and incite violence.As president, what would you do to address this toxic climate and promote increased tolerance in the United States?WALLACE: Governor Bush, how do you answer Nabela?BUSH: Well first of all, I think it\u2019s important that when we\u2019re running for the highest office in the land that we recognize that we\u2019re living in dangerous times and we have to be serious about it, that our words have consequences.Donald Trump, for example \u2014 I\u2019m glad \u2014 I mentioned his name again just if anybody was missing him... (LAUGHTER)BUSH: ... Mr. Trump believed that in reaction to people\u2019s fears that we should ban all Muslims. Well, that creates an environment that\u2019s toxic in our own country. Nobela (ph) is a rising entrepreneur. She wants to pursue the American dream. She\u2019s an American citizen. She should not feel uncomfortable about her citizenship. She\u2019s not the threat. The threat is Islamic terrorism.We need to focus our energies there, not these broad, blanket, kind of statements that will make it harder for us to deal with ISIS. We need to deal with ISIS in the caliphate. We need a strategy to destroy ISIS there. You can\u2019t do that without the cooperation of the Muslim world because they\u2019re as threatened as we are.So, I think it\u2019s important for us to be careful about the language we use, which is why I\u2019ve been critical of Donald Trump. Disparaging women, disparaging hispanics, that\u2019s not a sign of strength. Making fun of disabled people...(BELL RINGING)BUSH: ... We\u2019re never going to win elections if we don\u2019t have a more broader unifying message.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Governor, thank you. Senator Cruz, change of subject. You called for an end to the renewable fuel standards which mandate that refineries blend biofuels, including ethanol into gasoline. As you well know, ethanol\u2019s a big industry in this state, $10 billion dollars a year.Last week, Terry Branstad, the popular Governor of Iowa...(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: ... Who is in the hall tonight, said that you\u2019re bankrolled by big oil, and that Iowa voters would be making a mistake supporting you. Why should those voters side with you over the six- term governor of the state, sir?CRUZ: Well, Chris, I\u2019m glad to discuss my views on ethanol and energy. I think God has blessed this country with enormous natural resources, and we should pursue all of the above. We should be developing oil, and gas, and coal, and nuclear, and wind, and solar, and ethanol, and biofuels. But, I don\u2019t believe that Washington should be picking winners and losers. And, I think there should be no mandates, and no subsidies whatsoever.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: And, indeed, my tax plan that I\u2019ve introduced, it\u2019s available on our website. It\u2019s a simple flat tax for everyone. It\u2019ll produce enormous economic growth, and it eliminates every mandate, every subsidy, so there\u2019s no subsidies for oil and gas, no subsidies for anyone.Now, it is true that there are a bunch of lobbyists, and a bunch of Democrats in this state spending millions of dollars trying to convince the people of Iowa that I somehow oppose ethanol. It\u2019s not true. I have introduced legislation that would phase out the ethanol mandate over five years, but that is in the context of having no mandates whatsoever for anyone.And, I would not that there\u2019s a much more important government regulation to ethanol, and that\u2019s the EPA\u2019s blend wall that makes it illegal to sell mid-level blends of ethanol in gasoline. I will...(BELL RINGING)CRUZ: ... Tear down the EPA\u2019s blend wall which will enable ethanol to expand its market share by up to 60%, all without mandates. All without any government mandates whatsoever through the marketplace. And, I\u2019ll note finally, Chris, there is a reason that Iowa\u2019s Congressman Steve King, perhaps the fiercest defender of farmers in this state, is sharing my campaign. Because he understands that I\u2019m committed to a fair, and level playing field for every energy source without lobbyists, and without Washington picking winners and losers.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Dr. Carson, I\u2019d like to ask you about exactly that issue. Where are you on the mandatory ethanol standard, and precisely this question. Should government be in the business of picking winners and losers, or should it be left to the market place?CARSON: Well, as anyone knows who\u2019s been listening to me, you know? I\u2019m very much against the government being involved in every aspect of our lives, you know? We last year there was an additional 81,000 pages of government regulations. If you stack that up it would be a three-story building. This is absolutely absurd. And, they\u2019ve insinuated themselves into everything.Now, as far as the renewable fuel standard is concerned, certain promises were made, certain government contracts were issued which extend all the way into the year 2022, and I believe that it\u2019s probably unfair to withdraw the rug because people have invested money. People have invested a lot of energy into that.But, you know, we are blessed with tremendous energy in this nation, and we need to be talking for new sources of energy. Seventy percent of our population lives by costly (ph). What about hydroelectric power? We can develop that, you know? We have so much natural gas now, and we can liquify it, and we can transfer it across the sea so we can make Europe dependent on us instead of Putin \u2014 put him back in his little box where he belongs.CARSON: Those are the kinds of things that we ought to be doing. And, you know, take advantage of the tremendous opportunities in energy that God has given us, not get involved in these little petty arguments.And we can get a lot of them out if we get the government out of our lives.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Doctor, thank you.BAIER: Coming up, closing statements from the candidates as our debate continues, live, from Des Moines, Iowa.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Welcome back, everybody. And now, it is time for closing statements. The candidates each get 30 seconds.And we begin with Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.PAUL: Well, thanks for having me. It\u2019s great to be back.(APPLAUSE)I\u2019m an eye surgeon from Bowling Green, Kentucky, I miss doing eye surgery, still get to do a little bit. Did a couple of cataract surgeries over Christmas holidays. Got to go to Haiti last year. I\u2019ve gotten to do some incredible things. Got to be on the floor of the Senate. And it has been amazing to me.But the thing that is most important to me and caused me to run for office is I\u2019m worried about the country and how much debt we\u2019re adding. And I am the one true fiscal conservative who will look at all spending. And that\u2019s the only way we\u2019ll ever balance our budget.Thank you.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Ohio Governor Kasich.KASICH: You know, one of our biggest national security issues is the world looks at us some time, and we look at each other and say, why can\u2019t we solve problems? Well, I\u2019ve got news for you, we can. We can in fact create jobs and provide job security. We can create a situation where wages begin to rise. We can create a situation for our children to be able to get a decent job to pay down their college debt. We can re-assume our role in the world.But all of this has to come together when we have a positive attitude, an optimistic approach, an ability for us to set the tune as conservatives, to invite other people in to be part of that orchestra. KASICH: You see, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of the day, I\u2019m an optimist(BELL RINGS)Because I\u2019ve seen so many things get accomplished in my lifetime. And we can do it again together, all of us, to strengthen this country, work together. Thank you.(APPLAUSE) BAIER: New Jersey governor, Chris Christie.CHRISTIE: On September 11, my wife was two blocks from the World Trade Center. When those buildings came down, she was trapped in her building and I didn\u2019t hear from her over six hours.We have three children, eight, five and one. And I had to confront the possibility of being a single parent. Terrorism in this country scares everyone. And the fact is that we need a commander-in- chief who not only understands how to protect us, but feels in here what it means to face the possibility of loss.I\u2019ve faced it. I\u2019ve prosecuted terrorists. I have made the decisions that need to be made as a governor to protect us and as president of the United States, no one will keep this country safer than I will.BAIER: Thank you governor.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. Governor.BUSH: We desperately need a conservative leader as president of the United States. I have a proven record as governor of the state of Florida, as a conservative leader. And I also have detailed plans to fix the mess in Washington, D.C.As president I will restore and rebuild our military, restore the alliances and keep us safe. And as our party\u2019s nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton in November. I ask for your support on the caucuses come Monday night and I will make you proud as our party\u2019s nominee. Thank you very much.(APPLAUSE) WALLACE: Dr. Ben Carson.CARSON: I want to thank the people of Iowa for being so welcoming to me. Please think of our founding fathers as you listen. We the people of the United States in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the benefits of liberty to ourselves and our prosperity, do ordain and establish this constitution of the United States of America. Folks, it\u2019s not too late. Enough said.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Florida Senator Marco Rubio.RUBIO: The bible commands us to let our light shine on the world. For over 200 years, America\u2019s light has been shining on the world and the world has never been the same again. But now, that light is dimming a little, after seven years of Barack Obama. And that\u2019s why Monday night, what will happen here in Iowa is so important.I\u2019m asking you for your vote. Caucus for me on Monday night because if I am your nominee, I will unite this party and I will defeat Hillary Clinton and when I\u2019m president, America\u2019s light will shine again and the 21 century will be a new American century.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Thank you senator.KELLY: Texas Senator, Ted Cruz. Senator.CRUZ: Ninety-three hours. The media noise will soon be over and it\u2019s now for the men and women of Iowa to decide. Our country is in crisis. We\u2019re worried the future of our children and we\u2019ve have been burned over and over again.The central question in this race is trust. Who do you know will kill the terrorists, defend the constitution and repeal Obamacare? Who do you know will stop amnesty and secure the borders? Who do you know will defend life, marriage and religious liberty? Examine our records, pray on it and I will be honored if you and your family will come caucus for us on Monday night.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Gentlemen, thank you all so much for being here tonight. We appreciate it greatly. And that does it for the seventh Republican primary debate of the 2016 presidential race. But we\u2019re not done. The Kelly file starts in a moment and guess who is going to be there? Senator Ted Cruz.WALLACE: And don\u2019t forget, after all the talk, the first voting of the 2016 campaign happens in just four days. The first Americans to vote, the Iowa caucuses are Monday and Fox News will have complete coverage.BAIER: And we have you covered from Iowa, all the way to the conventions and on to the general election. Thanks again for joining us. For all of us here in Des Moines, have a great evening.ENDAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Roller Coaster Year Ends With U.S. Markets Mostly Down", "Date": "2015-12-31", "News": "Supported byInvestors may be disappointed with the lackluster performance of the United States stock market in 2015, but, given all that happened, it could have been worse.It was a year when corporate earnings underwhelmed, Greece nearly crashed out of the euro, China carried out a shock devaluation of its currency, the price of oil slumped and the Federal Reserve increased interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.After its close on Thursday, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index finished the year down 0.73 percent. The performance was well below the solid gains of the last three years.But the index was still up 63 percent over the last five years. What is more, the stock market was able to bounce back from a summer rout that dragged the S.&P. 500 more than 10 percent below the nominal high it reached in May. After reinvesting dividends, the benchmark was up 2.35 percent in 2015.\u201cI don\u2019t remember a year where there were so many roller coasters along the way,\u201d said David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff. \u201cThe whole year was like a giant theme park.\u201dIn short, after many months of low volatility in the markets, the convulsions of 2015 were a jarring reminder that investing in stocks can be a risky business. And while plenty of analysts on Wall Street have relatively optimistic forecasts for 2016, many of the forces that upset markets in 2015 \u2014 like uncertainties about currencies and commodities and the potentially chilling effect of higher interest rates \u2014 could continue to buffet markets.The S.&P. 500 on Thursday fell 19.42 points, or 0.94 percent, to close at 2,043.94. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 178.84 points, or 1.02 percent, leaving it down 2.2 percent for the year, its first annual decline since 2008. The technology-heavy Nasdaq index did better than the other two benchmarks in 2015, rising 5.73 percent for the year.And technology firms were among the top performers in 2015.Shares in Netflix, which continues to add subscribers at a fast pace, were the biggest gainer in the S.&.P 500 index in 2015, soaring 133 percent. Amazon\u2019s stock was the second-best performer, more than doubling in 2015 as the company surprised investors with stronger profits. In contrast, Walmart, its bricks-and-mortar rival, dropped 29 percent.Lower oil and gas prices hurt the prospects of energy companies. This caused the energy companies within the S.&P. 500 to lose nearly one-fourth of their value in 2015.The pain in the oil and gas sector also caused stress in the junk bond market, where energy companies have borrowed huge amounts in recent years. The prices of junk bonds fell over 10 percent in 2015, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch\u2019s United States high-yield master index.The selling in the more speculative reaches of the credit markets is a sign that several years of speculation, brought about by ultralow interest rates, may now be unwinding. Some analysts expect the shakeout to intensify.\u201cHigh-yield credit is going to get a lot worse,\u201d said Atul Lele, chief investment officer at Deltec International, an investment firm. He also thinks emerging markets, where stock markets fell steeply in 2015, will continue to suffer in 2016, as companies in developing countries struggle to repay dollars that they borrowed in recent years. \u201cThe problem is that they are going to be defaulting on U.S. dollar debt and they don\u2019t have the dollar liquidity,\u201d Mr. Lele said.The crucial question is whether the United States economy can continue growing at around its current rate as the Fed raises interest rates. Away from the stock market, there were indications that investors are not confident about the outlook for the economy. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note might have been expected to rise considerably in 2015 as the economy grew and unemployment fell. Yet the note closed on Thursday with a yield of 2.27 percent, barely higher than the 2.17 percent at the end of 2014.Likewise, the price of oil, as measured by the benchmark United States crude contract in New York, fell by nearly a third in 2015. Some analysts saw the plunge as a portent of weak global growth, since it might indicate that companies are buying less oil to fuel their operations.Yet despite such indicators, many analysts said they saw activity within the United States economy that could keep it growing at a moderate pace. For instance, they said, United States consumers, benefiting from potentially higher wages and lower energy costs, could gain further confidence in 2016. While higher wages might dent profit margins for firms, higher spending by consumers could also bolster sales for certain companies. \u201cNext year is going to be the year of the wage breakout,\u201d said Mr. Rosenberg, the strategist. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be a pervasive theme.\u201dGloomier stock market watchers, however, said that problems they perceived in the global economy would most likely deepen in 2016, undermining the United States\u2019 recovery and the country\u2019s stock market. In their view, the monetary stimulus of the world\u2019s central banks has been of limited effectiveness. As a result, countries are choosing to let their currencies fall as a way of stoking their exports and thus their economies. The starkest example of this occurred in August, when China shocked the world by letting its long-stable currency, the renminbi, devalue slightly.As others have devalued, the United States dollar has strengthened. This can hurt companies based in the United States in two ways. They might find it harder to export and they might have to sell their goods at lower prices within the United States to compete with foreign firms. Their profits would suffer as result, and the deflationary forces in the economy might gain strength. To the bearish analysts, the devaluations and the problems they cause are an indication that policy makers are running out of ideas.\u201cI look around the world and see financial markets believing that the authorities are in control \u2014 but they are not,\u201d said Albert Edwards, a strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale in London.The bulls, of course, scoff at such pessimism.

Alexa excelled at music, and Cortana was mediocre across the board. Facebook was left out of the grading system because the company denied access to M, though I did hang out with her for two hours on a friend\u2019s account. More on that later.Apple said that Siri had \u201cbecome faster and smarter\u201d and spoke more languages than other assistants. Microsoft said it was \u201cjust scratching the surface\u201d on how Cortana could help people. Google said that it wanted smartphones to do more of the heavy lifting, and that users could do a host of things just by speaking to Google. Amazon did not respond to requests for comment.On the productivity front, Siri, summoned by pressing the home button on the iPhone or by saying, \u201cHey, Siri,\u201d was best able to schedule a meeting with a friend in Hawaii, check what was on my calendar for tomorrow, send an email and read my most recent email aloud. Others could complete only some of those tasks \u2014 Google could not read my last email out loud, and Alexa could not compose an email or create a calendar event.Siri also fared well in music-related tasks, but was bested by Alexa. Both assistants could play the song \u201cHey\u201d by the Pixies, put on the latest episode of the \u201cRadiolab\u201d podcast and play music in the instrumentals genre. But Alexa, summoned simply by saying \u201cAlexa,\u201d could play a specific music station on Pandora, whereas Siri could only open the Pandora app.Google, which builds its voice-controlled assistant into the Google mobile app, achieved the highest marks for completing travel and commuting-related tasks. It responded perfectly to the question \u201cWhat is the traffic like to 221 Main Street?\u201d by showing me how long it would take to drive there.When I said, \u201cTake me to the Dogpatch Boulders gym,\u201d it showed me a map and gave voice directions. When I said, \u201cFind me plane tickets to New York next week,\u201d it offered an impressive response: Flights from San Francisco to New York next week start at $435, and the shortest flight is five hours and 10 minutes long.On travel and commuting, Cortana could offer solutions for the questions about traffic and directions, but not the one about flights. Siri earned a C-minus in the category: She could not give traffic estimates, and in response to the question about flights to New York, she spat out an unhelpful list of web search results related to traveling to New York. And instead of taking me to a bouldering gym to hone my physique, she took me to a brewery.Alexa got a D \u2014 she could offer traffic estimates for only one fixed location that was set up inside the app, like your office, and she added the task of finding a flight to New York to my to-do list. (I gave Alexa a pass on failing to map me to the gym. It seemed too much to ask from a home audio speaker.)For food-related tasks, Google and Apple were even. Each of the assistants was able to find a list of nearby Indian restaurants. Only Google\u2019s voice assistant could order delivery food, but with an unintuitive process that required naming a specific restaurant that delivers food through one of the apps that Google has teamed up with. Siri was the only one capable of booking a restaurant table.In my limited time with M, I asked her to handle some of the most mundane tasks: Call the water company to ask about my utility bill, find out what meats are on sale at the local Whole Foods store and research when would be the cheapest time for my editor to fly to Hong Kong (not that I was trying to get rid of my editor).M pondered for a few minutes before answering each question, which made me suspect that a person handled most of the tasks. So I asked M to schedule a photo shoot with a studio owned by a friend of mine. Within minutes, the photo studio\u2019s phone rang, and my friend picked up.\u201cHi, I\u2019m calling on behalf of my boss,\u201d said M, who sounded like a young woman. \u201cHe wanted to find out if you guys have the ability for a photo shoot at 2 p.m. tomorrow.\u201dM left a contact phone number with a 650 area code, which includes Menlo Park, Calif., where Facebook has its headquarters.\u201cI didn\u2019t catch your name,\u201d my friend at the photo studio said.\u201cFirst name is M,\u201d the not-so-virtual assistant replied. \u201cLast name is Messenger.\u201d\u201cIs that Greek?\u201d my friend at the photo studio asked. M laughed nervously.In other words, M probably is more capable than all the virtual assistants, but largely because humans are on the other end of the puppet strings handling tasks that artificial intelligence cannot. That makes me doubt that many consumers will get to meet M, at least in its current state, in which it is free.\u201cM is still in its very, very early stages,\u201d Facebook said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re not yet focused on scaling M to a large number of people.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sundance Fights Tide With Films Like \u2018The Birth of a Nation\u2019", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Supported byCritic's NotebookPARK CITY, Utah \u2014 Art and industry are still slugging it out at the Sundance Film Festival. That\u2019s true even if you no longer hear many anguished discussions about the meaning of independent cinema. These days, chatter about distribution deals, a movie\u2019s commercial potential and even if a title will be in play at the next Academy Awards tends to drown out meaningful discussions of cinema and whether independence can be quantified by vision, spirit, money or some ineluctable combination of these. Then again, given how thoroughly the industry has colonized the festival (as the clusters of agents at screenings suggest), anguishing about it can feel like misplaced nostalgia.It\u2019s also pointless because no matter how much the industry and its media minions seem determined to turn Sundance into a snowy exurb of Hollywood, the festival continues to push against the mainstream tide through some of its selections. Each January, there are titles here that rise above the noise, reminding you why Sundance, now 32, remains crucial for many. This is where worlds and cinema open up, whether in a documentary about the first girl in Mongolia to hunt with a golden eagle (\u201cThe Eagle Huntress,\u201d a bliss-out) or a movie that finds the American director Kelly Reichardt giving Kristen Stewart a role and a burger to sink into with \u201cCertain Women,\u201d whose western characters are as stubbornly self-determined as this undersung filmmaker.By turns affecting and frustrating, \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d has a scale and ambition too rarely seen in most directorial debuts at Sundance. It has moments of power, but also longueurs and some unfortunate visual choices. And as the story unfolds, it becomes difficult to parse its political and theological arguments. Although the authenticity of \u201cThe Confessions\u201d remains in dispute, Turner seems to have seen himself as a religious prophet. It\u2019s a view that the movie shares by turning Turner (Mr. Parker) into an avenging Christ figure who rises from a crucifix-like whipping post to take up an ax that\u2019s soon slicked with blood. For the most part, Mr. Parker tempers the violence both of slavery in its everyday existential horror and of the revolt (the rebels kill only men), choices that feel commercially expedient.\u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d shook the festival up, which is always welcome, although only partly because of the real history it revisits. Like every movie, this one is defined by its moment in time, which means that its premiere took place amid the continuing, fractious uproar over Hollywood and its lack of real diversity. Although much of this recent discussion has been spurred by this year\u2019s Oscar contenders (all of the acting nominees are white), the issues are far greater and more enduring than the industry\u2019s annual Saturnalia of self-congratulation. As boldly suggested by Mr. Parker\u2019s appropriation of the title \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d \u2014 a reference to D. W. Griffith\u2019s 1915 racist landmark \u2014 the history of American cinema is undeniably also a history of white supremacy.Movies like \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d are helping to write the next chapter of American cinema. And, to an extent, that\u2019s true of Sundance at its best. This is, after all, a festival that makes room for experimental narratives like \u201cDark Night,\u201d Tim Sutton\u2019s drifty, conceptual exploration of a mass shooting, alongside documentaries ready-made for television (\u201cUnder the Gun,\u201d Stephanie Soechtig\u2019s look at gun policies and politics briskly narrated by Katie Couric). It\u2019s also where numerous selections pass the Bechdel test (movies like the very fine \u201cChristine\u201d and \u201cSand Storm,\u201d in which two women talk to each other about something besides a man) and, in honor of the director and Sundance alumna Ava DuVernay, what might be called the DuVernay test, in which African-Americans and other minorities have fully realized lives rather than serve as scenery in white stories.Among the titles that pass the DuVernay test are \u201cMorris From America,\u201d Chad Hartigan\u2019s at times rather perilously cute story about a 13-year-old African-American boy (Markees Christmas as the title character) whose father (an appealingly gruff Craig Robinson) works as a soccer coach in a blindingly, at times intolerantly, white German city. Mr. Hartigan tends to oversell the uplift, perhaps in an attempt to reach a larger audience than he did with his last feature, \u201cThis Is Martin Bonner.\u201d But he also produces moments of tenderness and wistful charm, as in a scene in which Morris and the casually unkind older girl he likes share a bench in front of an elaborate stone fountain that suddenly erupts, creating a cascade that\u2019s at once slyly sexual and a representation of Morris\u2019s flooding emotion.\u201cMorris\u201d will make its way into American theaters, and it\u2019s likely that so, too, will many other selections. The major studios and companies may dominate the box office, but the demand for streaming product means that scores of off-Hollywood titles will probably find an audience, if only on a television or computer near you. Two of the biggest players in the streaming world are Amazon and Netflix, both of which have been creating a great deal of movie-business turmoil, including at festivals. Netflix went after \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d hard (losing to Fox Searchlight), while Amazon picked up Kenneth Lonergan\u2019s rapturously received \u201cManchester by the Sea.\u201d Largely set in a town north of Boston and girded by a moving, lapidary performance from Casey Affleck as a broken man, the movie showcases Mr. Lonergan\u2019s gift with actors and for dialogue that ebbs, flows and stings like life.Like some of my other favorite movies at Sundance this year, \u201cKiki\u201d and \u201cUncle Howard\u201d seem unlikely to find the kinds of larger, mass reception that many at this festival might wish for. Every movie is made for an audience, of course, but one of the pleasures of Sundance is that it remains a place for the kind of non-mainstream work that hasn\u2019t been produced to scoop up viewers by the millions. This is where one day you can watch \u201cWild,\u201d a terrifically original German fiction film from Nicolette Krebitz about a woman and her wolf and next day watch an eagle land on the arm of a girl (Otto Bell\u2019s \u201cThe Eagle Huntress\u201d). For women, for minorities, for those seeking something different, it can be hard to love movies, because they don\u2019t always love us back. Sundance makes it easier.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As College Football\u2019s Popularity Expands, So Does Its Champions\u2019 Jewelry", "Date": "2016-01-09", "News": "Supported byGreg McElroy, a television analyst who was the Crimson Tide\u2019s starting quarterback during their 2009 national title season, said there was a simple reason he rarely wears his championship ring: \u201cIt\u2019s uncomfortable.\u201dChris Poitras, a vice president at the ring maker Jostens, said the trend began about a decade ago. It started at the professional level, he said, and has funneled down into the college ranks and, now, to high schools.\u201cThey were smaller in stature,\u201d Poitras said of early rings, \u201cwhereas now, the school wants their brand. They want to tell the entire story of that season through logos, through scores on the side of the ring, through unique sayings.\u201dAlabama\u2019s championship rings provide particularly telling points of comparison because there are so many of them. The university claims 15 football national championships \u2014 many neutral rankers would set the figure a little lower \u2014 including at least one each in the 1920s, the \u201930s, \u201940s, \u201960s, \u201970s and \u201990s, the 2000s and the 2010s.Before the 1950s and \u201960s, the most distinctive college football awards included watches and blankets from bowl games. The first ring Alabama bought for its players, coaches and staff at the time of a championship was after the 1961 season. That was the Tide\u2019s first title under Bear Bryant and the first for the program, even by its own accounting, in 20 years.Mary Harmon Hilburn has her Alabama championship rings in the form of lavaliers \u2014 pendants that are what you would get if you sliced off the meaty face of the ring like popping off the top of a muffin. They are the real thing, though, a perk Hilburn enjoys partly from being the oldest granddaughter of Bryant, the legendary coach who presided over six Crimson Tide national championships in the 1960s and \u201970s.The lavalier for the 1965 title team \u2014 the spoils of a 9-1-1 season that included a victory over Nebraska in the Orange Bowl \u2014 is on a bracelet that also contains various charms given out for bowl games. But when Hilburn wears the ones commemorating Alabama\u2019s three most recent national titles \u2014 from the 2009, 2011 and 2012 seasons \u2014 they hang at the bottom of a necklace, separated more out of necessity than sentimentality.\u201cThey would dominate all the bowl charms,\u201d she said.Which is a polite way of saying that the rings of recent vintage are a little too big for a bracelet. Or, for that matter, a finger.In size, Alabama\u2019s 1992 ring \u2014 the one owned by Clemson Coach Dabo Swinney, who was a senior wide receiver on that team \u2014 more closely resembles the 1961 ring than the one from 2009. But it also represents a design shift, probably prompted by Coach Gene Stallings\u2019s previous time in the N.F.L. There are more words, and there is a logo on the face \u2014 albeit a block \u201cA\u201d that looks nothing like the more familiar script \u201cA\u201d for which the Crimson Tide are known.By contrast, the three most recent rings \u2014 all won during the Bowl Championship Series, all under Coach Nick Saban \u2014 are about the size of table tennis balls. Their bodies contain words (like \u201cchampions\u201d) and other information (typically the score of the championship game), and faces studded with shiny stones and the script \u201cA.\u201dThey look like a million bucks. But they are not worth anything approaching that.The N.C.A.A. caps national championship awards bought by the school at $415. (Bowls may spend up to $550 on player gifts, which was why every Alabama and Michigan State player participating in last week\u2019s Cotton Bowl received an Apple Watch, an Amazon TV media player and the traditional commemorative watch.)\u201cThat\u2019s our challenge,\u201d said Poitras, whose company made Alabama\u2019s 2009 and 2011 rings as well as its ring last season for winning the Southeastern Conference title. (The value of that ring could not exceed $315, also per N.C.A.A. rules. Crimson Tide players can also expect another ring if they win the College Football Playoff.)The goal, Poitras said, is \u201cthat when you pick that ring up, you say, \u2018Wow, this is a spectacular ring that looks like it\u2019s worth thousands and thousands of dollars.\u2019 \u201dFor example, Alabama\u2019s 2009 national championship ring uses a nonprecious metal alloy for the golden body, a synthetic garnet for the crimson backdrop and cubic zirconia to simulate a diamond-studded face. By contrast, rings for professional franchises typically use the real thing.But, of course, the rings\u2019 value ultimately derives from something else. Unlike most jewelry, a championship ring has a purpose that is not primarily aesthetic. Alabama linebacker Reggie Ragland, a senior, said last week that his mother did not let him take his 2012 ring out of a safe-deposit box. But he also seemed almost to disown the championship ring, saying, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it that; I didn\u2019t get to play that much.\u201dOf his ring, McElroy said, \u201cI\u2019d rather have it in my dresser at home, safe and sound, or my safe, as opposed to having it on my hand.\u201dHe added, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m any less proud of it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

A generation of female writer-performers view her as indispensable. The rest of us: Eileen who? \u201cI\u2019m a loudmouthed lesbian, which means mainstream invisible,\u201d she said.That is changing, though, and in many ways Ms. Myles \u2014 to her ecstatic bewilderment \u2014 has Hollywood to thank.\u201cIt\u2019s real, and it\u2019s accidental,\u201d she told me at a coffee shop the afternoon after the Globes. \u201cYou know, evolution is not an even process.

Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon. Grail, which is majority-owned by Illumina, has also assembled a prominent roster of advisers.\u201cIf this pans out, this could be a real game changer,\u201d said Dr. Jos\u00e9 Baselga, the physician in chief at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, who will head the company\u2019s science advisory board.But some experts said that developing such a test would be a daunting task. Even Dr. Baselga seemed skeptical that a pan-cancer screening test could be ready by 2019, the goal of Illumina\u2019s chief executive, Jay T. Flatley. Screening for particular types of cancer may be easier, Dr. Baselga said.The approach to be used takes advantage of the fact that DNA from cancerous cells can be found in the blood, albeit in minute amounts. The blood test, using intensive DNA sequencing, would look for patterns of telltale mutations.But so far, liquid biopsies are mainly used for patients already known to have cancer. The tests help determine the particular mutations in the tumor to help select the best drugs to use. Or they are used to monitor whether treatment is effective or to check for a recurrence.Detecting early-stage cancer, although an eventual goal of many liquid biopsy companies, is considered more difficult. Many cells, not just cancerous ones, shed DNA into the bloodstream, and many noncancerous cells have mutations that are also found in tumors.\u201cAs you age, you have mutations,\u201d said Dr. Luis A. Diaz Jr., associate professor of oncology at Johns Hopkins and co-founder of three companies developing liquid biopsies. Polyps, moles and benign growths also have mutations that resemble those in tumors, he said.Moreover, Dr. Diaz said, current liquid biopsy technology is often not sensitive enough to pick up multiple mutations at once.\u201cPatients ought to be hesitant until there is really good data that this actually helps people, and they should remember that it could harm people,\u201d said Dr. H. Gilbert Welch, professor of medicine at Dartmouth and author of the book \u201cLess Medicine, More Health.\u201dOne company, Pathway Genomics, last year began offering a liquid biopsy test aimed at detecting early-stage cancer. The Food and Drug Administration almost immediately challenged the company, saying the test needed regulatory approval. The agency, in a letter to the company in September, also said that it had not found \u201cany published evidence that this test or any similar test has been clinically validated as a screening tool for the early detection of cancer.\u201dMr. Flatley said that Grail would overcome those problems by doing intensive DNA sequencing on 30,000 to 50,000 people over time, some of whom would have, or would develop, cancer, to figure out the mutation signatures indicating cancer.The screening test for each patient would also use the \u201cdeep,\u201d or intensive, sequencing, to check for numerous mutations. Mr. Flatley said a screening test would have to cost no more than $1,000 to be economically feasible.Sequencing a whole human genome now costs about $1,000 for big users of Illumina\u2019s sequencing machines. But costs are dropping and Grail, which does not have a chief executive yet, will get a special discount from Illumina.\u201cNone of our customers can afford to do this today \u2014 only Illumina can,\u201d Mr. Flatley said in an interview. \u201cWe have a sense of urgency to make it work.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cable Acquisitions by Charter Communications Face Rising Opposition", "Date": "2016-01-21", "News": "Supported byComcast\u2019s failed $45 billion merger with Time Warner Cable collapsed last year under pressure from regulators, who found that the combined company would have had both the power and incentive to inhibit the future of streaming video.Now, as rival Charter Communications seeks approval for its $67.1 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, critics point to the same potential for harm.\u201cIf Comcast\u2019s deal for Time Warner Cable was a Category 5 hurricane, Charter-Time Warner is a Category 4,\u201d said Jeff Blum, deputy general counsel of Dish Network, the satellite television provider. Mr. Blum made his comments during a conference call Thursday held by a coalition of companies, advocacy and industry groups publicizing the potential harms of Charter\u2019s takeover bid. If approved, the proposed merger would create a powerful new force in the country\u2019s broadband market. The combined company would rank as the country\u2019s second-largest broadband provider behind Comcast with about 19.4 million subscribers, and the country\u2019s No. 3 video provider with 17.3 million customers, across about 40 states. That increased heft is coming under close scrutiny as federal regulators continue their review of the Charter deals. If approved, the merger would most likely include strong conditions meant to prevent Charter from leveraging its market power to hurt rival streaming services, regulatory experts said. With increased clout, for instance, the company could restrict television networks from selling their content through stand-alone streaming services. Charter, which already has announced a number of commitments related to the merger, has extra incentive to agree to conditions. Time Warner Cable would receive a breakup fee of up to $2 billion if the transaction falls apart. The company received nothing when Comcast walked away from its deal.Another prominent issue is the role and influence of John C. Malone, the media mogul whose company Liberty Broadband would hold a 20 percent stake in a reconstituted Charter. Some groups have called for regulators to place restrictions on the involvement of Mr. Malone, saying that his interests in entertainment companies \u2014 including Discovery Communications and Starz \u2014 could represent untenable conflicts. Whit Clay, a spokesman for the Liberty businesses, declined to comment.Charter has argued that its deals pose no threat to the online video market because the future of its business depends more on broadband than its legacy video business. Alex Dudley, a Charter spokesman, said in a statement that the company is committed to creating American jobs, offering innovative products, faster Internet speeds, preserving an open Internet and online video with no data caps or modem fees.\u201cIt should come as no surprise that Dish and other parties seeking to use the regulatory review process to extract concessions are also engaging in tired P.R. tactics to further their self-interests,\u201d Mr. Dudley said in a statement. \u201cTheir arguments against the pending transactions are baseless.\u201dFederal regulators declined to discuss their reviews of Charter\u2019s proposed merger with Time Warner Cable and Bright House. But in recent months, antitrust officials have provided some insight into their priorities when considering cable mergers. Central to their analysis has been whether bigger cable firms \u2014 with strong bargaining power with programmers and fast-growing broadband Internet businesses \u2014 could harm their newest threat: streaming video providers like Netflix and Hulu. In a September speech, Jonathan Sallet, the general counsel for the Federal Communications Commission, said that the agency focused on the streaming companies in its decision to reject Comcast\u2019s bid for Time Warner Cable.The biggest concern was how a combined cable giant, with more than half of the high-speed Internet market and a major portion of the cable video market, could pressure programmers to keep their best content off online video services that competed with cable TV. Such market concentration over distribution would have given the company too much of an incentive to do so, Mr. Sallet said.\u201cSimply put, the core concern came down to whether the merged firm would have an increased incentive and ability to safeguard its integrated Pay TV business model,\u201d Mr. Sallet said in the speech at a telecom policy conference.Announced a month after Comcast aborted its bid last spring, Charter\u2019s proposed acquisitions have been the target of significantly less backlash than the Comcast merger, which would have united the two largest cable operators in the country.\u201cThat means that we, Hulu, Amazon and others can compete on an open basis,\u201d Mr. Hastings said. \u201cWe think it would be a huge step forward for U.S. policy\u201d for streaming services.Yet criticism of the deal has escalated in recent weeks as a number of media and technology companies, public interest groups and other organizations stepped forward to voice concerns over Charter\u2019s proposed acquisitions.In a meeting with F.C.C. officials last week, for example, executives from the media giant Time Warner said that public and private statements by Charter executives suggested that the deal could deter the development of streaming video options to the detriment of consumers. Dish, one of the most vocal opponents, has urged regulators to reject the proposed merger; its new Sling TV video service, which offers streaming television without a traditional cable or satellite subscription, is one of the offerings that could be harmed.Dish has joined other opponents of the deal to form a new Stop Mega Cable coalition, which wants to raise awareness of the harms that could result from the deal, including increased costs and worse service for customers. In addition to Dish, members of the coalition include the public interest group Public Knowledge and industry trade group USTelecom \u2014 The Broadband Association, and Consumers Union, the advocacy arm of Consumer Reports.\u201cWe want to make sure that the very dangers that enforcers were willing to challenge in the Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger are not allowed to go forward through a second company that can coordinate with Comcast,\u201d Gene Kimmelman, chief executive of Public Knowledge and a former antitrust official at the Justice Department, said on the conference call Thursday. \u201cThere is the danger of coordination on one side,\u201d he added in an interview later. \u201cBut the opportunity here, through the right enforcement requirements, is to actually push for a new business model. That won\u2019t happen automatically. It will have to be pressured.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Does a Parrot Know About PTSD?", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "FeatureAn unexpected bond between damaged birds and traumatized veterans could reveal surprising insights into animal intelligence.Supported byLove would not formally receive a diagnosis of severe post-traumatic stress disorder for another 15 years. In that time, she was married and divorced three times, came out as transgender and retreated periodically to Yelapa, Mexico, where she lived in an isolated cabin accessible only by water. She eventually ended up living on a boat in a Los Angeles marina, drinking heavily and taking an array of psychotropic drugs that doctors at the West Los Angeles Veterans Administration Medical Center began to prescribe with increasing frequency as Love proved resistant to traditional treatments like counseling and group therapy. One night, after her fifth stay in the center\u2019s psych ward, she crashed her boat into a sea wall. Finally, in 2006, she was in the veterans\u2019 garden and happened to catch sight of the parrots being housed in an unusual facility that opened a year earlier on the grounds of the center.\u2018\u2018This place is why I\u2019m still here,\u2019\u2019 Love, now 54, told me one day last summer as I watched her undergo one of her daily therapy sessions at the facility, known as Serenity Park, a name that would seem an utter anomaly to anyone who has ever been within 200 yards of the place.Inside one mesh-draped enclosure, Julius, a foot-high peach-white Moluccan cockatoo with a pink-feathered headdress, was madly pacing, muttering in the native tongue of the Korean woman who, along with her recently deceased husband, had owned him. Next door, a nearly three-foot-tall blue-and-gold macaw named Bacardi, abandoned by a truck driver who was spending too much time on the road, kept calling out for someone named Muffin, before abruptly rising up and knocking over his tray of food to surrounding squawks of delight. Across the way, Pinky, a Goffin\u2019s cockatoo, the castoff of a bitter custody battle between his original female owner and the husband who threatened to spite her by cutting off her beloved pet\u2019s wings, was mimicking a blue jay\u2019s high-pitched power-saw plaint. More screams rang out and then, in the ensuing silences, random snippets of past conversations: \u2018\u2018Hey, sweetheart!\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Whatever.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Oh, well.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Whoa! C\u2019mon man!\u2019\u2019 Soon, from a far corner, came the whistling, slow and haunted, of the theme from \u2018\u2018Bridge on the River Kwai.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018They had me loaded up on so many kinds of medications, I was seeing little green men and spiders jumping out of trees,\u2019\u2019 Love continued, as a six-inch-tall female caique parrot from the Amazon Basin named Cashew dutifully paced across her shoulders. Back and forth she went, from one side to the other, in determined, near- circular waddles.For the next 10 minutes, Love, her eyes closed, her arms still at her sides, continued to engage in one of the many daily duets she does with each one of Serenity Park\u2019s winged residents, listing her shoulders up and down like a gently rocking ship, Cashew\u2019s slow, feather-light paddings all the while putting Love further at ease. Now and again, Cashew would pause to give a gentle beak-brush of Love\u2019s neck and ear, and then crane her head upward toward Love\u2019s mouth to receive a couple of kisses. She made a few more passes, back and forth, then abruptly climbed atop Love\u2019s head. Smiling broadly, Love let her loll around up there on her back for a time, Cashew using the same upward scooping wing flaps that caiques employ to bathe on wet rain-forest leaves.In the wild, caiques, diminutive dollops of luminous yellow, white and deep blue-green, fly in huge, tightly knit flocks whose collective wing feathers make a singular whirring sound above the rain-forest canopy. Cashew, however, for reasons unknown, had her wings overclipped by her former owner, who had bought her as a pet and then abandoned her. So each day now, Love helps her learn how to take to the air again.The flight lessons are usually administered at the end of Love\u2019s daily rounds. Each morning at dawn, she arrives at Serenity Park from her boat at the marina. For the next four to five hours, she, like the six other veterans in the work-therapy program there, brings food and water to the parrots, cleans their cages and nuzzles and coos and talks and squawks with them. Love, by far the most animated of the veterans that I met at the park, flits from enclosure to enclosure, miming each bird\u2019s movements, mimicking their individual voices and attitudes and, as with Cashew, tries to restore what was taken from them.She had only to say her student\u2019s name once that day and Cashew was upright in Love\u2019s right palm, a knowing head tilt signaling her readiness. Love set Cashew on a nearby perch and with the thumb and forefinger of both hands took hold of each wing by the tip and moved them up and down a few times as though priming a pump. She then extended an index finger, held Cashew briefly aloft and with a quick thrust upward let her fall free. Some frantic flailing quickly morphed into firmer flaps, Cashew\u2019s wings finally gathering just enough air for her to gain the netting on the far side of her large mesh home. \u2018\u2018You see,\u2019\u2019 Love said, beaming. \u2018\u2018She can actually go a little distance.\u2019\u2019Taking hold of Cashew once again, she cupped her against her cheek. \u2018\u2018Their spirit gives me the will to get up and do it another day. They\u2019re all victims here. Kind of like what the veterans have been through, in a way.\u2019\u2019 Love lowered her hands and watched Cashew roll over once more on her back, a play position known as wrestling that is peculiar to caiques. \u2018\u2018They don\u2019t belong in captivity,\u2019\u2019 Love said, rubbing Cashew\u2019s white breast feathers. \u2018\u2018But they have a real survivor\u2019s mentality. These forgotten great beams of light that have been pushed aside and marginalized. I see the trauma, the mutual trauma that I suffered and that these birds have suffered, and my heart just wants to go out and nurture and feed and take care of them, and doing that helps me deal with my trauma. All without words.\u2019\u2019There were 34 parrots at Serenity Park when I was there last summer \u2014 representing a range of the more than 350 species in the psittaciformes order \u2014 a majority of them abandoned and now deeply traumatized former pets that had outlived either their owners or their owners\u2019 patience. A parrot separated from its flock will flock fully and fiercely to the attentions and affections of its new human keeper. And when that individual, for whatever reason, fails to uphold his or her end of such an inherently exclusive relationship, the effects are devastating.Up and down the aviary-lined corridor of Serenity Park are the winged wreckages of such broken bonds. On and on they go: the ceaseless pacing and rocking and screaming, the corner-cowering, self-plucking and broken-record remembrances. And yet at Serenity Park, the very behaviors that once would have further codified our parrot caricatures \u2014 \u2018\u2018birdbrained,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018mindless mimicry,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018mere parroting\u2019\u2019 and so on \u2014 are recognized as classic symptoms of the same form of complex post-traumatic stress disorder afflicting the patients in the Veterans Administration Medical Center. They\u2019re also being seized upon as a source of mutual healing for some of the most psychologically scarred members of both species.\u2018\u2018The problem with parrots is that they\u2019re so intensely attuned,\u2019\u2019 Lorin Lindner, the psychologist who founded Serenity Park, told me one afternoon as we stood watching Julius pace back and forth, speaking in Korean. \u2018\u2018Parrots have so many social neurons. Their brain is filled with the capacity to mirror their flock. It\u2019s so crucial for survival to be able to know what the flock is doing, to know what the danger signs are, when they have to get together, when night is falling and they are called to roost. They\u2019re so attuned to being socially responsive that they can easily transfer that to us. They have the ability to connect, to feel this closeness with another being, another species.\u2019\u2019Listening to Julius that day reminded me of a story I read not long ago in the journal Current Biology about a 22-year-old male Asian elephant named Koshik that resides at the Everland Zoo in Yongin, South Korea. Separated from the two female Asian elephants he was raised with in captivity, Koshik lived alone at Everland for seven years, a period during which he construed a way of speaking perfectly intelligible Korean words by sticking his trunk in his mouth and then using his tongue to shape his own plosive trumpetings into the language of the zoo\u2019s workers and local visitors. Such \u2018\u2018vocal learning,\u2019\u2019 the researchers who wrote the paper concluded, isn\u2019t an attempt to directly communicate with us so much as it is a way for a highly social species like the elephant \u2018\u2018to cement social bonds\u2019\u2019 with the only other species available.It\u2019s one of those unlikely natural outcomes of the so-called anthropocene, the first epoch to be named after us: the prolonged confinement of intelligent and social creatures, compelling them to speak the language of their keepers. And now, in yet another unlikely occurrence, parrots, among the oldest victims of human acquisitiveness and vainglory, have become some of the most empathic readers of our troubled minds. Their deep need to connect is drawing the most severely wounded and isolated PTSD sufferers out of themselves. In an extraordinary example of symbiosis, two entirely different outcasts of human aggression \u2014 war and entrapment \u2014 are somehow helping each other to find their way again.The following year, Lindner started a private practice in Westwood and began to do pro bono work with the increasing number of homeless veterans she encountered in the community, many of them living at that time in encampments under the nearby 405 freeway while awaiting appointments at the West Los Angeles V.A. medical center. Overwhelmed by their stories, she began devoting herself full time to veterans, eventually enlisting the backing of the state to head a nonprofit homeless-veteran-rehabilitation program, known as New Directions, at a residential treatment center.Spending more and more time at work, Lindner soon decided to take in another orphaned cockatoo named Mango as a \u2018\u2018flock mate\u2019\u2019 for Sammy. Before long, she was tending to both New Directions, which was relocated in 1997 to a newly refurbished building on the grounds of the V.A. center, and a sanctuary for homeless parrots that she started that same year with a friend on a four-acre plot an hour-and-a-half drive north in Ojai. One morning, near the end of 1997, Lindner found herself leading yet another veterans\u2019 group-therapy session that was getting nowhere.\u2018\u2018The guys are sitting around, all stoic, arms crossed, not saying anything,\u2019\u2019 she recalled. \u2018\u2018They\u2019d been like that for a number of weeks. So for a change, I took them up to Ojai to help build some new aviaries there. All of the sudden these same tight-lipped guys are cuddling up to the parrots and talking away with them.\u2019\u2019Lindner was soon repeating the same exercise with other veterans. The transformations she saw in both species were so pronounced that she promptly set about persuading the V.A. to allot her the grounds of an old outdoor basketball court just down the hill from the medical center so she could move the birds from her Ojai sanctuary and start a work-therapy program there. (Veterans are paid a stipend to work in the sanctuary; some, like Love, volunteer their time.) She began with two 25-foot-high aviaries; there are now nearly two dozen. Some hold as many as three or four birds, like Kiki, Phoebe and Dino (a.k.a. the Three Stooges), a now inseparable troika of umbrella cockatoos who spend their days cuddling and grooming one another. Others contain just one bonded pair like Mandy and Kookie, a female and male eclectus parrot couple, a species native to the Solomon Islands, or Jester and Tango, one Harlequin and one green-wing macaw, who never leave each other\u2019s side. And then there are the quarters of the inveterate loners, birds still caught somewhere between their inherent, wild selves and their captive ones: Cashew, Bacardi or Julius, who is afraid of other parrots because, as Lindner explained, \u2018\u2018he doesn\u2019t think he is one.\u2019\u2019As I stood talking that day with Lindner, who is warm and effusive, with long blond hair and bangs, I watched Jim Minick, a former Navy helicopter-squadron member who did three tours of duty overseas and suffered severe upper-body injuries in a fall from his chopper, get his fingernails cleaned by Bacardi, the blue-and-gold macaw. In another enclosure, Jason Martinez, a wheelchair-bound Army veteran, sat alongside Molly, an African gray, resting on her perch, the two of them just staring at each other.Love approached. She was holding an elderly Goffin\u2019s cockatoo named Bobbi, a bird kept most of her life by her owner in a kitchen drawer. She looked like a tiny plucked blue chicken, her only remaining plumage some straggly wing and tail feathers and a frayed skull cap of the ones she couldn\u2019t reach with her beak to mutilate. Love held Bobbi aloft on her index finger and then went dashing down the path between the compound\u2019s two rows of aviaries, shouting, \u2018\u2018Fly, Bobbi, fly,\u2019\u2019 giving her fruitlessly flapping charge at least the semblance of flight.I turned to take in a multitiered array of stares, feeling at once beheld and uplifted by creatures a fraction of my weight. I couldn\u2019t place it at first, the slow-swiveling sideswipe of their gazes, the way they\u2019ll dip their heads below their own bodies and then crane smoothly upward, like a movie camera pulling focus. And then it came to me: They reminded me of those C.G.I. velociraptors in films, except that the scales have turned to feathers and the stunted forelimbs to vibrant wings. Time, all at once, lurched wildly backward and ahead, depositing me right back where I\u2019d been, in that moment, and yet deeper and more present.\u2018\u2018God is a parrot,\u2019\u2019 Love said. \u2018\u2018I know that now. God supposedly interprets and mimics what we do on earth, right? Is a reflection of us? So I believe God, if she exists, must be a parrot.\u2019\u2019There is abundant evidence now that parrots possess cognitive capacities and sensibilities remarkably similar to our own. Alex, the now-deceased African gray parrot studied for years by his longtime companion, Dr. Irene Pepperberg, a psychology professor, is regularly held up as the paragon of parrot intelligence. His cognitive skills tested as high as those of a 5-year-old child. He mastered more than 100 words, grasped abstract concepts like absence and presence (Alex excelled at the shell game) and often gave orders to and toyed with the language of researchers who studied him, purposely giving them the wrong answers to their questions to alleviate his own boredom. Alex was also given to demonstrating what we would characterize in ourselves as \u2018\u2018hurt feelings.\u2019\u2019 When Pepperberg returned to Alex one morning after a three-week absence, he turned his back on her in his cage and commanded, \u2018\u2018Come here!\u2019\u2019Stories like these are, in fact, legion among those who keep and work with parrots. Dr. Patricia Anderson, an anthropologist at Western Illinois University, told me that her expertise in anthrozoology, the study of human-animal relations, is daily tested by her own cadre of adopted, orphaned parrots, including the first bird she decided to take in nearly 30 years ago, a Quaker, or monk, parrot named Otis.\u2018\u2018He was so bright,\u2019\u2019 Anderson told me. \u2018\u2018I taught him to say \u2018thank you.\u2019 Very anthropocentric of me, I know, but he generalized it appropriately to anything I ever did for him. He never said it randomly. He only said it when I did something for him, so it appeared to have meaning to him. There appeared to be some cognition going on, and this totally blew my mind.\u2019\u2019 Anderson read extensively about parrots and learned that anytime she left, she should say, \u2018\u2018I\u2019ll be right back.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018I started saying that, and then whenever I began to put my shoes on in the morning to get ready to go to work, he\u2019d say: \u2018Right back? Right back?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019Tango, a green-wing macaw.Nature, in other words, in a stunning example of parallel or convergent evolution, found an entirely other and far earlier path to complex cognition: an alien intelligence that not only links directly back to minds we\u2019ve long believed to be forever lost to us, like the dinosaurs\u2019, but that can also be wounded, under duress, in the same ways our minds can. In one recent psychiatric study conducted at Midwest Avian Adoption and Rescue Services, a parrot sanctuary and rehabilitation facility in Minnesota, a captive-bred male umbrella cockatoo who had been \u2018\u2018exposed to multiple caregivers who were themselves highly unstable (e.g. domestic violence, substance abuse .\u2009.\u2009. addiction)\u2019\u2019 was given a diagnosis of complex PTSD. \u2018\u2018When examined through the lens of complex PTSD,\u2019\u2019 Dr. Gay Bradshaw, a psychologist and ecologist and an author of the study, wrote, \u2018\u2018the symptoms of many caged parrots are almost indistinguishable from those of human P.O.W.s and concentration-camp survivors.\u2019\u2019 She added that severely traumatized cockatoos \u2018\u2018commonly exhibit rapid pacing in cage, distress calls, screams, self-mutilation, aggression in response to .\u2009.\u2009. physical contact, nightmares .\u2009.\u2009. insomnia.\u2019\u2019Veterans, of course, share similar psychological scarring, but whenever I asked any of them how it is that the parrots succeed in connecting where human therapists and fellow group-therapy members can\u2019t, the answer seemed to lie precisely in the fact that parrots are alien intelligences: parallel, analogously wounded minds that know and feel pain deeply and yet at a level liberatingly beyond the prescriptive confines of human language and prejudices.\u2018\u2018They look at you, and they don\u2019t judge,\u2019\u2019 Jim Minick, the badly injured helicopter-squad member, told me. \u2018\u2018The parrots look at you, and it\u2019s all face value. It\u2019s pure.\u2019\u2019One afternoon at the sanctuary, I went up the hill to the V.A. hospital to talk with Leslie Martin. A clinical social worker and a director at the center\u2019s trauma-recovery services, she often recommends parrot therapy for patients, including those who are \u2018\u2018treatment resistant,\u2019\u2019 like Lilly Love. I asked Martin if the primordial nature of the parrot\u2019s intelligence might have a particular effect on certain veterans. \u2018\u2018Everyone knows these animals are very sensitive, like children,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018The pure, primitive nature of their feelings, their emotions, activates your primitive brain. And then when they speak to you, it\u2019s a real high.\u2019\u2019Previous studies have shown that effective trauma therapies can help the brain construct neuronal bypasses around the scarred areas of a traumatized brain. \u2018\u2018They\u2019re only just starting to do research on this now, but there are phenomena that are operating in the prefrontal cortex,\u2019\u2019 Martin said. \u2018\u2018There are some physiological and chemical changes happening that are real, that are measurable.\u2019\u2019 Lindner says she would like to one day enlist researchers to study the brain science behind the efficacy of parrot therapy and whether it is the parrots themselves that are helping the veterans or whether there are other variables at work. For now, however, she uses as her measure the nearby veterans\u2019 garden just across from Serenity Park. For years, afflicted veterans were brought to work in the garden as a way of treating their trauma, essentially working in the same tranquil setting as the veterans at Serenity Park, the one obvious difference, of course, being the parrots. Lindner said she thinks that, using conventional measures of improvement for veterans suffering trauma \u2014 the ability to stay clean and sober; keeping up with their case-manager appointments; reuniting with family; finding gainful employment, and so on \u2014 the veterans who have been working with the parrots are doing better than those who spend time working at the garden.\u2018\u2018There\u2019s definitely something different going on at this place,\u2019\u2019 Lindner said. \u2018\u2018We know that what\u2019s preserved across species, all vertebrates truthfully, is the ability to feel compassion. As for birds and humans, we both have sympathetic nervous responses. We react the same way to trauma on the physiological level and in terms of the reparative nature of compassion and empathy. That\u2019s what is doing the healing. That\u2019s what is bringing the broken halves together. We don\u2019t know what the actual healing factor is, but I believe that it has to do with mental mirroring. That the parrots get what the veterans are going through and, of course, the veterans get them, too, because, hey, they are all pretty much traumatized birds around here.\u2019\u2019Simmons built his first computer in grade school. He joined the peacetime Navy right out of high school, he told me, to spite his father, who wanted him to go straight to college and then law school. He scored so high on his recruitment aptitude tests that the Navy wanted to assign him to a nuclear submarine. Simmons managed, instead, to secure what he believed would be a relatively easy tour as a yeoman \u2014 essentially an administrative and clerical position \u2014 on an aircraft carrier, until that ship made a sudden turn in early 1991.\u2018\u2018We\u2019re told we\u2019re headed for Puerto Rico,\u2019\u2019 Simmons told me at dinner one night with Lindner. \u2018\u2018And the next thing I know is the sun is behind the ship and the announcement comes that we\u2019re off to the Persian Gulf. I wound up in Bahrain, in-country, on a top-secret mission, tethered to the belt of Navy SEALs. My secretary job was now to document beneath the thick smoke all the slayings and how many targets the planes had accurately hit. For months it looked like night during the day. I saw a lot of killing, and things I wish I hadn\u2019t.\u2019\u2019Upon his return from active duty, Simmons enrolled at the University of Cincinnati and studied literature and philosophy. He started his own software company while still in his junior year and starred at quarterback under Rex Ryan, now head coach of the Buffalo Bills, until being permanently sidelined by a knee injury. At first, he attributed the night terrors and cold sweats he began to experience in his last two years of school to the stress of course work and managing his new company. But he soon started drinking heavily, and by his late 20s became addicted to heroin and prescription drugs. Growing increasingly estranged from his first wife, he eventually was divorced, sold his company to LexisNexis and then hopped in his B.M.W. one day and headed for California, where he ended up spending a year in jail for assault after nearly killing a man in a bar fight.The PTSD stemming from his time in the Navy wasn\u2019t formally diagnosed for another two years. A friend suggested that he visit the West Los Angeles V.A. for help. Simmons told me that until then, he had no idea that what he was experiencing had to do with his military service. The regimen of new drugs that were prescribed by a psychiatrist there proved ineffective, and he grew increasingly closed off in therapy sessions that were dominated at that time by long-ignored Vietnam veterans with issues entirely different from those associated with the Gulf War. \u2018\u2018I told my therapist this,\u2019\u2019 Simmons said, \u2018\u2018and he basically said that if I didn\u2019t go down and help out at the sanctuary, he was going to stop treating me.\u2019\u2019Simmons instantly connected with the yellow-headed Amazon, Joey, who had adopted and raised from infancy two other birds at the sanctuary \u2014 a pair of female lilac-crowned Amazon parrots that had fallen from their nest \u2014 regurgitating his own food to feed them. For a male parrot to raise two females from another species is a rare display of altruism, Lindner told me, a behavior long thought to be exclusive to humans and other primates.\u2018\u2018Joey came to Serenity Park around the same time I did,\u2019\u2019 Simmons told me. \u2018\u2018That\u2019s the first thing we had in common. I had learned that yellow-headed Amazons are not that friendly, so when Joey made an effort to befriend me, that meant even more. We were different species, but we got each other. I was shy, burned by humans, isolated, angry. Joey had what seemed to me the same attitude. So we bonded. He let me touch him. Only me.\u2019\u2019Within weeks of his arrival at Serenity Park, Lindner told me, Simmons had pretty much taken over the place. He was up at 3 a.m. every day in the New Directions kitchen, preparing breakfast for all the veterans. Then he came down to the sanctuary and worked there until 6 in the evening, clearing out the compound, building new aviaries and expanding the existing ones.When I asked Simmons to describe what happens to him when he is with a parrot, he instantly went into one of his signature high-speed soliloquies. \u2018\u2018Here we go,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018Write it down. There are things I have seen that will never leave me. There\u2019s this huge sack of guilt and shame and pain that I carry with me, and I got it when I was 18 years old in Bahrain. Now, when I\u2019m with a parrot, it\u2019s not a total time-change thing, but I do have to act like a 12-year-old boy again. And here\u2019s why. Because parrots are not domesticated animals. They haven\u2019t been bred for hundreds of years to be at my feet.\u2019\u2019 Simmons paused for a sip of Coke, the third one of the night. \u2018\u2018So in order to have a relationship with a parrot, that parrot has to select me. In order for that to happen, that parrot has to be comfortable. I have to come in open and quiet and calm. Much like that 12-year-old boy that met the mean dog next door and never had a problem. Much like that 12-year-old boy that went hiking and saw a mountain lion. I\u2019m acting like the 12-year-old boy again around the parrots, and what that does is help me confront my trauma rather than carry it around. Because now I\u2019m with a psychiatrist, and I\u2019m talking about how this bird didn\u2019t feel so good today and wasn\u2019t very comfortable and was kind of hiding in the back of the cage, and the psychiatrist goes, \u2018Hmm, you\u2019re starting to talk about emotions.\u2019 I\u2019m talking about how the bird was feeling, but I\u2019m also transferring my own emotions. So being with the parrots allows me to take that third-person look at my own trauma, which you can never do when you\u2019re whacked out on Vicodin and Budweiser and living under a cement highway bridge.\u2019\u2019The more time I spent at Serenity Park last summer, the more I came to think in terms of the expansive anatomy of empathy. And not just the shared neuronal circuitry that has now been mapped across species, from us to the other primates to elephants and whales and, we now know, to creatures with entirely different, nonmammalian brains, like crows and parrots. I thought, as well, of the extraordinary capacity conferred by that circuitry to recognize and respond to the specific infirmities, both psychic and physical (although those are essentially one and the same) of another species.I got a sense early on at the park of which parrots and veterans seemed most drawn to one another. The way, for example, Simmons said that the lilac-crowned Amazon, Dagwood, came to life around Jim Minick, the former Navy helicopter crewman. But I learned only later about the true depth of such bonds.\u2018\u2018You know, Jim does a great job of hiding how wounded he was,\u2019\u2019 Simmons told me. \u2018\u2018He has tattoos all over the elbow he can\u2019t use anymore, and he won\u2019t talk about it, but at one point he was sitting on the edge of the bed with a shotgun in his mouth and tears rolling down his face. On that same night, he drove his car into a tree, drunk out of his mind. So he comes to Serenity Park, and Jim doesn\u2019t know the history of any of the birds, and which bird loved him at first? Dagwood, the one with a screwed-up wing and a crooked beak. There\u2019s no way to explain it.\u2019\u2019Jason Martinez, who suffered traumatic brain injuries parachuting into Afghanistan and now suffers from epileptic seizures, was immediately drawn to Molly, an African gray, the only parrot at Serenity Park, he learned only later, with epilepsy. And then there were the daily cheek-to-cheek murmurings between the bedraggled, drawer-bound Goffin\u2019s cockatoo, Bobbi, and a blond 21-year-old ex-Marine named Josh Lozon.\u2018\u2018Let\u2019s talk about Josh,\u2019\u2019 Simmons said. \u2018\u2018A good-looking guy with curly hair. He\u2019s a little scary. He\u2019s so broken, all of his wounds are still hidden. Who gets along with him best? Bobbi, mostly naked, bleeding from her remaining feathers. A bird who looks like a damn pterodactyl that went through a buzz saw.\u2019\u2019Of all the veterans I encountered at the sanctuary, Lozon was by far the most skittish. The one time I was able to chat with him at length was when I found him early one morning atop an elevated wooden porch, one flight above a work shed, scrubbing the bars of an empty bird cage with a brush. My decision to head up the narrow steps that lead to it effectively trapped him up there.He joined the Marines, he said, because he \u2018\u2018wanted to hurt somebody.\u2019\u2019 He told me he received an exceptional score on his recruitment aptitude test, which landed him an office job working with computers, a post suited to his intellectual abilities but not his disposition. Sent to the V.A. for evaluation after frequent episodes of insubordination and erratic behavior, he was prescribed mood stabilizers and antipsychotics, neither of which, he sheepishly confided, he was presently taking, thanks to Serenity Park.He was not able to put into words what exactly went on between him and the parrots. All he kept saying was, \u2018\u2018It\u2019s something about the cages.\u2019\u2019 Feeling his growing discomfort, I descended the stairs. Back on the ground, I looked up at Lozon, who was peacefully cooing and chirping back and forth with Koko, the Australian Adelaide rosella. He suddenly looked down at me. \u2018\u2018They\u2019re in these cages and helpless,\u2019\u2019 Lozon said, \u2018\u2018and it\u2019s not their fault.\u2019\u2019 He paused, and I started away. \u2018\u2018But for me,\u2019\u2019 he continued, \u2018\u2018I think it\u2019s also that when I\u2019m alone with them in those cages, I feel I don\u2019t have to conform to what everyone expects of me. I\u2019m free to be an animal again.\u2019\u2019In the late afternoon on my last day at the sanctuary, I seemed to be the only one around. I passed Koko in his cage, sounding his particular strains of the park\u2019s ongoing symphony of stranded human speech. I thought then of the numerous anecdotes people have told of wild-parrot flocks learning, via \u2018\u2018cultural transmission,\u2019\u2019 to speak the human words taught to them by reintegrated former pets. In the parks of Sydney, Australia, where there are native wild-parrot flocks, people regularly overhear a \u2018\u2018Hello, darling\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018What\u2019s happening?\u2019\u2019 sounding from the trees above. The early German naturalist explorer Alexander von Humboldt wrote of encountering, during his travels in South America toward the close of the 18th century, a parrot that was the last living repository of the language of the extinct Atures Indian tribe.All alone now among the sanctuary\u2019s parrots, I got a sudden glimpse of a possible future. One long beyond us and our traumas. A world of winged dinosaurs, soaring and chatting back and forth, their different local dialects inflected here and there with the occasional broken shards of a long lost one: \u2018\u2018Hey, sweetheart.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Whoa! C\u2019mon man!\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Whatever!\u2019\u2019Nearing Serenity Park\u2019s exit, I decided to turn back and step inside Cashew\u2019s quarters for a moment. I had only to nestle close to her perch and she immediately hopped on my back. Crisscrossing my shoulders as I had watched her do with Lilly Love, she stopped at one point for what I assumed would be the parrot equivalent of a kiss. Instead, she began to clean my teeth: her beak lightly tapping against my enamel, the faint vibrations strangely soothing. Immediately afterward, she took a brief nap in my shirt\u2019s left breast pocket \u2014 it felt as if I\u2019d grown another heart \u2014 then re-emerged and crawled to the top of my head. She strolled about there for a time before plucking out one of her own deep blue-green feathers and then descending to gently place it on my left shoulder. I have it still.Charles Siebert is a contributing writer for the magazine.

{"Headline": "Walmart to Close 269 Stores as Retailers Struggle", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byThe closures underscore the turmoil faced by brick-and-mortar retail across a variety of fronts. Web merchants are gobbling up a growing share of shopping dollars, their vast online catalogs rendering Walmart\u2019s sprawling superstores increasingly less relevant. And consumers are spending less on traditional retail items like apparel.\u201cClosing stores is never an easy decision, but it is necessary to keep the company strong and positioned for the future,\u201d Doug McMillon, Walmart\u2019s president and chief executive, said in a statement.\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that we\u2019ll open well more than 300 stores around the world next year,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we are committed to growing, but we are being disciplined about it.\u201dMr. McMillon had warned investors late last year that the company was considering shifts in its retail strategy. At the higher end of its new plan to add 142 to 165 new stores, Walmart\u2019s store base in the United States would still rise; at the lower end, Walmart would, for the first time, shrink its United States footprint.The closings account for less than 1 percent of global square footage and revenue, which totaled $485 billion last year. Walmart\u2019s exit from its smaller-format stores also highlights the difficulties it has faced in reaching more urban consumers. Introduced in 2011, its Express stores are slightly larger than a typical dollar store and were an effort to establish the retailer in bigger cities. But they have failed to make significant inroads or generate enough returns in the face of cutthroat competition from dollar stores and other discounters.Over all, Walmart has been slow to pull out of a flat sales period after the recession and was slow to react to the pace of growth in online shopping.Although sales have improved, the retailer has warned of lower profits going forward because of its investments in its work force and e-commerce. Over the last year, Walmart\u2019s stock has tumbled 30 percent to its lowest level in half a decade.Despite heavy spending on e-commerce initiatives, Walmart\u2019s online sales growth is slowing.\u201cPhysical retail, and large box in particular, is at a tipping point,\u201d Richard Church, a retail analyst at the data analytics firm Discern, wrote in an email.\u201cThere are too many stores in the U.S. across all retail sectors, low end to high end and everything in between,\u201d Mr. Church wrote. \u201cThis is never more evident than when consumer demand is sluggish and decelerating, as it is now.\u201dThere are bright spots in retail, like Lululemon Athletica, which raised its earnings outlook as it continued to ride a boom in athletics wear. L Brands, which owns Victoria\u2019s Secret, reported its \u201cbest December ever\u201d after the lingerie brand generated holiday buzz with a star-studded fashion show.Noam Paransky, a director in the retail practice at the consulting firm AlixPartners, said that retailers were reaching the limits of competing on price, especially with online merchants eager to beat prices.Brick-and-mortar retailers needed to come up with a better proposition, he said, to lure shoppers into their stores.\u201c\u00a0\u2018Stack it high and let it fly\u2019 doesn\u2019t work anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to figure out how to make shopping fun again.\u201dAbout 16,000 store employees will be affected worldwide by the closings, Walmart said. The stores are scheduled to shut down by the end of January.Walmart said it intended to transfer as many workers as it could to nearby stores and offer severance pay to those who do not find new positions. The company is the nation\u2019s largest private-sector employer.Workers\u2019 groups blasted Walmart\u2019s move.\u201cFor Walmart, its workers are disposable,\u201d said Jess Levin, communications director at Making Change at Walmart, a group backed by the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union and a longtime critic of working conditions at the retailer.\u201cThese latest store closings could very well be just the beginning,\u201d she said. \u201cThis sends a chilling message to the company\u2019s hard-working employees that they could be next.\u201dOf the 154 locations Walmart will close in the United States, 102 will be Walmart Express stores. The company said it would focus more on the slightly larger Neighborhood Market format, which has logged stronger sales (though it will also close 23 of those stores). Walmart is also closing 12 supercenters and four Sam\u2019s Club membership stores.The bulk of Walmart\u2019s 115 closings overseas are in Brazil, where the economy is slowing. The retailer will also close 55 primarily small, loss-making stores in other Latin American markets, it said. The closures are expected by the end of the month.Walmart said that costs associated with the closings would shave an estimated 20 to 22 cents from its earnings per share, and that the effect would be felt mostly in its fourth-quarter results, which it reports next month. That effect is not reflected in its quarter or full-year earnings guidance.Advertisement"}

That has not been confirmed either by the tax authorities or by Google.Lack of transparency over how the amount was calculated has prompted additional complaints and led to fresh calls for companies to publish their tax returns to allow the public to judge for themselves. Mr. Corbyn noted that, unlike Google, ordinary taxpayers \u201cdo not get the option of 25 meetings with 17 ministers to decide what their rate of tax is.\u201dMr. Cameron countered that part of the tax recovered was based on revenue Google had generated in years which the Labour Party was in power under prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.If Mr. Corbyn is angry, Mr. Cameron said, \u201cmaybe he should start by calling Tony Blair.\u201d He continued: \u201cYou can get him at JPMorgan. Call Gordon Brown. Apparently, you can get him at a Californian bond dealer called Pimco.\u201dWith public spending restrained following the financial crisis of 2008, and amid a growing debate over wealth inequality, the amount of taxes paid by corporations like Google, Facebook and Amazon remains a highly sensitive issue. The ability of big multinational corporations to limit their tax liabilities has stirred resentment in many countries.\u201cIt has never seemed fair that some of these companies \u2014 no matter how wonderful the service they provide \u2014 should be paying so much less in tax than the high street tearooms and bookshops they have pulverized,\u201d Mr. Johnson wrote.The British news media have contrasted their government\u2019s approach to that of France and Italy, which, they have reported, are seeking to extract more in taxes from Google.In a statement, Google said that it would \u201cnow pay tax based on revenue from U.K.-based advertisers, which reflects the size and scope of our U.K. business.\u201d It added, \u201cThe way multinational companies are taxed has been debated for many years, and the international tax system is changing as a result.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why the Post Office Makes America Great", "Date": "2016-01-01", "News": "Supported byI WAS transported recently to a place that is as enchanting to me as any winter wonderland: my local post office.In line, I thought fondly of the year I came to this country from Turkey as an adult and discovered the magic of reliable mail service. Dependable infrastructure is magical not simply because it works, but also because it allows innovation to thrive, including much of the Internet-based economy that has grown in the past decade. You can\u2019t have Amazon or eBay without a reliable way to get things to people\u2019s homes.Of course, infrastructure is also boring, so we get used to it and forget what a gift it truly is. I never do, maybe because I discovered it so late.My first year in the United States was full of surprises. I remember trying to figure out if the 24-ounce glass of ice water the waitress placed in front of me was a pitcher, to be shared by the whole table. But where was the spout? I had expected some of what I encountered \u2014 I had seen enough movies, and came to this country expecting big cars and big houses and wide open spaces. I got used to gigantic glasses.But I didn\u2019t expect the post office.The first time I needed to mail something, I trekked over to my campus\u2019s post office, looking for the line to get my envelope weighed. The staff was used to befuddled international students like me, I suppose, and one clerk took my envelope without fuss, said \u201cfirst class letter,\u201d and took my change.Then I discovered some vending machines outside the office. People came and bought stamps. \u201cSo many people must be into stamp collecting,\u201d I thought to myself. Was that another weird American quirk? Otherwise, why would people waste money buying stamps in advance, without having their letters weighed?Something I take for granted now just didn\u2019t occur to me: There were standardized rates, and you could just slap a stamp on your letter, drop it in a mailbox, and it would go to its destination.I then encountered a visa service that asked me to mail in my passport. My precious, precious passport. With a self-addressed, stamped envelope for its return. I laughed at the audacity of the request. Despite being a broke student, I booked a plane trip. I couldn\u2019t envision putting my passport in the mail. I\u2019ve since learned that this is a common practice, and I\u2019ve even done it once or twice myself. But it still does not come easy to me.I noticed that Americans were a particularly patriotic bunch: So many of them had red flags on their mailboxes. Sometimes they would put those flags up. I presumed it was to celebrate national holidays I did not yet know about. But why did some people have their flags up while others did not? And why weren\u2019t they American flags anyway? As in Istanbul, where I grew up, I assumed patriotism had different interpretations and expressions.Yes, I was told, in the United States, mail gets picked up from your house, six days a week, free of charge.I told my friends in Turkey about all this. They shook their heads in disbelief, wondering how easily I had been recruited as a C.I.A. agent, saying implausibly flattering things about my new country. The United States in the world\u2019s imagination is a place of risk taking and ruthless competition, not one of reliable public services.I bit my tongue and did not tell my already suspicious friends that the country was also dotted with libraries that provided books to all patrons free of charge. They wouldn\u2019t believe me anyway since I hadn\u2019t believed it myself. My first time in a library in the United States was very brief: I walked in, looked around, and ran right back out in a panic, certain that I had accidentally used the wrong entrance. Surely, these open stacks full of books were reserved for staff only. I was used to libraries being rare, and their few books inaccessible. To this day, my heart races a bit in a library.Over the years, I\u2019ve come to appreciate the link between infrastructure, innovation \u2014 and even ruthless competition. Much of our modern economy thrives here because you can order things online and expect them to be delivered. There are major private delivery services, too, but the United States Postal Service is often better equipped to make it to certain destinations. In fact, Internet sellers, and even private carriers, often use the U.S.P.S. as their delivery mechanism to addresses outside densely populated cities.Infrastructure is often the least-appreciated part of what makes a country strong, and what makes innovation take flight. From my spot in line at the post office, I see a country that does both well; not a country that emphasizes one at the expense of the other.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Pegi Vail Knows About Backpackers", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "Supported byQ&AQ. Why the focus on backpacker culture?Describe a typical backpacker then and now.Most are still in their 20s, equally male and female and even if they\u2019re on a shoestring, the majority are from middle- to middle-upperclass families. However, the racial and ethnic profiles have changed with the education and income levels in different countries. So now there are many more travelers from Asia, Brazil, Russia and India. And they\u2019re using social media as much as, if not more than, Lonely Planet. That element of being connected, among themselves and to people back home, is the biggest change.You begin your film with the story of Yossi Ghinsberg, who in 1981 was lost in the Bolivian jungle for a month. His book about his adventures sparked a boom in backpacker travel to the town of Rurrenabaque. Your film showed how locals created canned adventures for the travelers who poured in.That\u2019s a very typical example of what can happen. In the case of Rurrenabaque, there aren\u2019t any policies that limit the numbers. Communities really need to plan ahead or at least react quickly to save their cultural and environmental resources.Your most jarring example of backpacker tourism run amok was Haad Rin, a town on the Thai island of Ko Pha Ngan, which went from a little-known beach to a giant party place, famous for its full-moon parties. What is the situation now?I was there in 1987. There were just a few huts to stay in, and in my youthful notions of paradise, that was it. Back then, it was really chill and beautiful. Now it\u2019s mostly buildings. I went after another backpacker told me about it, so of course I was part of that process. It keeps growing and now they have half-moon and quarter-moon parties.Chalal\u00e1n is a great example because the people there have really become stewards of their own land and culture. We actually saw a number of backpackers who had decided to splurge at Chalal\u00e1n; also, you can often get cheaper rates when you sign up in person. It\u2019s really about the things people value. Some backpackers don\u2019t blink about spending tons on beer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Drone Lobbying Heats Up on Capitol Hill", "Date": "2016-01-24", "News": "The efforts in the halls of Congress are to shape the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s approach to drone rules on safety and privacy. They are part of a multifront intervention by advocates for broader drone use as well as by their opponents, who argue that the machines pose significant safety and privacy risks. Together, the two sides have quickly emerged as a vocal and passionate contingent in this city.\u201cNow that there is so much interest and money in drones, everyone wants to get their say\u201d said Ryan Calo, an assistant professor of law at the University of Washington who is focused on robotics. A bill under consideration in Congress \u201cis a way for people who aren\u2019t getting what they want out of the process or getting it fast enough to get their views injected.\u201dThe goals of the drone hobbyists, companies and safety advocates differ in some ways. Hobby groups are trying to peel back recreational registration rules, while airline pilots are pushing for more mandates that drone makers like DJI and GoPro put safety technology on machines. Amazon and Google, which want to use drones for delivery, are asking permission to test their technology. They agree, though, that the F.A.A. is due for fresh guidance on its approach to drone rules.On Capitol Hill, where much of the attention has turned in recent weeks, lobbyists are focusing on a reauthorization bill for the F.A.A. The bill gives the agency guidance on regulations and funding for projects like commercial drone testing sites. It can also include more specific instructions, like for the agency to strengthen \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or loosen \u00e2\u0080\u0094 safety and privacy rules for the use of drones.Lawmakers are close to finishing a draft on the bill, which several congressional aides said would include mandates on drones. A draft could be completed by early February, the aides said. It is unclear if the lobbying efforts will have much effect on lawmakers; aides said various lobbyists who have asked for meetings are asking for a broad set of provisions.Yet, Amazon and Google clearly see the reauthorization bill as an opportunity to advance their goal of using drones to deliver packages from warehouses to doorsteps. Drone deliveries are now restricted, and proposed rules by the F.A.A. would keep those drones grounded for the foreseeable future. The companies are pushing lawmakers to allow for experimental testing of drone delivery in sparsely populated areas and more research and development of delivery plans, according to Michael E. Drobac, a leader of Akin Gump\u2019s unmanned aerial vehicle lobbying practice, which represents Amazon.\u201cWe expect regulations to come in stages,\u201d Mr. Drobac said. \u201cAny delivery company will look for mechanisms now for delivery in less densely populated areas.\u201dAmazon and Google have also pushed lawmakers to apply pressure on the F.A.A. to move faster with their first-time rules for commercial drones, Mr. Drobac said. The rules are not expected to allow delivery at first, but lobbyists say it could be an important first step forward in their plans.\u00e2\u0080\u009cCompanies want to be able to benefit from drones by flying beyond visual line of sight, or near congested areas or over people, in a way that is safe,\u201d said Lisa Ellman, a lawyer at Hogan Lovells, which represents commercial drone hardware and software makers. \u201cThe F.A.A. is taking steps in that direction, but slowly.\u201dGoPro, DJI and other makers of recreational drones, meanwhile, are lobbying against more rules. In December, the F.A.A. introduced its mandatory registration system for recreational drone users, and some lawmakers and safety advocates said the agency needs to go further to prevent collisions in the air and to keep users accountable. DJI and GoPro executives sat on the F.A.A.\u2019s task force that came up with recommendations for the registration system that began in December.The Air Line Pilots Association has been urging lawmakers to require point-of-sale registration at retail stores or online. And it is lobbying for provisions in the reauthorization bill that would require \u201csense and avoidance\u201d technology that would automatically steer a drone away from a nearby object.\u201cThe proliferation of these vehicles has reached a point where there needs to be a more aggressive approach to safety,\u201d said Tim Canoll, president of the Air Line Pilots Association.Some of those concerns were echoed last week by Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, the group that will oversee the drafting of the F.A.A.\u2019s reauthorization bill. He wrote letters to the F.A.A., Department of Homeland Security, NASA, and Pentagon calling on them to coordinate on drone safety and security.Every time a drone is spotted \u201cnear an airport runway, or used to smuggle contraband over a prison wall, reminds us that this technology poses another kind of threat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Nelson wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI ask that your agencies increase collaboration to mitigate the risk.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFollowAdvertisement"}

Redstone, Viacom\u2019s 92-year-old chairman, holds a majority of the voting power through his holding company, National Amusements, meaning any changes would have to come at the will of the media mogul.Frustrated shareholders, who include Gamco Investors\u2019 chief executive, Mario Gabelli, have had no recourse other than to complain publicly.\u201cAt the end of the day, they can tell us to pound sand, and we\u2019re kind of stuck,\u201d Mr. Jackson, a managing director at SpringOwl, said in a phone interview. \u201cViacom made sense to own because even though we\u2019ve got some strong criticisms over the C.E.O., it\u2019s so lowly valued, in our view, there could be a number of things that become catalysts.\u201dMr. Jackson owns a relatively small amount of Viacom, well below the threshold of 5 percent required to file with regulators.\u201cViacom\u2019s board and management team are completely focused on delivering long-term value to shareholders,\u201d said a Viacom spokesman, Carl Folta. \u201cWe are looking to the future, and the opportunities ahead.\u201dThe company, which owns Nickelodeon, MTV and Paramount Pictures, has a slumping stock price, a well-compensated management team and board and a decade of missed opportunities online, says Eric Jackson.He added that the company was \u201cencouraged by the growth in our strong international business, the ratings upswings at most of our networks, Paramount\u2019s strong start in 2016, our leadership position in advertising technology and other positive recent developments.\u201dViacom\u2019s stock price has underperformed peers, currently trading at half the level of its July 2014 peak. The report estimates that replacing Viacom\u2019s chief executive, Philippe P. Dauman, could provide the most upside to the stock. Mr. Dauman, along with the chief operating officer, Thomas E. Dooley, were granted a combined $432 million in cash and stock over the five years through 2014, higher than comparable executives at CBS, Disney, Time Warner and Fox, according to SpringOwl figures.Mr. Jackson declined to specify who would be a fit replacement for Mr. Dauman, but suggested that someone would need to have a better understanding of digital strategies. Viacom, under Mr. Dauman\u2019s leadership, had sold the half of Vice Media it owned for $3 million in 2007, the report showed. He also suggested that the management team consider partnerships for Paramount Pictures with Alibaba or Amazon, as well as a merger with AMC.Mr. Jackson also notes how Mr. Redstone, facing a legal battle from a former companion questioning his mental capacity, has skipped earnings calls and shareholder meetings.Mr. Jackson criticizes the makeup of Viacom\u2019s board, saying that only 27 percent could truly be classified as independent. Viacom counts Deborah Norville, host of the CBS-produced program \u201cInside Edition,\u201d as an independent director, even though Mr. Redstone also owns a controlling stake in CBS.Mr. Jackson says he has had little luck reaching executives at Viacom.\u201cWe have reached out to the company to try and communicate these ideas, and it hasn\u2019t been a great experience getting a hold of them so far,\u201d Mr. Jackson said.Separately, a shareholder filed a lawsuit contending that board members of Viacom and CBS are conflicted and have put the interests of the Redstone family before that of those of the companies. The suit charges a breach of fiduciary duty and a waste of corporate assets.In the suit, E. F. Greenberg says that none of the directors are independent and that they are responsible for \u201csubstantial financial and reputational damages\u201d at the companies. One example is the \u201cmany millions of dollars\u201d paid to Mr. Redstone for serving as executive chairman of Viacom and CBS while \u201cphysically and mentally incapacitated.\u201dThe suit is based on the accusations made by Mr. Redstone\u2019s former companion, Manuela Herzer, in a separate court battle.Mr. Folta, the Viacom spokesman, called the shareholder suit \u201cwithout merit.\u201d Dana McClintock, a CBS spokesman, declined to comment.Viacom\u2019s chief executive has said that while Mr. Redstone has physical disabilities he is engaged and attentive. During the three-year period from 2012 to 2014, Mr. Redstone\u2019s total compensation from the two companies was more than $169 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Video Collections Examine Machines Modern and Less So", "Date": "2016-01-14", "News": "Supported byEarly film artists were acutely aware of motion pictures as a machine-based art particularly qualified to embody the feel of modernity and the pace of urban life. Recurring preoccupations for the avant-garde of the 1920s included the mechanical man and the metropolis. Both can be found, somewhat battered by time, in the films of Manfred Kirchheimer and the Brothers Quay, contemporary artists with works newly out on disc.A 45-minute film shot largely in 1977 with the help of Mr. Kirchheimer\u2019s students at the New York Institute of Technology, \u201cStations of the Elevated\u201d may be the single most evocative record of the vernacular expression damned and celebrated as Graffiti Art. Mr. Kirchheimer documents elevated subway cars as billboards in motion, transforming graffiti into a form of kinetic sculpture while, enhanced by Charles Mingus\u2019s bluesy music, establishing a dialectical relationship between urban vitalism and postindustrial entropy.The movie is at once affirmative and alienated. Mr. Kirchheimer\u2019s protagonists are not the graffiti writers but New York\u2019s battered, near-derelict subway cars, stolidly rolling through bombed-out Bronx neighborhoods and toward Brooklyn\u2019s beaches, past cemeteries, abandoned tenements and the acceptable graffiti of garish advertising posters.Now digitally restored, \u201cStations\u201d is packaged by Oscilloscope on a two-DVD set, \u201cStations of the Elevated and the New York Films,\u201d with several of Mr. Kirchheimer\u2019s earlier documentaries. \u201cColossus on the River\u201d (1965) is a beautifully framed if conventional look at the city\u2019s vanished harbor; \u201cClaw: A Fable\u201d (shot in 1958 and completed in 1968) is a densely edited contemplation of Manhattan construction sites that, in its use of gargoyles and statues to comment on the urban scene, anticipates the less obviously allegorical narrative found in \u201cStations.\u201dAlthough triumphantly revived 15 months ago at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Mr. Kirchheimer\u2019s appreciation of graffiti was not always appreciated. \u201cStations\u201d had its premiere at the 1981 New York Film Festival, on a bill with Errol Morris\u2019s \u201cVernon, Florida.\u201d The movie would become a legend among graffiti enthusiasts, but at the time it went largely unreviewed. I was an exception, criticizing \u201cStations\u201d in The Village Voice as \u201cdecline-and-fall glum,\u201d suggesting that Willie Col\u00f3n might have provided a more appropriate score, and unfavorably comparing it with Agn\u00e8s Varda\u2019s documentary of Los Angeles street art \u201cMur Murs,\u201d also in the festival.Perhaps I\u2019ve mellowed or become nostalgic, but \u201cStations of the Elevated\u201d feels improved with age, a historical record of a transient epoch.Although born in Norristown, Pa., in 1947 and long living in London, the Quays practice a distinctively Central European mode of animated puppetry and cultivated a kindred worldview. Their animations suggest a grimmer version of Wes Anderson\u2019s imaginary Zubrowka (from \u201cThe Grand Budapest Hotel\u201d). Quay Land is a chunk of petrified Mitteleuropa preserved under perpetually overcast skies beneath a dusty bell jar.\u201cThe Cabinet of Jan Svankmajer,\u201d named for the Czech Surrealist who is the Quays\u2019 greatest precursor, is a kind of demented music box populated by a variety of dolls, machines and animals \u2014 somewhat more precious and less brutal than Svankmajer\u2019s animations. \u201cStreet of Crocodiles,\u201d which takes its title and iconography from the work of the Polish writer-artist Bruno Schulz, incorporates live insects as well as actual people. The self-exiled Polish animator Walerian Borowczyk is another Quay touchstone, as is the Czech collagist Jiri Kolar. \u201cMaska\u201d (2010) was inspired by the Polish science-fiction writer Stanislaw Lem, and the Quays have also adapted Franz Kafka along with one of Kafka\u2019s favorite authors, the Swiss eccentric Robert Walser.Beginning with \u201cRehearsals for Extinct Anatomies\u201d (1987), the Quays\u2019 films grew increasingly austere and creepy; later pieces, like the \u201cStill Nacht\u201d series (the first of which was commissioned as an \u201cart interlude\u201d by MTV), are stranger and more experimental in their miniature landscapes and impossible perspectives. The Quays also began making music videos, of which the most radical is \u201cIn Absentia\u201d (2000), a homage to the German graphomaniac Emma Hauck, closely synchronized to music by Karlheinz Stockhausen.Zeitgeist\u2019s new Blu-ray, \u201cThe Short Films of the Quay Brothers,\u201d includes 15 of the Quays\u2019 short films plus an eight-minute tribute made in 2015 by their mainstream admirer Christopher Nolan. As dense and repetitive as the movies are, a little Quay-ness goes a long way, but there is no mistaking the power of the twins\u2019 worldview. Their uncanny movies seem to document the after-hours life of a musty \u201cwonder cabinet\u201d held by a provincial museum moldering away in some once Habsburg backwater.NEWLY RELEASEDAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Good Governance Stock Index Lacks Expert Judgment", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Supported byAnother ViewLast week in Davos, Switzerland, a group of giant pension funds unveiled a new stock index, the Standard & Poor\u2019s Long-Term Value Creation Global Index.In the image of the World Economic Forum whence it came, the index aspires to collect the best-run global companies, by evaluating their governance, financial quality and sustainability initiatives. Most Standard & Poor\u2019s indexes are defined by mere region and asset class. What is the purpose of a stock index composed of supposed global elites?\u201cWe are trying to use the index to change corporate behavior,\u201d said Mark Wiseman of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, a member of the group that established the index.So how will the Standard & Poor\u2019s Long-Term Value Creation Global Index work? Its marketing materials point out that despite the qualitative nature of the criteria \u2014 long-term strategy, innovation, sustainability \u2014 do not worry, \u201cexpert judgment is limited.\u201d Instead of experts using their brains, the \u201cindex\u201d will rely on a messy stew of checklists and quantitative models. The \u201cquality score,\u201d for instance, seeks to tell us how good a business is based on a formula with three inputs: return on equity, financial leverage and a rudimentary balance sheet metric. This is, of course, madness.Here we have an opaque, quantitative investment strategy masquerading as an S.&P. index based on qualitative factors. And what are the largest holdings of this \u201cindex\u201d of long-term value creators? What are the elite companies that Mr. Wiseman hopes will be the envy of their peers? Perhaps visionaries like Google, Amazon or Berkshire Hathaway? Nope. The top 10 holdings include two cigarette makers, McDonald\u2019s, and, why not, McGraw Hill Financial, which happens to own Standard & Poor\u2019s.What\u2019s especially frustrating about this ill-advised plan is that the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and its cohorts should know better. Public pension plans have learned a lot of tough lessons about the cost of bad public company governance. For much of the 1970s and 1980s, passive institutional investors struggled with their responsibilities as large public company shareholders. After they were exploited for years by both corporate raiders and entrenched management teams, General Motors\u2019 1986 buyout of Ross Perot\u2019s stake in the automaker drove them over the edge. The head of the State of Wisconsin Investment Board proclaimed, \u201cIf shareholders continue to be passive, they will continue to be shorn like sheep.\u201dBy the end of the 1980s, many large institutional investors were doing their homework. They ran proxy fights, submitted scores of shareholder resolutions and formed opinions on sophisticated corporate governance issues. This paved the way for the kind of shareholder activism that dominates markets today. The current explosion in hedge fund shareholder activism, which has pressured corporations like Microsoft, Apple, DuPont and General Electric, has been fed by the (often tacit) support of large institutional investors behind the scenes.And now, rather than directly challenging offenders as a shareholder activist might, the pension funds want to ride the growing wave of indexation to create an exclusive collection of best-in-class companies. They hope to lure retail investors into this \u201cindex,\u201d which they believe can provide excellent investment returns while encouraging corporate management teams to focus on long-term value creation. The problem is, you can\u2019t identify great, long-term oriented companies with quantitative models and checklists.The proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services provides a cautionary tale about relying on checklists to evaluate corporate boards. Robert A.G. Monks and Nell Minow, two renowned scholars of corporate governance, founded I.S.S. in 1985 with the best intentions. Mr. Monks and Ms. Minow used their own expert judgment to advise public company shareholders on how to vote their proxies. Since they sold the business in 1992, it has changed hands several times and grown rapidly. Regulations that require investment firms to have robust proxy voting policies have had the peculiar effect of pushing more of them to outsource the responsibility to I.S.S.As the proxy adviser\u2019s growth forced it to resort to standardized, checklist-style evaluations, some of its recommendations became shockingly imprudent. In 2004, I.S.S. advised Coca-Cola shareholders to withhold votes from Warren E. Buffett because of conflicts of interest related to his ownership of Dairy Queen. Apparently, there was no question on I.S.S.\u2019s checklist that asked, \u201cIs the candidate the greatest capital allocator to ever live?\u201dMr. Wiseman, the Canadian pension board and their pension fund partners should know that wise, long-term corporate governance requires the kind of sound business judgment you cannot evaluate by employing a hundred-page checklist. Markets will only reward companies that govern themselves for the long term when large institutional owners use their expert judgment to vote bad boards out of office.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Despite the CES Hype, It\u2019s Better to Wait on That 4K TV", "Date": "2016-01-05", "News": "Supported byTech FixMy advice: Wait at least another year or two before buying it \u2014 the hype and the TV sets themselves.Keep that bottom line in mind as you hear more about 4K TV, named for the high-definition resolution display. Plenty of announcements about the technology are on tap this week at International CES, the consumer electronics show in Las Vegas that is one of the tech industry\u2019s largest trade shows. The high-definition televisions will be a featured attraction at the four-day event, alongside virtual reality devices, drones and new smartphones.But after interviewing several technology companies and testing a premium Samsung 4K TV for more than a week, I was less than convinced that 2016 would be a good year to buy one of the sets. Televisions with the 4K feature remain expensive, ranging from $1,000 to tens of thousands of dollars. More important, the content available in the new 4K video resolution is sparse. And while images encoded in 4K do look better than normal high-definition ones, the differences aren\u2019t jaw-dropping.Still, even with more 4K content coming, the higher resolution may not be worth it. In my tests, I compared Samsung\u2019s flagship 4K television, the JS9500, which costs $4,500, side by side with my three-year-old Panasonic 1080p plasma TV. On the 4K version of \u201cJerry Maguire,\u201d I could see some details that were lost in the 1080p version, such as Cuba Gooding Jr.\u2019s pores, along with some details in the shadows of his face and horizontal lines on a television screen showing a football game. In other words, not breathtaking.More profound differences could be seen in newer content that was produced with 4K in mind, like Amazon\u2019s TV series \u201cMozart in the Jungle.\u201d The colors in that show looked especially vibrant and vivid, and the picture was noticeably clearer in 4K than in 1080p. Amazon declined to make an executive available for comment on its 4K offerings.A telltale sign that it\u2019s too early to buy a fancy television is you still won\u2019t be able to enjoy arguably the biggest show on television in ultra high definition: \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d Jeff Cusson, a spokesman for HBO, which airs the show, said the company had \u201cno plans at this time\u201d to begin supporting 4K content. So fans who were hoping to gaze at the pores of characters like Daenerys Targaryen this year are out of luck. Other popular HBO shows like \u201cGirls,\u201d \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d and the \u201cThe Leftovers\u201d will not be offered in 4K either.\u201c4K adoption has been phenomenally quick,\u201d said Dave Das, a Samsung executive, in an interview. \u201cAdoption has been as fast, or faster, than when we launched 1080p.\u201dSamsung estimates that altogether there are now 800 titles to watch in Ultra HD. Mr. Das said Samsung this quarter would begin selling its first 4K-capable Blu-ray players, which will give consumers another avenue for obtaining 4K content other than streaming.At CES, all the big TV manufacturers, including Sony, Samsung and Panasonic, are highlighting their 4K televisions. Many new sets this year will include high dynamic range. Samsung on Tuesday promoted its next flagship TV, the KS9500, which it says delivers the most realistic color range it has ever offered. Roku, the TV streaming device maker, said on Monday that it was working with TV manufacturers to introduce 60 Ultra HD television sets including Roku\u2019s software this year.And there is new branding for 4K television sets, too. The TVs that include high dynamic range will be called Ultra HD Premium. The Consumer Technology Association, a trade group that represents the electronics industry, said on Monday that the new specification would help consumers understand the differences between various Ultra HD technologies and navigate the growing marketplace.If you\u2019re happy with your current high-definition TV, do yourself a favor and wait at least a year or two before buying an Ultra HD television. By then, there should be plenty more 4K content to watch. Plus TV prices drop rapidly as their features become more commoditized \u2014 if you buy a 4K television set today, a TV with the same features will probably cost less than $1,000 in 2017 or 2018.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "After a Tumultuous Year for Investors, the Experts Look Ahead", "Date": "2015-12-31", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseBut low gas prices and a strong dollar were good for United States consumers, who had more money to spend, lifting the American economy. Even though broad market averages were flat, United States stocks reached lofty valuations by historical measures.These are some of the big questions preoccupying investors as the new year gets underway. For answers, I turned to some of 2015\u2019s most successful investors and analysts for my annual look at the year ahead.\u25a0So much went wrong for investors in energy and other commodities this year that it\u2019s hard to imagine that 2016 could be any worse. This week, a barrel of Brent crude approached $36, the lowest since 2004, continuing what appears to be a record decline from over $100 a barrel in June 2014.The strong dollar added downward pressure on oil and commodities, which are priced in dollars, as the Federal Reserve pursued a tighter monetary policy. Global demand for oil grew in 2015, but not nearly fast enough to keep pace with supply. And China\u2019s economy, where rapid growth was supposed to drive demand for years, cooled noticeably.With oil prices so low, it\u2019s tempting to say the worst is over, as many hedge fund managers did earlier in 2015, only to get burned. But Damien Courvalin, senior strategist in the Global Investment Research Commodities team at Goldman Sachs, told me this week that it was too soon for the all-clear signal. While Goldman expects oil prices to recover eventually, even by late 2016, over the near term the same forces that drove prices to new lows in the last year, starting with oversupply, shadow the market. Goldman\u2019s three-month forecast for oil prices is $38, about where they are now, but they could go as low as $20, Mr. Courvalin suggested.\u201cWe\u2019re more concerned about the downside risks than the upside potential at this point,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople keep asking if it\u2019s time to get excited about energy, but we believe that conversation is premature.\u201dIn theory, slumping prices, and the resulting financial stress for marginal producers, should lead to cutbacks in production. There have been some, \u201cbut supply has proven surprisingly resilient,\u201d Mr. Courvalin said. After a long period of capital investment driven by high prices for oil and other commodities, many production facilities are only now coming on line, \u201cand they\u2019re going to produce, no matter what the price,\u201d Mr. Courvalin said.He compared recent oil price moves to the period from 1976 to 1989. After peaking in 1980, oil prices fell through much of the \u201880s, finally bottoming in 1988. So far, the current period, beginning in 2005, looks similar. If the pattern continues \u2014 a big if \u2014 a recovery should begin by 2018, which is still two years away. \u201cIt could even be another decade,\u201d Mr. Courvalin said, \u201cbefore prices sustainably return to the levels of the past few years.\u201d\u25a0Mr. Heugh, who is based in Hong Kong, manages the Morgan Stanley Institutional Fund Global Opportunity Portfolio, which gained over 20 percent in 2015. Mr. Nadel is senior portfolio manager in New York for Royce\u2019s International Premier Investment Fund, which gained over 17 percent in 2015, and the Royce European Small-Cap Fund, up nearly 14 percent. Both managers invest in relatively concentrated portfolios, by fund standards, that don\u2019t closely track broad indexes, which helped them outperform their respective indexes in the last year by a large margin. And both avoided the energy sector. Mr. Heugh\u2019s largest holdings as of November were Facebook, the software concern Epam Systems and Amazon. Mr. Nadel\u2019s were VZ Holding, a Swiss financial services company; Clarkson P.L.C., a shipping firm based in London, and Bajaj Finance in India.Several money managers are predicting another flat-to-down year for United States equities for the same reasons stocks were flat in 2015 \u2014 high valuations, expectations of rising interest rates, a strong dollar and continued weak oil and commodity prices.But both Mr. Heugh and Mr. Nadel see future opportunities in international stocks. \u201cThe U.S. has outperformed the rest of the world for quite a few years now, and the strong dollar has been exacerbating this trend,\u201d Mr. Heugh said. \u201cThese cycles tend to reverse themselves over time, sometimes violently.\u201dHe sees many opportunities in Asia, including China, which he notes is still growing, even if at a slower pace. \u201cAsia is trading at a discount to its historical multiples of free cash flow and earnings, while the U.S. and Europe are trading at premiums,\u201d he said.But Mr. Heugh focuses more on fundamental stock analysis and less on broad geographic or macroeconomic forces. He said he looked for high-quality companies with competitive advantages that deter potential competitors. Then, \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter which region outperforms in a given year or three- or five-year period, you will become partners in great businesses and have the potential to benefit as partners over time.\u201dMr. Nadel said he also looked for stocks of international companies that benefit from high barriers to entry. \u201cI\u2019m not big on predictions, but the stage is set nicely for investing internationally,\u201d he said. While the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has risen 75 percent over the last five years, international small-cap indexes have contracted slightly. \u201cDividend yields are over twice as generous outside the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cI think in 2016 we could see some catch-up.\u201dHe especially likes some companies based in India, a country with \u201csome of the best 10-year prospects in the world,\u201d and Brazil, whose market \u201chas to have hit rock bottom \u2014 at least, I hope so.\u201d He said he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about the prospects for emerging markets. He praised structural reforms in Japan and said a wave of immigration should eventually benefit developed European economies.\u25a0The long bull market in bonds sputtered in 2015, as the Fed finally raised its target federal funds rate by a quarter point for the first time since 2006. United States Treasuries and most investment-grade corporate bonds barely eked out positive returns, and junk bonds plunged in a panicky sell-off late in the year.Travis King, head of investment-grade credit at Voya Investment Management in New York, managed a 1.3 percent return for the Voya Investment Grade Credit Fund. While modest, that was better than most fixed-income funds, and Morningstar has ranked his fund the No. 1 corporate bond fund over the most recent three-year period. Mr. King said that even with the Fed expected to continue a slow but steady rise in interest rates, he anticipated modest positive returns again in 2016.\u201cOur market view is for a slow and gradual rise in the Fed funds rate, with Japanese and European rates staying very low,\u201d Mr. King said. \u201cIn that environment, we think corporate bonds will be a winning trade, but you have to be selective.\u201d In 2015, his fund rotated toward bonds from money center banks and other financial concerns, which helped it outperform its benchmark. He said he expected to continue that emphasis in 2016. \u201cWe think financials are still a good place to be overweight,\u201d Mr. King said.As for junk bonds, he said he thought that the worst of the sell-off might have run its course. \u201cYields are starting to push 9 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are still avoiding high-yield debt from the energy sector, but elsewhere you\u2019re seeing some stability. In a world where the 10-year Treasury is yielding 2.25 percent, 8 percent or 9 percent starts to look pretty interesting.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It was like I had just walked out of my living room into an iconic American television show.\u201dBelow are excerpts, edited and condensed, from a conversation about Ms. Jones\u2019s experience working on the show and what she has coming up next.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Need to Fret, Apple Is Doing Fine", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtLet\u2019s get this out of the way first: Despite what you may have heard, the iPhone is not dying. Neither, by extension, is Apple.But if Apple is now hitting a plateau, it\u2019s important to remember that it\u2019s one of the loftiest plateaus in the history of business. The $18.4 billion profit that Apple reported on Tuesday is the most ever earned by any company in a single quarter.So this column will try to do something tricky: explore what\u2019s ailing Apple without going off the deep end. Here\u2019s my ice-cold take: Apple is doing quite O.K.Could it be doing some things better? Sure. Are any of its problems urgent? Not particularly, and from what one can tell, it\u2019s working to address many of its shortcomings. Does it face existential threats? Yes, but no more than any other tech giant. Will it remain an outsize presence in the tech industry for years to come, generating profits on a scale that no other corporation can match? Almost certainly.I\u2019ll get to those long-run worries in a bit, but let\u2019s start with the present. At the moment, Apple\u2019s biggest problem is its own success. The iPhone turns nine this year. The iPad turns six. These devices have made Apple the world\u2019s most valuable company (until Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, overtakes it, which might happen soon).Yet the very dominance of Apple\u2019s aging mobile empire inspires doubts about its future. The bigger the iPhone gets, the harder Apple has to work to beat its previous milestones, and the more vulnerable it appears to some fatal technological surprise.But there\u2019s something worth keeping in mind about each of these criticisms. They\u2019re the gripes of a technophile, and they don\u2019t necessarily reflect mainstream consumer perceptions about Apple\u2019s products.But if continued growth sounds like wishful thinking, there\u2019s another path for Apple to prosper even if iPhone sales do hit a wall: Suck more money out of each phone. In a note to clients last fall, analysts at Goldman Sachs suggested that through a widening number of subscription services baked into the iPhone, Apple could begin to reap a huge monthly fee from its users, which it said constituted \u201cthe most lucrative installed base in the world.\u201dIt\u2019s an argument Apple executives are starting to vocalize loudly. On Tuesday\u2019s earnings call, Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said the popularity of the iPhone provided the company a \u201clong-lasting foundation.\u201dApple\u2019s ecosystem is so sticky that people tend to flock to its services even if there are better products out there. Even if I\u2019m not a fan, 10 million people have subscribed to Apple Music in its first six months.Given all these options for minting bullion from the iPhone, the most alarming worries for Apple aren\u2019t about the present. They are about the future beyond the horizon, and they are necessarily speculative.The basic question is this: In the future, will physical devices matter less than they do now? If computers are more like the machines in the movie \u201cHer\u201d \u2014 ethereal, ambient computers that exist in the cloud, that respond to our voices and our bodies, anticipating our desires \u2014 what will happen to Apple then? This is a company whose entire existence hinges on the cultural appreciation of physical things. Can it prosper in an age of ambient computing?These are interesting questions to pose. I had a long conversation with Mr. Thompson about these ideas, and Apple\u2019s apparent weaknesses \u2014 how it\u2019s not as good at artificial intelligence and voice recognition as Google, how it lacks the cloud infrastructure that Amazon has built, and how, most important, its entire corporate culture is geared toward making actual stuff, which could limit its capacity to create fantastic online services.But ultimately the discussion felt academic. It seems obvious that as the tech world changes around it, Apple, over the next decade, will need to reinvent itself. But so will everyone else. That is just what you do in this industry.An earlier version of a credit for an illustration with this article misspelled the illustrator\u2019s surname.
