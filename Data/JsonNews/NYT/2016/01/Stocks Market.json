{"Headline": "China\u2019s Economic Turmoil Sends Ripples to Global Markets", "Date": "2016-01-07", "News": "Supported byNow, it appears to be China\u2019s turn to cause havoc far beyond its borders.China\u2019s challenges have been debated for years, but in recent months they have taken on a greater importance in the minds of investors and policy makers. China was the focus when stocks sold off sharply during the summer, and such worries have again driven global markets down in recent days.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, for instance, plunged 2.4 percent on Thursday after the Chinese currency continued to fall and trading was halted on its stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average is now trading 9.8 percent below the all-time nominal high that it reached last year.China\u2019s convulsions have come at an inopportune time. The Federal Reserve recently increased interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade, a move that appears to have intensified an exodus from riskier markets. And there are signs of weakness in the United States economy, like the manufacturing sector.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.The White House said on Thursday that it was monitoring the turbulence in the markets. \u201cObviously, we\u2019re aware of the kind of volatility that we\u2019ve seen in China over the last several days, and this has had an impact on markets in other countries, including ours,\u201d said the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest. \u201cSo that\u2019s certainly something that we\u2019re closely watching.\u201dChina is in many ways different from the United States or Europe, and its unique strengths and weaknesses are complicating efforts to assess the level of damage that the country might inflict on the rest of the world. This task is made even harder by the enmeshed nature of the world\u2019s markets and economies. Problems in one large country can transmit to other places in several ways \u2014 and they may feed on themselves as they do so.But despite this murkiness, some analysts and economists say they are becoming less optimistic that the United States will remain unscathed by China\u2019s struggles.\u201cIf things were to get really disruptive, global growth would stall to where the U.S. would be affected,\u201d said George Goncalves, a rates strategist at Nomura in New York. \u201cThese issues started percolating last year and they don\u2019t just go away because the calendar year changed.\u201dThe slowing of China\u2019s economy from historically high rates of growth has long been expected to weigh on growth elsewhere. \u201cThe China that had been growing at 10 percent for 30 years was a powerful source of fuel for much of what drove the global economy,\u201d said Stephen S. Roach, a senior fellow at the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs at Yale. The growth rate has slowed to an official figure of around 7 percent. \u201cThat\u2019s a material deceleration,\u201d Mr. Roach said.But investors have long doubted the official numbers. And they are increasingly worried that the Chinese authorities\u2019 handling of the country\u2019s challenges may set off chain reactions that hurt other markets.Much now depends on how China manages the devaluation of its currency, the renminbi. By allowing it to fall against other currencies, the Chinese authorities apparently hope to spur higher exports and reduce imports, bolstering Chinese businesses in the process.Countries devalue all the time without causing too many shock waves. But it is not clear how far the authorities want the currency to fall. \u201cMere uncertainty about where the exchange rate will ultimately be creates higher risk premiums in financial markets,\u201d said Steven Wieting, global chief investment strategist at Citigroup\u2019s private bank. \u201cThat can diminish when there is stability, but we don\u2019t have stability right now.\u201dAnd there are ways in which a Chinese devaluation could go wrong. A devaluation could end up being unsettlingly large. China, for instance, slashed the value of the renminbi in 1994, an event that investors have not forgotten.A steep drop in the renminbi could do significant harm to the real economies of other countries. A much cheaper renminbi could, for instance, make it much harder for companies in, say, Indonesia or South Korea to compete in world markets against Chinese rivals. Some countries might then slash the value of their currencies to regain competitiveness, setting off a currency war.In such a scenario, the dollar, as a safe haven currency, would most likely strengthen, creating a headwind for United States corporations that export into global markets. A stronger dollar would make imports into the United States cheaper, potentially intensifying the forces that have pushed inflation down to a level that has made the Federal Reserve nervous. \u201cInflation is now going to have a hard time rising,\u201d said Mr. Goncalves, the strategist.Fearing that the United States economy might soon sag, investors would most likely clamor for the Fed to hold off on increasing interest rates. A monthslong guessing game over monetary policy could then occur, stoking further uncertainty.Global investors might soon also have to contend with high numbers of defaults in China\u2019s corporate sector. Chinese companies have borrowed billions of dollars in recent years. As the renminbi falls, many companies may find it harder to pay back dollar debts.Most large foreign banks do not appear to be holding dangerous amounts of dollar-denominated debt owed by Chinese corporations. As a result, such banks may avoid taking the sort of losses they suffered on mortgage bonds during the 2008 financial crisis. Still, rising defaults could harm Chinese investors and banks, creating the sort of headlines that could at least cause global investors to scale back their risk-taking.Still, the current storm in the markets may pass, as it did last year.The recovery going on in the rest of the world may yet survive China\u2019s turbulence. Policy makers in Europe, Japan and the United States can always respond aggressively, as they have done in past crises. The dollar could weaken under such stimulus.And China may just be going through a necessary but bumpy adjustment, not a full-blown shakeout.China may, for instance, be able to manage a steady devaluation and absorb corporate defaults while avoiding a dangerous level of financial instability. Its government, after all, has far deeper pockets than the Europeans at the height of the Continent\u2019s crisis. And on some measures, China is still doing rather well. Growth may be slowing, but the Chinese government may ultimately care more about employment than headline growth figures, said Mr. Roach of Yale. And he noted that China\u2019s jobs numbers had been healthy in recent months. This could be a sign that China\u2019s plan to shift more of its economy away from manufacturing and toward the services sector, which creates more jobs, is bearing fruit. \u201cThe bottom line for the economy is that it\u2019s still growing fast enough to create a lot of jobs,\u201d Mr. Roach said.Gardiner Harris contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investment in Internet Start-Ups Appears to Slow in China", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s Internet companies, in recent years, have been the shining stars of growth, with Alibaba and Tencent rivaling in size some of their most formidable global competitors.Inspired by their success and driven by huge buyouts of smaller companies by China\u2019s Internet giants, investors have poured money into new start-ups.But new figures from the end of 2015 show that wave of investment may be coming to an end, or at least slowing.Among the contributors may be the Chinese Internet giants that have fueled the boom. Hiring freezes at Alibaba and Baidu have signaled recent caution about spending, according to Mark Natkin, founder of the research firm Marbridge Consulting in Beijing.\u201cA year or two ago, V.C.s felt they didn\u2019t have to drive a company all the way to I.P.O. for an exit because Baidu, Tencent and Alibaba were rolling down the aisles with their shopping carts,\u201d he said, referring to venture capital firms. He pointed out that now those firms are less focused on smaller companies, and instead are preoccupied with consolidating more mature sectors like group buying and ride-hailing apps.A looming question is how much recent market turmoil in China will affect private fund-raising in 2016. A major slowdown could dent Beijing\u2019s ambitions to continue the rapid growth of the Internet industry.In recent economic plans, the Chinese Communist Party has identified Internet-related businesses as fundamental to the transition of the Chinese economy from one centered on infrastructure investment to one based on consumer spending.Yet the drop-off in China and Asia comes amid a very different context than the drop-off in the United States. In Asia, the increase in venture capital funding rose much more sharply after 2013. Such investment in Asia jumped from just $2.8 billion in the first quarter of 2014 to $14.2 billion in the third quarter of 2015. In the fourth quarter it fell to $9.7 billion.Still, 2015 was a banner year for Asian venture capital investment, with deals totaling $39.7 billion in 2015, well above the $21.1 billion in 2014 and the meager $6.4 billion in 2013.The report said venture capital firms may be sitting out the latest investment rounds because they expect valuations to come back down to earth in the next year or two. In Asia, roughly one-third of investment in start-ups comes from large corporations, compared to just a quarter in North America.Lyndon Fung, an analyst with KPMG\u2019s U.S. capital markets group, wrote in the report that Chinese investors are also increasingly looking abroad.\u201cWe are seeing Chinese V.C. investors and V.C.-backed companies shifting their focus to invest in the international market, where things are a bit more stable, to acquire complementary technologies to strengthen their ecosystem,\u201d he wrote.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Stories Drive the Stock Market", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewSince the stock market began falling at the beginning of this year, there seems to have been a palpable change in the stories we have been hearing. Suddenly there is more willingness to entertain the possibility of a major stock market correction, or of an economic recession.One tale that has been intensified lately has focused on the Chinese economy and its stock market, including sharp market declines at the beginning of 2016. Long-abiding concerns about Chinese overinvestment, shadow banking issues, ghost cities that were built but never inhabited and similar problems have been amplified. In the West the narrative has been colored with emotions. China\u2019s mistakes have been contrasted with Western optimism, our sense of patriotism and our sense of competitiveness.Another current focus is the fact that this year set a record for poor performance of the stock market in the first week of the year. That timing has given the market-decline story wings, though there is really nothing special about such timing. After all, the date of the new year is an arbitrary social convention. There\u2019s a Western Christian New Year, an Orthodox New Year, a Jewish New Year, an Islamic New Year, a Chinese New Year and so forth. The prominence of the Western year in global calendars reflects a history of Western dominance, and that has given the new year the ability to spark stories that evoke mixed, and changing, feelings.A third narrative that is being widely conveyed concerns oil, and the extremely low prices that energy commodities have reached.Just a few years ago the prevailing narrative about oil was all about the amazing United States success with a newly improved extraction method, fracking, to the detriment of the less creative oil-exporting countries. That story has been resonant here in America, where it has been taken as a tale of peculiarly American creativity. The history of modern petroleum may be seen as an American story that goes back to 1859 and Edwin Drake, who showed the world how it was possible, in Titusville, Pa., to drive a pipe deep through bedrock to reach oil. Drake became part of a great social narrative, leading the way to an entrepreneurial revolution in oil production and to still enduring American pride.Unfortunately, the bottom has just dropped out of that narrative, and some of us have gotten emotional about that, too. With this year\u2019s extremely low oil prices, many of these frackers, so recently hailed as heroes, are going out of business. Their very ingenuity in increasing the supply of oil has been part of the problem by contributing to the oil price drop. It is easy to jump from this to broader conclusions: Maybe we\u2019re not so smart after all, or so the new story goes. This thinking is a downer: Sometimes social narratives are quite depressing.Professor MacMullen tries to convey to the reader the feelings people had long ago when they were inspired or dejected. He says he believes this will help us understand history at a deeper level. One emotional story loaded with moral value leads to another, in his retelling. As an example, he gives us the tale of the murder of the abolitionist editor Elijah Lovejoy by a pro-slavery mob in 1837. That story motivated John Brown, helping to lead years later to his revolt and capture and hanging in 1859. And those events created another widely recounted emotional story that helped to lead to the Civil War and, eventually, abolition. Such popular stories are serious matters. They can lead to revolutions, or to market collapses.Those who care about the stock market will surely be living through a new sequence of stories this year, including the four that I have enumerated here. Whether these narratives have a cascading effect, leading to further price decreases and yet more negative stories, is one possibility. But only time will tell us how the stories go.ROBERT J. SHILLER is Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Need for a Tax on Financial Trading", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byEditorialA financial transaction tax \u2014 a per-trade charge on the buying and selling of stocks, bonds and derivatives \u2014 is an idea whose time has finally come. It has begun percolating in the Democratic presidential campaign, with all three candidates offering proposals.Such a tax would also bring the United States more in line with other countries. There are already financial transaction taxes in Britain, Switzerland and South Korea as well as in Hong Kong and other developed markets and emerging nations, generally at rates of 0.1 percent to 0.5 percent on stock transfers. In addition, 10 countries in the European Union, including Germany and France, have agreed to apply a common financial transaction tax starting in 2017, though relentless lobbying by investment banks and hedge funds threatens to delay and even derail the effort.Opponents of the tax have long contended that it would be ineffective because it could be easily avoided. Wall Street\u2019s threat to move to foreign trading venues is one of the reasons a federal financial transaction tax, imposed for much of the 20th century, was gone by the mid-1960s. But as more countries seek to adopt the tax, the claim that American traders would be at a disadvantage has weakened. And high-frequency traders can\u2019t escape abroad, because the speed they seek requires that their computers be located near the exchanges.Critics also contend that a financial transaction tax would have damaging effects on trade volume, volatility and the ability of markets to determine asset prices. That is debatable, and setting the tax rate low at first, and raising it gradually, would help avoid potential damage. But the possibility of unintended consequences is not the real obstacle to a broad and prudent financial transaction tax. It is that a majority of lawmakers are not willing to challenge Wall Street\u2019s power. Imposing the tax will take leadership from the next president.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In China, Shares Remain Volatile; Europe Markets Are Steady", "Date": "2016-01-11", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Chinese stocks plunged again on Monday, as jittery investors worried about whether the authorities could manage the financial market turmoil and a broader economic slowdown.Following steep losses last week, the main Shanghai share index fell 5.3 percent on Monday. The benchmark Shenzhen index ended the day down 6.6 percent.Global stocks, though, largely shrugged off the slump in China, with Asian and European stocks steadying after a tumultuous week. The futures markets pointed to gains on Wall Street.After several months of relative calm, global investors have faced a wild ride, set off by weakness in the Chinese stock market and currency. The troubles have raised concerns about the health of the country\u2019s economy, a major engine of global growth.\u201cA China hard landing is bad for capital markets, and we think the risk is uncomfortably high, higher than we would prefer,\u201d Bob Browne, the chief investment officer at Northern Trust, said Monday morning in an interview in Hong Kong. A sharp slowdown was not the likeliest outcome for China\u2019s economy, Mr. Browne added, but it remained a cause for worry among global investors.The government\u2019s messy attempts to manage the situation have added to investors\u2019 anxiety.While the government is pushing for major overhauls, it has also kept a tight control over areas like the market and currency. It is sending a mixed message to investors, making it more difficult to navigate the markets.Take the so-called circuit breaker mechanism, a newly installed measure that halts trading when losses reach a certain threshold.The mechanism, a response to last summer\u2019s stock plunge, was intended to bring greater stability to the markets. But it deepened the losses last week.The government backtracked, suspending the use of the circuit breaker late Thursday. In a stark admission, the main securities regulator acknowledged that it had \u201cno experience\u201d operating such a mechanism.Adding to the recent uncertainty has been the renewed weakness of China\u2019s currency, the renminbi.The renminbi, which is tightly controlled by the government, has been steadily falling in recent weeks. While that has helped exporters, it has also pushed companies and families to pull money out of the country, in anticipation that their wealth will be worth less.The government tried to calm the markets by setting the renminbi\u2019s official exchange rate stronger against the dollar for the second day in a row. But it is also making it difficult to discern the motives of policy makers.The strengthening in the official exchange rate on Monday set off a scramble for offshore renminbi in Hong Kong, where the currency is more freely traded, albeit in smaller volumes.The overnight bank-to-bank borrowing rate for offshore renminbi in Hong Kong rose sharply on Monday to a record high of 13.4 percent. Such a drastic, short-term spike in demand can indicate a so-called short squeeze, in which investors betting that the currency will continue to weaken are forced to buy it to avoid losses, temporarily increasing its value.Stock investors in China took a dim view of the currency, bringing the total losses on the Shanghai market to 15 percent this year. The sharp sell-off spilled over into Hong Kong, where the Hang Seng, which includes a large numbers of companies from the mainland, closed down 2.8 percent. Markets in Japan were closed for a holiday.Global investors, though, were more sanguine.Shares in Europe were steady, after falling slightly in early trading. The blue-chip FTSE 100 in London rose 0.1 percent in afternoon trading, while the DAX in Frankfurt gained 0.6 percent.An earlier version of this article misstated when China set the renminbi stronger against the dollar. The rate was set stronger on Friday and Monday, not just on Monday.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "After Mass Shootings, Some on Wall St. See Gold in Gun Makers", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byWhile the country reels from a series of mass shootings, each one reigniting the debate over the regulation of firearms, the hottest investments in the stock market seem to be shares of gun manufacturers.But some investors have missed out on the rally in gun stocks by choice. A number of public pension funds and other money managers have moved to sell their stakes in gun and ammunition companies in recent years, arguing that their profits come at too steep a price.Still, the business climate for gun makers has rarely been better. Firearms enthusiasts, whether they are hunters, target shooters or those concerned with their personal safety, buy more guns after mass shootings and the resulting appeals for stricter gun laws. After the call for sales restrictions after the San Bernardino attacks, more guns were sold in December than almost any other month in nearly two decades, according to federal data released this week.On Monday, Smith & Wesson alerted Wall Street analysts and investors that it believed its full-year sales would be higher than expected, above $650 million for its fiscal year, which ends in April. That is up more than 57 percent from its 2012 sales of $412 million.One of the investors\u2019 first targets was the Freedom Group (now called Remington Outdoor), a large gun maker owned by the investment firm Cerberus Capital Management. One of the guns used in the Sandy Hook shootings was a Bushmaster, a Remington Outdoor brand.More guns were sold in December than almost any other month in nearly two decades after President Obama called for new gun-buying restrictions.Likewise, Gotham Asset Management, a firm whose co-investment chief is Joel Greenblatt, a well-known New York money manager, largely sold off its position in Smith & Wesson early last year. But starting last fall, it bought more than a million shares of the company and today is one of the largest shareholders.Neither firm responded to requests for comment.A number of large shareholders in gun manufacturers are the nation\u2019s largest providers of 401(k)\u2019s, including Fidelity Investments, the Vanguard Group and BlackRock. It is unclear whether the stocks are in actively managed funds or in passive index funds, which are intended to mimic the movements of the broader markets.For Mr. Navellier, there was nothing personal driving his decision to invest in Smith & Wesson and Sturm, Ruger. His home in Nevada came with a gun range, but he uses it as a wine cellar. When he inherited some guns from his father-in-law, he gave away the ammunition to his employees and locked the guns away in a safe, he said in a phone interview on Tuesday.Instead, the decision to buy the gun shares had everything to do with profits.\u201cEverybody is so desperate for earnings.

{"Headline": "For Stock Markets, January Is a Cloudy Crystal Ball", "Date": "2016-01-07", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseAs January goes, so goes the entire market year.That\u2019s probably the best-known aphorism from the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac, an annual compilation of dates, statistics and advice for investors first published in 1968 by Yale Hirsch. A prolific author of pithy investment advice, Mr. Hirsch also created the strategy often referred to as \u201cSell in May and go away,\u201d and he identified a year-end seasonal \u201cSanta Claus\u201d rally.His so-called January barometer posits that a decline in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index in January means that major averages will also end that calendar year with a decline, and vice versa if stocks rise during the month.Given the global plunge in stock market prices this week \u2014 United States and European shares dropped sharply on Thursday in the face of market turmoil in China \u2014 it may be a grim year for stock investors. With the S.&P. 500 already down more than 5 percent in just the first four days of trading of the year, this is shaping up as one of the worst Januarys ever. (In January 2009, the index declined 8.6 percent.) If the selling keeps up through the end of the month, the almanac suggests investors should sell stocks and wait for the inevitable further decline.If only it were that simple.It\u2019s tempting to dismiss the January barometer as just another statistical coincidence, along with other market predictors that have enjoyed periodic bursts of popularity, such as the Super Bowl indicator (if the winning team is from the old National Football League, now the National Football Conference, stocks will rise); the Chinese zodiac (years of the rabbit and dragon are best for stocks); or the old hemline indicator (skirt lengths shorten during market upswings and fall to the floor during downturns).The impulse when the stock market falls hard for a few days in a row is to do something but it probably doesn\u2019t make much sense to overhaul an investment strategy based on a blip of market activity.But Mr. Hirsch\u2019s son Jeff, who now runs the publishing and investment business his father founded, calculates that the January barometer has been right 87.7 percent of the time since 1950 (ignoring basically flat years) and 75 percent of the time including all years. He said the percentages were roughly the same extending back to 1938. He also examined all other months of the year, and none displayed any predictive capacity. (April was next best, but showed only a modest correlation with subsequent stock movements, he said.)Traders react to them immediately, usually with considerable foresight, and then the economic implications unfold throughout the year, confirming the traders\u2019 January instincts. \u201cTraders and analysts react to the political agenda, as well as what the new year looks like based on last year and the state of the world economy,\u201d Mr. Hirsch told me this week. \u201cI think that\u2019s the root of it.\u201dEspecially ominous this year is the Almanac\u2019s \u201cFirst Five Days\u201d indicator, which posits that in presidential election years, the market\u2019s performance during the first five days of trading will determine whether the market ends up or down for the year. Mr. Hirsch said that indicator had been accurate in 14 of the last 16 such years.But such causation in the stock market is impossible to prove or disprove, unlike, say, the link between smoking and lung cancer.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.\u201cYou can\u2019t possibly prove this is causal or even predictive, which might be a better concept,\u201d said Rebecca Goldin, a mathematics professor at George Mason University and director of research for Stats.org. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t, but you\u2019d need to know much more.\u201dShe pointed out that a 75 or 87 percent correlation sounds impressive, but not if the stock market goes up every year, in which case it is meaningless. In fact, the stock market does tend to rise more often than it falls: It has gained in 21 of the last 30 years, or 70 percent of the time. So simply predicting every year that the stock market would go up would have been nearly as accurate as the 75 percent rate achieved by the January barometer when all years were included.Moreover, using January to predict the outcome for the full calendar year incorporates January\u2019s results, which further biases the prediction.Given the vast number of variables that might be used to predict stock prices, it\u2019s possible that even a high degree of accuracy of the January barometer is a purely random outcome.\u201cIf you have a truly random variable, and there are, say, 60 million possibilities, it\u2019s impossible not to find some pattern somewhere,\u201d said Nassim Nicholas Taleb, a professor of risk engineering at New York University, author of \u201cThe Black Swan\u201d and a former derivatives trader on Wall Street. \u201cYou might well find a correlation between changes in your grandmother\u2019s blood pressure and stock prices. But that\u2019s a spurious correlation.\u201dHe added, \u201cIt\u2019s surprising we don\u2019t have more weird correlations, given the vast number of possible variables and the large number of markets we have.\u201dProfessor Goldin said that if you flipped enough coins every year, you would most likely find one that predicted stock prices with 100 percent accuracy. \u201cYou could call that a magic coin,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has an impressive correlation looking backward. The problem is, it wouldn\u2019t give you any sense of how well it\u2019s going to do going forward.\u201dThat seems to have been an issue lately with the January barometer, whose accuracy in recent years has been slipping. Over the last 10 years, it gave false negative indications in 2014, 2010, 2009 and 2005, and a false positive in 2011.That\u2019s a success rate of just 50 percent, which is what you would expect from a coin toss.And the magnitude of a January decline doesn\u2019t seem to be a factor. In 2009, after a dreadful start, the S.&P. 500 gained more than 23 percent for the year. In two of the four years since 1950 when the January decline was greater than 6 percent, the index ended the year with a gain.That has not curbed popular demand for Mr. Hirsch\u2019s insights. He has been deluged with media requests this week and has been making television appearances talking about the almanac and the January barometer. Most likely for evolutionary reasons, the human mind looks for patterns, and it is uncomfortable with randomness.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.\u201cThere\u2019s a reason people love almanacs,\u201d Professor Taleb said. \u201cThey purport to find order in random events, like weather or the seasons. People have an irrational belief in them.\u201d\u201cOur brains are hard-wired to find causality,\u201d Professor Goldin said. \u201cThat\u2019s especially true for the stock market. The stock market may not be entirely random, but there\u2019s enough about it that is to make it unpredictable. The desire to find a pattern is really strong because if you\u2019re right, it could make you rich.\u201d(Some, like the mathematician and quantitative hedge fund manager James Simons, do seem to have found such patterns, and Forbes estimates Mr. Simons\u2019s net worth at $14 billion. But as far as is known, his formulas cannot be reduced to a single catchy sentence.)Even Mr. Hirsch does not rely entirely on the January barometer, which he said was just one of many technical and fundamental factors he takes into consideration when making investment decisions. \u201cI try not to be too one-dimensional, and use all the tools available,\u201d he said. Although he\u2019s not nearly as bullish this year as he was last year, \u201cI\u2019m not throwing in the towel yet,\u201d he said.Professor Taleb said that despite this week\u2019s decline in share prices, he would not be buying United States stocks now because of high valuations, rising interest rates and the continuing plunge in commodity prices. And while that decision has nothing to do with a bearish forecast from the January barometer, he doesn\u2019t entirely dismiss such market maxims.\u201cOne thing you learn as a trader is, don\u2019t bet against the folk wisdom,\u201d he said. \u201cThe odds are this is a purely random outcome, but sometimes there\u2019s a kernel of truth in these sayings.\u201dThe Common Sense column on Friday, about what the stock market\u2019s performance in January means for the rest of the year, gave an outdated name for the organization for which Rebecca Goldin, a mathematics professor at George Mason University who commented on the issue, is research director. It is Stats.org, no longer the Statistical Assessment Service.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Case Sheds Light on Goldman\u2019s Role as Lender in Short Sales", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Supported byFair GameBut the smaller settlement merits close study because it sheds light on one of Wall Street\u2019s most secretive and profitable arenas: securities lending and short-selling.Essentially the regulator said Goldman advised its clients that it had performed crucial services for them when it often had not. Customers who paid handsomely for those services may want their money back.The $15 million punishment is just petty cash for Goldman, but this case tells us a lot about one of the most important duties that Wall Street firms perform for their clients \u2014 executing trades for hedge funds and other large investors. When these clients want to bet against a company\u2019s stock, known as selling it short, they rely on brokerage firms to locate the shares they must borrow and deliver to a buyer.The S.E.C. has said that naked shorting can be abusive and may drive down a company\u2019s shares. Therefore, brokerage firms are barred from accepting orders for short sales unless they have borrowed the stock or have \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to believe it can be secured. This is known as the \u201clocate\u201d requirement.Goldman violated the rule from November 2008 through mid-2013, the S.E.C. said. Through that period, which included the market decline of early 2009, the firm was \u201cimproperly providing locates to customers where it had not performed an adequate review of the securities to be located.\u201dNor was the firm helpful when the S.E.C. staff questioned its practices. For example, Goldman \u201ccreated the incorrect impression\u201d with the regulator that it had in fact conducted an individualized review for all locate requests, the order noted. Goldman\u2019s \u201cincomplete and unclear responses\u201d hampered and prolonged the inquiry, the S.E.C. said.How might Goldman be liable beyond the $15 million fine? While the firm was improperly advising customers that it had located shares for their transactions, some of those customers were very likely paying for a service the firm wasn\u2019t providing.Costs to borrow shares can be considerable under normal circumstances, but they rocket when there is more demand by investors to short a company\u2019s stock than there is stock to borrow. Clients may have to pay 25 percent or more of the trade\u2019s value to secure the shares.If Goldman charged borrowing fees when it had not actually located the shares, its customers might well try to recover those costs, said Lewis D. Lowenfels, an expert in securities law in New York and an adjunct professor at Seton Hall University Law School.\u201cGoldman Sachs employees performed inadequate reviews in response to customer requests to locate stocks for short sales, according to the S.E.C.\u2019s order,\u201d Mr. Lowenfels said. \u201cDepending upon the specific factual circumstances, Goldman could incur private damage liabilities to its customers for these actions.\u201dIt\u2019s unclear how many customers may have been affected by Goldman\u2019s failures. The S.E.C. order is silent on that; it noted that the firm was \u201cgenerally able to meet its settlement obligations\u201d during the five-and-a-half-year period.\u201cThe S.E.C. settlement concerns the provision of locates,\u201d said Michael DuVally, a Goldman spokesman, \u201cand Goldman does not charge its clients for locates. As is common industry practice, clients are only charged if they establish a short position. The S.E.C. order noted that Goldman\u2019s rate of fails to deliver remained low.\u201dSome market participants have long suspected that big brokerage firms were charging high fees to short-selling customers while not actually locating the shares these investors needed under the rules.The most famous litigation alleging violations of short-sale regulations was brought in 2007 by Overstock.com, a closeout retailer based in Salt Lake City, and a group of its shareholders. Overstock and its chief executive, Patrick M. Byrne, contended that abusive naked short-selling had driven down the company\u2019s share price and harmed its capital-raising efforts. A slightly different group of 11 Wall Street firms, Overstock said, essentially created stock out of thin air that could be sold by investors.Overstock shares were exceedingly hard to borrow; fees ran as high as 35 percent.The Overstock suit generated a trove of emails and other documents that shed light on questionable Wall Street practices in the securities lending arena.For example, in a deposition in the case, which Goldman had sought to seal, Marc Cohodes, the former head of Copper River Partners, said that he had paid Goldman more than $100 million to handle its short sales over many years.Goldman has disputed this contention.I asked Mr. Cohodes, who no longer manages money, what he thought of the S.E.C.\u2019s recent findings on Goldman. He forwarded my request to his lawyer, David W. Shapiro, in San Francisco.In an interview, Mr. Shapiro, a former federal prosecutor and United States attorney, questioned the recent S.E.C. settlement. \u201cI\u2019m very curious to understand what Goldman Sachs admitted to the S.E.C.,\u201d he said, \u201cand why $15 million was considered to be an adequate punishment.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oil Market Tests Banks\u2019 Ability to Weather Losses", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported byBanks of all sizes are marking down the value of loans and setting aside reserves to absorb additional losses as oil producers struggle to pay their debts.On Tuesday, Bank of America said provisions for credit losses increased $264 million in the fourth quarter, driven by the downturn in the energy sector. Citigroup, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase reported last week that oil issues also weighed on fourth-quarter earnings.While the energy downturn is cutting into profits, it is not threatening the big banks\u2019 capital cushions, a testament, analysts say, to the rigorous regulations put in place to protect the financial system after the collapse of the mortgage market in 2008.Still, the worst pain for the banks may lie ahead. While many banks have reduced credit lines to oil producers, some lenders are loath to cut off financing entirely for fear of forcing energy companies into bankruptcy, according to energy lawyers and consultants.The banks \u2014 and their regulators \u2014 are also trying to determine loan values and forecast future losses amid great uncertainty about the direction of oil prices, which have dipped below $30 a barrel. Some analysts and energy executives say prices could rebound in a few months if the global oil glut eases. Others say it could take years for prices to rise again as the global economy slows and new supply comes online from countries like Iran.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.\u201cThe natural bias will be to keep these things on life support for as long as you can,\u201d said Dennis Cassidy, a co-head of the oil, gas and chemical practice at AlixPartners, a consulting firm.\u201cThe question becomes how much of that waiting can you endure before you get to the point where you say, \u2018It is never going to turn around,\u2019 \u201d he added.There are other factors that may be putting off a reckoning for oil companies and their lenders, even as the slump in oil prices enters its second year.When times were booming and oil was selling for more than $100 a barrel, many banks required energy companies to hedge, or protect against price drops. As a result of those deals, some companies are still receiving as much as $80 a barrel. But those hedges are supposed to expire early this year \u2014 dealing a big blow to some companies\u2019 cash flow and their ability to make debt payments.\u201cA lot of these energy companies are still enjoying some handsome hedges,\u201d said Brady Gailey, an analyst at the investment bank Keefe Bruyette & Woods, who covers regional banks in the oil-producing regions of the Southwest.Executives at the largest banks have stressed in recent days that oil and gas exposure does not make up a big percentage of overall loans.Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks\u2019 bottom lines.But that confidence is also prompting questions from some analysts about whether the banks are socking away adequate reserves in light of the prolonged oil slump.Shares of bank stocks have been hammered since the start of the year when the stock market turned volatile in the face of the collapse in oil prices and concern about China\u2019s slowing economy. Bank of America\u2019s shares, for example, are down more than 15 percent since the start of the year, while the broader market has fallen more than 8 percent.Loans to oil and gas companies make up less than 2 percent of the loans at Bank of America and Wells Fargo \u2014 a far cry from the residential mortgage exposure at some large banks, which was as high as 25 percent leading up to 2008.There is always risk, analysts say, that declining oil prices could lead to additional energy losses from trading positions or hedges that go against the banks.But it is not likely to equal the vast array of the derivatives like collateralized debt obligations and other mortgage-related investments that clogged the bank\u2019s balance sheets and nearly brought them down.\u201cYou could easily write off every dollar in oil and energy loans and have more capital than before that last crisis,\u201d said Mike Mayo, a banking analyst at CLSA. \u201cBanks have enough cushion.\u201dFor years, North America\u2019s expanding oil production \u2014 particularly in the shale fields of North Dakota and parts of Texas \u2014 was a boon to the nation\u2019s biggest banks. Over the last five years, oil and gas companies in the United States and Canada have issued bonds and taken out loans that are together worth more than $1.3 trillion, according to data provider Dealogic.In good times, the financing boom provided banks with billions in fees and interest incomes. The banks financed nearly every facet of the industry, from drilling operations to the service companies providing the drill bits. In the downturn, the risks are becoming clearer.Bank of America said on Tuesday that $8.3 billion of its $21 billion in energy exposure was in the \u201chigh risk\u201d activities of exploration and production and oil field services. The bank has classified about one-third of that debt as problematic.\u201cWe feel like we have a very good handle on our energy portfolio,\u201d the bank\u2019s chief financial officer, Paul Donofrio, said in a conference call on Tuesday morning.Wells Fargo said most of its $17 billion in energy exposure was to noninvestment-grade companies, which are at higher risk of default.Citigroup said 32 percent of its energy loans went to below-investment-grade borrowers.For regional banks, where energy exposure makes up as much as one in five of the bank\u2019s loans, the pain is more acute.Last week, BOK Financial, which includes banks in Oklahoma and Texas, updated investors ahead of its scheduled earnings release to say that its credit-loss provisions in the fourth quarter would total $22.5 million, not the $3.5 million to $8.5 million that it had previously forecast. A bank official said \u201ca single borrower reported steeper-than-expected production declines.\u201dMr. Gailey, the banking analyst, was blunt in his prediction: \u201cThese oil patch banks have a tough road ahead in 2016.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Junk Bonds Go Sour, but the Question Is How Sour", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byFair GameThe tide has definitely turned against investors in high-yield debt, better known as junk bonds.Market indexes are down approximately 9 percent from their highs of last year. Plummeting prices for oil and other commodities have done most of the damage, but the decision last month by a well-known mutual fund, Third Avenue Focused Credit, to halt redemptions, has also spooked the market.Is the worst over in this $1.5 trillion arena? Not yet. And some strategists say that investors may be focusing too much on the role energy has played in the decline while underestimating other risks.Commodities companies, outsize issuers of junk debt in recent years, have certainly caused the most pain. Fully 27 percent of high-yield debt brought to market in 2014 came from oil companies, many of them riding the shale fracking boom.These two energy holdings have no doubt contributed to the funds\u2019 poor performance of late: The shares of both are down 20 percent from their peaks of 2015. (It didn\u2019t help that one of the largest holdings in the Franklin fund was debt issued by the troubled company Valeant Pharmaceuticals International.)But with oil falling below $30 and no bottom yet in sight, there is probably further pain ahead in the oil sector, according to Matthew Mish, global credit strategist at UBS, who also contends that prices on junk bonds outside of energy have not come down enough either.\u201cIn energy, bond valuations are pricing in an uplift in underlying commodities, so there\u2019s more downside risk if prices hold at these levels for a long time or go lower,\u201d Mr. Mish said in an interview. And elsewhere, he added, \u201cwe do not see a marginal buyer for lower-quality credit.\u201dSome retail investors have sold high-yield bond fund holdings recently, reducing overall exposure in this market to about $250 billion from $300 billion. Still, that\u2019s a lot of money riding on what may constitute a \u201chope trade.\u201d\u201cFor six years, a subset of the investing class \u2014 and a large one \u2014 chased yield in complex ways, and by doing so they took on currency risk and exposure to commodity prices and emerging-market countries,\u201d Mr. Kotok told me. \u201cNow all three now are unraveling. I don\u2019t need to see the fire \u2014 I see the smoke.\u201dCurrency risk is a considerable worry to Mr. Kotok. Foreign currencies \u2014 even those in developed markets such as Canada \u2014 have been crushed under a strong United States dollar. Over the past year, the Canadian loonie has fallen 17 percent against the American currency; the Brazilian real has plummeted 34 percent.Morningstar reports that about one-quarter of global bond funds do not hedge their currency exposures. More than half of these funds focus on sovereign debt, but some invest in corporates.High-yield bond funds\u2019 holdings that were issued by foreign companies in United States dollar denominations are a real problem, Mr. Kotok said. An issuer in a country with a collapsing currency will find it much harder to repay these debt obligations.While rare, redemption halts like the one started by the Third Avenue Focused Credit fund also remain a risk, Mr. Kotok said. \u201cThere are a lot of moving pieces in the junk bond market that are unknown until they surface,\u201d he said.\u201cThat\u2019s what has gotten me more concerned this time around, compared to the generalized, risk-off sell-off we had in the middle of last year,\u201d he said. Downward moves in small capitalization stocks and upward action in volatility also point to further pressure in the high-yield market, he added.For investors, another cause for worry is the relatively low levels of cash currently held by high-yield mutual funds to meet redemptions. \u201cIn general, over the last three years, there has been a general feeling of bullishness among high-yield managers,\u201d Mr. Kalish said. \u201cAs a result we\u2019ve seen a drawdown of cash reserves.\u201dAt the moment, high-yield funds have average cash reserves of less than 5 percent, he said. (The Franklin and Nuveen funds have 4.5 percent cash on hand.) While such levels are sufficient to meet normal redemptions, high levels of investor sales could require these managers to sell assets, possibly at depressed prices.\u201cI would like to see us get back to 8 percent,\u201d Mr. Kalish said. \u201cThat would suggest managers have become more cautious \u2014 they have built up sufficient cash reserves to meet redemptions and they can become buyers again.\u201dMr. Kalish said that he would become more positive about the high-yield market if he felt confident that commodity prices wouldn\u2019t go much lower.\u201cI just can\u2019t say at this point that we\u2019ve seen the bottom in oil or commodity prices,\u201d he said. \u201cThat needs to be clearer for people to understand the risk they are taking and whether they are being compensated for it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jack Dorsey Juggles Twitter and Square, Both Caught in Downdraft", "Date": "2016-01-20", "News": "Supported byIt is not shaping up as a happy new year for Jack Dorsey and his two companies.Shares of Twitter hit a record low early Wednesday before going on a wild ride and rising 4.1 percent for the day. The gain did little to erase Twitter\u2019s negative trajectory, with its shares off 25 percent this year. Square, which went public last November, fell below its initial public offering price of $9 for the first time on Wednesday before recovering. In total, the stock is down 28 percent this year.The travails underscore how the stock market\u2019s up and downs are especially hitting companies that have question marks hanging over their heads. While a rising market lifts all boats, doubters tend to flee riskier stocks in a tumultuous market. And plenty of questions \u2014 mostly around growth \u2014 surround Twitter and Square, with scrutiny set to intensify in the next few weeks as Twitter is scheduled to report earnings on Feb. 10 and Square to issue its first earnings as a public company on March 9.\u201cThe market has suddenly found volatility\u201d and that has made Square \u201ca magnet of pessimism\u201d and with Twitter, \u201cpeople are piling onto it because it\u2019s a disliked name that\u2019s poorly understood,\u201d said Max Wolff, the chief economist at Manhattan Venture Partners.As traders seek to protect their portfolios in the rough market, Jason Kupferberg, a senior equity research analyst at Jefferies & Company, said some selling of riskier stocks was to be expected \u2014 including those of Twitter and Square.For Mr. Dorsey, 39, the stock tumult complicates an already complex set of challenges. Twitter, for example, is dealing with questions about whether it can rev up its service\u2019s user growth, while Square needs to graduate from a newly public company to a more mature one. The share declines suggest shareholders are impatient and may potentially shorten the leash they give Mr. Dorsey in achieving his goals at both businesses. Spokesmen from the companies declined to comment.\u201cThere was too much hype and too much hope that once Jack was hired, he would suddenly wave the magic wand and user numbers would somehow go up right away,\u201d said Eric Jackson, managing director of SpringOwl Asset Management, a financial firm based in New York.In an earnings call last October, Mr. Dorsey said Twitter had lots of work to do to make the service easier for regular people to use. Those changes, he said at the time, would not come overnight.Yet Wall Street is now realizing that it will take time for the changes to pay off, Mr. Jackson said. That has led to questions about whether Twitter might become a takeover target. On Wednesday, the market pushed up Twitter\u2019s share price on talk that News Corporation was potentially building a stake in the company, which a News Corporation spokesman denied. \u201cIt\u2019s been Wall Street\u2019s gradual reconsideration of the assumption there would be some immediate effect on user growth,\u201d Mr. Jackson said of Twitter\u2019s stock performance this year. \u201cNow people are saying, \u2018Hey let me out of this thing.\u2019\u00a0\u201dSquare faces its own set of difficulties. Naysayers have long questioned the profit margins on the company\u2019s payments processing business. Square takes a small cut of every credit card payment it processes, a cut that is split with banks and other financial intermediaries. The company has expanded into other areas in recent years, such as food delivery and capital extensions to small businesses.Some analysts said the gyrations in Square\u2019s share price are not all the company\u2019s fault. \u201cSome of it could be out of sympathy with the weakness we\u2019re seeing with Twitter right now, due to the link with Dorsey,\u201d Mr. Kupferberg of Jefferies & Company said. Square also is dealing with a relatively small proportion of shares available for trading, since the company sold less than 10 percent of itself in its public offering, in what is known as a \u201csmall float\u201d offering. Also, many of Square\u2019s executives and major shareholders are still held by the so-called lockup period after the offering, which prohibits them from selling their shares. Companies with relatively few shares outstanding tend to get whipsawed during volatile market periods because it becomes harder to adequately match the small amount of supply for the stock with the demand, or lack thereof.\u201cThose tiny-float I.P.O.s come back to haunt you,\u201d Mr. Wolff of Manhattan Venture Partners said.Leslie Picker and Ravi Somaiya contributed reportingAdvertisement"}

Another index, the RTS, which prices Russian shares in dollars and therefore reflects changes in the exchange rate as well as in the stock market, fell 4.9 percent.The ruble dropped sharply at the opening of trading to more than 76 to the dollar, from 74.75, before recovering to close at 75.8.Oil and other commodities like natural gas and steel, which make up the bulk of Russia\u2019s exports, have fallen sharply on fears of a slowdown in the Chinese economy. A barrel of the benchmark Brent crude was trading at less than $32, down more than 4 percent for the day.In an interview published on Monday in the German newspaper Bild, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia conceded that the plunge in oil prices was hurting his country\u2019s economy, but that it would have a positive side in that it would push Russia to improve its financial policies.\u201cOur nonoil and gas deficit had risen to a very dangerous level,\u201d Mr. Putin said. Resisting spending oil funds is difficult, he said, but \u201cit is the reduction of these expenses that improves the economy.\u201dThe Russian government taxes oil companies at higher rates when oil prices are higher, and at lower rates during a price slump.As a result of that policy, the federal budget, rather than the companies, has borne the brunt of the oil price decline.The average after-tax profit a Russian oil company earned from the sale of a barrel of oil actually rose over the past year \u2014 to 1,290 rubles in 2015, from 1,012 rubles in 2014, according to an analysis by Renaissance Capital, a Moscow-based investment bank. Because of the skewed price signals, Russian oil companies have ramped up production, reaching a post-Soviet record of 10.8 million barrels a day in December.The Russian government has budgeted for an average oil price of $50 in 2016, far above where it stands today, with a deficit of 3 percent of gross domestic product.The government could balance its budget at a lower oil price and with that deficit only if the central bank allowed the ruble to decline against the dollar, further whittling away the value of Russians\u2019 wages and pensions.Russia\u2019s central bank has warned that the country\u2019s economy could continue to contract this year, after a 3.8 percent drop last year, if oil prices do not recover.\u201cWe believe we will gradually be looking at the stabilization and rise of the economy,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Having a stock decline by 20 percent or 30 percent in a short period of time, as Apple and Disney have done in recent months, is a good wake-up call for children about the importance of diversifying their investments.Our goal here, in case it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t obvious, is that by the time they are 22 years old, they will have learned that investing in individual stocks is actually gambling. They should put their grown-up savings in low-cost mutual funds that invest in thousands of stocks at once.But we agree on one thing: Parents should provide a benchmark so that children know how their investments are doing. Sure, Apple and Disney have lost value, but how does that compare with other stocks in an index like the S&P 500?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stock Market Ends Sharply Lower as Worries About Economy Surface", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byIt may be time for everyone to take the markets seriously again.As stock prices started tumbling in the first trading days of the year, many Wall Street professionals were tempted to describe the declines as the sort of adjustment that the market has gone through in recent years before moving higher.But that optimism evaporated this week as the selling intensified. Concerns are now growing that the markets are signaling that the United States economy, despite its recent bright spots, is on the verge of a slowdown.The fear is that economic problems in China have set off negative reactions around the world that could ultimately weigh on American households and corporations.On Friday, stocks in the United States touched their lowest levels since late August. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, the main benchmark for the United States market, is now down 8 percent for 2016 and nearly 12 percent below its benchmark high reached last year.In the face of the market turmoil, investors are showing signs that they are again seeking out safe-haven investments like government bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which falls as its price rises, declined to 2.05 percent from 2.09 percent on Thursday, after earlier falling below 2 percent for the first time since October.\u201cThere is just a broad reassessment of risk right now.\u201dA bear market occurs when stocks are down more than 20 percent from a high. The Russell 2,000, a measure of small-cap stocks, is actually down 23 percent from its peak. It fell 1.75 percent on Friday.On the one hand, it is important not to read too much into market moves. Markets often misinterpret what is really going on in the economy. The stock market came roaring back from sharp declines in 2011 and, more recently, from a rout last summer.Also, since the financial crisis of 2008, the United States economy has displayed the ability to power through rough patches in financial markets.Analysts note that the world\u2019s central banks can always increase their stimulus policies if the economies they watch over start to sag again.The global sell-off in stocks started in China, where the main Shanghai index dropped 3.6 percent on Friday. The index has fallen more than 20 percent from its December high. Stocks in London ended down 1.93 percent. Stocks in Frankfurt closed down 2.54 percent.The S.&P. 500 ended Friday down 41.51 points, or 2.16 percent. The much narrower Dow Jones industrial average fell 390.97 points, or 2.39 percent. The Nasdaq composite index declined 2.74 percent.Investors were quick to sell companies that appear most vulnerable to a drop in global growth.Shares of Intel, the giant chip maker, for instance, plummeted over 9 percent on Friday. When reporting earnings Thursday afternoon, Stacy J. Smith, Intel\u2019s chief financial officer, made comments about future sales that unsettled investors. \u201cThis outlook represents a soft start to the year as we remain cautious on the level of economic growth, particularly in China,\u201d Mr. Smith said.Investors also shunned shares of companies that had soared in 2015. Netflix, which fell 2.8 percent on Friday, is now down 20 percent from its high in 2015.The turbulence in the markets is causing pessimism over the economy to grow. And economists say they are taking seriously some of the signals they see in markets. Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, asserted that the markets that, in effect, predict interest rates and inflation appear to be doing a better job than, say, officials at the Fed.Such markets have in recent months been more pessimistic, predicting lower interest rates and inflation, both of which can act as an early warning of lower economic growth ahead.\u201cHere\u2019s where I believe the market has it right,\u201d Mr. Bernstein said.A month ago, investors in an interest rates futures market were predicting a nearly 90 percent chance that the Fed would increase interest rates in April, according to Bloomberg. Now that market is predicting only a 32 percent chance.The United States economy is expected to grow 2.5 percent this year, according to a poll by Reuters of over 90 economists. A year ago, they were forecasting growth of 2.8 percent.One school of pessimists asserts that the central banks\u2019 policies used to stimulate slowing economies since the crisis are losing effectiveness. Such policies stoked huge increases in debt that borrowers will now struggle to pay back, causing broader stress on large economies. This threat seems particularly large in China, which unleashed a credit binge after 2008, but the defaults in the United States energy industry are also a sign of how debt-fueled growth can backfire.A less gloomy camp contends that markets are just getting used to a world that is going to grow more slowly than in the past. Stock markets may struggle for a time, they say, but they are not going to crash and they are not signaling a severe global recession.A lukewarm economic outlook could be heard in the comments from the executives of United States banks that are reporting their fourth-quarter earnings.\u201cThere are pockets of strength,\u201d John Stumpf, the Wells Fargo chief executive, in a call with analysts. \u201cI am not going to say it is robust.\u201dThe bank\u2019s executives expect lower gas prices to bolster growth more broadly, as consumers and businesses enjoy smaller energy bills. Still, Mr. Stumpf added, consumers \u201chave not spent a lot of their gas savings.\u201dLikewise, Mr. Fink of BlackRock expressed concern that low energy prices here and abroad were not feeding through into the real economy.\u201cWe have just not seen the consumer consuming,\u201d he said. \u201cAt some point we will find a bottom in energy, and then things will stabilize.\u201dLower global economic activity can cause prices to fall in the United States, which can erode the profitability of American companies and make their shares less attractive to investors.Shares of Citigroup were down far more than those of other large United States banks on Friday, falling more than 6 percent.Investors are now on tenterhooks as they wait for data that might clarify the strength of the United States economy and the stance of central banks.\u201cThe market is acting as if China is already in recession and is dragging the U.S. into recession and there is nothing we can do about it,\u201d Mr. Orlando said, \u201cand there is nothing you can do to refute it until there are more data points.\u201dAn article on Saturday about the United States stock market\u2019s recent decline referred incorrectly to the Russell 2,000. It is an index of companies with small market capitalizations; it is not a broad measure of the stock market.Reporting was contributed by Landon Thomas Jr., Michael Corkery, Neil Gough and Stanley Reed.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Looking for Signs That Apple\u2019s Runaway Growth Is Waning", "Date": "2016-01-24", "News": "Supported byAlready, some investors have begun to treat Apple in a new way: as a \u201cvalue\u201d stock, a label typically attached to companies that generate predictable business results or a reliable dividend, rather than ones that deliver runaway revenue growth. Value stocks often command much lower valuations than growth stocks.\u201cPeople were in love with Apple because hits like the iPod and iPhone created phenomenal growth,\u201d said Ernesto Ramos, a fund manager at BMO Global Asset Management, which manages $18 billion and counts Apple as its largest holding. \u201cAs investors shifted their minds around the fact that it\u2019s no longer going to deliver the same sort of huge growth over the next five years, the stock became a value play.\u201dMr. Ramos says his firm still owns Apple in some of its growth funds, but began including the stock in value funds in mid-2013.Switching from being a growth stock to being a value stock can also be a long and painful process. Growth investors need to sell a company\u2019s shares and drive down the price until it is low enough to tempt value investors, who buy stocks they think are cheap compared with the intrinsic value of the company. In the tech industry, a shift from growth to value also often signals to investors that a company is facing newer competitors with more innovative products, raising the question of how relevant the company can remain.\u201cInvestors don\u2019t like to see the words tech and value combined because when growth slows at a tech company, it usually means that something essentially is not working,\u201d said Angelo Zino, a senior analyst at the research firm S&P Capital IQ.A spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment.Any change would have repercussions beyond Apple because its soaring performance in recent years helped lift the broader market. If Apple shares were removed from the equation, the performance of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index in five of the last seven years would drop by about 1 percentage point, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices. In 2014, for instance, the index rose 13.7 percent with Apple and 12.9 percent without Apple.The Apple effect is even more pronounced when technology names are isolated. For tech stocks on the S.&P. 500 as a group, annual gain in 2009 declined by 6 percentage points when Apple shares were not included, dropping to 56 percent from 62 percent.The effect was more muted last year as Apple\u2019s growth decelerated, according to the data.Investors have turned to Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet, which owns Google \u2014 collectively referred to as the FANG stocks \u2014 for growth. Those companies are each expected to show annual revenue gains of 23 to 40 percent for the last three months of 2015, while Apple is projected to deliver 3 percent revenue growth, according to Bloomberg data.Mr. Ramos says companies like Amazon have bigger growth potential for his fund than Apple, though he plans to continue owning Apple shares. \u201cAmazon will see about 20 percent revenue growth, and earnings per share are expected to jump considerably,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a very strong growth story.\u201dApple shares have already been buffeted in recent months because of worries about the slowing economy in China, which the company counts as one of its largest markets. Half a dozen companies that provide parts for the iPhone also blamed weak demand from Apple for lower-than-expected earnings, causing worries about the company\u2019s sales trajectory.\u201cIf you wanted to outperform the market, the FANG stocks did better,\u201d said Jonathan Krinsky, an analyst at MKM Partners, though he added that Apple remained a must-watch stock because it composed such a large part of many stock indexes.Investors may still someday reanoint Apple as a growth stock, especially if the company can create a best-selling new product that drives up its sales rate. Wall Street analysts cite Microsoft as an example of a business that lost steam and then made the adjustments necessary to deliver strong revenue growth again.Apple has been reclassified as a value stock before. FTSE Russell, which makes several closely followed stock indexes, found in 2013 that Apple no longer met its criteria to be treated purely as a growth stock. Some of the company\u2019s enormous market capitalization was reallocated to the Russell Value Index, as well as being in the Russell Growth Index. A year later, when the company\u2019s sales had risen strongly with the introduction of the iPhone 6, FTSE Russell placed Apple solely back in the growth index.Tom Goodwin, FTSE Russell\u2019s senior research director, said that stock price, sales growth and analyst expectations determine whether a company is placed in the growth or value index, or in both. About a third of the stocks that Russell tracks are included in both indexes, he said.But until Apple reveals another hit or shows a significant pickup in iPhone sales growth, Apple should be viewed as a value-oriented name, Mr. Zino said.\u201cHistorically Apple was the name to own if you wanted to outperform the market,\u201d he said. \u201cNow there are other places to look.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Year Chill on I.P.O.s", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "Supported byDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 The market for initial public offerings has been all but dead since late last year. Don\u2019t expect that freeze to lift anytime soon, according to two top officials for the United States\u2019 biggest stock exchanges.Executives at both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq stock market said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum here that they expect very few companies to try to make their market debuts.Elevate, an online lender, postponed its planned offering earlier this week, joining the likes of the Albertsons supermarket chain and the Caribbean telecommunications provider Digicel.\u201cThis has been one of the worst starts to a year,\u201d said Garvis Toler, the head of capital markets for the Big Board\u2019s parent, NYSE Euronext.The hesitation of companies to pursue I.P.O.s arises from a stew of circumstances, including the poor reception for companies that made their market debuts this year, the whipsawing stock markets and the continued availability of money in the private capital markets.Executives from both the N.Y.S.E. and Nasdaq said that their backlog \u2014 companies that have filed privately for an I.P.O. without publicly disclosing their intentions \u2014 remains strong. But Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq\u2019s chief executive, noted that prolonged market troubles simply meant that those would-be debutants would push back their plans.\u201cThe backlog is now less meaningful than at other times,\u201d he said.Still, Mr. Greifeld held out hopes that another Nasdaq offering would rise in popularity. Last fall, the exchange operator bought SecondMarket to bolster its options for companies to allow the sales of their stocks without going public.As companies stay private longer, he said, they will face more pressure to let shareholders and early investors cash out their holdings, in part as the number of \u201cdown rounds\u201d \u2014 financings that value a company at less than what it was worth in a previous round \u2014 multiply.Such a system will not eliminate I.P.O.s, Mr. Greifeld said.

{"Headline": "Robo-Advisers for Investors Are Not One-Size-Fits-All", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "Supported byYour MoneyThe robo-advisers have quickly attracted a growing number of investors. They have also caught the attention of established financial players. Digitally driven investment providers were estimated to hold $53 billion at the end of 2015, according to the Aite Group. That\u2019s up from $2 billion in 2013, though at least half of the growth is from existing firms like Vanguard. And it\u2019s still a small fraction of the $20 trillion in retail investors\u2019 total investable assets.But the services can vary greatly in their overall approach. Some view your financial life more holistically, taking into account money in, say, a 401(k) held elsewhere. And while the actual investment recommendations should be relatively easy, the suggested portfolios differ widely enough to warrant closer inspection.What really matters is whether investors are comfortable sticking with a particular recommendation when the markets sour. There could be a significant difference in how much risk the robots believe you can afford to take \u2014 and what your stomach can truly handle.These companies offer help picking and rebalancing index and exchange-traded funds or similar investments, and none charge more than about 0.5 percent of your assets each year for the privilege.Betterment, an automated advisory service introduced in 2010 that manages $3.2 billion, said less than half of 1 percent of its 135,000 customers made a change to their portfolios over the last two weeks.But upon closer inspection, some of the robo-advisers\u2019 portfolios appeared aggressive, at least from the perspective of one personal finance reporter. Some of the initial recommendations strayed far from the 65 percent in stocks that I\u2019m comfortably invested in now, an allocation decided upon after consulting with a certified financial planner who charged a flat fee for her advice.One robo-adviser initially suggested a 90 percent stock allocation, which, in theory, younger and midcareer investors may be able to handle because their portfolios still have many years to recover from a precipitous decline. But it could be a rocky ride.Here\u2019s a closer look inside two of the larger start-ups, as well as two other established players that introduced automated services over the last year:The service illustrates how likely you are to meet goals like achieving a certain annual income in retirement. The portfolios are what you\u2019d expect from Vanguard: broad diversification across all asset classes. It suggests that 50-year-olds with a moderate risk tolerance invest 70 percent of their money in stock funds and another 30 percent in well-diversified bond funds.Instead of focusing solely on performance, it shows how well investors are doing relative to their goals. The tool will alert investors when they fall off track, and suggest how to address the issue. Maybe, it\u2019s saving $30 more each month, or making a one-time contribution. \u201cI think that really helps people keep calm,\u201d said Naureen Hassan, an executive vice president of Schwab.For now, the tool is relatively one-dimensional: It enables investors to calculate how their portfolio is likely to grow in the future if they invest a lump sum or save a certain amount each month. Schwab plans to make its service more comprehensive by aggregating information on accounts held outside the firm.The portfolio of a 50-year-old with a moderate risk tolerance would have 8.5 percent in cash, and 21 percent in bonds. But that includes 8 percent in high-yield debt and 7 percent in an emerging markets bond fund.\u201cBottom line, while this portfolio will have a decent expected return,\u201d said Mr. Bernstein, who reviewed several of the robo-adviser portfolios, \u201ca lot of its owners are going to be surprised about how it lives up to \u2018moderate risk.\u2019\u201dThe investment gurus at Schwab argued that all investments had trade-offs and that these bonds, for example, were less sensitive to rising interest rates. Over the long run, they said, they were confident these bonds would be less volatile than stocks.Perhaps. But before selecting an investment mix at any of these services, investors should consider how a particular portfolio might feel if this latest downturn \u2014 or the next one \u2014 were to become a replay of 2008 and 2009.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated part of the name of Schwab\u2019s robo-adviser service.

{"Headline": "Fears About China\u2019s Economy Fester at Davos", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "Supported byDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 At the World Economic Forum here, chief executives and investors are blaming China for a slump in global markets.Fears about the country\u2019s downshift, as its official growth slowed to a quarter-century low, have dominated high-level discussions, both during public debates and in smaller, private meetings.The financier George Soros said at a dinner on Wednesday night that a \u201chard landing is practically unavoidable,\u201d adding that China is the root of the current financial crisis.But behind the gloom and doom a more complex picture is emerging among the global elite in this Alpine ski resort. Some of it is coming from those who have lived or worked in China.China\u2019s most influential executives could be seen this week in Davos, including Zhang Xin, the chief executive of the real estate developer SOHO China; Ya-qin Zhang, the president of the search engine giant Baidu; Jiang Jianqing, the chairman of the Industrial and Commercial Bank; and Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba. These leaders have stepped in to argue for a more nuanced view on China.Some have defended China\u2019s potential for growth as Western participants voiced concerns and doubts. Neil Shen, a veteran venture capitalist and one of China\u2019s most successful entrepreneurs, told one panel discussion about the evolution of Chinese industry, that Chinese companies were already competing in their own right in industries like smartphone manufacturing.Within the arena of financial markets, Chinese and Western leaders alike argued that the fears demonstrated in rocky markets were overstated. Last week, stocks moved into bear market territory \u2014 which occurs when stocks are down more than 20 percent from a high \u2014 in large part on the news of China\u2019s disappointing 2015 growth domestic product figures.Yet many cited the larger concerns that remained over China\u2019s slowing economy and whether its government will manage its transition from an economy focused on industry and exports to one that derives most of its growth from consumption. And many worried that an unintended consequence of President Xi Jinping\u2019s anticorruption campaign would be continued disruption of the financial markets.Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, touched on these points during a debate at the start of the conference. China\u2019s biggest problem today was how its government communicated with the rest of the world, Ms. Lagarde said.\u201cI would say also that given those massive transitions that are undertaken pretty much at the same time and accepted as such, there is a communication issue,\u201d Ms. Lagarde said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s something that markets do not like.\u201dLast summer, unexpected actions by the Chinese government started a global sell-off in the markets. Some of those measures nearly brought the market to a standstill. At one point in July, a third of the stock market was frozen. Investors with big stakes in stocks were prohibited from selling those stakes. Hedge funds were raided and short-sellers investigated for what the government called \u201cmalicious\u201d activity, according to state media reports. The government even organized large-scale purchases of stocks by government-linked brokerages and investment funds to prop up the plunging market.Many of these interventionist actions in the market were \u201cthe exact replicas that many other countries, including the United States, have done in certain parts of their modern history,\u201d Gary D. Cohn, president of Goldman Sachs, said.\u201cThe communication is really what\u2019s important here; communicating what the Chinese market is going to be and sticking with that theory no matter how painful it is in the transition,\u201d Mr. Cohn added.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.Speaking at the same event, Fang Xinghai, the vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, told a packed room, \u201cWe are learning. We are doing it.\u201dThis message, however, was still lost on some of the more cynical China watchers.Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard economist who has long warned of a potential financial crisis in China, remained skeptical. \u201cThere is a big propaganda push to say everything is good, everything is fine.\u201dEarlier in the week he told attendees at the forum that China\u2019s large accumulation of government debt would one day be a shock to a financial system that \u201camplifies shocks.\u201dOthers with bearish views on China have kept their claws out. Jim S. Chanos, who once said China was \u201con a treadmill to hell,\u201d said he remained deeply concerned. His hedge fund, Kynikos Associates, estimated that China\u2019s nominal gross domestic growth in 2015 was 5 percent compared with 15 percent just five years earlier.\u201cChina\u2019s debt problems still lie ahead of it,\u201d Mr. Chanos said on Thursday, referring to concerns about the extent to which China\u2019s seeming economic growth is actually fueled by borrowing.As for Mr. Soros, he told an audience at the Panorama Restaurant in the Seehof Hotel in Davos this year that the Chinese had waited too long to properly address the transition of its growth model. Asked by a Bloomberg reporter if there was a risk of repeating 2008, Mr. Soros said the market was in a similar time of financial crisis.\u201cBut the source of the disequilibrium is different,\u201d Mr. Soros said, adding that in 2008, the main cause was the United States subprime crisis. \u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201cthe root cause is basically China.\u201dMichael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Media Titans Would Be Wise Not to Overlook Netflix", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtImagine you run a global media conglomerate. Say you\u2019re Robert A. Iger, the chief executive of Disney, or Brian L. Roberts, of Comcast, or perhaps you\u2019re slightly lower down on the ladder of behemoths \u2014 the boss of Twenty-First Century Fox or Time Warner, perhaps. In any case, you own a lot of valuable stuff: movie studios, broadcast and cable TV networks, perhaps a broadband infrastructure, maybe some theme parks with roller coasters and a few impressive castles.Yet Netflix is still a tiny frigate in the global sea of the content business, and surely it\u2019s no threat to the mightiest fleets in the industry. Your castles are safe, right?Well, here\u2019s a scarier proposition for you and your fellow media executives to ponder while roasting marshmallows by the fire at Davos next week. What if Netflix is the Amazon of the entertainment industry \u2014 the embodiment of a slow, expensive, high-risk effort to consume the entirety of your business?The good news for the Davos set is that there are lots of reasons that Netflix\u2019s strategy won\u2019t work. The bad news: So far, it just keeps working.Netflix\u2019s audacious strategy arouses strong feelings among folks on Wall Street. The company, based in Silicon Valley, is now valued at $50 billion, but many analysts rapturously say its efforts to reinvent TV could be worth several times more. Others find the ardor for Netflix to be nearly physically repulsive.\u201cI\u2019ve covered stocks for more than 15 years, and it\u2019s amazing how bad my idiot competitors are on this,\u201d said Michael Pachter of Wedbush Securities, who believes Netflix is highly overvalued. \u201cIt\u2019s like they drink the Kool-Aid and they\u2019re done.\u201dThe reason opinion is split is that, like Amazon before it, Netflix\u2019s business is so daring that it seems like it shouldn\u2019t work \u2014 and yet the company keeps surprising everyone. Observers and rivals were expecting Netflix to go global over the course of the next couple of years, not to open up just about everywhere on a single day. But the rest of the industry always seems to be a step or two behind in realizing the scope of Mr. Hastings\u2019s ambition.A capacity for surprise is the first and most obvious similarity between Netflix and Amazon. There are lots of others.Consider that like Mr. Bezos\u2019s retail machine, Netflix has been given leeway by investors to spend huge sums to build a globe-spanning video jukebox available to anyone. For Amazon, the investment was in warehouses; for Netflix, the money is being plowed into original content. During a speech at the International CES trade show last week, Ted Sarandos, Netflix\u2019s chief content officer, said the company would produce 600 hours of original programming in 2016, about double what it created last year, and on par with most major TV networks.In a recent note to investors, Nat Schindler, an analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, counted all the new shows Netflix is offering this year. He tallied 31 TV series, 10 feature films, 30 children\u2019s shows, 12 documentaries and 10 stand-up comedy specials.\u201cTo put it into perspective, you would have to watch Netflix for 25 days straight to consume all of its new original content next year,\u201d Mr. Schindler wrote.But Netflix isn\u2019t an ordinary TV producer. Like Amazon, it is amassing a cache of intelligence on what customers want, and it\u2019s using that data to create content that appeals to a wide range of demographics globally. In his CES speech, Mr. Sarandos argued that Netflix\u2019s business model and its data allowed it to produce shows that wouldn\u2019t have existed in traditional TV.\u201cTo make a baseball analogy, linear TV only scores with home runs,\u201d Mr. Sarandos said. \u201cWe score with home runs, too, but we also score with singles and doubles and triples.\u201dAnd finally, Netflix, like Amazon, is a flywheel that keeps spinning faster: As it gets more subscribers, it gets more data and more money to fund more content, which in turn helps it bring in more customers, and on and on, ever faster. Netflix barely ekes out a profit now, but the bulls say that as the flywheel spins, it will eventually begin earning enormous sums.They argue that Netflix will gain enough power in the content business to demand favorable pricing on content. Analysts also expect Netflix to begin raising its subscription fees, which are currently the most attractive in the media business. Customers streamed 12 billion hours of Netflix video during the last three months of 2015, the company says. That means customers paid around 14 cents per hour of Netflix, according to Rob Sanderson, an analyst at MKM Partners.\u201cCable is between 25 and 30 cents an hour \u2014 so Netflix is basically half,\u201d Mr. Sanderson said. \u201cIf you look at the dollars per hour of Netflix, there\u2019s nothing even close.\u201dAnd then there is Netflix\u2019s demonstrated ability to surprise with new ventures. Like Amazon\u2019s expansion from books to everything, Netflix grew from delivering DVDs to streaming old-run movies to, now, producing movies and TV shows. Some expect Netflix to keep moving deeper into the industry \u2014 to build its own studio, for instance. One day, if things keep going the way they are, maybe it, too, can have theme-park castles.There are Netflix skeptics, of course. Mr. Pachter argues that Netflix will have a difficult time lowering its content costs. As media giants realize Netflix is pulling away their best customers from cable, they will begin demanding more for licensing deals. He also predicted Netflix would have trouble raising subscription prices given increased competition from Amazon, which offers original programming as part of its Prime subscription service. (Prime costs $99 a year, about $20 less than a year of Netflix, and it includes free shipping.)Considering these hurdles, Mr. Pachter believes Netflix can create a modestly profitable business, just not a spectacular one. \u201cThese guys aren\u2019t going away \u2014 I just think the stock will drop to about $70 or $75,\u201d he said, from its current price of around $115. (In an email after the interview, Mr. Pachter revised his price target to \u201caround $60\u201d per share.) \u201cOtherwise, things just don\u2019t make sense.

{"Headline": "Follow Your Conscience Without Losing Your Shirt", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byInvesting can sometimes seem heartless. If whatever makes money is your mantra, you may find that you have put your cash into enterprises with which you fundamentally disagree.That is where so-called socially responsible \u2014 also known as environmental, social and governance, or E.S.G. \u2014 mutual funds come in. These funds have been around for years, but these days, more investors are committing money to them and more investment companies are rolling out offerings. EPFR Global in Cambridge, Mass., said funds and exchange-traded funds in the sector had increased assets under management sixfold since the beginning of 2008, though they still represent less than 1 percent of assets invested in stocks in the United States.Even the index funds in the niche are harder to parse than some conventional competitors inasmuch as they are based on more obscure indexes. Without digging into a fund\u2019s full list of holdings, which can number in the hundreds, investors may have difficulty knowing precisely what they are getting.\u201cThe sector is not as simple as it used to be,\u201d said David J. Kathman, a senior fund analyst at Morningstar. \u201cInstead of just excluding a few things, the idea is you want to own the best companies judged by positive E.S.G. criteria. So it\u2019s more nuanced, but it\u2019s also tougher to look at a portfolio and tell how socially responsible it is.\u201dAll Parnassus funds avoid investments in companies that derive significant revenue from making alcoholic beverages, tobacco products or weapons, from gambling or from business in Sudan. Yet even those strictures require qualification. \u201cWith certain things, like Sudan, there\u2019s zero tolerance,\u201d Mr. Ahlsten said. \u201cWith others, we have a 10 percent revenue threshold. Say you\u2019re Whole Foods, and you\u2019re just selling wine, not making it. You can still be in the portfolio.\u201dParnassus also assesses positive performance on dozens of environmental, social and governance measures \u2014 \u201cevery one of those levers boils down to risk management,\u201d Mr. Ahlsten said. Companies with strong environmental records, for example, should be less likely to run afoul of regulators, he said.Their approach created a template for the field: Decide what you disdain and shun it. Over time, the list of common no-nos grew to include things like adult entertainment and genetically modified organisms. Many fund managers \u2014 even those at Pax World \u2014 came to conclude that approach was too restrictive, thus they increasingly mix screening out a few companies with overweighting others based on financial, environmental, social and governance factors.\u201cWe still don\u2019t invest in weapons and tobacco,\u201d Mr. Keefe said. \u201cBut for the most part, we\u2019ve shifted to sustainable investing, which we define as fully integrating E.S.G. factors into portfolio construction.\u201dA diversity of approaches brings a wealth of choices for investors but also, potentially, bewilderment.Consider the opposing ways two social-fund specialists view General Electric. Mr. Alhsten of Parnassus won\u2019t invest because of what he calls \u201clegacy environmental issues.\u201d G.E., for example, only recently said it had completed the dredging of a stretch of the Hudson River that was polluted decades ago by two of its plants.In contrast, John H. Streur, chief executive of Calvert Investments in Bethesda, Md., says his company\u2019s analysts rate G.E. as a buy. \u201cThe business focus there is all about sustainability,\u201d he said. \u201cOur research says G.E. is doing a lot of important work on renewable energy and its nuclear exposure isn\u2019t what the public\u2019s impression of it is.\u201dEven as socially minded investors disagree about which companies count as exemplary citizens, their funds, as a group, tend to favor growth-oriented sectors of the market, like technology, over value-oriented ones, like energy and utilities.\u201cYou\u2019re getting a different set of exposures to the economy than you would with an S.&P. 500 index fund,\u201d said Dan D. diBartolomeo, president of Northfield Information Services, an investment analytics company in Boston. That is not necessarily bad for investors, Mr. diBartolomeo said. They should just understand that, when the energy sector sizzles, their fund might not keep up.A criticism long leveled against socially minded funds is that they can\u2019t, by their very construction, keep pace with the broader market. This reasoning says that if you limit the sorts of stocks you invest in, you limit your potential return and add to the riskiness of your investment.The KLD wasn\u2019t any riskier than the S.&P., Mr. diBartolomeo said. The average annual total return for the MSCI KLD from the end of 1991 to Nov. 30, 2015, was 9.4 percent, compared with 9.1 percent for the S.&P. 500 for the same period.Mr. diBartolomeo reconciles the findings with conventional investment wisdom by pointing out that not all constraints bind. \u201cIn real life, if I constrain myself from having five martinis, that\u2019s not going to hurt me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if I go from 500 to 400, that\u2019s still plenty of stocks to invest in.\u201dRodney Comegys, a principal in the investment management group at Vanguard, said a fund that barred so many different sorts of stocks might not work as a core holding for many people. Although managed passively, it is analogous to an active bet because its holdings have different characteristics from broad market indexes like the S.&P. 500, he said. Financial stocks, for example, account for about a quarter of the FTSE index but only 15 percent of the S.&P. (Only about 10 percent of the retirement plans Vanguard administers offer it as an option.)\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be perfect for everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a compromise because you don\u2019t believe a typical core holding is right for you.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ted Cruz Didn\u2019t Report Goldman Sachs Loan in a Senate Race", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported by\u201cSweetheart, I\u2019d like us to liquidate our entire net worth, liquid net worth, and put it into the campaign,\u201d he says he told his wife, Heidi, who readily agreed.A review of personal financial disclosures that Mr. Cruz filed later with the Senate does not find a liquidation of assets that would have accounted for all the money he spent on his campaign. What it does show, however, is that in the first half of 2012, Ted and Heidi Cruz obtained the low-interest loan from Goldman Sachs, as well as another one from Citibank. The loans totaled as much as $750,000 and eventually increased to a maximum of $1 million before being paid down later that year. There is no explanation of their purpose.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.A spokeswoman for Mr. Cruz\u2019s presidential campaign, Catherine Frazier, acknowledged that the loan from Goldman Sachs, drawn against the value of the Cruzes\u2019 brokerage account, was a source of money for the Senate race. Ms. Frazier added that Mr. Cruz also sold stocks and liquidated savings, but she did not address whether the Citibank loan was used.The failure to report the Goldman Sachs loan, for as much as $500,000, was \u201cinadvertent,\u201d she said, adding that the campaign would file corrected reports as necessary. Ms. Frazier said there had been no attempt to hide anything.\u201cThese transactions have been reported in one way or another on his many public financial disclosures and the Senate campaign\u2019s F.E.C. filings,\u201d she said.Kenneth A. Gross, a former election commission lawyer who specializes in campaign finance law, said that listing a bank loan in an annual Senate ethics report \u2014 which deals only with personal finances \u2014 would not satisfy the requirement that it be promptly disclosed to election officials during a campaign.\u201cThey\u2019re two different reporting regimes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe law says if you get a loan for the purpose of funding a campaign, you have to show the original source of the loan, the terms of the loan and you even have to provide a copy of the loan document to the Federal Election Commission.\u201dThere would have been nothing improper about Mr. Cruz obtaining bank loans for his campaign, as long as they were disclosed. But such a disclosure might have conveyed the wrong impression for his candidacy.Mr. Cruz, a conservative former Texas solicitor general, was campaigning as a populist firebrand who criticized Wall Street bailouts and the influence of big banks in Washington. It is a theme he has carried into his bid for the Republican nomination for president.History suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.Earlier this year, when asked about the political clout of Goldman Sachs in particular, he replied, \u201cLike many other players on Wall Street and big business, they seek out and get special favors from government.\u201dIn recounting the decision to put all of their savings into the campaign, Mr. Cruz said in the 2013 Times interview that Mrs. Cruz immediately agreed to his proposal, even though he was trailing in the polls and still viewed as a long shot against Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, who spent $24 million of his own money on the race.\u201cWhat astonished me, then and now, was Heidi within 60 seconds said, \u2018Absolutely,\u2019 with no hesitation,\u201d Mr. Cruz said.Mrs. Cruz, who is on leave as a managing director at Goldman Sachs, later suggested that the reality was more complicated. She told Politico in 2014 that she thought they should apply \u201ccommon investment sense\u201d and not use their own money for the campaign \u201cunless it made the difference\u201d in winning. The article did not mention anything about loans from banks.The money from the Cruzes allowed his campaign to keep running television ads in the period preceding the primary election, including a $300,000 ad buy that highlighted the story of Mr. Cruz\u2019s father\u2019s flight from Cuba in the 1950s after opposing the Batista regime. Mr. Cruz earned enough votes in the primary to qualify for a runoff, where he defeated Mr. Dewhurst and went on to win the general election.The ethics reports that candidates file with the Senate require them to list all assets they held at the close of the year or that generated income during the year. Assets are reported in broad categories of value, such as $1,001 to $15,000 and $100,001 to $250,000.Mr. Cruz\u2019s filings show that at the close of 2011, he and his wife had cash and securities in bank, brokerage and retirement accounts worth $1.3 million to $3.4 million. They also had mortgages and a loan against Mr. Cruz\u2019s partnership equity in his law firm. During 2012, they sold securities worth $82,000 to $355,000, and the value of other holdings was reduced by, at most, $155,000.However, they also added a money-market account with $250,000 to $500,000 in it, and the value of other holdings increased by as much as $435,000. All told, the value of their cash and securities in 2012 saw a net increase of as much as $400,000 \u2014 even as the Cruzes were supposedly liquidating everything to finance Mr. Cruz\u2019s Senate campaign.The biggest change in the Cruzes\u2019 finances in 2012 was the addition of the two bank loans, each valued at $250,000 to $500,000, during the first half of the year. One was a margin loan from Goldman Sachs. Margin loans, which are secured by holdings in a brokerage account, are often used to buy more stocks, but can be obtained for almost any purpose.The other loan was a line of credit from Citibank. Even if the Citibank loan did not go directly into the Senate campaign, it could have freed up other assets for that purpose. While the Cruzes were well paid \u2014 he made more than $1 million a year as a law partner, and she earned a six-figure income as an executive in Goldman Sachs\u2019s Houston office \u2014 they also had big bills, including mortgage payments and full-time child care.Both loans had floating interest rates around 3 percent, according to Mr. Cruz\u2019s Senate disclosures, which appear to be generally in line with rates available to wealthy borrowers at that time.During the remainder of 2012, the Cruz campaign repaid Mr. Cruz for about half of the money he lent. His Senate disclosures show that he and his wife paid off the Citibank loan that same year. As for the Goldman Sachs loan, it remains outstanding, though the balance has been reduced to between $50,000 and $100,000.The federal guide to campaign finance reporting for congressional candidates makes it clear that if the original source of money for a candidate\u2019s personal loan was a margin loan or a line of credit, it must be disclosed.\u201cBank loans to candidates and loans derived from advances on a candidate\u2019s brokerage accounts, credit cards, home equity line of credit, or other lines of credit obtained for use in connection with his or her campaign must be reported by the committee,\u201d according to the guide.Advertisement"}

Seats", "Date": "2016-01-26", "News": "Supported byThe high-frequency trading takeover of the New York Stock Exchange is now essentially complete.Barclays was the last traditional financial institution to still run a major operation on the floor of the Big Board. Barclays has been the so-called designated market maker for 1,200 stocks listed on the exchange.Designated market makers at the New York Stock Exchange are responsible for setting the opening and closing prices for stocks listed with the exchange. They used to sit at the center of the American stock market, but they have lost that role as more trading has been done by computers.The market makers are now best known from the photos from the floor of the exchange that run with news reports about movements in the stock markets.Other big banks and brokerage firms previously sold their seats on the floor of the exchange to high-speed firms like Virtu Financial Capital Markets and Knight Capital Group (now KCG). In 2014, Goldman Sachs sold its business on the floor to the Dutch high-speed firm IMC Financial Markets.The sales have created an odd situation: Computerized trading firms like Virtu now dominate one of the last places where humans still play a crucial role in the stock markets.Even on the floor of the exchange, though, most prices are generated by algorithms that determine when to buy and sell. The humans are generally present to monitor the computers and to step in if anything goes wrong, as has happened on several occasions in recent years.Global Trading Systems, or GTS, said it would take on most of the Barclays employees who have been working on the floor.\u201cGTS\u2019s new role as a designated market maker reflects our commitment to providing more liquidity in more places, and to creating a better, more cost-efficient marketplace for retail and institutional investors and listed issuers,\u201d the chief executive of GTS, Ari Rubenstein, said in a statement.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Standout Year for Deals, in Volume and Complexity", "Date": "2016-01-03", "News": "Supported byOf all the ways to describe mergers and acquisitions in 2015, \u201cplain vanilla\u201d is not one of them.Last year was one for the record books, generating $4.7 trillion in announced deals, with the highest percentage ever derived from those valued at more than $5 billion, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters.Boardrooms were flooded with so much confidence that executives were willing to stretch beyond the textbook-style acquisition \u2014 Company A buys Company B \u2014 to get deals done. Financing was cheap because of low interest rates and growth was generally slow, so colossal companies sought purchases as a way to expand.That shift coincided with a transformation among activist investors, many of whom recommended sweeping transactions instead of the traditional stock buyback or board seat for themselves. Pressure from activists, or the potential to become the target of activists, encouraged companies to explore all their options and make moves.\u201cBoards have become much more educated and diligent. They understand the options that are available to them more than any point in my career,\u201d said Vito Sperduto, the head of United States mergers and acquisitions at RBC Capital Markets, who has been in the industry for about 25 years. \u201cAs a result, they\u2019re better able to consider complex transactions, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing more of them.\u201dInvestors also helped open the merger and acquisition floodgates, sending stock prices of the acquiring companies higher when deals were announced. On average, buyers\u2019 shares gained 0.5 percent for deals over $1 billion, according to Thomson Reuters. Traditionally, they have tended to decline.\u201cShareholders have been more receptive to M.&A. transactions because they have provided hope for growth,\u201d said Michael Carr, the global co-head of the mergers and acquisition group at Goldman Sachs. \u201cThis acceptance has given companies the opportunity to find creative ways to generate value.\u201dBut as deals became more complex in the second half of the year, investors became more discerning. In the first half of 2015, 68 percent of announcements lifted the acquirer\u2019s stock; that figure fell to 36 percent in the last six months, according to Thomson Reuters.\u201cThe earlier deals with large, positive investor reactions were some of the most obvious deals to get done, where the synergies were well understood and highly tangible,\u201d said Chris Ventresca, the global co-head of mergers and acquisitions at JPMorgan Chase. \u201cAs some buyers extended beyond their core business lines and/or premiums paid got too high relative to synergies, investors became less comfortable bidding that buyer\u2019s stock up.\u201dPrevious booms were met with more of a playbook. The uptick in 1999 was composed mostly of one sector: technology. In 2007, the surge was the result of enormous leveraged buyouts. Neither of those periods was met with large amounts of structure within deals, bankers and lawyers recall.The deal market surpassed records last year. The $4.7 trillion worth of mergers and acquisitions was a 42 percent increase from 2014, Thomson Reuters data showed. The number of deals conducted last year gained a mere 0.2 percent from 2014, according to the data. That showed how skewed the market was toward bigger deals.Investors started becoming more comfortable with complexity as tax-inversion deals surged over the last few years. Despite a legislative backlash over the tactic \u2014 by which an American company acquires a foreign one and reincorporates abroad to reduce its tax bill \u2014 many investors understood and applauded the strategy.In November, Pfizer agreed to a $152 billion deal with Allergan, the biggest transaction over the last 15 years. Because Allergan, the maker of Botox, is based in Dublin, the deal allowed Pfizer to shed its American citizenship, relocate its headquarters and pay a lower tax rate, especially on cash earned abroad. By all intents, the transaction achieves the same outcome as an inversion, even though Allergan was technically the buyer, despite being much smaller.To make matters more complex, the companies are already considering splitting into two businesses, one focused on faster-growing innovative drugs and another on more-mature treatments. Pfizer said it would decide on the separation by 2018.Some private equity firms opted for private investment in public equities, or PIPEs, in lieu of large leveraged buyouts. Most recently, the private equity firm Cerberus took Avon\u2019s North American unit private while infusing $435 million in equity into the parent company.But all of this complexity can be risky from an execution standpoint. DuPont and Dow have traded lower since news broke of their merger, as investors were concerned about potential pressure on the business from combining their companies and then splitting them up later.There\u2019s also the risk that some of the large deals will not be able to find the concessions necessary to appease regulators or will be thwarted by the Justice Department altogether.For the last several years, regulators have been willing to \u201cpush the envelope a bit more in terms of enforcement,\u201d but it has not slowed down deal activity, said Stephen F. Arcano, a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, who leads the firm\u2019s mergers and acquisitions group in New York.Amid such an abundant year in deal-making, many of the top few companies in each industry have combined. That could cause their competitors to continue to seek unique and creative methods for deals of their own to avoid any regulatory tangle.Most bankers and lawyers agree: 2016 will continue to be busy.\u201cPeople are being more thoughtful in trying to solve the objectives of both sides,\u201d said Robin Rankin, the global co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Credit Suisse. \u201cThey\u2019re willing to do so through structure or governance or other mechanisms, and I think that theme will continue.\u201dAn earlier version of this article included outdated data from Thomson Reuters that misstated how the number of deals in 2015 compared with those in 2014. The number of deals actually rose by 0.2 percent in 2015; they did not decline by 0.5 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stock Prices Sink in a Rising Ocean of Oil", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byThe oil glut \u2014 the unsold crude that is piling up around the world \u2014 is a quandary and a source of investor anxiety that once again rattled global markets on Friday.As prices have dropped, the amount of excess production has been cut in half over the last six months. About one million barrels of extra oil is now being dumped on the markets each day.But that means the glut is still continuing to grow, and it could take years to work through the crude that is being warehoused, poured into petroleum depots or loaded onto supertankers for storage at sea.The shakeout will be painful, taking an even bigger toll on companies, countries and investors.Global stocks sank sharply on Friday, as the price of oil slipped below $30 a barrel. The glut was at the heart of the tumult, as investors worried that the demand from China would drop and supplies from Iran would grow.A glut of crude oil on the markets is pushing the price of oil down to levels not seen since the global financial crisis.\u201cThe glut is the 800-pound gorilla in the room,\u201d said Steve McCoy, vice president for drilling contracts at Latshaw Drilling, an Oklahoma service company that prospered in recent years from the American shale boom. \u201cThe world simply produced too much, and now we have to use it up or many oil-producing countries and some oil companies may drown.\u201dJust a couple of years ago, producers and petro-states were making vast fortunes drilling and pumping relentlessly to fuel expanding middle classes in Asia, Latin America and Africa. But suddenly they are producing more than anyone needs at a time when China and other rapidly growing economies, once hungry for energy, are pulling back.The extra oil has sent the price of crude into a tailspin, down more than 70 percent over the last 18 months.That, in turn, has helped depress stock markets around the world, as investors worry about global growth. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is off around 8 percent in just the first two weeks of the year; European shares are down even more. Chinese stocks have dropped 20 percent from their December peak, putting the market in bear territory.\u201cWhat was once viewed as a gift is now viewed similarly to the gift of the monkey\u2019s paw,\u201d said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for Oil Price Information Service. \u201cGlobal financial damages trump the benefits of cheap oil at anything under $30 a barrel.\u201dIt could get worse.The nuclear deal with Iran should allow the country to start exporting far more oil, once sanctions are lifted, potentially in a matter of days. Iran could add as much as 500,000 barrels a day to the global markets.Tentative progress in negotiations between warring factions in Libya, battling for control of oil and export terminals, could unleash another flood. And Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq continue to maintain a pumping frenzy to grab Asian markets.The United States is slowly cutting production. Major oil companies have dropped their rig count, and dozens of small businesses have gone bankrupt. But the industry cannot simply flip the switch on big projects, like deepwater production projects in the Gulf of Mexico, that require companies to keep pumping to cover their costs. Smaller companies have to keep producing from shale fields, even at a loss, to keep paying their lenders.\u201cSheikhs and shale caused this,\u201d said Scott Tinker, director of the Bureau of Economic Geology at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cThey are both producing more oil. That is the fundamental driver.\u201dA million to two million barrels a day of excess production may not seem like much in a world market that requires 94 million barrels daily. But the amount of daily oversupply in recent months is the largest since oil prices collapsed in the late 1990s.Back then, the price dropped below $10 a barrel, on an inflation-adjusted basis. Oil from new fields flooded the market just as the Asian financial crisis was roiling emerging markets.Most of the glut today can be explained by a near doubling of American domestic oil production since 2008. The shale boom added roughly three million barrels a day to the global market.In the past, when markets got out of kilter, Saudi Arabia and its partners in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries slashed production to support prices. But this time, the Saudis and other big producers increased output to try to preserve market share and undercut higher-cost competitors like those drilling in the shale fields of Texas and North Dakota.Even as prices slipped through 2015, global production climbed. The Energy Department projects that overall inventories will rise by an additional 700,000 barrels a day in 2016.The balance of oil supply and demand can swing abruptly, along with price, as they did in the early 2000s. Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.At the time, the Chinese and other emerging-market economies went into overdrive just as production in the United States and Mexico was declining and big producers like Venezuela and Nigeria were facing political turbulence. By mid-2008, the price of oil had risen to nearly $150 a barrel.That is the possibility that many analysts are now contemplating, even if not at a price that high. An unexpected drop in supply or rise in demand could create a floor for prices, ease the glut and eventually lead to a slow recovery.On the supply side, if tensions erupting between Saudi Arabia and Iran lead to armed conflict or an insurrection, the excess production could quickly disappear.The boom in Iraqi oil production faces multiple threats, including Islamic State terrorism. The government is falling behind in its payments to international oil companies, water is running low for pumping to revive aging oil fields, and northern Kurdish fields are short on pipelines.Low oil prices have already constrained exploration and production investment around the world.American oil producers are in retreat; companies have decommissioned more than 60 percent of their rigs in the last year or so. Since peaking at 9.7 million barrels a day early last year, domestic oil production has fallen by more than half a million barrels. Rosneft, Lukoil and Western companies are also dropping big projects in Russia.Some analysts also say that the concerns about slowing demand in emerging markets, a byproduct of the economic weakness, are overblown. China and India, for example, are working hard to build up enormous strategic reserves, which adds to the demand.RBC Capital Markets, a division of Royal Bank of Canada, estimates that China\u2019s needs will continue to grow as it places an additional 65 million to 70 million barrels in its reserves this year. India began amassing a strategic reserve only last year, and it has a goal of storing roughly 330 million barrels over the next several years.\u201cIncreased demand can certainly help,\u201d said Michael Tran, an RBC commodity strategist. \u201cBut the growing supply glut is what ultimately got us below $30-a-barrel oil, and significant supply cuts are what will ultimately have to dig us out.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China G.D.P. Growth at Slowest Pace Since 2009, Data Shows", "Date": "2016-01-18", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s growth slowed further last year, adding to the troubling economic picture that is unsettling investors around the world.The Chinese economy grew at a 6.8 percent pace in the fourth quarter, according to data released on Tuesday. It was the lowest quarterly expansion since the global financial crisis in 2009.Uncertainty about the Chinese economy \u2014 and whether the government can manage a slowdown \u2014 has been weighing heavily on global markets in recent weeks. Investors, in part, are trying to determine if China\u2019s slump will spread, dragging down the rest of the world.The latest data is not likely to reassure investors that all is well in China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy.The quarterly growth rate was lower than analysts expected. For the full year, China expanded at 6.9 percent, just below the government\u2019s target of 7 percent.It is a pace that would be the envy of many developed countries. But the figure represented China\u2019s slowest expansion since 1990, when foreign investment shriveled in the year after the government\u2019s deadly crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square.\u201cSigns of growth bottoming out are nowhere to be seen,\u201d said Li-Gang Liu, the chief economist for greater China at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Groups. \u201cInstead, we will see at least another two years of further growth slowdown.\u201dAfter decades of double-digit growth, the Chinese economy is entering a new era of more muted growth. While the government\u2019s leaders have said they are comfortable with this shift, the slowdown creates a host of unexpected challenges.China\u2019s growth is decelerating as its traditional industrial businesses struggle with excess capacity and dwindling demand. A slump in new housing construction is hurting consumption of building materials including steel, cement and glass, even as home prices show signs of a rebound.China\u2019s export base in lower-end manufacturing, once a powerhouse that drove growth and created jobs, has been hollowed out. Factories churning out goods like garments and furniture are losing competitiveness because of lower wages in Southeast Asia and South Asia.Although consumer spending and more innovative private sector companies are expected to help China\u2019s economy expand in the future, analysts worry that their development will be too slow to offset the current and painful industrial slowdown.And the government\u2019s response could add to the challenges. The government has rolled out a raft of stimulus measures to help bolster the economy. But that only threatens to leave already struggling companies even deeper in debt.Taken collectively, China\u2019s results could spell more trouble for global growth, even as the economy in the United States shows resilience.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.Separate monthly data released on Tuesday offered no sign that China\u2019s slowdown was bottoming out. In December, industrial production rose 5.9 percent from a year ago, retail sales increased 11.1 percent and investment rose 10 percent \u2014 all of which were slightly below economists\u2019 forecasts.In a news release on Tuesday, China\u2019s state statistics agency said the growth rate last year was challenged by a \u201ccomplicated international environment and increasing downward pressure on the economy.\u201d However, it added that the economy \u201cachieved moderate but stable and sound development.\u201dThe weakness in China has reverberated around the world, as investors try to dissect what\u2019s actually happening in the country\u2019s economy. The plunge in Chinese stocks, which are now in bear territory, only clouds the outlook.Global investors worry about what these dramatic stock swings say about the health of China\u2019s economy. But analysts note that the frequent gyrations of Chinese stocks are often unrelated to what is happening on the ground in China.\u201cThere does seem to be a disconnect there between equities in mainland China and how the economy is actually performing,\u201d said Julian Evans-Pritchard, a China economist at Capital Economics.He cited the example of a huge rally in the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets in the first half of last year\u2014 which gathered steam even as the economic data emerging from the mainland suggested a sharpening slowdown.\u201cA lot of what goes on is driven by perceptions of what policy makers are going to do in terms of market support, rather than what\u2019s happening in the real economy,\u201d said Mr. Evans-Pritchard.Asian markets seemed unmoved by the G.D.P. figures, as Shanghai closed up 3.25 percent, and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index finished the day up about 0.6 percent. In Europe, the FTSE Euronext index rose nearly 2 percent at the open.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stock Markets Shudder After Chinese Stock Plunge Forces a Trading Halt", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 The market turmoil in China spread around the world on Thursday, as global investors grew more anxious about the country\u2019s currency and the health of its economy.Major market indexes in the United States ended the day down more than 2 percent.Earlier, Chinese stocks plunged by more than 7 percent, forcing officials for the second time this week to halt trading for the day \u2014 in this case, after just 29 minutes.After the market mess, the Chinese authorities made a stark reversal, suspending a market mechanism \u2014 known as a circuit breaker \u2014 that halted trading when losses reached a threshold. The measure, put into effect just this week and intended to help stabilize stocks, may have instead intensified investors\u2019 concerns.The big question now is how much of the turmoil reflects rule changes and other policies at the Chinese stock market, and how much is based on broader economic fundamentals that might have a further impact on global growth.The market aftershocks spread to Europe and the United States. The benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index closed down 2.4 percent, to its lowest level since the start of October. For the last four days, the S.&P. 500 is down 4.9 percent, producing the worst start to a year in the history of the index.The narrower Dow Jones industrial average ended down 2.3 percent, while the Nasdaq composite index finished down 3.03 percent. The selling was in shares in nearly all industries.Still, American investors appeared to be less panicked than during a similar sell-off in August, also set off by concerns about Chinese growth. Market indexes in the United States are still above the lows they reached during the summer and many strategists have been arguing this week that the current problems in China are unlikely to become a major issue for the American economy.\u201cWe don\u2019t see this as an issue for a major sell-off in the markets,\u201d said Timothy M. Ghriskey, chief investment officer at the Solaris Group. \u201cPeople are responding like there is nothing new here.\u201dChina\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.It has been a rocky start to the new year in global markets. The big fear is that China\u2019s economy, the world\u2019s second-largest after the United States, is slowing down and crimping growth in other countries.Markets \u201care in a panic over what\u2019s happening in China,\u201d said Derek Halpenny, European head of global markets research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in London. \u201cPeople are saying, \u2018Whoa, growth is way worse than we were expecting this year.\u2019\u201dA downbeat Chinese manufacturing report sent stocks spiraling on Monday, previously prompting the country\u2019s market to close early. It also set off a global rout, with stocks in Europe and the United States getting hit.China\u2019s currency, the renminbi, continued to be a sore spot on Thursday.The Chinese government, which closely controls the renminbi, has been allowing the value of the currency to decline steadily as a way to bolster the economy. A weaker renminbi helps exporters, a key engine of growth.But it is a difficult process to manage. A falling currency is pushing companies and individuals to send money out of the country at a rapid rate, putting additional pressure on the renminbi and unsettling investors.On Thursday morning before the stock market opened, China\u2019s central bank set the rate for the renminbi at 6.5646 to the dollar, its lowest point in almost six years. When stock trading started, investors dumped shares, once again shutting down the market.\u201cPeople are worried about whether they are using currency depreciation to stimulate growth,\u201d said Steven Sun, head of China strategy and Hong Kong and China equity research at HSBC. \u201cAt the end of the day, the question is, do they have control? Everyone is asking that question.\u201dThe currency problems risk setting off a chain reaction.As the renminbi, also known as the yuan, keeps sliding day after day, traders start to expect ever greater declines. The falling currency can then propel further stock losses in China.That, in turn, can ripple through to the global markets. A surprise currency devaluation in August helped prompt a sell-off around the world.\u201cIt\u2019s getting into a stage where it is self-fulfilling \u2014 the weaker the yuan gets, the more selling there will be,\u201d said Hao Hong, the chief market strategist at Bank of Communications International.The price of benchmark West Texas intermediate oil continued to fall on Thursday, dropping to $33.27 a barrel, down over 2 percent. As recently as May, oil was trading at nearly $65.The eurozone\u2019s blue-chip Euro Stoxx 50 index fell 1.7 percent on Thursday. The FTSE 100-stock index in London was off 2 percent for the day.The impulse when the stock market falls hard for a few days in a row is to do something but it probably doesn\u2019t make much sense to overhaul an investment strategy based on a blip of market activity.Asian stocks broadly stumbled. Japan\u2019s benchmark Nikkei 225 index fell 2.3 percent, and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong shed 3 percent.The renminbi \u2014 and the global repercussions \u2014 will provide a crucial test for the Chinese government in coming months.In theory, a weaker renminbi addresses two of China\u2019s problems: It makes China\u2019s exports more competitive in foreign markets, offsetting part of the surge in the country\u2019s blue-collar wages over the last decade; and it makes foreign companies, houses and other overseas investments seem more expensive.The trick is preventing a gradual decline from turning into a rout.Managing the currency is becoming harder for China. Investors, most of them domestic, are moving money out of the country before the buying power of the renminbi slides further.China\u2019s enormous overseas spending has helped it displace the United States and Europe as the leading financial power in large parts of the developing world.China\u2019s economy has also been steadily slowing, making it a less attractive place to invest. Fourth-quarter growth, which will be reported this month, is expected to be 6.9 percent, although some economists have expressed skepticism about the reliability of such figures.The clearest indication of investor sentiment about the renminbi lies in the currency\u2019s value in unrestricted trading here in Hong Kong. Traders have been selling renminbi in Hong Kong for a significantly lower price than the bottom of the government-authorized trading range in Shanghai.The falling value of the renminbi in Hong Kong undermines confidence in the mainland\u2019s currency. It then puts pressure on the central bank to keep pushing down the official trading range.Taken together, the currency weakness, the economic slowdown and the stock market turmoil could force the government to take action. When stocks sold off last summer, China organized large-scale purchases by government-linked brokerages and investment funds.Some of those measures may have added to this week\u2019s pain, though.Under the circuit-breaker rule suspended later Thursday, trading was stopped for 15 minutes when losses hit 5 percent.Both times the circuit breaker was activated this week, the losses continued once trading resumed, taking stocks down 7 percent and forcing a stop in trading. On Thursday, trading was suspended after just 14 minutes. When it resumed 15 minutes later, the indexes almost immediately fell to the daily limit. Trading was then halted for the day.On Thursday, economic policy makers in China issued two statements meant to indicate that officials were taking matters in hand. First, the foreign exchange markets unit of the central bank said that \u201ccurrent conditions are supportive of a relatively stable\u201d exchange rate. The comment was interpreted by some traders and economists as signaling that the central bank might intervene more heavily in currency markets to support the renminbi. There were indications that it had already begun to intervene more to prop up the renminbi in Hong Kong trading.Subsequently, the China Securities Regulatory Commission announced that it was extending for three months a ban on stock sales by large shareholders. A previous ban, imposed in early July during a steep plunge in share prices at the time, had been scheduled to expire on Friday.Erwin Sanft, the head of China strategy at Macquarie Group, based in Sydney, Australia, predicted further declines in Chinese stocks, but he said that the fall might not continue for long. \u201cChina is quite good at defensive measures,\u201d he said.The options for the government go far beyond the market.To shore up the economy, China could further reduce interest rates so as to help the real estate market. It could also further increase its already considerable stimulus spending on infrastructure.Still, while such measures might help in the short run, they would only add to one of China\u2019s biggest problems in the long run: a huge overhang of debt that was used to finance poorly judged investments. Many of those investments, like high-speed rail lines built in smaller provincial capitals for political reasons, may struggle to generate enough of an economic return to cover the interest on the money that was borrowed to finance them.\u201cThe more you try to alleviate, the worse it gets in the long term,\u201d said Viktor Shvets, the head of Asian strategy at Macquarie.As for the broader effects of China\u2019s problems, Mr. Halpenny, the London analyst, said, \u201cThere has to be a point when the market sensitivity to Chinese devaluations declines.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t expect this degree of volatility to continue,\u201d Mr. Halpenny said. \u201cBut it looks like it\u2019s going to be an interesting year.\u201dNathaniel Popper contributed reporting from New York, and David Jolly from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Morgan Stanley Heeds Its Investors", "Date": "2016-01-14", "News": "Supported by\u201cThey were saying \u2018You should do more,\u2019 and also asking \u2018Why aren\u2019t you already?\u2019 \u201d said an investor who attended a 2013 lunch with Mr. Gorman at the Boston Harbor Hotel. The investor spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of losing his access to the bank.After long holding off on a big overhaul, Mr. Gorman last month began the sort of cuts investors were pushing for \u2014 announcing plans to lay off roughly a quarter of the staff, or hundreds of employees, on its bond and commodity desks, known as the fixed-income division.Last week, the executive who oversees the trading businesses, Colm Kelleher, was elevated to the No. 2 spot in the firm, while Gregory J. Fleming, who headed wealth management, announced that he would leave. And on Thursday, the firm announced a shake-up in the fixed-income division\u2019s management ranks.Still, investors have already begun to ask whether the changes are too little, too late.Since word of the cuts surfaced in December, Morgan Stanley\u2019s stock has fallen more than any of its largest competitors, and several analysts have lowered their projection for the bank\u2019s future stock price.Mr. Gorman has been credited with successfully steadying many parts of the company, leading its push into the more stable earnings of wealth management. Yet the stock price is now lower than it was when he took over as chief executive in January 2010.The new strategy will take center stage on Tuesday, when Morgan Stanley announces its 2015 financial results. It is assumed that Mr. Gorman will lay out the full details of the recent changes, and the response could determine his future.\u201cThe pressure is on James Gorman to reassure investors that they are on the right path,\u201d said Mike Mayo, a bank analyst with CLSA Americas. \u201cEither you convince the market you are the right person or we need a new person.\u201dThe situation facing Mr. Gorman is a symptom of the broader challenges confronting Wall Street, as new regulations have raised the cost of doing what was once the most profitable work in the financial industry: buying, selling and holding bonds, commodities, derivatives and currencies. Wall Street banks have struggled with difficult markets and the added regulatory burden, while some big European banks have gone further, making major retreats in the business.Among American banks, Morgan Stanley is under particular pressure because, since 2010, Mr. Gorman has already been through four leadership teams within his fixed-income division, trying to find the right formula. So far none have worked. The management turnover itself is causing concern for investors and analysts who worry that Morgan Stanley is unlikely to stick with any strategy for long.\u201cTruthfully, over the last few years, Morgan Stanley has flip-flopped\u201d on its fixed income business, said Michael Wong, a bank analyst at Morningstar. \u201cThe flip-flopping has increased my uncertainty about that business.\u201dThe most basic problem facing Mr. Gorman is that the returns from his company as a whole have remained below the amount Morgan Stanley is presumed to pay its shareholders for their money: 10 percent.This closely watched measure of profitability is called return on equity. In 2013, Mr. Gorman said that he aimed to get Morgan Stanley above that 10 percent threshold.But he has failed so far, and in the first nine months of 2015 the company\u2019s return on equity was actually lower than it was during the same period in 2014, coming in at 8.8 percent.If it were not for the fixed-income business, Mr. Gorman would already be comfortably above his target. But the bond trading business lowers Morgan Stanley\u2019s return on equity because it increases the level of equity and capital that the bank has to maintain.Mr. Gorman did not move sooner, in part, because he was not anticipating the Federal Reserve\u2019s continuing efforts to increase capital requirements for large banks, according to people briefed on the firm\u2019s thinking.The continuing evolution of Morgan Stanley is taking it further and further away from where it was a decade ago, when it was run by a bond trader, John J. Mack, and was earning big profits from its mortgage trading desks.Mr. Gorman, an Australian with a background in consulting and wealth management, came in after those bond desks took Morgan Stanley to the brink of collapse during the financial crisis. Mr. Gorman had a mandate to shift the firm away from riskier businesses and build up things like the Smith Barney wealth management division that Morgan Stanley acquired from Citi during the crisis.Morgan Stanley has also had recent success in the units that advise companies on mergers and acquisitions, and trade stocks, which do not have the same high regulatory costs as bond trading.The emphasis on these businesses led many investors to believe that Morgan Stanley would no longer be as prone to big swings in the markets. And Mr. Gorman did successfully halve the amount of its resources dedicated to fixed-income trading over the last three years \u2014 at least in terms of capital.But he hesitated from pulling back too far, and occasionally appeared to be pushing further into the business, like when he brought in Glenn Hadden, a prominent bond trader from Goldman Sachs. Mr. Hadden had to leave Morgan Stanley after facing questions from regulators about activity during his time at Goldman.Bank shareholders and some executives within the bank pushed Morgan Stanley to make stronger moves to get out of the business. In 2013, an internal review of the bank\u2019s resources, conducted by all the top executives, created dissension in the ranks about how reliant the bank still was on bond trading, according to people briefed on the review.Financial results in the last year have served as a reminder of how Morgan Stanley\u2019s financial results are still tied to what happens on its fixed-income desks, even though they now account for less than 10 percent of the firm\u2019s overall revenues.The problem for turning the business around is that even after employees are let go, the bank must still maintain the elevated levels of capital it previously needed to conduct the business. The firm will only be able to get rid of that capital if it can win approval from regulators, which has not been easy for any bank and can take years. Until then, the so-called trapped capital will continue to restrain Morgan Stanley\u2019s return on equity.The man who was given the mandate, last October, to deal with this problem is Ted Pick, an executive who came from Morgan Stanley\u2019s successful equities trading business. His elevation has been questioned by some investors who worry that he does not have any experience in fixed income, a very different marketplace.But Mr. Pick, who is now the company\u2019s global head of trading, quickly began cutting from across the bank\u2019s trading desks over the last month. On Thursday, he announced that one of his old deputies from the equities trading business, Sam Kellie-Smith, would now have responsibility for the fixed-income operations.The investor at that 2013 lunch in Boston says he worries that the results of all this will not be different from what happened after previous shake-ups. But he is willing to see it out.\u201cWe can take another run at this,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is it. This is the shot.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How David Bowie Changed Wall Street", "Date": "2016-01-11", "News": "Supported byMr. Bowie at the Glastonbury Festival in England in 2000.In 1997, Mr. Bowie bundled up nearly 300 of his existing recordings and copyrights into a $55 million security that paid the buyer \u2014 Prudential Insurance Company of America \u2014 a 7.9 percent annual rate over 10 years, backed by the income from his royalties and record sales, and the licensing of his songs for films or other uses.The buyers in these deals, which are negotiated privately by the banks that put the transactions together, tend to be specialized hedge funds or big institutions that can negotiate terms with the bankers. Individual investors never got their hands on a Bowie bond because Prudential never sold any of its stake.A Prudential spokesman declined to comment.At the time it was a good deal for Mr. Bowie. He got upfront cash for a decade\u2019s worth of royalty and licensing revenue without having to give up ownership of his songs.Originally rated A3 by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Bowie bonds were later downgraded to Baa3, just above junk status. By the early 2000s, Internet file sharing had become a factor, and musicians were generating less income because album sales were declining.Still, Mr. Bowie\u2019s Wall Street collaboration inspired other celebrities to cash in while the getting was still good. Edward Holland, Brian Holland and Lamont Dozier, the Motown hit songwriters, did a deal, as did James Brown and Rod Stewart. In 2002, DreamWorks SKG entered into a $1 billion deal involving its film catalog.Most asset-backed securities are secured by income generated from mortgages, credit card loans and auto loans. But mortgage-backed securities gave the sector a bad name during the financial crisis and investors backed off for a while.Issuance of asset-backed securities dropped 16.6 percent last year, to $184 billion, with a steep drop off in deals backed by credit card loans, according to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.Deals backed by unusual assets make up about a tenth of the asset-backed security market, appealing to investors who want higher yields and are willing to take on more risk.\u201cThere\u2019s a nonanalytic aspect to these deals that makes them riskier,\u201d says Sylvain Raynes, a founder of R&R Consulting who worked at Moody\u2019s at the time the Bowie bond was being rated.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Daily Fantasy Sports Industry Turns Fans Into Suckers", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byFeatureSince the start of this N.F.L. season, I have lost roughly $1,900 on DraftKings and FanDuel, the two main proprietors of daily fantasy sports (D.F.S.). I play pretty much every night. This requires me to pick a team of players \u2014 whether baseball, basketball, football, hockey or soccer \u2014 each of whom have been assigned a dollar amount, and fit them all under a salary cap. I base these lineups on reasonably educated hunches, something to the effect of: I\u2019ll play the Indiana Pacers point guard George Hill tonight, because he\u2019s going up against the New Orleans Pelicans, who have been a defensive train wreck this season, especially on the perimeter. Also, Monta Ellis, Hill\u2019s back-court partner, is sitting out, which means more of the usage load should fall to Hill. Sometimes, usually while walking the dog, I\u2019ll even sit down on a park bench and check to make sure that at least some of those facts are real. My bets range anywhere from $3 to $100. My losses in D.F.S. are not financially crippling, nor are they happening at a rate that should be cause for concern. But every gambler, whatever the size of the problem, wants to know that he or she has some chance of winning.The ads, I admit, are what got me. For the first 10 months of 2015, DraftKings and FanDuel spent more than a combined $200 million on advertising, a surge that peaked at the start of the football season, when a DraftKings ad ran seemingly every couple of minutes on television. In addition to the ads, many of which showed regular guys like me who had won, in the DraftKings parlance, \u201ca shipload of money,\u201d there were DraftKings lounges in N.F.L. stadiums, FanDuel sidelines in N.B.A. arenas and daily fantasy advice segments in the sports sections of newspapers and all over ESPN, which, during the first weeks of the N.F.L. season, felt as if it had been converted into a nonstop publicity machine for DraftKings. As of August, both companies had billion-dollar valuations and promised weekly competitions with huge payouts and fast and easy withdrawals.Initially, D.F.S. seemed harmless enough \u2014 on Sunday mornings, I would challenge a couple of my friends in California to head-to-head match-ups for $50 and put a few $20 entries into the million-dollar fantasy-football contest. Then, on Sunday, Sept. 27, Ethan Haskell, an employee at DraftKings, inadvertently published information that could have given him an edge over his competitors. That day, Haskell won $350,000 in prizes on FanDuel. (DraftKings later concluded, in an internal review conducted by a former United States attorney, that Haskell obtained the information after the deadline for submitting his lineup in the contest and couldn\u2019t use it for profit.) Haskell\u2019s accidental disclosure and subsequent bonanza caught the attention of several media outlets, including The Times, leading to a volley of articles and columns that placed the operations of daily fantasy sports under close scrutiny.Since the scandal broke, I have traveled to D.F.S. events, spent dozens of hours playing on DraftKings and FanDuel and talked to players and industry media figures. I initially intended to write an article about the bro culture that had sprouted up around D.F.S., which, from a distance, reminded me of the sweaty, sardonic camaraderie you typically see at high-stakes poker events. At the time, the crusade against D.F.S. felt a few degrees too hot \u2014 DraftKings and FanDuel struck me as obviously gambling sites, but the game itself felt sort of like homework. You research players. You build a spreadsheet. You project data and enter a team. You watch the team either fulfill or fall short of your projections. The next day, you start over again. The ruinous thrill of other forms of gambling \u2014 sports betting, blackjack, poker \u2014 just wasn\u2019t there.Instead, I came across a different sort of problem: a rapacious ecosystem in which high-volume gamblers, often aided by computer scripts and optimization software that allow players to submit hundreds or even thousands of lineups at a time, repeatedly take advantage of new players, who, after watching an ad, deposit some money on DraftKings and FanDuel and start betting. Both companies mostly looked the other way. And, when evidence of the competitive advantages enjoyed by these high-volume players became too overwhelming for the companies to ignore, DraftKings and FanDuel enacted rules that in the end are likely to protect the high-volume players rather than regulate them. In any case, a stricter ban on computer scripting would have been functionally impossible \u2014 because, as a representative of FanDuel told me, D.F.S. companies cannot reliably detect it on their sites.Each company took advantage of language in a federal law that allowed them to plug directly into two huge, overlapping populations \u2014 fantasy sports players and gamblers. Each company was able to raise hundreds of millions of dollars in venture capital funding and sponsorships, all of which created pressure to increase user bases, which, in turn, led to an advertising deluge this past fall. It takes years of testing, regulation and outside oversight to create a reliable betting market. But DraftKings and FanDuel rose to prominence \u2014 and now, seemingly, have become derailed \u2014 in the course of a single N.F.L. regular season.The betting economy that has been created is highly unstable and corrupt. One critic I spoke to was Gabriel Harber, a well-known D.F.S. podcaster and writer who has worked in the D.F.S. industry since its inception and goes by the handle CrazyGabey. He has come forward to discuss the rampant exploitation in D.F.S.\u2019s betting economy.\u201cThe idea that these sites exist so that regular guys can make a lot of money playing daily fantasy sports is a lie,\u201d Harber told me. \u201cFanDuel and DraftKings are optimized for power players to rape and pillage regular players over and over again.\u201dAbout a year after the passage of the U.I.G.E.A., Chris Fargis, a poker pro, wrote a post on his personal blog that explained a new business venture he had started called Instant Fantasy Sports. The idea, Fargis wrote, was to \u201ctake the time frame of season-long fantasy sports leagues and shrink it. \u2026 The site will look familiar to many of you who are reading this blog because it\u2019s set up a lot like an online poker site.\u201d\u201cGiven the current state of online gaming, the next logical question is, \u2018Is this site legal?\u2019\u201d Fargis continued. \u201cHappily, I\u2019m able to tell you that fantasy sports games are explicitly protected by the U.I.G.E.A. (the same law that has given online poker so much trouble in the U.S.A.). Instant Fantasy Sports is 100 percent legal in the U.S.A. and Canada.\u201dThe D.F.S. industry is still inextricably tied up in those poker roots. Players talk about \u201ctilting\u201d because of \u201cvariance,\u201d especially when a \u201cfish\u201d puts in a \u201cdonkey\u201d lineup that ends up going crazy. (In regular American English, this translates roughly to \u201cI am really mad because some idiot punched in some random lineup that ended up catching every conceivable break and beating me.\u201d) And it\u2019s not only the former poker players who talk like this \u2014 when I first spoke to Nigel Eccles, the C.E.O. and founder of FanDuel, he referred to the different denominations of D.F.S. games as \u201ctables,\u201d in the same way a pit boss at a casino might point you to the $10 blackjack or the $25 baccarat tables. Rotogrinders, by far the biggest site for D.F.S. discussion, commentary and content, was founded in part by Cal Spears, a former poker player from Tennessee who used to run an online forum for poker strategy called PocketFives. Jonathan Aguiar, DraftKings\u2019 director of V.I.P. services, is also a former poker player known as FatalError. Fargis, too, now works at DraftKings.Over the next few years, dozens of other gaming entrepreneurs started their own daily fantasy companies. There were DraftDay and DraftStreet, along with pretty much every possible portmanteau of \u201cdraft,\u201d \u201cfan\u201d and \u201cfantasy.\u201d The sites made no attempts to hide their connection to poker. They weren\u2019t big enough to warrant attention from law enforcement or regulators. Many of the contestants were career game players who all knew one another from the poker circuit. Prize pools rarely rose much higher than $10,000. The companies failed for all the obvious reasons that companies run by gamblers usually fail.Then, in March 2009, Nigel Eccles, a wiry, youthful entrepreneur from Northern Ireland and an alumnus of the management consulting firm McKinsey, started FanDuel. He had never played fantasy sports before. In Britain, Eccles, who holds an advanced degree in statistics, had started a company called Hubdub that hosted prediction markets on news stories. Readers who had just finished an article on, say, Hillary Clinton\u2019s chances in the New Hampshire primary could then put a wager on it using virtual currency. According to Eccles, Hubdub failed because it \u201cdidn\u2019t have a business model.\u201dBut in the burgeoning D.F.S. scene, Eccles saw a completely legal opportunity to make a huge amount of money. Initially, his investors weren\u2019t so sure. They believed D.F.S. was a niche product that would appeal only to a hard-core audience. But at FanDuel\u2019s first live final in December 2010, where all the qualifying players met up in Las Vegas, Eccles realized that the investors were wrong. The players who had qualified weren\u2019t all oddball quants and gamblers. \u201cThey were all mainstream sports fans,\u201d Eccles said. \u201cThat was the point where I was like, O.K., this is not niche. If we can convert a couple hundred, even a few thousand players, then we can probably convert millions of players. There\u2019s no difference between these players and the tens of millions of fantasy sports fans out there.\u201dEccles often talks about how FanDuel cultivates a sense of community among fans. There\u2019s some truth to what he says. D.F.S. can be a way to connect with people who live far away (I certainly used it that way), and, like Words with Friends or any card game, it can be a fun, low-investment excuse to talk smack with your friends. But on the whole, Fargis, in his introductory blog post, had it spot on: D.F.S. is the bastard child of online poker, with its dizzying prize pools, fast action and, perhaps most important, the dream of an easy living. The only difference is that poker, despite its seedy glamour, is associated with casinos and shady underground games. Fantasy sports, by contrast, evokes visions of dads sitting in basements with their college friends, yelling out the names of their favorite athletes.Here\u2019s how it works: Let\u2019s say you run D.F.S. Site A, and D.F.S Site B has just announced a weekly megacontest in which first place will take home $1 million. Now you have to find a way to host a comparable contest, or all your customers will flee to Site B to chase that seven-figure jackpot. The problem is that you have only 25,000 users, and the most you can charge them to enter is $20 per game (anything higher is prohibitively expensive). And you\u2019ll need $2 million or even $3 million in a prize pool if first prize is valued at $1 million (remember, you still have to pay second place, third place and beyond). So you need to somehow quadruple the number of entries. But how? You\u2019re already paying high cost-per-acquisition fees to sites like RotoGrinders, which charge, according to Harber, anywhere between $100 and $200 per person they refer to your site, and you\u2019ve already put your logo on every bus, trash can and ESPN screaming-heads show out there. You\u2019ve also kicked in some of your own money (known as \u201coverlay\u201d) to spice up the pot.The solution is simple: You let each contestant enter hundreds of times. But even given this freedom, a majority of people will enter only a few more times, which will help but probably won\u2019t get you all you need. If, however, you can attract a few high rollers who are willing to book several hundred or even several thousand entries apiece, the path to the $1 million first prize becomes a lot more manageable. And as long as you can make sure those players keep pouring in their thousands of entries, you can keep posting the $1 million first prize all over your ads. (Each company has instituted caps on the number of entries per player, but more enterprising high rollers have found ways around this.)Now, however, you have an even bigger problem: You need the high roller more than he needs you. You need his entry fees to gas up your prize pools, and you also need the roughly 10 percent service fee he pays for the hundreds of thousands of dollars he bets on the site. In big casinos, high rollers have been known to negotiate rules with the house. If, for example, a whale from China wants to play a variant of blackjack in which the dealer has to hit on soft 17, the casino, especially if it is struggling, will sometimes adjust to please the whale.D.F.S. high rollers similarly come with demands, and because there\u2019s no powerful regulatory body involved, DraftKings and FanDuel have been mostly free to set the parameters of play, which, as it turns out, is near anarchy, especially for the D.F.S. elite. High rollers want to be able to use third-party computer scripts that will allow them to enter thousands of lineups at once, something that your average player cannot do. High rollers can gain access into D.F.S.\u2019s inner circle, in which they get to be on first-name, texting basis with executives and employees at DraftKings and FanDuel. They can operate under the cover of plausible deniability \u2014 if other players complain that the high roller has been using tools that destroy competitive balance, he might expect the sites to stick up for him.The difference between the D.F.S. high roller and the blackjack whale, of course, is that the whale is trying to take millions from a multinational casino corporation and not from the honeymooners from Fresno who are betting away at the $5 tables.In the game lobbies of DraftKings and FanDuel, however, sharks are free to flood the marketplace with thousands of entries every day, luring inexperienced, bad players into games in which they are at a sizable disadvantage. The imbalanced winnings in D.F.S. have been an open secret since this past September, when Bloomberg Businessweek published an expos\u00e9 on the habits of high-volume players. The numbers are damning. According to DraftKings data obtained by the New York State attorney general\u2019s office, between 2013 and 2014, 89.3 percent of players had a negative return on investment. A recent McKinsey study showed that in the first half of the 2015 Major League Baseball season, 91 percent of the prize money was won by a mere 1.3 percent of the players.In their escalating legal battles, DraftKings and FanDuel have used these statistics to bolster their argument that D.F.S. is a game of skill, not of chance: How could a contest in which the same people win nearly all the time not be the ultimate test of skill? DraftKings and FanDuel have each tried to prove that the act of projecting player performance and selecting a lineup takes more thought and expertise than, say, playing a poker hand. In paperwork filed on Dec. 24 in Illinois, the latest state to question the legality of D.F.S. lawyers wrote that D.F.S. is \u201clike chess, Scrabble or crossword-puzzle tournaments in that they do not test athletic skill, but instead mental prowess.\u201d They went on to argue that \u201cthe success of a contest is not a matter of luck any more than was the success of the architects of the 1985 Super Bowl-winning Chicago Bears.\u201dWhile it\u2019s true that some of the skill required to win in DraftKings and FanDuel lies in statistical modeling, general sports knowledge and due diligence, it\u2019s also true that it\u2019s nearly impossible to make a net positive return on investment without bumhunting. You have to win roughly 53 percent of your bets to beat the \u201crake,\u201d another poker term for the roughly 10 percent service fee DraftKings and FanDuel take out of each wager. The most efficient way to hit that number is to play as many bad opponents as possible.For the 17 weeks I played D.F.S., whether at a $5 entry fee or for $100, I routinely was matched up against top players. But unless I examined win rates and researched the strengths and weaknesses of my opponents, I would never have known that I was being repeatedly bumhunted by high-volume players.On Dec. 16, for example, I entered three $20 N.B.A. head-to-head contests on DraftKings. My opponents were gunz4hire, Dinkpiece and Nadia4Fashion. Gunz4hire was then ranked 47th on the Rotogrinders players ranking and is generally considered one of the better players in the world. Dinkpiece, who was 20th on that same list, is the alias for Drew Dinkmeyer, a former stock trader whose winnings in D.F.S. have been so well publicized that he has his own Wall Street Journal stipple drawing.On Christmas, the biggest day in the N.B.A.\u2019s regular season, I entered 17 head-to-head contests on DraftKings for prices between $1 and $20. Once again, I was matched up against Dinkpiece and gunz4hire, along with a handful of other professionals.The next day, I entered three more $20 N.B.A. contests. I was able to avoid Dinkpiece and gunz4hire, but found myself in a $20 head-to-head against Birdwings, the 2nd-ranked player in the Rotogrinders rankings.In three days, I played three of the best D.F.S. players in the world.In December, I traveled to the FanDuel World Fantasy Football Championships in San Diego. The festivities, which would end with one player winning a staggering $3 million first prize, included an obstacle course in which Joe Montana and Dan Marino threw footballs at the qualifiers, as well as an extremely drunken couple in Patriots jerseys (those of Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski, of course) who kept screaming, \u201cWe\u2019re [expletive] rich!\u201d While the championships raged on, I asked Eccles about the gross imbalance of winners detailed in the McKinsey report. He said that baseball was not an accurate marker for how the site worked. The majority of D.F.S. novices only come to play football, and their sheer numbers and the natural variance in fantasy football distributes the money more equally. He admitted the Sunday Million, FanDuel\u2019s most-hyped N.F.L. tournament, was extremely difficult for the average player to win. He suggested, instead, that new players enroll in beginner leagues, which are open exclusively to players who have entered only a few contests, and in 50/50s, where several, even thousands of players pool their money together and reward the money to the players who finish in the top half, and head-to-head competitions, in which two players play one another, winner-take-all.On Sunday, Dec. 27, I took Eccles\u2019s advice and entered myself into 20 separate N.F.L. head-to-head contests with buy-ins ranging from $2 to $20. This time, I drew Mtom347, a high-volume player ranked 42 on the Rotogrinders leader board; David Potts, winner of the 2014 FanDuel Daily Fantasy Baseball Championship; and TwoSHAE, one of the 25 top ranked daily fantasy football players in the world.On Dec. 28, I had a phone conversation with Justine Sacco, FanDuel\u2019s director of communications. She told me that I must have misunderstood Eccles and that he was probably referring only to 50-50 match-ups, in which a large group of people enter a pool and roughly the top half wins the bottom half\u2019s money, and not head to heads, which were admittedly tough to beat. The next day, I entered an N.B.A. 50-50, once again for $20.There were 3,638 total entries in the 50-50 that day. Roughly two-thirds of these came from players who entered multiple lineups. Here is a small selection of those players and the number of lineups they entered:Maxdalury, generally considered the top player in the world: 100 lineups.Birdwings, the No. 2-rated player on the RotoGrinders rankings: 22 lineups.rayofhope, the screen name for Cory Albertson, a former poker pro, widely regarded as one of the best: 40 lineups.Kobe4MVP, the screen name for Eytan Jankowitz, also one of the best players in the world: 100 lineups.Youdacao, the No. 6 player on the RotoGrinders rankings: 100 lineups.Notorious, a regular contributor to the Rotogrinders site and the No. 24 player on their rankings: 40 lineups.Dinkpiece, my nemesis from the last two times: five lineupsIf we are going to talk about games of skill and the legal protection they deserve, we should acknowledge that much of the skill in D.F.S. lies in bumhunting. It\u2019s why maxdalury and Birdwings are slumming it in a $20 50-50 competition with me. It\u2019s how the top players ensure their profitability. In D.F.S., as in poker, the easiest way to win money is to turn a sucker into an A.T.M.Over the course of extensive phone conversations and correspondence this fall and winter, Harber explained that he had begun to turn against DraftKings and FanDuel when the companies were unresponsive to complaints from the D.F.S. community about the prevalence of scripting. Last March, when maxdalury, a player named Saahil Sud, used a script that enabled him to adjust most of his 400 lineups in less than an hour, the community took notice. Sud was reacting to the breaking news that Channing Frye, usually a reserve forward for the Orlando Magic, would be starting in place of the injured Nikola Vucevic. Sud won first, third, fourth and seventh place in a big DraftKings competition that night and took home hundreds of thousands of dollars. The speed with which he made the adjustments caused many within the D.F.S. community to protest. How could they be reasonably expected to compete if one of the players was using a tool that allowed him to both blanket the field with entries and avoid the work and hassle of manually adjusting his lineups to reflect late-breaking news? What\u2019s worse, these scripts were not supposed to be used under DraftKing\u2019s terms of service.In July, after months of review, instead of banning scripting, or at least forcefully regulating it, as the D.F.S. community would have liked, both DraftKings and FanDuel announced that they would change their policies to permit some scripting. The founder of DraftKings, Matt Kalish, who declined to comment for this article, told ESPN\u2019s David Purdum in July that the decision had been made to \u201cincrease and improve the experience for a couple of users, who I think were experiencing a very poor usability of the site.\u201d In other words, DraftKings had decided to accommodate players who wanted to modify the site to their own specifications. FanDuel, for its part, clarified its position on the practice and asked players to send in their scripts for \u201capproval.\u201d This, by definition, is a game played by different rules.Harber explained how his frustration with DraftKings and FanDuel reached a breaking point. \u201cPeople may wonder why I\u2019m coming forward now, and it\u2019s a good question,\u201d Harber wrote in one of two emailed statements to me. \u201cMy focus as a broadcaster in this industry for the last four years has been primarily as an ambassador to the community. The daily fantasy community has had very real concerns about competitive imbalances at FanDuel and DraftKings for quite some time now. I have publicly submitted simple questions in writing to both companies on numerous occasions, and both companies have completely ignored the community\u2019s concerns about the use of automated processes, sniping, multiaccounting and their own terms of service.\u201d\u201cYour average Joe sees a commercial for daily fantasy sports, signs up, plays and loses,\u201d Harber wrote. \u201cHe has no idea his games are being sniped by professional power users with access to automated processes and optimization software. He has no idea that the large-field tournament he\u2019s playing in features power users with hundreds of unique lineups, all optimized using third-party software. In truth, D.F.S. is more like the stock market, with athletes instead of commodities. No new player attempting to trade stocks has any shot at success without a sizable amount of training.\u201dHarber continued: \u201cI believe the major sites are fully aware of these competitive issues, yet they continue to do nothing about them because of the high amount of rake the power users are bringing in for them. As long as they can spend advertising money to bring fresh meat to the table, the power users will eat up the new players extremely fast by using their competitive advantages. No one is saying that better players should not win money off worse players, but it should not be at this rate and it should not be with misleading advertisements that prey on consumer confidence. Everyone does not have an equal chance, and everyone is not playing on the same field.\u201cThe major daily fantasy sites do not want attention drawn to these competitive issues because they are also afraid that doing so will increase the likelihood of negative legal consequences for them. Their rationale is that if the various attorneys general and prosecutors were to become knowledgeable about these competitive issues, they would be much more likely to outright ban daily fantasy.\u201dDraftKings and FanDuel have instituted rules to address some of these problems \u2014 each site has sections dedicated to new players, and FanDuel, at least, says that all scripts must be approved by the company. (DraftKings\u2019 terms of use permits \u201climited use of scripts\u201d and prompts users to email them for details.) But those measures only protect players from the worst excesses of bumhunting behavior.I asked Justine Sacco why FanDuel allowed scripting at all. She told me: \u201cYou want to allow people on the site to make their experience meaningfully better. So the idea that big players can\u2019t bring in features to improve their time, honestly \u2014 it feels a bit Orwellian.\u201dSacco emphasized that any script that was deemed \u201canticompetitive\u201d would immediately be banned, and that the company had caught and banned players for using scripts in the past, but she declined to release any specific names. She also estimated that FanDuel had approved approximately 30 scripts over all and that some of these were benign, voluntary devices used by sites like Rotogrinders to track the wins of their players. When asked if part of FanDuel\u2019s decision to allow scripts was based on a desire to keep players from taking more of their business to DraftKings, Sacco said, \u201cYou do have to take that into account \u2014 if someone is playing hundreds of thousands of dollars and comes and says, \u2018I have some ideas that would help me keep doing what I\u2019m doing,\u2019 only a bad business would not take that into consideration.\u201dSacco also said that one reason FanDuel allowed some scripting was that the company could not completely stop it. This confirms the suspicions of many in the D.F.S. community who believe that DraftKings and FanDuel do not regulate scripts because they have become so sophisticated that the companies simply don\u2019t know how to detect or disable all of them. (DraftKings, when asked for comment, said these \u201cassumptions\u201d were \u201cinaccurate.\u201d) When I asked Justin Park, maxdalury\u2019s business partner at RotoQL, a site that provides third-party tools, including a scripting program that plugs straight into the DraftKings interface, if he had asked DraftKings for permission to alter their site, he said he didn\u2019t know. He later remembered an email exchange with DraftKings. DraftKings could not confirm this.This amounts to gaming chaos \u2014 nobody really knows what the next guy might be doing, and everyone who should be making decisions that ensure fairness is afraid to punish power players for their indiscretions. There is no gambling hole in America, whether Atlantic City or Las Vegas or a riverboat in the Mississippi, that could put out a game like DraftKings or FanDuel without running straight into the state gaming commission.Knowledge about sports will always be the main sorting mechanism for the types of dudes (FanDuel reports that 95 percent of its contestants are male) who play games like D.F.S., and there\u2019s certainly nothing wrong \u2014 especially morally wrong \u2014 with putting some money on it, but there is a point where rampant bumhunting turns a gambling economy into a predatory market.There is, in theory, a version of D.F.S. that could work. All that\u2019s required is a transparent marketplace in which a player can reasonably expect to enter a head-to-head or 50-50 or even one of the big-money tournaments without going up against hundreds of lineups generated by professional gamblers who have been lying in wait for him.During my many conversations with Harber, we would often find ourselves talking about my D.F.S. match-ups for the night. Both of us love the N.B.A. above all things, and we would invariably start talking about DeMarcus Cousins and his sad six years in the N.B.A., or Gerald Green\u2019s shot volume, or whether we could trust Tony Parker to put up fantasy points anymore. These, I believe, are the sorts of moments the best of the D.F.S. community wants to promote \u2014 fantasy sports is essentially a way to turn the usual sports arguments into a game.At the start of the N.B.A. season, a couple of friends and I started a friendly league on DraftKings. Every night, we draft teams, watch the points accumulate and make fun of one another for our picks. On the first of each month, we pay one another what we owe. One of these friends creates N.B.A. player performance models. They help him escape the cynical demands of his job as a corporate lawyer. To date, I am down $350 to him.\u201cYes, yes, yes,\u201d Harber said when I told him about this league. \u201cThat\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to be.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incompletely to action against DraftKings and FanDuel. It was a judge\u2019s order telling the companies to stop accepting wagers \u2014 not an order by the New York attorney general \u2014 that was stayed on appeal.Advertisement"}

It was the biggest single-day increase in Japanese shares since September.Analysts said that, in addition to a push from bargain-hunting traders, Friday\u2019s rally could also have been driven by hopes that major central banks, including those in Japan and Europe, would soon roll out economic stimulus efforts.\u201cThe general background is the expectation for monetary easing,\u201d said Takuya Takahashi, a senior strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo. \u201cWe saw a rise today because the market is just speculatively expecting the Bank of Japan, along with the central government, will take some action.\u201dChina\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.European stocks continued their rebound on Friday, with the FTSE 100 share index in Britain rising 3 percent through early afternoon. The regional Euro Stoxx 50 index was up 2.4 percent. Futures activity pointed to a strong opening on Wall Street when trading begins in New York.Earlier, the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong closed 2.9 percent higher, while Shanghai stocks rose 1.3 percent.Global markets have been under pressure this year. Increased uncertainty over the health of China\u2019s economy and the plummeting price of oil have fed concerns that the world economy could be on shakier ground than it appeared.In response, professional money managers have been converting more of their investment portfolios to cash, regarded as a safer but lower-return investment than stocks or bonds, according to a survey published this week by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.But the rebound on Friday in Asia suggested that buyers have not been lurking too far from the action. Many assets that have been pummeled in recent sessions got an end-of-the-week reprieve from investors.Oil continued its minirally, with futures contracts for Brent crude, the international benchmark, trading 7 percent higher at $31.27 a barrel.

{"Headline": "\u2018Noon Swoon,\u2019 Then Recovery That May Signal Market Turnaround", "Date": "2016-01-20", "News": "Supported bySoon after midday on Wednesday, panic selling seemed to be seizing the United States stock market.The Dow Jones industrial average was down more than 500 points, and all the fears that have driven this year\u2019s declines \u2014 including concerns that the world economy is slowing \u2014 seemed as potent as ever.Then investors\u2019 mood changed.Buyers rushed in, sending the Dow up over 400 points. What could have been a rout ended up being just the sort of down day that investors have had to get used to this year.The Dow closed off 249 points, or 1.56 percent, to 15,766.74. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, a broader benchmark, fell 22 points, or 1.17 percent, to 1,859.33. The Nasdaq composite index ended barely changed, 5.26 points lower, or 0.12 percent.And after spiking, the Vix index, which measures investors\u2019 expectations of volatility and is known as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, tumbled.To some, the turnaround felt a little like the sort of cathartic turning point that can signal a bottom on the markets \u2014 at least for a time.\u201cThe noon swoon today looked to me to be consistent with sort of important lows that I\u2019ve seen over the years,\u201d said Douglas A. Kass, a founder of Seabreeze Partners Management. \u201cYou had panic, fear and immobility on the part of many investors.\u201dThe main reason that the analysts gave for their tempered optimism is that the global economy does not appear to be in as poor a shape as the stock market is suggesting. In other words, while many countries, including China and its $10 trillion economy, still face stiff challenges, the United States stock market now appears to already reflect such risks, these analysts say.\u201cIt feels like we are discounting too much bad news ahead,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. \u201cOn these sort of days, you want to go and look at how the economy is doing, and it appears that the financial markets are overreacting.\u201dIn recent years, global stocks have at times sold off sharply without a clear, cataclysmic trigger. Instead, the cause has been concern that the global economy is faltering. In 2011 and 2012, Europe was the source of most fears. Then last year, China started to unsettle global markets, especially after its shock currency devaluation in August.Still, investors have in recent years jumped back into the market after they have concluded that the world economy is not sliding into recession and that the global financial system is not about seize up as it did in 2008.The markets, however, will have to rise by quite a lot to recover their recent losses.The S.&P. 500 has slid 9.03 percent so far this year and is now 12.74 percent below the nominal high that it reached last year. After adjusting for inflation, the stock market is lower than it was in 1999.And some markets are still flashing warning signals.On Wednesday, for instance, investors sought the safety of government bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which falls as its price rises, slipped to 1.99 percent, from 2.06 percent, the first time it has closed below the 2 percent threshold since October.The tumbling price of oil has also persuaded investors to be cautious. Cheaper oil reduces costs for companies and consumers. But a falling oil price could also be a signal that companies require less oil, which in turn could be an early signal that the world economy is on the verge of decelerating.The impulse when the stock market falls hard for a few days in a row is to do something but it probably doesn\u2019t make much sense to overhaul an investment strategy based on a blip of market activity.And on Wednesday, oil prices resumed their slide; the price of a barrel of crude oil reached the lowest level since May 2003. Crude oil was down 6.7 percent, to settle at $26.55 a barrel in trading for February futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange.European stocks ended sharply lower on Wednesday. The Euro Stoxx 50 index was down 3.3 percent. The FTSE 100 in London closed the day down 3.46 percent. London stocks are now down more than 20 percent from their April high: a level analysts generally regard as a bear market.Stocks in Japan closed 3.7 percent lower, bringing the Nikkei 225\u2019s total decline since its near-term high in June into bear market territory, too.The trading action in the United States stock market contained some unexpected moves. Shares of Twitter, which have plunged in recent weeks, surged on takeover rumors, leaving the stock up 4.13 percent for the day.Pradnya Joshi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Goldman Says It Supports IEX, but Raises Market Structure Issues", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported byGoldman Sachs told the Securities and Exchange Commission in a letter dated Tuesday that it supported a proposed new stock exchange, but also pointed out that one exchange should not have an unfair advantage over another in its control of market data.The proposed exchange, Investors Exchange, or IEX, is trying to get approval to operate as an official exchange. It bills itself as the investor-friendly alternative to other exchanges, where high-frequency traders lie in wait to make trades based, in part, on the buy and sell orders their fast computer programs can see from other brokers.IEX proposes to slow trading by delaying the sharing of buy and sell orders on its exchange by 350 microseconds. But it would not slow its receipt of information from others \u2014 and that is part of the problem, its rivals say.Goldman has long been supportive of IEX, and said in its letter that the emergence of the new exchange had raised important issues regarding the way stock markets operate. One of those issues is that exchanges have increasingly taken on roles as broker-dealers.\u201cWe are concerned that exchange-affiliated routing broker-dealers may have access to and use the proprietary market data of the exchange to benefit their own order routers,\u201d Goldman said on Tuesday in a comment letter to the S.E.C.In other words, IEX will have some trade information before other exchanges, such as BATS, the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq.BATS said last year in its comment letter, \u201cThis disparate treatment in favor of IEX\u2019s routing-broker dealer not only unfairly discriminates against other broker-dealers, but it actually allows the IEX routing-broker dealer to engage in the exact type of latency arbitrage that IEX claims is plaguing the current market.\u201dThe N.Y.S.E., Citadel Securities and others have made similar complaints.One of the market trends of the last two decades has been an increasingly blurred distinction between the broker-dealers who send orders to and from exchanges and the exchanges themselves.Goldman and other major Wall Street trading banks compete with exchanges for orders through their internal dark pools, which match buyers and sellers but do not publish the trade information.Goldman has been investing in electronic trading, including improving its Sigma X dark pool and hiring executives from high-frequency trading firms to strengthen its electronic execution business.In the comment letter said Goldman said it supported IEX becoming an exchange. The bank also suggested that speed should not be the only factor in trading.\u201cThe value to investors from this nonstop race for faster speeds may have reached a point of diminishing marginal returns for market efficiency and stability,\u201d Paul Russo, a managing director at Goldman, wrote in the letter. Instead, stronger safety nets to reduce the size and frequency of market malfunctions should be a priority, the letter said.An earlier version of this article misstated the thrust of Goldman Sachs\u2019s letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission about Investors Exchange. Goldman continues to endorse the exchange; its support is not \u201cin the past.\u201d (The letter did, however, raise questions about a proposed delay in transmitting buy and sell orders.)Advertisement"}

The American economy is acting as a steadying force in a volatile world.A giant question for 2016 \u2014 not just for Americans but for people across the globe who benefit from having one of the world\u2019s major economic engines revving while others sputter \u2014 is how resilient the United States will prove to be.On the other hand, in the past the United States has shown an uncanny tendency to benefit economically from tumult abroad.\u201cThe United States may not have incredibly robust economic growth and has plenty of problems you can point to,\u201d said Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, a geopolitical consultancy. \u201cBut from a stability perspective, when things are more unstable, the United States in some ways gets stronger\u201d as both people and investment dollars gravitate to the nation\u2019s relative stability.The truth is, not one of the problems that have flared across financial news tickers so far in 2016 is completely new or surprising. Rather, they are continuations of trends that were well established in 2015.Oil prices fell to $37 a barrel from around $53 a barrel over the course of last year, and are now under $34. The Shanghai composite index fell sharply starting in June of last year, and even after steep declines in the opening days of 2016 is above its late-August level (though it is anybody\u2019s guess how much it would have fallen absent a string of government interventions to try to stanch the declines).Economic growth has been slowing not just in China but across many emerging markets, including Brazil and Nigeria, for two years now. Europe and Japan are growing only barely, and even formerly hot advanced economies like Canada are suffering from the commodity glut.Against that gloomy backdrop, the consensus economic forecasts for the United States \u2014 the International Monetary Fund forecasts 2.8 percent growth in 2016 \u2014 look pretty terrific. The American stock market indexes, despite the global sell-off and major hits to oil companies\u2019 earnings, remain above their September levels.But there are two basic questions about the notion that the United States can serve as an island of economic and political stability in a messy world.First, what happens if that changes? Second, what happens if it doesn\u2019t?The \u201cthings change\u201d situation is the risk that these global headwinds become too powerful for the United States to overcome.Already, oil producers and their suppliers are suffering. The American industrial sector is groaning under the weight of a strong dollar, which drives up the price of exported goods. That\u2019s a consequence of the mismatch between growth in the United States and the rest of the world.The strength in the service sector and the broader consumer economy in the United States has offset any damage so far. But the 2008 crisis showed how the global economy is intertwined in ways that are hard to predict \u2014 and that\u2019s before accounting for the geopolitical dangers from the Middle East and the Korean Peninsula that could cause major economic disruptions if they take a dark turn.If something does go wrong, the usual buffers in the global economy look to be weakened or nonexistent right now. Government deficits are high in much of the world, and even where they aren\u2019t, political leaders have shown no desire to open the spending floodgates in an effort to bolster economies. If the American economy were to slump and President Obama were to ask the Republican Congress for fiscal stimulus, it would give new meaning to \u201cDead on Arrival.\u201dThen there\u2019s the less obvious risk from this mismatch between what is happening in the United States and the rest of the world \u2014 the risk of what happens if it doesn\u2019t change.During the years running up to the 2008 crisis, the United States served as the global consumer of last resort. Americans kept shopping when the rest of the world hunkered down. The side effect of that role in the global economy was constantly increasing debt, which in the precrisis era frequently took the form of mortgage-related securities.The longer other global economies remain a mess and the United States remains on a relatively steady course, the more these same forces will reassert themselves. This means that an ever-strengthening dollar will hobble American exporters while fueling an American consumption binge. Broadly, it would mean that crisis-era hopes of a more balanced global economy might not come to fruition.In other words, the best thing that could happen for the global economy would be for the mismatch between the United States and the rest of the world to end \u2014 and not because the United States falters. Rather, it would happen if Europe and Japan achieved more rapid growth, China managed its shift toward a more consumer-driven economy and other emerging markets weathered a tough year while continuing their progress toward stable and sustainable growth.It\u2019s a tall order for a world full of unpredictable risks. Good thing 2016 has another 51 weeks to go.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Emerging Markets Roar, Stand Your Ground", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byFundamentallyWhile most forms of investing require a leap of faith, betting on emerging-markets stock funds this year \u2014 Chinese stocks have already had double-digit declines \u2014 may feel like jumping across the Grand Canyon.Not only have shares of companies based in developing economies like China, Brazil and Russia been mired in a prolonged bear market \u2014 prices were down about 40 percent from April 2011 through Thursday, compared with a 44 percent gain percent for American stocks \u2014 but this once-promising group was also hit with a double whammy of bad news at the end of last year.There was the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision in December to raise short-term interest rates for the first time since 2006. Near-zero rates, intended to encourage risk-taking, induced investors to pump billions of dollars into the developing world in search of higher yields and better returns.Now rates are a bit higher and the mood is very different. \u201cUncertainty associated with the Fed and guidance on future rate hikes is a big overhanging negative\u201d for emerging-market shares, said Brian D. Singer, head of dynamic allocation strategies at the asset manager William Blair.Despite this bad news, money managers and market strategists say there is a compelling case for long-term investors to have a presence in the developing world.A big reason is valuations.Historically, the price-earnings ratio of emerging-market stocks \u2014 based on five years of averaged, or \u201cnormalized,\u201d profits \u2014 has been roughly 20 percent lower than the price-earnings ratio for stocks in the United States, according to figures compiled by the Leuthold Group. During the global financial crisis in 2008, emerging-market shares actually traded at a 20 percent premium.Today, these stocks are 53 percent cheaper than domestic shares.The last time they were this inexpensive was in 2000, shortly after the Asian currency crisis raised questions about the health of those economies. From mid-1997 through 2000, emerging-market shares declined more than 30 percent.In hindsight, said Jason Hsu, vice chairman of Research Affiliates, the aftermath of the Asian currency crisis was probably among the best times to be invested in these shares.From 2000 through 2007, emerging-market stocks tripled in value while the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index of domestic shares was flat. \u201cThe lesson of the Asian currency crisis,\u201d Mr. Hsu said, is that \u201crebounds can come fast and furious and waiting can sometimes hurt you.\u201dResearch Affiliates predicts that over the next decade, emerging-market stock returns will outpace inflation by nearly 8 percentage points a year, owing much to lower valuations. By contrast, the firm predicts that blue-chip domestic stocks will beat inflation by only about 1 percentage point a year.Fed rate increases are likely to hurt companies in the emerging world in a couple of ways: Rising interest rates could slow global growth, which may further reduce demand for commodities, and rising domestic rates could also strengthen the value of the dollar against emerging-market currencies.\u201cIf the dollar continues to strengthen, companies and countries holding dollar-denominated debt could be hit with solvency issues,\u201d said Arjun Jayaraman, a portfolio manager with Causeway Capital Management. That is because their debt burden based on their local currencies would rise.But Mr. Jayaraman also pointed out that if the Fed increases are more gradual than expected, leading to \u201ca slow and steady increase in the dollar, the emerging markets can weather that better,\u201d he said.Also, market watchers think that if the slowdown in China is not as pronounced as the market fears, that, too, could be good news for emerging-market equities.How then can investors play this volatile group of stocks for the long term while still trying to play it safe? There are several strategies.Investors could simply \u201cdollar-cost average\u201d into emerging-market stocks, which means putting money to work in the markets in small increments on a regular schedule, which investors already do effortlessly with their 401(k) retirement accounts.\u201cIf you think in the long run you\u2019d be comfortable putting 15 percent of your stock portfolio in the emerging markets but don\u2019t know if today is the right time, give yourself a window \u2014 say, 15 months \u2014 and commit to putting 1 percentage point to work each month come hell or high water,\u201d Mr. Hsu said. \u201cThat takes away the anxiety over whether the timing is exactly right.\u201dLewis J. Altfest, a financial planner in New York City, suggests being selective about the type of emerging-market stocks you own.For instance, he said, \u201cif you\u2019re worried about commodities, you want to be in those countries that are beneficiaries of low commodity prices, not victims.\u201d He pointed to industrial and consumer economies such as India and South Korea that stand to gain with low energy and raw-materials prices.Jeffrey N. Kleintop, chief global investment strategist for Charles Schwab, agreed, suggesting that investors stay away from commodity-based economies such as Brazil, Russia and South Africa, instead focusing on more diverse economies such as Mexico, South Korea and Taiwan.To be sure, such a strategy does have a drawback. While stock market valuations in commodity-producing emerging markets are dirt cheap \u2014 Russian stocks, for instance, trade at a price-earnings ratio of around 6 \u2014 commodity importers like South Korea and India are more expensive. The average price-earnings for the MSCI South Korea index, for instance, is about 10 while Indian stocks trade at 19 times their projected earnings.\u201cYes, the emerging markets are cheap, but it\u2019s not the cheapest ones you necessarily want to own,\u201d Mr. Kleintop said, citing the danger of plunging commodity prices.This calls for seeding a portfolio partly with companies based in economies like India that might not be hurt by lower commodity prices. Among the fund\u2019s top holdings in India is HDFC Bank, a large retail bank. Then the other part can be devoted to \u201cthings that are outright cheap,\u201d Mr. Wilson said. \u201cI would put China in that camp. The market is too concerned about the growth outlook for China without noticing the low valuations.\u201dAmong the fund\u2019s top holdings in China is China Mobile, the world\u2019s largest wireless phone company.For instance, he pointed out that over the next 10 to 20 years, the sheer demographic shifts taking place in China \u2014 including the growing middle class and the aging population \u2014 may point to favorable conditions for the country\u2019s health care sector.\u201cIn the next 10 years, the pharmaceutical market there could be the second largest in the world, outside the U.S.,\u201d he said. Even better, that market is most likely to grow no matter what happens to commodity prices or interest rates.If you are able to take a really long view, emerging markets may not be as scary as they seem.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Corporate Raider Enters Picture, With Eye on a Sale of Ally", "Date": "2016-01-12", "News": "Supported byNow, an upstart New York hedge fund is trying to step into that pantheon of corporate bank raiders.Lion Point joins a select group of activist investors to take aim at a national, deposit-taking bank as part of a wave of activism that has touched just about every industry in the last two years. It raises the prospect that activism will soon spread to big institutions, like Bank of America, that suffer from lagging share prices.This week, some of the nation\u2019s largest banks report their fourth-quarter results, which are expected to show modest improvement but no cures for their lackluster returns. There are also renewed calls \u2014 this time on the presidential campaign trail \u2014 to break up the big banks.Lion Point\u2019s campaign, however, shows the long odds activists face in trying to shake up or split up a large, underperforming bank.Early this month, the hedge fund proposed two candidates for the board of Ally and urged the company to explore strategic alternatives. In a statement, Ally said Lion Point had a \u201cclear agenda to force\u201d the lender\u2019s sale. Ally, formerly known as GMAC, said that path would not be in the best interest of its other shareholders.Lion Point released a statement two days later, expressing disappointment with Ally\u2019s decision to publicly disclose their talks. The hedge fund said that the strategic review was only one part of their proposal to Ally, without elaborating on other suggestions.Often the mere disclosure of an activist campaign can cause a stock to soar. Ally\u2019s shares, however, have fallen about 12 percent since Lion Point\u2019s involvement became public last week.Inside Ally, there is also frustration with the share price, which has slumped 31 percent over the last year. Long before the activist effort spilled out into the public, Ally was under pressure from many of its other hedge fund investors, which bought the bank\u2019s shares after it went public in 2014 hoping it could ride the boom in auto sales, according to people briefed on the matter.But given the chance, Ally executives might entertain selling parts or all of the company, the people said. The reality, though, is that there are no obvious buyers for a bank with a market value of about $8 billion and more than $156 billion in assets.\u201cFinding an exit strategy for a bank the size of Ally is going to be difficult in the current regulatory environment,\u201d said Frederick L. Cannon, a banking analyst with the investment bank Keefe Bruyette & Woods. \u201cThe number of potential buyers is going to be pretty small.\u201dOne possible candidate is TD Bank Group, of Toronto, which has been acquiring smaller banks in the United States over the last decade, according to analysts and people briefed on the matter. So far, TD Bank has made no overtures toward Ally, the people said. A spokeswoman for TD Bank declined to comment.Regulators keep a close eye on any investor that acquires a significant stake in a bank. Once a fund manager surpasses an ownership of about 5 percent, the Federal Reserve could come in and request a passivity commitment, preventing the shareholder from trying to influence operations at the company or starting a proxy fight.If an investor tries to buy a stake greater than 10 percent, it must file an application with regulators for approval. These potential regulatory hindrances have dispelled activists from going after banks in the past. Lion Point owns about 1 percent of Ally.Lastly, there are certain conflicts of interest that would arise from aiming at the largest banks. For one, many of the hedge funds use these banks to conduct their trading. Additionally, law firms that would help advise on the shareholder\u2019s campaign also count these firms as clients and would be more hesitant in helping the activist.Despite the popularity of activism over the last few years, the financial sector has been largely untapped. In the nonbank sector of the industry, Carl C. Icahn has recently been pushing the insurer American International Group to break itself up.\u201cThere has been a lag of activists targeting this sector,\u201d said Josh Black, editor of Activist Insight. \u201cBut it\u2019s been building over a while by activists becoming more involved and looking for more targets in this sector.\u201dLion Point was started in 2014 by former portfolio managers from the activist hedge fund firms Elliott Management and Perry Capital, ultimately raising about $950 million from investors.Their fund joins about $350 billion in assets at activist-focused or partly focused funds, according to data compiled by Activist Insight, which tracks data on activism. The number of campaigns and amount of capital has increased the perception that the market is crowded, according to a report from FTI Consulting and Activist Insight; 40 percent of activist firms surveyed said that the opportunities had dwindled as more activists entered the fray.The challenges do not make campaigns against financial institutions impossible, however.In recent years, Nelson Peltz\u2019s Trian Fund Management has gone after both BNY Mellon and State Street, two systemically important institutions. At State Street, Mr. Peltz achieved some of his requests, such as higher margins and share buybacks, but not everything. At BNY Mellon, he achieved a board seat.In a number of ways, Ally appears ripe for a shake-up. Like many other large banks, its shares trade below book value, which is what the company would be worth if liquidated. All of the analysts who follow the company have a buy recommendation on the stock.Ally has been expanding its lending to car buyers with less-than-pristine credit, which has helped bolster revenue. But the move also increases the default risks when the economy slows, analysts say.\u201cA big concern for the banks right now is credit,\u201d said Mr. Cannon, the banking analyst. \u201cCredit has been so good for so long that there is a natural normalization that is occurring.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Obsolete Economic Strategy", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "Supported byEditorialIt was inevitable that China\u2019s economy would slow from its once turbocharged growth rates. But its leaders have made so many mistakes in recent months that they have turned what should have been a benign, natural slowdown into a chaotic descent.China\u2019s main stock index fell nearly 10 percent for the week, depressing stock and commodity prices elsewhere. These drops are not in themselves a big economic problem. The larger question is whether China\u2019s leaders, their credibility already damaged, will see this moment for what it is: a dramatic warning that it\u2019s time to make fundamental changes in the way they manage the economy.The Chinese economy, the world\u2019s second largest, is growing at nearly 7 percent a year \u2014 down from 10.6 percent in 2010 but still a healthy pace for a country at its stage of development. The problem is that the boom was fueled by lavish investment and spending as well as profligate borrowing, a lot of which will probably not be paid back. China\u2019s central government orchestrated that binge by pumping billions of dollars into the economy in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis and by failing to enact needed reforms that would make it easier for private and foreign companies to compete with inefficient state-owned enterprises.The lesson here is clear: Instead of trying to micromanage stock prices, Chinese officials ought to be strengthening the economy, foremost by shifting its emphasis from investment to consumer spending and services. This is important because China can no longer grow by taking people off the farm and putting them to work in factories. It needs to move people into white-collar jobs. To take one example, officials could help create more such jobs and make the economy more competitive by easing the way for private companies to get into industries like telecommunications and insurance that are currently dominated by a handful of state-owned corporations.China also has to clean up its financial system. Many businesses and local governments have borrowed billions of dollars to build high-speed rail lines, real estate developments and other projects, many of which are not going to produce the returns needed to pay off those debts. The government should encourage lenders and borrowers to quickly restructure loans that paid for those projects so that banks are not crippled by bad debts and can continue making new loans. Officials also need to shut down highly inefficient state-owned businesses.Even industrialized countries like Germany, Japan and the United States are vulnerable, though less so than commodity exporters, because they sell manufactured goods to China and many multinational companies have invested a lot of money in the country. Some analysts are concerned that Beijing will simply fall back on a familiar tool to aid the domestic economy: devaluing the currency, the renminbi. That would raise China\u2019s exports and reduce its imports, but it would do so at the expense of the rest of the global economy, which is itself not very healthy.Since early August, the renminbi has already fallen about 5 percent against the dollar. It has also been under pressure because as the Chinese economy weakens many people and companies in China are clamoring to convert their savings into dollars to buy property and invest in businesses overseas.Ultimately, however, China\u2019s leaders must realize that they need to modernize their policies by encouraging more private initiatives and greater competition. Their nation has changed dramatically over the last three decades, and a command-and-control approach to economic management will not produce the results of the past.Advertisement"}

All of the 2016 candidates do, too; Donald J. Trump has taken to the medium like an agitated middle schooler.Other business executives with legal problems, including Lynn G. Tilton, a private equity executive, and Charlie Shrem, who led a money transfer service, have also been pretty loose lipped.To be fair, Mr. Shkreli, for one, has not been his usual brash \u2014 maybe even bratty \u2014 self online. Before the arrest, based on his tweets and live videos, he almost seemed to be playing the role of a movie bad guy. Now he\u2019s posting on Twitter less often, and with a restrained (for him) air.But he is still talking. I called him and asked about his current approach on social media, and he responded: \u201cI\u2019m not going to say something that jeopardizes my case.\u201d He said prosecutors had a lot of sway over public opinion through events like so-called perp walks. \u201cThis sort of becomes a chess match now of public opinion \u2014 which is sad, because ultimately it should be about the facts,\u201d he said. Mr. Shkreli added: \u201cI feel like I\u2019m being prosecuted for being a jerk.\u201dThis has not happened yet, thank goodness. But give me time.The thing is, though, that as close as I regularly skate toward disaster online, I\u2019m not a chief executive, and I\u2019m not facing criminal or civil charges. What these brilliant captains of industry are doing takes boldness into a realm that even I, a great fan of boldness, find questionable.I checked in with Gerald L. Shargel, a prominent criminal defense lawyer, for insight into this phenomenon, and I\u2019m pretty sure I could hear him shaking his head over the phone. Mr. Shargel, who has represented John J. Gotti, the Mafia don, among others, said that the problem came down to brains and self-confidence.\u201cIt starts with the proposition that there are people who are very smart outside the four walls of the courtroom,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they think they are smarter than the lawyers they have engaged.\u201dThese are high-powered people, he said, who didn\u2019t get to their positions by being conventional. Is it possible, I asked, that their rule-breaking, gut-trusting ways might be part of what got them plunked down in front of a judge in the first place?He paused for a moment, and replied, \u201cWell said.\u201dThe public pronouncements get the clients the attention that they seem to crave, he said, \u201cand sometimes, it\u2019s funny \u2014 until the verdict.\u201dTo get further insight into the minds of these geniuses, I called Rory J. O\u2019Connor, who provides media training and crisis consulting to executives through his San Francisco company, Morcopy Communications. He pronounced himself mystified by the likes of Mr. Shkreli. \u201cWhat\u2019s the first line of the Miranda warning? \u2018You have the right to remain silent.\u2019\u201dMr. O\u2019Connor said that when police officers say, \u201cAnything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law,\u201d they really mean it. \u201cWhy would you want to go on social media, where they don\u2019t even need a subpoena, and say things that could be used against you?\u201dIt\u2019s great for clients\u2019 lawyers and friends to say how wonderful they are, but as for the executives facing legal trouble themselves, he says, \u201cYou want to keep your mouth shut.\u201dThere is nothing novel about this advice, he said: \u201cI\u2019ve never been in a situation where a lawyer or P.R. counsel says, \u2018Hey, get out there and open your yap.\u2019\u201dWhat does this mean for the future? I wonder whether the quiet period before an initial public offering of stock \u2014 a blessedly silent interlude when executives are prohibited from speaking out and influencing public opinion \u2014 is doomed.More generally, many corporate espionage strategies, and sophisticated market research programs, could become utterly pointless. Just check a C.E.O.\u2019s Pinterest and Instagram accounts. Maybe Tinder, too. It\u2019s all out there, baby!Vanity might finally lead to true corporate transparency. How wonderful if corporate America used Twitter even more!All of it, eventually, would be a guide for investors. Give money to this company? To this entrepreneur or that one?

Or how Henry Ford would have fared if he had committed anti-Semitic gaffes in a social media world.Yes, strip away the layer of handlers and let us see what these giants are really like and what we think of their judgment and boldness then.

{"Headline": "Nuclear Facilities in 20 Countries May Be Easy Targets for Cyberattacks", "Date": "2016-01-14", "News": "Supported byThe findings build on growing concerns that a cyberattack could be the easiest and most effective way to take over a nuclear power plant and sabotage it, or to disable defenses that are used to protect nuclear material from theft. The countries on the list include Argentina, China, Egypt, Israel, Mexico and North Korea.But the list is damning. The group looked, for example, at whether any cyberprotections are required by law or regulation at nuclear facilities, and whether cyberattacks are included in the assessments of potential threats to the security of those installations. One question asked whether there were mandated drills and tests to assess responses to a cyberassault, rather than just a physical attack on the facilities.The report also concludes that President Obama\u2019s global initiative to sweep up loose nuclear material, which will be the subject of his third and final nuclear security summit meeting this March, has slowed substantially.Mr. Nunn, 77, who left the Senate in 1997, blamed the increasing tensions with Russia for some of the slow progress. \u201cWhen things are strained between the two big nuclear powers, which have 90 percent of the weapons and materials, it makes it harder\u201d for other states to make the case for reducing their own stockpiles, he said in an interview.Mr. Obama was an early adherent of Mr. Nunn\u2019s advocacy for comprehensive programs to reduce the amount of nuclear material in the world, and by any measure his six-year effort to prevent nuclear terrorism has made major progress. Each summit meeting has forced countries to make progress on locking down or eliminating materials.The Nuclear Threat Initiative, which publishes an annual index of nuclear security around the world, notes that a dozen countries have eliminated all weapons-usable nuclear materials since the summit meetings began. Many more have greatly improved the security surrounding lightly guarded materials, which are stored every place from hospitals to research reactors on university campuses.But at the very moment that the black market in nuclear materials remains active, the report found that 24 nations still had more than 2.2 pounds of weapons-usable nuclear material, \u201cmuch of it still too vulnerable to theft,\u201d and many have just begun to think about their vulnerability to cyberthreats that could enable an attacker to sabotage a site without breaking through fences or risk setting off perimeter alarms.The lesson of Stuxnet, however, has apparently been lost on many nations that have yet to develop requirements that nuclear facilities have cyberprotections in place before they can operate.\u201cToo many states require virtually no effective security measures at nuclear facilities to address the threat posed by hackers,\u201d the study, in which the Economist Intelligence Unit also participated, concluded. Of the two dozen nations with weapons-usable material, nine got the maximum score for cyberindicators, and seven got a score of zero.In 23 nations that possessed no weapons-usable materials, but had nuclear power plants or other nuclear facilities that contain fuel that could be converted to weapons use, 13 got a zero score.More than 80 percent of all nuclear stockpiles are classified as military material, meaning they are largely used in weapons programs, and all of those are outside international security review, including the guidelines issued by the International Atomic Energy Agency for the protection of civilian nuclear stocks.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stop China\u2019s Market Manipulations", "Date": "2016-01-18", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorWashington \u2014 THE other day while I was crossing the street in Beijing, a car almost flattened me. Both the driver and I were outraged at the other\u2019s ineptitude. In China, if you want to avoid being hit, you keep your head down and avoid eye contact with the oncoming driver, since looking at him would signal that you saw the car and know you should let it pass. In the United States, the opposite rule applies: Making eye contact confirms that the driver has seen you and should yield to the vulnerable pedestrian.Something similar is occurring now between China and global financial markets. Billions in renminbi and dollars could be lost while trying to untangle the lines of communication.Chinese bureaucrats believe that they have the right to intervene in their country\u2019s economy whenever they want, not only to promote certain industries but also to prevent sudden downturns and reduce volatility. Officials believe that they don\u2019t have to defend or explain their decisions in real time to market participants. In fact, being opaque preserves their discretion to make changes on the fly.This approach goes against the operating principles of global financial markets: clarity and timely transparency. Intervention should be the exception, not the norm.The job of regulators should be to ensure a fair market, but China\u2019s stock market is worse than a casino, as Chinese regulators\u2019 goals and the basic rules of the game can shift without warning. With China\u2019s housing market in disarray in 2014, authorities invited investors to shift their capital to the stock market and then took a series of steps to facilitate high returns. When the market started to nose-dive last summer, officials wouldn\u2019t let the bubble that had inevitably formed fully burst. Instead they suspended trading for some companies, mopped up shares, ordered large shareholders not to sell and accused market analysts of spreading false rumors.Regulators were at it again earlier this month, delaying the trading of stocks that had been frozen since last summer and even suddenly declaring that the market would temporarily halt trading if the Shanghai index rose or fell 5 percent. All this did was give investors just enough time to hit the sell button when markets restarted. About four days after it was started, this tool was abandoned without apology. Some investors have lost their shirts, but no regulators have lost their jobs.China\u2019s currency missteps have been equally maddening. The market suggests that the renminbi is overvalued because a strengthening or even stable renminbi is inconsistent with the country\u2019s expanding debt burden and slowing economic growth. China\u2019s central bank has taken some steps to liberalize the exchange rate, measuring the renminbi against a broader basket of currencies instead of the dollar. But because Chinese officials continue to publicly assert the renminbi is not overvalued, they are intervening daily to prop up the currency. And they have imposed a range of capital controls.Based on my interviews, Chinese officials believe these steps are preserving economic stability and facilitating gradual change, while investors who see policies change constantly with little apparent rationale have had their confidence in officials\u2019 ability badly shaken.Frustration with China has prompted calls for a regulatory response. Some in Congress have long clamored for the Treasury Department to label China a currency manipulator and issue sanctions. Even Donald J. Trump has advocated for a 45 percent across-the-board tariff on Chinese imports. But given that China is not trying to depress its currency to make its products more competitive, penalties are not justified. Nor would they work; they might make Washington feel better, but American investors, producers and consumers would all suffer from the resulting tit-for-tat.The Obama administration instead should take a page out of the human rights playbook and privately raise the harmful effects of interventionism and delaying liberalization with the Chinese every chance it gets until the message gets through. And if it does not, American officials should step before the cameras and let markets know how disappointed they are with China\u2019s policies. President Xi Jinping claimed that last summer\u2019s emergency measures were necessary to prevent \u201csystemic risks\u201d to China\u2019s economy, but at a summit meeting in September President Obama essentially did nothing to push Mr. Xi on that issue publicly or privately, implying that the United States accepted this explanation and related policies.China\u2019s economic management should also be a central part of multilateral diplomacy. The Group of 7 and Group of 20 nations have issued general calls for flexible exchange rates, transparent market management and greater coordination of macroeconomic policies. But if Chinese interventionism continues to roil global markets, the conversation ought to become much more pointed. At a minimum, governments and world markets deserve far more detailed information from China provided in a far timelier manner than is now the case.If the world economy does not want to be flattened by a Chinese state apparently unaware of how risky its actions are, then we may need to make the conversation about China\u2019s markets much more public. The two sides may not see eye to eye, but no one should avert their glance.Scott Kennedy is the director of the Project on Chinese Business and Political Economy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stocks Are Potential Bright Side to Lower Wall St. Compensation", "Date": "2016-01-20", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsIt\u2019s bonus day at Goldman Sachs. It also happens to be the day that the Wall Street company reports earnings for the final quarter of 2015.So employees are getting a peek at the lay of the land before sitting down for their annual pay review. It\u2019s not, on the face of it, encouraging: Compensation has fallen on average 8 percent from 2014. But the news at Goldman and other rivals may have a silver lining.First, Wall Street professionals are still making enviable pay. Average overall compensation last year was $344,000 at Goldman. At Morgan Stanley, it was $285,000, even after an 11 percent cut.Investment bankers and traders bore the brunt of the drop as Morgan Stanley slashed the division\u2019s compensation pool 17 percent even as revenue rose 6.4 percent. It\u2019s a smart move by a bank that is not yet earning enough to cover its cost of capital.Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks\u2019 bottom lines.Employees at JPMorgan Chase\u2019s investment banking unit fared better. They face an average cut of just under 1 percent to $203,000, even though the overall pool is 4.5 percent lower \u2013 the division employs almost 4 percent fewer people.For those not cheered by reminders of their relative wealth, there\u2019s something else to think about. The shares of the three banks \u2013 along with those of many other financial companies \u2013 have fallen in value so much in the last couple of weeks that all now trade below book value. In fact, Goldman and Morgan Stanley shares trade below the even-lower tangible book value. That means Goldman, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan shares are worth less than each bank\u2019s theoretical breakup value.On the other hand, it may signal that a broader crisis is in the offing, one that might hurt earnings or the value of assets on the balance sheet. That would be bad news for most banker wallets, with the exception of restructuring experts.If, though, shareholders are overreacting to fears about China, oil and other issues, Wall Street employees paid partially in stock may be getting one of the best deals in years. Goldman shares, for example, have not traded below tangible book value on bonus day since January 2012.If markets shrug off the current jitters, the rise in bank stock prices should more than make up for the bonus shortfall.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gilbert E. Kaplan, Publisher and Improbable Conductor, Dies at 74", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byGilbert E. Kaplan, a financial publisher who had an accidental second career as an international symphony conductor \u2014 despite the fact that he could scarcely read music and possessed a concert repertoire of exactly one piece \u2014 died on New Year\u2019s Day in Manhattan. He was 74.The cause was cancer, his daughter Emily Kaplan said.For an untrained conductor to lead a symphony orchestra \u2014 much less to lead one in a fiendish piece like Mahler\u2019s Second \u2014 is, as The St. Louis Post-Dispatch wrote in a 1991 review of one of Mr. Kaplan\u2019s concerts, \u201calmost preposterous.\u201dBut in that \u201calmost\u201d hung a tale of obsession, determination and midlife renewal that became, as The New York Times described it in 2003, \u201cone of the strangest acts of wish fulfillment in musical history.\u201dMahler\u2019s Second, known as the \u201cResurrection\u201d Symphony, is a work of titanic power. The piece, which had its world premiere in Berlin in 1895, entails an orchestra of more than 100, a vast choir, choral soloists, multiple harps, a pipe organ and additional offstage percussion and brass. Its five movements span some 90 minutes and have been said to evoke the most elemental aspects of human experience \u2014 joy and sorrow, birth and death \u2014 and, ultimately, resurrection.By 1982, when Mr. Kaplan made his sweaty-palmed debut with the American Symphony Orchestra, he had undergone an immersion worthy of George Plimpton, devouring recordings, traveling the world to hear every live performance, grilling scholars and conductors and undergoing a monthlong nine-hour-a-day boot camp in the mechanics of conducting.Mr. Kaplan would go on to conduct the \u201cResurrection\u201d more than 100 times. He would become a recognized authority on the piece and the owner of its original score, which he published in facsimile; a lecturer on Mahler; and the owner of a bust of him by Rodin.As a conductor, Mr. Kaplan divided reviewers. Some called his performances lackluster and superficial, if well intentioned.But in the end, as unlikely as it seemed, he also wound up with a sheaf of rapturous notices and \u2014 more unlikely still \u2014 a top-selling, critically esteemed recording of the symphony that had possessed him since he was a young man.The son of a shirt manufacturer, Gilbert Edmund Kaplan was born in Manhattan on March 3, 1941, and reared in Lawrence, on Long Island. His family, he said, was for the most part unmusical: As a boy, Gilbert endured three years of piano lessons and played the guitar a little. (His older brother, under the professional name Joseph Brooks, became a songwriter whose hits included \u201cYou Light Up My Life.\u201d)After attending Duke University, he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from the New School for Social Research in New York and studied at New York University Law School. In 1963, he took a $15,000-a-year job as an economist with the American Stock Exchange.He soon became conscious of the importance of money managers in financial markets \u2014 and of a gap in the marketplace when it came to meeting their needs.\u201cThey were professional investors,\u201d Mr. Kaplan told The Sunday Times of London in 1984. \u201cHere was a group of people who had no information about their field \u2014 and an audience that advertisers wanted to reach in a major way.\u201dScraping together $150,000 \u2014 two-thirds of it borrowed from Gerald Bronfman, whose family owned the Seagram distilling company \u2014 he put out the first issue of The Institutional Investor, as it was originally known, in March 1967.Mr. Kaplan, who also held the title of editor in chief, appointed the financial journalist George J.-W. Goodman, better known by the pseudonym Adam Smith, as the magazine\u2019s inaugural editor. After selling the company in 1984 to Capital Cities Communications, he stayed on until 1992 as Institutional Investor\u2019s editor in chief.The \u201cResurrection\u201d had put its hold on Mr. Kaplan in 1965, when he attended a performance of the piece by the American Symphony, under Leopold Stokowski, at Carnegie Hall.\u201cI wanted to get inside the music,\u201d he told The Age, a Melbourne, Australia, newspaper, in 1993. \u201cThere\u2019s a real explanation of life and death in that music, and I wanted to get to the bottom of it.\u201dBut to get fully inside the music, he came to realize, he would have to learn to conduct it. That he had long since forgotten his scant musical instruction was no impediment.\u201cSomeone once told me that a bumblebee, judged by aerodynamic principles, is incapable of flying,\u201d Mr. Kaplan told The Associated Press in 1988. \u201cBut the bumblebee doesn\u2019t know that. So I kept going forward.\u201dIn 1981, he enlisted the services of Charles Zachary Bornstein, a young conductor fresh out of the Juilliard School, who oversaw his monthlong immersion. He snagged a two-hour lesson in London with Georg Solti. He studied German. He lifted weights.\u201cYour arms get tired from two minutes of changing a light bulb,\u201d Mr. Kaplan told The Times of London. \u201cTry keeping them up for an hour and a half.\u201dHe seeded his copy of the score with a thicket of notations. \u201cStart left,\u201d the first one read, a reminder to aim his baton toward the violins at the outset.He rented Avery Fisher Hall and engaged the American Symphony and the Westminster Symphonic Choir. The orchestra, collectively astonished, agreed on two conditions: that no tickets be sold and no reviews be published.On Sept. 9, 1982, Mr. Kaplan mounted the podium for what he intended simultaneously to be his debut and his farewell performance, an invitation-only gala for 2,700 guests, staged at an estimated cost of $100,000.He had solved the problem of his music literacy by conducting the entire score from memory. Should his memory fail, he said, he planned to turn to the audience and announce, \u201cLadies and gentlemen, dinner is served.\u201dBut he did not need to, finishing the performance to a thunderous ovation.At least one critic in the house, Leighton Kerner of The Village Voice, broke the embargo to publish a glowing review, declaring the performance to be \u201cone of the five or six most profoundly realized Mahler Seconds I had heard in a quarter-century.\u201dOffers poured in, and Mr. Kaplan went on to lead the piece with the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic of London, the Russian National Orchestra, the Philharmonic Orchestra of La Scala and dozens of other ensembles.There was some jeering. \u201cThe Resurrectionist,\u201d the headlines called him, \u201cOne-Hit Wonder\u201d and, inevitably, \u201cWalter Mitty.\u201dMore seriously, some reviewers taxed Mr. Kaplan with being a checkbook maestro, paying orchestras to let him ascend the podium. He denied doing so, although he acknowledged that his refusal to accept a fee constituted a de facto savings for the ensembles he led.Perhaps the worst moment in Mr. Kaplan\u2019s new career came in December 2008, when he led the \u201cResurrection\u201d with the New York Philharmonic. On the day of the concert, the musicians held an hourlong meeting with the orchestra\u2019s president, Zarin Mehta, to vent their frustration with Mr. Kaplan\u2019s musicianship.The London Symphony recording, featuring the London Symphony Chorus and the vocal soloists Benita Valente and Maureen Forrester, was named by The New York Times as one of the best classical records of 1988. By 2008, it had sold more than 180,000 copies, making it, The Times reported, the biggest-selling Mahler recording of any kind.Mr. Kaplan\u2019s brother, Mr. Brooks, committed suicide in 2011, two years after he had been charged with drugging and sexually assaulting more than a dozen women.Besides his daughter Emily, Gilbert Kaplan\u2019s survivors include his wife, the former Lena Bi\u00f6rck, whom he married in 1970 and who wears the only ring that Mahler was known to have given his wife, Alma; two other daughters, Kristina Wallison and Claude Davies; a son, John; and eight grandchildren.Mr. Kaplan served over the years on the boards of the American Symphony and Carnegie Hall, and taught in the evening division of the Juilliard School.If, in his unplanned second act, Mr. Kaplan was tilting at windmills, at least he was doing so with one of Mahler\u2019s batons, which he also owned. And though some critics continued to snipe, his work, admirers said, unmistakably reflected his passion, his fealty to Mahler\u2019s intentions and, quite possibly, the idea that a man\u2019s grasp might sometimes equal his reach.He was, in any case, far from the only conductor to incur critical barbs with the \u201cResurrection.\u201dReviewing the United States premiere of the piece, The New York Times praised the performance generally, but described some aspects as \u201clacking in unity and proportion\u201d and \u201cfragmentary and bizarre.\u201dThat concert took place in December 1908 and featured the New York Symphony Orchestra, a progenitor of the Philharmonic.On the podium was Gustav Mahler.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Wall St. Slides After Chinese Stocks Plunge", "Date": "2016-01-04", "News": "Supported byOn the first trading day of the new year, investors\u2019 old worries flooded back.Global stock markets tumbled on Monday, as further fears about a slowdown in China\u2019s economy reignited concerns about global growth.The selling on Monday started after China released a weak manufacturing report, and continued after the United States did the same. Chinese stocks lost nearly 7 percent of their value, although they appeared to stabilize Tuesday morning. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, the main benchmark for the United States stock market, posted a decline of 1.5 percent, while European stocks also fell.The sharp drops bring back memories of the sell-off last summer. China\u2019s surprising decision in August to devalue its currency prompted concerns about the health of the country\u2019s economy and helped ignite a global rout.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.But there was a new twist to investors\u2019 anxieties. Measures to help steady stocks that were put in place after the market turmoil last year now appear to be exacerbating the selling in China.\u201cThis will be the theme for the year,\u201d said Devendra Joshi, an HSBC Asia equity strategist. \u201cThere will be more volatility.\u201dThe market volatility, if it continues, may create headaches for the Federal Reserve, which in December raised interest rates for the first time in over nine years. The Fed chose not to raise rates in September, in part because it was concerned that the turbulence of the summer would weigh on the United States economy.The manufacturing data released on Monday could strengthen the arguments of some economists who say the Fed was too quick to raise interest rates. The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s measure of manufacturing activity fell to 48.2 in December, its lowest reading since 2009. (A number below 50 signals that the manufacturing sector is contracting.)Chinese manufacturing has been steadily contracting for 10 straight months. The Caixin purchasing managers\u2019 index for December fell to 48.2, well below expectations and lower than the reading in November.\u201cIt was a one-two punch from the manufacturing sector,\u201d said Gina C. Martin Adams, institutional equity strategist at Wells Fargo Securities. Some of the stocks that soared in 2015 were among the hardest hit on Monday. Netflix, the top-performing stock in the S.&P. 500 last year, declined by almost 4 percent, while Amazon, the second-biggest gainer last year, plunged 5.8 percent. Investors also appeared to seek some safety in government bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which falls as its price rises, declined slightly to 2.25 percent, from 2.27 percent.The oil markets shrugged off increased tensions in the Middle East. Early in the day, the conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran, two major oil producers, sent the price of crude soaring. But oil ultimately ended down, as concerns about the Chinese slowdown crimped commodity prices.Analysts cautioned that it would be a mistake to read too much into one day\u2019s trading, and they pointed out that markets around the world rallied strongly after the sell-off in the summer. The outlook for Europe appears to be stronger than it was a year ago. And the United States economy has proved its resilience in recent years, growing even as the dollar increased in value and as the plunge in oil prices damaged the prospects of the energy sector.Still, China\u2019s challenges will most likely unsettle investors for a while. As the world\u2019s second largest economy, China is a critical piece of the growth puzzle. If China decelerates markedly, Chinese companies and consumers buy less in goods and services from other countries.Chinese demand is particularly worrisome for commodity producers around the world, which have been hurt by the country\u2019s slowdown. On Monday, Anglo American\u2019s shares fell about 7 percent, while Glencore\u2019s were off 5.8 percent. The pressures on the Chinese currency add to the global worries.The Chinese government is allowing the value of its currency, the renminbi, to decline as a way of spurring its own economy. On Monday, the central bank set the renminbi at its lowest level since May 2011.But this approach risks fanning market tumult and trade tensions.Companies and individuals have moved their money overseas, prompted by economic weakness and the fear that the renminbi will lose more value. Those outflows further weigh on the value of the currency.\u201cThe People\u2019s Bank of China needs to be careful,\u201d said Li-Gang Liu, the chief economist for greater China at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group. \u201cIt cannot create a one-way bet for renminbi depreciation. If they were to do that, we would run into an out-of-control scenario like we saw in the second half of last year.\u201dFrom a trade perspective, China\u2019s policy can prompt other countries to devalue their currencies to try to regain competitiveness. Some Asian countries have already moved in that direction.It is also a challenge for American companies. As other currencies have weakened, the dollar has remained relatively strong. That makes it harder for United States companies to export and it forces them to cut prices to compete \u2014 all of which potentially drags down earnings.The Chinese government\u2019s stock stabilization plan is also playing into the market sell-off.A new rule, which went into effect on Monday, suspends trading in the major mainland markets when the CSI 300 index of blue-chip shares falls 5 percent during a session. The circuit breaker kicked in Monday, setting off a temporary halt. Analysts indicate that the suspension might have led investors to later dump shares, which then brought on a halt for the day.Another measure, a six-month ban on major shareholders\u2019 offloading stocks in Chinese-listed companies, expires at the end of this week. The policy was imposed to stabilize share prices last summer. But now it could be having the reverse effect, leading those with smaller holdings to sell before larger shareholders do. After opening lower on Tuesday, shares in Shanghai wavered between small gains and losses. Hao Hong, chief strategist at the Bank of Communications International, predicted that the tough start to 2016 could continue. \u201cVolatility tends to beget volatility,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will more likely than not spill over to other asset classes. Given we had such dramatic volatility, it\u2019s really too early to see the bottom, especially now that the fundamentals are looking so ugly.\u201dDavid Jolly contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Struggle to Quell Investor Fears Over Unsettled Emerging Markets", "Date": "2016-01-24", "News": "Supported byCurrency turmoil in China and fears of a global slowdown have led investors to abandon emerging markets in droves, rattling the large asset management firms that have long promoted such investments in their hunt for higher returns.For more than a decade, star managers at Franklin Templeton, Pimco, Aberdeen and Oppenheimer seemed more like Marco Polos than Warren Buffetts, beating a path to Internet companies in China, oil giants in Brazil and gold mines in South Africa.Investing in these high-risk markets came to be seen as a necessity for a diversified portfolio as well as an opportunity for these firms to levy some of the highest fees in the industry.Now, with investors fleeing in a fury, asset management firms are struggling to stanch the bleeding.Last year, a record $105 billion was pulled out of global mutual funds, with 26 percent of that figure coming from asset managers based in the United States, according to the fund tracker EPFR.It was the third consecutive year of bond and equity outflows and one would have go back to the Asian crisis era of the late 1990s to see a similar retreat, said Cameron Brandt, the head of research at the data provider.\u201cThis has become a chronic condition as opposed to the sudden onset of something,\u201d Mr. Brandt said. \u201cThere is almost no conviction out there right now.\u201dFor large fund companies whose assets under management ballooned on the back of these flows, the world has changed drastically, largely for the worse.Take the global bond manager Pimco. It has three bond funds that invest in developing markets that the research firm Morningstar tracks: a local currency sovereign bond fund worth $4.7 billion; a broader vehicle valued at $1.7 billion, and a corporate bond fund whose assets have eroded to $202 million from more than $1 billion.In total, investors pulled $6 billion last year from emerging market funds managed by Pimco, according to Morningstar.Pimco has had to steady itself after the explosive departure of a star manager, William H. Gross, in 2014. Yet the emerging market outflows, on top of the billions of dollars that followed Mr. Gross out the door, have only added to the firm\u2019s woes.Pimco, once the world\u2019s largest manager of emerging market bonds, has experienced industry- lagging returns from outsize bets in Brazil and Russia that have propelled an investor exodus that is getting worse by the month.Last December, investors pulled $619 million from the firm\u2019s local currency fund, which has lost 21 percent of its value over the past year, trailing every fund in the category except one, according to Morningstar.A $15 billion fund in 2013, it now languishes below $5 billion.While Pimco may be struggling, it is certainly not alone. A debt fund run by MFS investment management in Boston lost $1.4 billion last year, and Trust Company of the West in Los Angeles had outflows of $1.8 billion from its $2.6 billion bond offering last year.On the equity side, the $28 billion Oppenheimer Developing Markets fund suffered by far the largest exodus last year, with $5 billion departing the fund, according to Morningstar.And in Europe, Aberdeen Asset Management, which manages $403 billion and specializes in emerging markets, had $48 billion leave the firm. Aberdeen\u2019s stock price fell by half for the year.Traders and portfolio managers say that what worries them now is the sense that sophisticated institutional investors, who generally tend to take a longer-term view than their retail counterparts (and who might even be inclined to buy at these levels), have been the ones driving the selling over the last six months.Instead of taking advantage of bond and company valuations that are at historic lows, these investors are acting more like lemmings, unloading the good and the bad in their portfolios because that is what they see their peers doing. The panicky climate is also forcing managers to have a chunk of cash on hand to meet redemption requests.\u201cWe are seeing evidence that institutional investors are capitulating,\u201d said Charles Collyns, an economist at the Institute of International Finance, using an industry term to describe the practice of wholesale selling when all hope is lost.In a recent survey of more than 100 investment managers conducted by Northern Trust in Chicago, the No. 1 risk factor cited by respondents was that problems in China would continue to bring down growth rates in the developing world.Also of concern, regulators and economists say, is the fact that many emerging market securities, especially bonds, can be very hard to sell, especially when markets are declining.The surprise decision by Third Avenue Management last month to close down a junk bond fund because it could not meet investor demands for cash has heightened fears that an emerging market bond fund could find itself in a similar position.\u201cThere is definitely a liquidity concern out there,\u201d said Mr. Brandt, the research director at EPFR. \u201cPeople are asking: \u2018If I don\u2019t get my stuff out now, will I be able to get it out later?\u2019 \u201dThings would need to get much worse for that to happen. The bonds that trade in countries like Turkey, Mexico and Brazil are far more liquid than the deeply distressed corporate securities that Third Avenue\u2019s credit fund favored.That has not stopped the selling though \u2014 especially in recent months. For example, of the $2.5 billion that left Pimco\u2019s local currency fund last year, $1 billion came in the last two months of 2015, according to Morningstar.The emerging markets unit at Pimco is headed by Michael A. Gomez, a former debt trader at Goldman Sachs who has been at the firm overseeing these funds since 2003.The dismal performance of Pimco\u2019s emerging market funds has done little to lift morale at the firm since the departure of Mr. Gross. And while Mr. Gomez\u2019s difficult run \u2014 over the last three years his local currency fund trails 89 percent of its peers \u2014 and the sustained pace of outflows has put him under some pressure, his superiors continue to stand by him.\"Michael Gomez is the leader of the emerging market team and has our full trust and support,\" said Daniel J. Ivascyn, Pimco\u2019s chief investment officer.Last year, in an effort to better gauge employees\u2019 mood, the leadership of Pimco organized a companywide survey, according to people who were briefed on the initiative. It was the first time the company ever did such a thing, and while the 8,000 responses did vary, there were those who took the opportunity to vent \u2014 using strong language to complain about the company\u2019s culture.At an employee meeting last month at company headquarters in Newport Beach, Calif., Pimco\u2019s president, Jay Jacobs, discussed the survey results. And he said that if there were no improvements he would, at some point in the future, step down.Also addressing the staff at the meeting was Mr. Ivascyn, who acknowledged the performance problems in emerging markets and said that the firm would continue to hire more experts to help matters, with Mr. Gomez leading the recruiting effort.As is often the case in emerging markets, the most opportune time to buy is when everyone else is selling. In that regard, the rally in oil and emerging market currencies last week could well be a sign that the pessimism of late has been overdone.Mark Meisel, who conducted the survey at Northern Trust, said that while it is true that global investors fear emerging markets more than anything else, they also said that the stocks and bonds in these countries were among the most undervalued investments to be found anywhere.An article on Monday about investors\u2019 withdrawing money from emerging-market funds misidentified the MFS investment management fund that had investor outflows of $1.4 billion last year. It is the Emerging Markets Debt fund, not a local currency fund.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Global Markets Move Lower After Sell-Off", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Global markets continued their jitters on Thursday \u2014 with China a lone bright spot \u2014 as investors continued to show concern about the strength of the world\u2019s largest economies.After Wednesday\u2019s sell-off in the United States, shares in Japan fell again, European stocks were down on Thursday, and Wall Street trading opened slightly higher.Oil, whose plunging price has lately become a stand-in for worries about the state of the global economy, rose more than 1 percent and moved closer to $31 a barrel on Thursday, after briefly dipping below the symbolic $30 threshold the day before.China, whose market turmoil in recent days has helped stoke investor anxiety, had a notably strong bounceback on Thursday.Shanghai\u2019s main share index fell in the morning to near the low it had hit amid the turmoil in late August, but it finished the day 2 percent higher. The Shenzhen composite index ended 3.8 percent higher, and the broad CSI 300 stock index finished 2.1 percent higher.\u201cI would caution against any near-term prediction, because the market has been very volatile,\u201d said Hao Hong, the chief strategist at Bank of Communications International. \u201cBut we should have a weakish rebound from here.\u201d\u201cYou tend to have people try to come in and do some bottom fishing,\u201d he added, referring to bargain-hunting investors.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was up 0.1 percent in the first minutes of trading on Thursday, and the Dow Jones industrial average was flat.In Europe, the Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of eurozone blue chips, was down 1.6 percent in early afternoon trading, while the FTSE 100 in London was off 1 percent.While Chinese stocks had at least a one-day respite, Japanese shares continued their recent slide. The Nikkei 225-share index was down as much as 4.3 percent but pared losses late in the afternoon to finish down 2.7 percent.The Japanese market is under pressure on two fronts, analysts said, with broad concerns about global growth rates compounded by a rise in the value of the yen.Traders have flocked to the Japanese currency as a haven during the recent turmoil, pushing up its exchange rate against the dollar by about 5 percent since December. That has undercut one of the main supports for Japanese share prices: The cheaper the yen, the bigger the benefits for global manufacturing giants like Toyota and Hitachi, which earn most of their revenues abroad in foreign currencies.\u201cThe main reason Japanese shares are falling so hard is the exchange rate,\u201d said Masahiro Ichikawa, a strategist at Mitsui Sumitomo Asset Management. \u201cCurrencies in other Asian countries and emerging markets are falling, but people are buying yen as a hedge against risk.\u201dIn addition, traders said, Middle Eastern investors who have been hit by the fall in oil prices are selling parts of their shareholdings in large foreign markets like Japan.\u201cThe biggest markets by capitalization are the U.S., the U.K. and Japan, so if oil money is selling, that is where it will come from,\u201d said Chihiro Ota, general manager at SMBC NikkoSecurities, a Japanese brokerage house. \u201cSell orders from oil producing countries were front-and-center today.\u201dUnited States stocks are in the zone of a correction, or a decline of 10 percent or more from a recent high. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index in the United States dropped 2.5 percent on Wednesday, despite two days of gains that suggested that confidence might be returning after a tumultuous start to the year. The technology-heavy Nasdaq dropped 3.4 percent.Neil Gough contributed reporting from Hong Kong, and Jonathan Soble and Hisako Ueno from Tokyo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Robust 4th Quarter Couldn\u2019t Redeem Market After an Anxious Year", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byThe stock market withstood fierce punishment last year and had almost nothing to show for it. A strong fourth quarter healed some of the damage but as the year closed and 2016 began, the battering in the market began yet again.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index ended 2015 at 2,043.94, down just 0.7 percent for the year, after a late rally helped the benchmark recover most of the ground lost during a sharp summertime swoon. The 6.5 percent fourth-quarter gain followed a 6.9 percent third-quarter decline.One reason for the flat-but-volatile performance is that there was much to worry about, yet not much happened.\u201cThe markets went nowhere all year because there was a lot of noise and we were waiting for the Fed,\u201d said David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.Wall Street and the world waited nearly all year for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. The central bank obliged at last in mid-December, nudging the target for its main short-term rate up by a quarter percentage point and suggesting that more increases were coming in 2016.As for the noise, \u201cwe worried about Greece blowing the euro up, China slowing down and another government shutdown\u201d in the United States, Mr. Kelly said. \u201cWe worried about them, but in the end they didn\u2019t become a real problem. They just kept people on the sidelines. Not that these problems have gone away, but we\u2019ve managed to look through them.\u201dInvestors lately have done more than look. They have endured another pummeling. A plunge in the Chinese currency, the renminbi, apparently on fears of economic weakness, led to a sharp drop in Chinese stocks in two of the year\u2019s first three trading days that spilled over into markets worldwide. The S.&P. 500 lost 6 percent in the first week of trading, the worst start to a year ever.That was a departure from the placid and profitable fourth quarter. The average domestic stock fund was up 4.3 percent, according to Morningstar, led by double-digit gains for portfolios that concentrate on technology and health care. International stock funds rose 3.3 percent, as China and Japan outperformed.The fourth-quarter gains alleviated widespread weakness that had been masked by comparative strength in the large companies that dominate the S.&P. 500. The full-year decline in the index still allowed it to outperform shares of smaller companies and nearly all major foreign markets, especially in the developing world. Nearly every other significant asset class fared worse, too, including investment-grade bonds and less creditworthy high-yield issues, foreign currencies and commodities like gold and oil.For all of 2015, the average domestic stock fund fell 1.3 percent, with specialists in small companies down 5 percent and midsize companies down 4.4 percent. Average losses exceeded 20 percent for portfolios that concentrate on energy and other commodities.International stock funds fell 2.9 percent, as losses in emerging markets, mainland Asia and Latin America more than offset gains in Europe and Japan.For all the turbulence before the fourth quarter and so far in 2016, the markets seemed to take the Fed\u2019s rate increase in stride. The S.&P. 500 closed December almost exactly where it was on Dec. 15, the day before the move, and the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds was 2.27 percent on both days.Bond funds were nevertheless weak to poor. The average one fell 0.7 percent during the fourth quarter, hurt by a 2 percent decline in the high-yield niche. For the full year, bond funds in general were off 1.4 percent, with high-yield bonds losing 4 percent.Although Wall Street accepted the rate increase graciously, some investment advisers wish that it hadn\u2019t happened and wonder how markets will perform this year, especially if the Fed keeps raising rates.\u201cThey did it because they felt they had to,\u201d said Hank Herrmann, chief executive of Waddell & Reed. \u201cI don\u2019t think the data necessarily supported doing it.\u201dGDPNow, a forecasting tool of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, estimated on Jan. 6 that the economy grew at a 0.7 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter. The forecast has eroded steadily from nearly 3 percent two months earlier.The Fed has signaled that it will raise rates four times this year, but the markets don\u2019t believe it, and neither does Mr. Herrmann. Based on prices of interest-rate derivatives, two further increases are expected. He anticipates either one or none.\u201cEconomic data will provide the answer, and I think it\u2019s going to remain something less than robust,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we have an inflation threat. There\u2019s still room for employment to increase and not cause a lift in wages.\u201dCharles de Vaulx, chief investment officer at International Value Advisers, is concerned that inflation will bubble up. He also worries about the opposite problem: deflation. Either could occur, he warned, as the Fed tries to step back from crisis mode and return to normal monetary policy while the world pares excessive debt on the books of governments, businesses and consumers.\u201cIt\u2019s a binary outcome. Will deflationary trends stay in place for another 10 years or will there be inflation?\u201d Mr. de Vaulx said. \u201cThe outcome is unknown, and investors have to acknowledge their ignorance. They should avoid making a one-way bet,\u201d by overemphasizing government bonds, for example, to safeguard against deflation, or commodities to hedge against inflation.Whichever way it plays out, he foresees anemic long-term performance, or worse, for many investments.\u201cStocks and bonds will be able to deliver exceedingly low returns for the next five to seven years,\u201d he predicted. \u201cInvestors have to plan accordingly.\u201dThat means buying a diverse group of assets, stressing ones that appear cheap. For Mr. de Vaulx that includes stocks and bonds in emerging markets; high-yield debt, particularly bonds issued by oil-service companies; and gold and other commodities. He also encourages stockpiling cash, which he called \u201ca critical tool to have in a low-return environment where volatility may be with us for a while.\u201d\u201cThe key is to have realistic expectations, then diversify, hold cash, be nimble, be willing to be contrarian,\u201d he advised.Robert J. Horrocks, chief investment officer of Matthews International Capital Management, questions how realistic the Fed\u2019s economic expectations are and what the consequences will be for Asia if growth remains soft.\u201cThe jury is still out on how strong underlying growth in the U.S. economy is,\u201d Mr. Horrocks said. \u201cInflation is still well contained. The Fed was pretty fast off the mark, and I suspect that worries some Asian markets.\u201dThat\u2019s because growth prospects in the region aren\u2019t so great, either, and its central banks haven\u2019t been much looser with monetary policy than the Fed.\u201cIn the very short term, we have some headwinds,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how strong the case is\u201d for emphasizing Asia \u201cat a time when the Fed is raising rates.\u201dAsian stocks aren\u2019t cheap, Mr. Horrocks pointed out, although he thinks valuations compare favorably with American and European markets. Looking past the near future, \u201cthe underlying elements that support growth and ultimately increase profits are still there in Asia,\u201d he added, including stronger productivity growth than other regions and more rapidly expanding economic output.He recommends high-quality companies that pay healthy dividends and have strong competitive positions within their industries. Of the two big mainland markets, he prefers China to India, but he finds good opportunities at lower prices in Thailand and Malaysia. He would also seek out \u201cmiddle-class growth stories\u201d in industries like retailing, insurance, health care and consumer staples.Ben Inker, co-head of asset allocation at GMO, likewise finds the short-term economic outlook daunting, and not just in Asia. He pointed out that the value and volume of global trade shrank last year, something that has never occurred outside of a recession.Mr. Inker encourages investors to go cheap and go abroad. His preferred destination is emerging markets, which have suffered from high indebtedness and weak prices in commodities like the oil and industrial metals that they export. Emerging markets took a turn for the worse \u2014 funds that focus on them fell 13.4 percent in 2015 \u2014 as the dollar grew stronger, reducing the dollar value of their assets and raising the burden of the dollar-denominated debt that proliferates in the developing world.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to be afraid of there, but generally the best money is to be made where people fear to go,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have given up on emerging; you can buy good companies at really cheap prices.\u201dOil prices are bound to recover at some point, he added, but he conceded that it could take a while.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a situation where the price stays at $30 to $40 a barrel for long if the world is producing as much oil as it consumes,\u201d he said, noting that \u201cproduction activity has come to a screeching halt.\u201dAmong American assets, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities offer better value for safety-conscious investors than conventional Treasury instruments, Mr. Inker said. He also considers it worth taking a chance on high-yield bonds for the long haul, but he cautioned that they \u201ccould get worse before they get better.\u201dMr. Kelly of J.P. Morgan also favors high-yield bonds, even though he expects economic and investment conditions to get better before they get worse now that the Fed has begun to raise interest rates. The first move to raise rates in a tightening cycle can lift the economy by putting more money into the hands of savers, he said, while borrowers on fixed-rates loans often see no change for a while. Home sales can improve, too, as the prospect of higher mortgage rates compel buyers to act.After that initial activity, growth slows and further rate increases can choke off a recovery. That\u2019s what Mr. Kelly envisions.\u201cYou want to avoid a situation where you\u2019re raising rates as the economy is slowing down,\u201d he said. Because the Fed waited so long, \u201cthere\u2019s a risk of that toward the end of the year. We have the potential for a typical central-bank-induced boom and bust.\u201dBefore it happens, Mr. Kelly expects stocks in economically sensitive sectors like financial services and consumer cyclicals to outperform. He also likes emerging markets. The appreciation of the dollar in anticipation of rising interest rates has hurt them, but now that rates are heading up, the dollar may reverse course.\u201cMy instinct is if something is cheap and good for long-term investors, don\u2019t wait for a better buying opportunity,\u201d he said.But many investors in 2016 have focused on selling opportunities, especially in assets that took spectacular drops in 2015, like oil and Chinese stocks. Mr. Herrmann wonders if the Fed will be all that eager to tighten credit further. He would stick with safer investments, including Treasury bonds and stocks in sectors that can generate growth in an anemic economy, such as health care, technology and consumer staples. He also advised being prepared for more excitement, like it or not.\u201cIt\u2019s a confusing time,\u201d Mr. Herrmann said. \u201cYou have to predict the unpredictable now more than ever.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oil Price Falls as Global Growth Anxiety Weighs on Markets", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byThe recent turmoil, across stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies, reflects investors\u2019 growing anxiety about global growth. The swirl of forces are interconnected, so the volatility in one area can quickly spread to other countries and other markets.The tumult in China, where stocks are now in bear-market territory, is helping drag down oil prices. China, an important energy consumer, is facing a slowdown that could hurt its demand for crude.It all makes for trouble in the stock markets, with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell about 2 percent.The sell-off started on Friday in China, where the main Shanghai index dropped 3.6 percent. The index has fallen more than 20 percent from its December high, a threshold that analysts generally regard as a bear market.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.China\u2019s troubles have affected the price of oil, which is off more than 70 percent over the last 18 months.On Friday, the futures for Brent crude for March delivery were trading at $29.06 a barrel on the Intercontinental Exchange. West Texas intermediate crude settled at $29.42 a barrel, or down 5.7 percent. As recently as May, Brent crude was trading at about $65 a barrel.Whether the volatility subsists will depend largely on the direction of the global economy and how it affects demand for oil.In China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy after the United States, underlying growth continues to slow. The government is expected to report next week that economic growth cooled last year to 6.9 percent. That figure would be the envy of many countries but that would signal China\u2019s slowest pace in a quarter of a century.China and other growing Asian economies have become important customers for oil exporters like Saudi Arabia and Iran, particularly as rising production of oil in the United States has reduced American imports. If the economic weakness in China leads to a sharp fall in demand, the big producers will most likely discount their oil even more aggressively to attract buyers.Oil prices are also under pressure because an easing of international sanctions on Iran could come in the next few days. Sanctions have crimped Iran\u2019s production and sales in recent years. If they are removed, Iran could start to ramp up production and rekindle sales to former customers in Europe and elsewhere. In the coming months, that could add 300,000 to 400,000 barrels a day to an already oversupplied market, analysts estimate.Sentiment in the market is now very negative, analysts say. Traders are betting on still-lower prices, perhaps even heading toward the $20-a-barrel range.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.With prices settling below the $30 level, \u201cit could set the scene for further declines next week,\u201d said Richard Mallinson, an analyst at Energy Aspects, a research firm based in London.The low prices of oil are wreaking havoc in the industry, adding to the broad investor anxiety.\u201cThe dramatic fall in prices has led to the disappointing write-down announced today,\u201d Andrew Mackenzie, BHP Billiton\u2019s chief executive, said on Friday in a statement. \u201cOil and gas markets have been significantly weaker than the industry expected.\u201dThe cutbacks seem drastic, but it will take time for them to have a significant impact on the balance of supply and demand. Despite weak prices, oil production was higher in 2015 as extensive investments in previous years began to translate into higher production in the United States, Brazil and elsewhere. Even Britain, whose North Sea region is widely viewed as struggling, showed increased output.Seth Kleinman, an analyst at Citigroup in London, said it was unlikely that crude prices would reach bottom before markets encountered production declines outside the United States and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.Saudi Arabia and other members of OPEC continue to produce at high levels and show no signs of abandoning their unwillingness to adjust outputs to regulate the market.\u201cIn order to maintain an efficient economy, you can\u2019t be pushing your production up and down by half a million barrels a day to prop up prices somewhere else,\u201d said Sadad al-Husseini, a former executive vice president of Saudi Aramco, the national oil company, who now runs a consulting firm.Neil Gough contributed reporting from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Madoff\u2019s Multibillion-Dollar Mirage Arrives on TV", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Supported byAt the McCarran airport in Las Vegas not long ago, I handed my ticket and driver\u2019s license to the T.S.A. agent, a woman who appeared to be in her mid-60s. She examined my return ticket to Newark and then, seemingly out of the blue, looked up and said, \u201cI wish I could move back to New York.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s stopping you?\u201d I asked, perhaps too glibly.\u201cMadoff,\u201d she replied sadly. \u201cHe took everything. I never thought I would be working this late in life.\u201dThen, in December 2008, they discovered that it had all been a mirage. Instead of buying stocks with their money, Mr. Madoff had been running the biggest Ponzi scheme the world has ever known; when it collapsed, his investors lost $65 billion. Or rather, they thought they did; most of that money never existed in the first place. Within a matter of months, Mr. Madoff, who was then 71, had pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 150 years in prison.Inevitably, journalists struggled to understand Mr. Madoff\u2019s psyche, not to mention whether his family had known what he was doing, and how he had pulled it off. Newspaper articles led to magazine articles, which led to books, some better than others.I say \u201csupposedly,\u201d because the mini-series tells its story far more lucidly than Mr. Ross\u2019s scattershot book. It is always difficult to convey the intricacies of financial fraud on the screen, but \u201cMadoff\u201d does an exceptionally good job of it.Take its opening scene, in which Mr. Madoff is having lunch with a prospective investor. \u201cIt\u2019s a closed fund,\u201d he tells the investor, meaning that he isn\u2019t accepting new investments. Then we hear Mr. Dreyfuss\u2019s voice-over, explaining what his character has learned over the years about luring in investors.\u201cYou present it as an exclusive thing, an elite club for the chosen few,\u201d he says. \u201cNothing on earth makes people want something more than telling them they can\u2019t have it.\u201d Back to the lunch, where Mr. Madoff tells the investor, \u201cI\u2019m going to make an exception.\u201d The man smiles broadly at the news he will be joining the club \u2014 and happily hands his money over to a crook.By the time the mini-series is over, we\u2019ve learned what a Ponzi scheme is \u2014 pretending to invest people\u2019s money but actually making payouts to exiting investors with new money from incoming investors. We\u2019ve seen the Securities and Exchange Commission conduct an investigation into Mr. Madoff\u2019s firm \u2014 and fail to make the one critical phone call that would have exposed the scheme. We\u2019ve watched Mr. Madoff and his key lieutenant, Frank DiPascali Jr., rig each month\u2019s statements so that they arrive at a predetermined gain.And though \u201cMadoff\u201d can\u2019t explain what\u2019s going through Mr. Madoff\u2019s mind during the decades he harbors his secret, we do get to watch him pull it off with an incredible bluster and nerve. He actually rages at the regulators holed up in his office, examining his books \u2014 regulators who could expose him if they were to do their jobs right. He threatens to toss big investors who have upset him out of the fund, even though he doesn\u2019t have the money to pay them back. We watch him take money from Elie Wiesel, knowing he will even defraud the beloved Nobel Prize winner and Holocaust survivor. Over and over, we see him look people in the eye, lunch with them and laugh with them, even as he\u2019s betraying them.This is never truer than when he is around his family. Though Mr. Madoff was a philanderer, the mini-series correctly portrays him as someone who preferred being with family. His sons, his brother, his niece \u2014 and Ruth \u2014 all worked at the firm, though in the legitimate part of the business. (The Ponzi scheme was conducted several floors below Mr. Madoff\u2019s main office.) They spent much of their free time together.Indeed, to a large extent, \u201cMadoff\u201d is about his family as much as it is about him. They are portrayed as his most tragic victims. His sons, Mark and Andrew (played by Tom Lipinski and Danny Deferrari), were the ones who turned him in after he confessed to them that he had been running a Ponzi scheme. Despondent, buried in litigation and obsessed with the scandal, Mark committed suicide on the second anniversary of his father\u2019s arrest. (Andy died of cancer in 2014.)As for Ruth, she lost virtually everything, including her relationship with her sons when she refused to turn against her husband, as they had done. Although Mr. Ross hints in his book that she may have known about the scheme \u2014 he notes that she made several multimillion-dollar withdrawals before Mr. Madoff\u2019s confession \u2014 the mini-series portrays her as the ur-victim.\u201cFrom the materials we had and the people we talked to, we could not come to the conclusion that she knew,\u201d said Linda Berman, one of the show\u2019s executive producers. Ms. Berman added that Ms. Danner spent a day with Ruth Madoff as she prepared for the role; visits like that invariably arouse sympathy.However much Mr. Madoff\u2019s family may or may not have been victimized, what is largely missing from \u201cMadoff\u201d are all those other victims, the ones who, like that T.S.A. agent I met in Las Vegas, entrusted their life savings to Bernie Madoff and lost everything. Almost all the scenes in \u201cMadoff\u201d involve the rich; only once do we see him meet a small investor, a woman whose husband has died and who is considering withdrawing her daughter\u2019s college money from the fund. Mr. Madoff writes her a check, which she then rips up, saying that she will trust him, just as her husband did.Toward the end, there is also a short montage of small investors who had their money with Mr. Madoff. But the scene feels dutiful, lacking the kind of empathy that the mini-series heaps on Ruth Madoff.The truth is, in virtually all the journalism about Mr. Madoff, his victims have gotten short shrift. \u201cVictims are always an afterthought,\u201d said Ilene Kent, a Madoff victim I got to know when I was writing about Mr. Madoff. The fascination with Mr. Madoff, and with Ruth and Andy and Mark and his brother, Peter (who is serving a 10-year prison sentence), has caused us \u2014 myself included \u2014 to skip lightly over the enormous pain he inflicted on so many people.That \u201cMadoff\u201d has this flaw as well is not surprising. It\u2019s just sad to see.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bank of America\u2019s Profit Tops Expectations", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported byThe bank, which is based in Charlotte, N.C., said net income increased 9 percent, to $3.3 billion, or 28 cents a share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had been expecting earnings of 26 cents a share.Revenue in the quarter rose about 4 percent, to $19.8 billion, on par with what analysts expected.\u201cWe saw solid customer activity in loan growth, deposits and wealth management asset flows, and we returned more capital to our shareholders,\u201d the bank\u2019s chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, said in a statement.It was the fourth consecutive quarter that Bank of America reported higher profit from the year earlier period.The results were also helped by relatively strong investment banking results. Sales and trading revenue increased 11 percent in the quarter, bolstered by strong activity in the bank\u2019s fixed income, currencies and commodities unit.Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks\u2019 bottom lines.The bank\u2019s fourth-quarter results were muted somewhat by the impact of dropping oil prices.The bank said provisions for credit losses increased $264 million in the fourth quarter, related to higher charge-offs and increased reserves.Last week, Citigroup reported a large increase in reserves, while Wells Fargo said its losses had increased from the third quarter because of low oil prices.Until now, investors have figured that many customers of the large United States banks will actually benefit from the turmoil in the energy markets because low oil price will give them more spending money.But the oil-price drop to below $30 a barrel is destabilizing the vast oil and gas industry, which has borrowed billions from banks like Bank of America to drill wells and explore new reserves. Already, some companies are on the verge of bankruptcy and the collateral backing their loans is shedding value, raising the prospect of large losses in the banking system.For now, executives at the largest banks have said the losses are manageable and oil and gas exposure is not a big percentage of overall loans.Still, bank stocks have been getting hammered since the start of the year, when the stock market turned volatile amid the collapse in oil prices and concern about China\u2019s slowing economy. Bank of America\u2019s shares are down more than 14 percent since then, while the broader market has fallen more than 8 percent.Advertisement"}

Take Alphabet, he said. \u201cNot only does it have a great brand, but every day it does seven to eight times as many searches as all of its competitors combined. So every day its search accuracy is improving that much faster than competitors\u2019.\u201dAs befits a growth investor, Mr. Baker is a technophile. He will riff at length about the technological themes that undergird his picks, like the omnipresence of cloud computing, the maturation of solar power and the promise of artificial intelligence. Skeptics complain the information age isn\u2019t yielding benefits comparable to the industrial revolution, but that is humbug, he says.\u201cThe steam engine, to take advantage of that, you needed to dig canals and put in railroads. The peak change was 75 to 100 years after the invention.\u201d As far as the microchip goes, he said, \u201cAll of the infrastructure is in place, and we\u2019re entering the period of peak economic and social change.\u201dEven video game makers are benefiting, he said. Consider Activision Blizzard, another top holding and the producer of Call of Duty and Guitar Hero. A decade ago, its market comprised a few million game consoles and personal computers, Mr. Baker said. \u201cNow you have a billion smartphones, all of which you can play a video game on.\u201d And Activision Blizzard is trying to broaden its share of the mobile market with its pending acquisition of King Digital Entertainment, maker of the game Candy Crush.Mr. Baker\u2019s fund, with an expense ratio of 0.83 percent, returned 13.34 percent for the quarter, compared with 7.04 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.\u201cBrands hold their value, and a global brand isn\u2019t dependent on one geography,\u201d she said. Est\u00e9e Lauder, Starbucks and Nike were all among her fund\u2019s recent stakes. \u201cTheir markets are growing because they address the whole world,\u201d she said.Sturdy brands also drew her to Constellation Brands, which owns the United States rights to popular Mexican beers like Corona, Modelo and Pacifico, as well as a groaning cellar of wines. \u201cIn good times and bad, people still drink wine and beer,\u201d she said.Ms. Starke took over her fund about a year and a half ago. It then held more than 80 stocks. She set about paring that number, with an aim of keeping the portfolio at 30 to 50 holdings. \u201cIn large-cap growth, it\u2019s hard to outperform with a big portfolio,\u201d she said. \u201cA concentrated portfolio is the way to do it.\u201d With too many holdings, a fund can end up looking too much like the broader market and merely matching its return.She also plowed a greater portion of the fund\u2019s money into her top picks. Previously, the top 10 holdings accounted for about 14 percent of the portfolio, she said. Now they are more than 40 percent.The fund\u2019s biggest sector weightings are information technology, health care and consumer discretionary. Those tend to produce the best earnings growth, she said. \u201cI\u2019m looking for healthy earnings growth and healthy sales growth,\u201d she said.Ms. Starke\u2019s fund, with an expense ratio of 1.12, returned 9.92 percent in the fourth quarter.Like Mr. Baker\u2019s fund, it lately held shares of Microsoft. Mr. Kleinschmidt said the fund had owned the stock for about a decade, even as the company was seen as falling behind competitors like Apple and Google. But Microsoft kept putting up strong numbers, he said.\u201cForget the name,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I just gave you their market share, their cash flow, their return on equity, if I showed you all of that, would you be interested? Yes. Most people would be.\u201dFacebook, an overlap with both Mr. Baker\u2019s and Ms. Starke\u2019s top holdings, is a more recent purchase. Mr. Kleinschmidt said he was attracted to the social network\u2019s enormous customer base, about 600 million people when the company went public in 2012. Tocqueville bought shares in the months after Facebook\u2019s initial public offering, when the stock sagged. \u201cI reasoned a smart management team would be able to figure out how to make money on 600 million users,\u201d Mr. Kleinschmidt said. Facebook says its network has grown and estimates more than a billion people use its service daily.Mr. Kleinschmidt has patience. As he has with Microsoft, he will stick with a stock for years. His fund\u2019s annual turnover ratio is 15 percent. In contrast, the average actively managed stock fund tracked by Morningstar turns over about two-thirds of its portfolio annually.\u201cOne of the hardest things to do in this business \u2014 and yet one of the best things \u2014 can be to sit on your hands and not let the market\u2019s noise convince you that you have to do something,\u201d he said.Mr. Kleinschmidt cautioned that his turnover might increase in coming months. As a contrarian, he said he often finds buying opportunities when the market sags, as it has lately. \u201cThe essence of a contrarian thinker is to lean against the wind. You do that by looking into situations where the prevailing feeling is, \u2018Oh, my God.\u2019\u201dMr. Kleinschmidt\u2019s fund, with an expense ratio of 1.25 percent, returned 10.97 percent in the fourth quarter.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A New Focus on Liquidity After a Fund\u2019s Collapse", "Date": "2016-01-11", "News": "Supported byThe college seminar was drawing to a close in October and Martin J. Whitman was pondering the hits and misses in his long career at the top of Third Avenue Management, one of Wall Street\u2019s better-known value investment firms.He had had winners with his stock picks, but when it came to bonds, the results were mediocre.Those bets may have been bad. But they paled in comparison to the implosion in December of his firm\u2019s junk bond fund, which was loaded with high-risk bonds of distressed companies. Worried about the fund\u2019s viability, panicked investors demanded payouts that far exceeded the fund\u2019s liquid assets. And in a desperate move, the firm froze the fund, halting further redemptions.Since the end of November, investors have withdrawn $1.5 billion from Third Avenue funds, according to Morningstar, the fund research firm. Total assets under management at the firm have fallen to $6.3 billion from about $10 billion half a year ago, according to Third Avenue.In essence, that is what happened to Third Avenue\u2019s fund.Mr. Whitman\u2019s renown in the 1990s and early 2000s was largely due to his success as a value-oriented equity hawk, seeking out companies that traded at discounts to the broader market. But as he made clear to the business school students at Boston College last fall, he got his start as an investor in the 1970s by scooping up the debt securities of highly indebted companies.It is a laborious, time-consuming process that involves buying the bonds of a few bankrupt companies for pennies on the dollar and then working with management to effect a turnaround.In many ways, that approach was reflected in the strategy of the Third Avenue Focused Credit Fund that barred redemptions in December: find a company on death\u2019s door and bet big, paying little concern to investment tenets that encourage diversified portfolios of securities that can be easily sold.\u201cIf you don\u2019t know a thing about the company, then you should diversify,\u201d Mr. Whitman growled, using an obscenity to underscore his view that owning a broad basket of securities reflects a lack of confidence and conviction on the part of the investor.Betting big on a few companies and sticking with them may have worked during Mr. Whitman\u2019s heyday. For example, one of his earliest forays into investing was in the waste energy firm Covanta in the 1980s, and even now the company remains a top holding for the flagship Third Avenue Value Fund.But such an approach proved disastrous for Third Avenue\u2019s credit fund, which, more than any of its peers, skewed its portfolio toward high-risk, high-return turnaround situations in which the bonds traded so infrequently that determining a price for them was little more than guesswork.The question looming now is whether this practice of pushing into bonds that have very high yields but are very hard to sell \u2014 taken to an extreme by Third Avenue but popular among many junk bond managers these days \u2014 will result in any action against the firm by regulators.Third Avenue declined to comment, as did the S.E.C.In 2010, the S.E.C., the main regulator for mutual funds, set up an asset management unit with the aim of increasing surveillance of fund companies. Since then, one of the main areas of focus for this division has been the extent to which fund trustees, who are obligated to look out for the interests of mutual fund investors, are fulfilling their duty to hold fund managers to account.At the root of these investigations is the concern that fund trustees are beholden less to the investors they are mandated to protect than to the investment advisers that appoint them to their paid positions.Regulatory experts say that if the S.E.C. does decide to crack down on Third Avenue, it will be related to this pricing issue and whether the portfolio managers at the credit fund set prices too high for the most illiquid bonds. Mispricings of hard-to-trade (and hard-to-value) securities give investors a distorted view of the assets\u2019 worth \u2014 which makes the fund all the more vulnerable when investors remove their money en masse.\u201cThere is a line that that board could have crossed by not ensuring that the fund had adequate liquidity,\u201d said Mercer E. Bullard, a mutual fund specialist at the University of Mississippi School of Law and a former lawyer at the S.E.C.Just a few months before the Third Avenue fund debacle, the commission published a new set of proposed rules aimed, in effect, at preventing exactly what happened with Third Avenue\u2019s credit fund.The message was clear: Mutual fund boards are responsible for making sure that the investment adviser acts responsibly in pricing securities and ensuring there is enough cash on hand for investors looking to sell.But experts worry that mutual fund boards these days do not have the expertise or the muscle to do this job effectively.\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to value these types of corporate bonds,\u201d said Stephen Keen, a securities lawyer at the law firm Perkins Coie in Denver. And few boards, he added, have the technical smarts for such a task.To be sure, there is no indication so far that Mr. Whitman, or any other trustees, will face charges for failing to ensure that securities were valued correctly and that enough cash was on hand for investors who wanted to get out.Still, as the S.E.C. continues to scrutinize the sequence of events leading to the fund\u2019s decision to prevent investors from taking their money out last December, a critical question will be how Mr. Whitman balanced his responsibility as fund chairman to protect investors with his loyalty to the investment firm that he founded.Although Mr. Whitman gave up his direct money management responsibilities in 2012, he and his family remain the largest of the firm\u2019s minority shareholders.In the past, the makeup of Third Avenue fund trustees has tilted toward people closely tied to Mr. Whitman with little to no financial experience. Until 2002, for example, Mr. Whitman\u2019s daughter, Barbara, a Broadway producer, and his sister, Phyllis Beck, a superior court judge in Pennsylvania, served on the board.And even today, three of the board\u2019s independent trustees have personal links to Mr. Whitman. Lucinda Franks, an author and a former journalist, is married to Robert M. Morgenthau, former district attorney of Manhattan and a close friend of Mr. Whitman. Two others, Martin Shubik, a mathematics professor, and Charles Walden, a financial executive, have assisted Mr. Whitman with books he has written.Regulatory filings show that as money poured out of the fund, the board stepped up scrutiny of its hard-to-sell holdings. The board has two committees to review pricing issues. One is a valuation committee, which included Third Avenue\u2019s top lawyer and its chief financial officer. And the other is a fair value committee, composed only of independent directors.According to fund disclosures, the fair value committee met 13 times in the fiscal year ending in October 2014. Third Avenue has not yet disclosed how many times the committee has met since then. But the more its members met, especially in 2015, the more exposed the fund became to its most distressed hard-to-price securities.And by December, with these bonds making up 16 percent of its portfolio \u2014 in violation of the S.E.C.\u2019s 15 percent limit \u2014 Mr. Whitman and the board decided to shut the fund down.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Davos Takes a Fresh Look at Emerging Markets", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported byEver since emerging markets became a major asset class in the early 1990s, a parade of potentates, policy makers and corporate chieftains have flocked to the stylish village of Davos in the Swiss Alps in the hope of becoming the latest global meme.From 2000 on, the Davos boom and the emerging markets boom have been pretty much one and the same, a living ideal of globalization helped by central banks that have printed trillions of dollars of new money.But now, as interest rates in the United States begin to rise, these dollars have begun to flow out of China, the Middle East and Latin America. Growth rates are stumbling, debt levels rising and geopolitical fears spreading.Over the last year, the exodus has gathered pace, fed by worries that China will lose control of its currency, the price of oil will drop to $20 a barrel, and Brazil\u2019s problems will worsen.And many now say that this rosy, Davos-fueled notion of a world powered by emerging-market growth and innovation needs to be reconsidered.\u201cI have long maintained that the emerging-market hype was oversold when it was clear that what was going on was high commodity prices and cheap money,\u201d said Dani Rodrik, an expert on globalization at the Harvard Kennedy School.As for the World Economic Forum in Davos, he said that over the last 10 years it had become an echo chamber of sorts.\u201cWhat we are seeing now is lower growth and policy conflicts between the emerging and the developed world,\u201d said Mr. Rodrik, who will not be making the trip this time around. \u201cIt is going to be a different type of Davos this year.\u201dPerhaps the biggest sign that global investors have lost faith is that for the first time since 1988 (when only the bravest souls invested in these countries), investors have pulled more money out of emerging markets than they have put in, according to research by the Institute of International Finance.In an unusually blunt speech in Paris this month, Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said that emerging nations needed a new model for growth after years of relying on easy money and high commodity prices.\u201cGrowth rates are down, and cyclical and structural forces have undermined the traditional growth paradigm,\u201d Ms. Lagarde said. Moreover, she warned, the dollar\u2019s continued strength against just about all emerging-market currencies could well result in a new round of financial uncertainty, pushing commodity prices and global growth forecasts even lower.Since mid-2011, the dollar has gained more than 100 percent against emerging-market currencies in Turkey, Brazil and South Africa. And over the last six months, following China\u2019s decision to depreciate the renminbi, previously robust monetary units in Singapore, Korea and Taiwan have also started to lose value against the dollar.\u201cOur own estimates show that a slowdown of 1 percent in the emerging world would lower growth in advanced countries by at least about 0.2 percentage points,\u201d Ms. Lagarde said.Still, even with the gloom and doom surrounding emerging markets these days, there is little sign that standard bearers are forgoing their annual week in the Swiss mountains.This year, more than 320 representatives from Brazil, Russia, India and China \u2014 the so-called BRIC community of emerging nations \u2014 will be in Davos \u2014 compared with 237 from these countries in 2010.None of these representatives will be heads of state, though. In the past, Brazilian presidents and Vladimir Putin of Russia have led their countries\u2019 delegations. This year, Russia is sending a deputy prime minister, Yury Trutnev, while China is sending a vice president, Li Yuanchao.Two large emerging markets that have been under significant stress of late will be sending their leaders. Turkey, recently rocked by terrorist attacks, will be represented by its prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu. And the South African president, Jacob Zuma, who has gone through three finance ministers in the last five weeks, is also planning to show up.The president of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, whose popularity polls have sunk to single digits, will not be making an appearance, but her recently appointed finance minister, Nelson Henrique Barbosa-Filho, is scheduled to attend.Ready to engage in some damage control will be the top executives at BTG Pactual, the Brazilian investment bank whose former chief executive, Andr\u00e9 Esteves, is under investigation for corruption.In terms of panels themed for developing nations, the World Economic Forum will be serving up the usual fare this year. One will explore how companies in emerging markets cope with laws that discriminate against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender workers. Another is more straightforward: What will the impact of higher interest rates in the United States be on emerging market growth?But, as is always the case at the World Economic Forum, the meetings of genuine consequence will be the ones that you do not know are happening.That could mean Laurence D. Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest money management firm, sitting down with Jean-Paul Villain, an executive at the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, or Fahad al-Mubarak, the governor of Saudi Arabia\u2019s central bank and overseer of the country\u2019s $650 billion foreign reserve stash.Or the chief executives of Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase could wind up huddling with Fang Xinghai, the vice chairman of the China securities regulatory commission. The sharp swings in China\u2019s stock market are having an outsize effect on markets in the United States, and the big American investment banks will want to hear what Mr. Fang\u2019s strategy is for 2016.But as central bankers, prime ministers and chief executives wrestle this week to make sense of it all, Ruchir Sharma, head of emerging markets at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, has a fairly simple explanation: The impact on the developed world of a slowdown in China and other emerging markets is going to be greater than most people realize.\u201cIn 1997, the emerging world\u2019s share of the global economy was 20 percent \u2014 now, it\u2019s nearly 40 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a big deal. What happens in China has an effect on the wider world, and I think that the Davos crowd has been slow to recognize this.\u201dAdvertisement"}

(Under the Medicare drug benefit that began in 2006 and continues today, drug prices are negotiated between manufacturers and private plans, or pharmacy benefits management companies on their behalf.)Ms. Ellison and Ms. Wolfram examined over 100 of the largest revenue-generating brand-name drugs from manufacturers receiving the greatest price scrutiny. They found that large, brand-name drug firms tended to keep drug price growth close to that of overall inflation during this period of political examination. This tendency was stronger for firms likely to be more politically sensitive \u2014 those with more sales to Medicare-aged consumers and those less likely to face price-reducing competition because of longer lives left on patents.For those outraged by the prices of drugs, there are two ways to think about drug price responses to political pressure. You can view them as short-term cynical moves by an industry attempting to escape a political firestorm. Or, you can view them as consolation prizes.Drug price control legislation is exceedingly difficult to pass, and many prior attempts to do so have failed. At least with political pressure, drug price growth may slow, if only temporarily.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inquiry in China Adds to Doubt Over Reliability of Its Economic Data", "Date": "2016-01-26", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 The veracity of China\u2019s economic data has been increasingly questioned as the slowing pace of the country\u2019s growth has startled the world. And a new investigation into the official who oversees the numbers is unlikely to inspire confidence.The Communist Party\u2019s anticorruption commission announced late Tuesday that it was looking into the head of the country\u2019s statistics agency over what it called \u201cserious violations.\u201dChina\u2019s shrinking manufacturing sector and falling stock market have unnerved global investors. Any further doubt about its economic figures could paint an even darker picture of the health of the economy, adding to the pain in the markets. Stocks in Shanghai, which closed before the announcement, were off 6.4 percent on Tuesday.The statistics bureau has a variety of responsibilities that are hard to balance even in the best of times.The bureau is supposed to provide China\u2019s leaders with an unvarnished assessment of the country\u2019s economic strengths and weaknesses, even while reassuring the public about growth and maintaining consumer confidence. It is also supposed to release enough detailed and accurate information for investors and corporate leaders to make sound decisions about economic and financial prospects.Few doubt that China has grown enormously over the past three decades. But economists, bankers and analysts who study the numbers believe that the bureau smooths data, underestimating growth during economic booms and overestimating it during downturns.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.Many economists are worried that China\u2019s economy is not expanding anywhere close to the nearly 7 percent annual pace that bureau data still show. By some estimates, the pace is half of the official figures.Those skeptical about the data point, in part, to the underlying numbers.Still, the bureau has consistently and repeatedly defended its statistics, contending that critics do not adequately understand the data or the Chinese economy. And the market impact of the investigation could be limited by the fact that many were already wondering about China\u2019s data.\u201cThe international credibility of China\u2019s G.D.P. figures is anyway very low, so this probably is not a severe blow,\u201d said Diana Choyleva, the chief economist and head of research at Lombard Street Research, an economic analysis group in London. Lombard estimates that China\u2019s gross domestic product grew 3.2 percent last year, not the 6.9 percent that the National Bureau of Statistics claims.The reliability of China\u2019s economic data goes to the heart of the market\u2019s concerns.At the official rate, China grew last year at the slowest pace in 25 years. The government is trying to manage a slowdown without letting the pain create social unrest.That can make it hard to discern what\u2019s really happening in the economy. Among other problems, it has a glut of old-line factories that make products like steel, glass and cement. That industrial overcapacity stems from years of debt-financed investment in industries that now show little sign that they can repay those loans.Beijing is trying to rebalance its economy to focus more on consumer spending and services. But concerns about the pace of change play into the worries about the data.Take the steel industry.China produced 804 million tons of steel last year, even as demand faltered. Over all, China\u2019s steel-making capacity was set to reach 1.17 billion tons last year, according to estimates from Fitch Ratings.The government is taking steps to work through some of the excess. The country\u2019s State Council, or cabinet, decided on Sunday that it would close 100 million to 150 million tons of steel-making capacity. That would mean cutting capacity by an amount similar to the total annual steel output of Japan, the world\u2019s No. 2 steel maker.The State Council decision, which was released on Monday, also called for large reductions in coal-mining capacity, without providing a target figure.But it is a balancing act for the Chinese authorities.Li Xinchuang, the head of the China Metallurgical Industry Planning and Research Institute, told the official Xinhua news agency that the planned steel mill closings could cost 400,000 jobs. \u201cLarge-scale redundancies in the steel sector could threaten social stability,\u201d he warned.The disjointed attempts of policy makers to manage the stock markets and the currency are adding to skepticism about the economy.The outflows of capital reflect the uncertainty about the direction of the currency \u2014 and about the broader economy. Excluding foreign investment, capital outflows probably rose to as much as $900 billion in 2015, economists at Standard Chartered wrote on Tuesday in a research note.In response to the outflows, China\u2019s central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, has been eating into its reserves at a record pace in recent months. The central bank is trying to prop up the value of the Chinese currency, the renminbi, which is under pressure as the country\u2019s growth prospects weaken.It is all making for messiness in the markets. After the fall on Tuesday, Chinese stocks were at their lowest level in 13 months.Neil Gough contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The question in the case, Salman v. United States, No. 15-628, is whether prosecutors had to prove that the brother-in-law, Maher Kara, disclosed the information in exchange for a personal benefit.The Second Circuit read the passage narrowly, saying it required \u201cproof of a meaningfully close personal relationship that generates an exchange that is objective, consequential and represents at least a potential gain of a pecuniary or similarly valuable nature.\u201dThe United States attorney in Manhattan oversaw a sweeping crackdown on insider trading in the hedge fund industry, but a federal appeals court upended the campaign.The Ninth Circuit focused on a passage in the Dirks decision that allowed liability \u201cwhen an insider makes a gift of confidential information to a trading relative or a friend.\u201d\u201cIn our case,\u201d the Ninth Circuit said, \u201cthe government presented direct evidence that the disclosure was intended as a gift of market-sensitive information,\u201d adding that the Second Circuit\u2019s approach would have negative consequences.\u201cIf Salman\u2019s theory were accepted and this evidence found to be insufficient,\u201d the court said, \u201cthen a corporate insider or other person in possession of confidential and proprietary information would be free to disclose that information to her relatives, and they would be free to trade on it, provided only that she asked for no tangible compensation in return.\u201dAs is its custom, the Supreme Court gave no reasons for agreeing to hear the case.The Justice Department unsuccessfully sought review of the Second Circuit\u2019s ruling in the Newman case, arguing that it represented a significant change in decades of insider trading case law. Allowing the ruling to stand, the petition said, will \u201churt market participants, disadvantage scrupulous market analysts and impair the government\u2019s ability to protect the fairness and integrity of the securities markets.\u201dThe Supreme Court on Tuesday again declined to take the Justice Department\u2019s advice.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Robert H.B. Baldwin, Transformer of Morgan Stanley, Dies at 95", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byRobert H. B. Baldwin, a Wall Street maverick who presided over the transformation of Morgan Stanley from a prestigious but staid old investment bank into a modern, competitive financial services corporation in the 1970s and early \u201980s, died on Sunday at a nursing home in Skillman, N.J., near Princeton. He was 95.His son Robert Jr. confirmed the death on Wednesday.At the start of Mr. Baldwin\u2019s tenure, Morgan Stanley\u2019s partners and clients wore old-school neckties, lunched at the same clubs and relied on sure things: underwriting bonds, genteel integrity, assured profits. But as Morgan Stanley\u2019s gentlemanly mystique gave way to new regulations and cutthroat competition, Mr. Baldwin liked to remind them that he had worked his way through Princeton, and that his grandfather had been a railway conductor.In short, that he was not really one of them.A tough, brusque, often polarizing leader who struck colleagues as being out of place at Morgan Stanley, he was widely credited with pulling the firm out of its white-shoe rut into an era of enormous growth and painful change, less focused on exclusive services for blue-chip clients and more on the rough-and-tumble of securities trading, mergers and acquisitions and money management.As president from 1973 to 1982 and chairman until he retired at the end of 1983, Mr. Baldwin expanded Morgan Stanley into a full-service financial brokerage and changed a culture that had been entrenched for decades, with executive success often assured by family, social and educational connections.Morgan Stanley\u2019s tweedy underwriters dealt almost exclusively with the chief executives of corporate America \u2014 American Telephone, General Electric, Exxon, DuPont and other giants \u2014 playing golf, taking leisurely lunches, giving advice and managing the sales of bond and stock issues without dickering over commissions or competing in open markets. Those relationships were not abandoned under Mr. Baldwin.But after the Securities and Exchange Commission abolished fixed commissions on stock trades in 1975, changes were inevitable. For Morgan Stanley, which sold blocks of stock for institutions at set fees, the new rule meant a huge loss of easy revenue and a need to compete for commissions. It could no longer monitor markets from a distance, but had to get down on trading floors and skirmish for bids and prices.Mr. Baldwin created a trading operation from scratch, and hired a big staff for it. The firm had long looked down on the trading-floor crowd as coarse. Now it needed traders capable of split-second, high-pressure decisions, people with quick wits, stamina and guts. Other firms were raided for talent. Incentive pay sharpened performances. Collegiality faded, competition raced ahead.Other traditions also fell. To get closer to clients, Morgan Stanley gave up its hallowed headquarters on Wall Street and moved to Midtown Manhattan. It established new offices in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Instead of taking country club memberships, it rented Madison Square Garden sky boxes to entertain clients at Knicks and Rangers games.To compete for lucrative mergers and acquisitions, long shunned by Morgan Stanley\u2019s etiquette, Mr. Baldwin named dozens of new executives whose expertise was in equities and hostile takeovers, not social relationships. The firm also began taking start-ups as clients, handled initial public offerings of stock and moved into wealth management for private clients.By the time Mr. Baldwin stepped down, Morgan Stanley had become a full-service financial hub. Its staff had grown tenfold to 2,600 and its capital to more than $300 million from $7.5 million in 1970. It was still one of the most prestigious names on Wall Street. But historians said the cost had been great.Robert Hayes Burns Baldwin was born on July 9, 1920, in East Orange, N.J., to John Frank and Anna Burns Baldwin. His grandfather really was a Pennsylvania Railroad conductor. Robert graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1938. At Princeton, he ran a laundry to pay his way. He studied economics, played football, basketball and baseball, and graduated in 1942 with high honors. In World War II, he was a naval officer on two aircraft carriers.In 1949, he married Geraldine Gay Williams. They divorced. In 1981, Mr. Baldwin married Dorothy Tobin Ayres.Besides his son Robert, his survivors include another son, Whitney; three daughters, Janet K. Baldwin, Deborah Baldwin Fall and Elizabeth Baldwin Maushardt; two stepchildren, Mary Ayres Hack and W. Dillaway Ayres Jr.; and 13 grandchildren.Mr. Baldwin joined Morgan Stanley in 1946. He became a general partner in 1958 and a limited partner in 1965. From 1965 to 1967, he took a leave to be President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s under secretary of the Navy.As president and chairman of Morgan Stanley for a decade, he was an influential voice on Wall Street, quoted by the press when interest rates changed, inflation worsened or government agencies imposed new regulations affecting the industry.His 1975 prediction that hundreds of brokerage firms would go out of business as a result of the new S.E.C. rule eliminating fixed commissions was quoted often as its accuracy became apparent over the next few years. In 1978, he signaled Wall Street\u2019s cautious approval of a national market system linking the major securities exchanges electronically. And he spoke for many colleagues when he criticized President Jimmy Carter\u2019s tax reforms and enthusiastically endorsed Ronald Reagan in 1980.When he stepped down as chairman at the end of 1983, he joined a board that informally advised Morgan Stanley on policy matters and business ventures. From 1989 to 1992, he was chairman of the Lodestar Group, a New York merchant bank.In later years, as Morgan Stanley became a global financial operation with 1,300 offices and 60,000 employees in 42 countries, Mr. Baldwin was remembered by old colleagues as a man of rough edges and driven energy, awkwardly misplaced among the Ivy Leaguers but the savior of a proud institution.\u201cTo the last, Baldwin remained hypercompetitive and bent on having his way,\u201d Mr. Chernow wrote in his history of the House of Morgan. \u201cYet for all his flaws, the tough, tactless Baldwin had emerged as the most important person in modern Morgan Stanley history, giving the firm the market skills to compete in a world no longer based on old-school ties.\u201dAn earlier version of this obituary misstated the year of Mr. Baldwin\u2019s marriage to Dorothy Tobin Ayres. It was 1981, not 1961.Sam Roberts contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When China Stumbles", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "Supported bySo, will China\u2019s problems cause a global crisis? The good news is that the numbers, as I read them, don\u2019t seem big enough. The bad news is that I could be wrong, because global contagion often seems to end up being worse than hard numbers say it should. And the worse news is that if China does deliver a bad shock to the rest of the world, we are remarkably unready to deal with the consequences.For those just starting to pay attention: It has been obvious for a while that China\u2019s economy is in big trouble. How big is hard to say, because nobody believes official Chinese statistics.The basic problem is that China\u2019s economic model, which involves very high saving and very low consumption, was only sustainable as long as the country could grow extremely fast, justifying high investment. This in turn was possible when China had vast reserves of underemployed rural labor. But that\u2019s no longer true, and China now faces the tricky task of transitioning to much lower growth without stumbling into recession.A reasonable strategy would have been to buy time with credit expansion and infrastructure spending while reforming the economy in ways that put more purchasing power into families\u2019 hands. Unfortunately, China pursued only the first half of that strategy, buying time and then squandering it. The result has been rapidly rising debt, much of it owed to poorly regulated \u201cshadow banks,\u201d and a threat of financial meltdown.What about financial linkages? One reason America\u2019s subprime crisis turned global in 2008 was that foreigners in general, and European banks in particular, turned out to be badly exposed to losses on U.S. securities. But China has capital controls \u2014 that is, it isn\u2019t very open to foreign investors \u2014 so there\u2019s very little direct spillover from plunging stocks or even domestic debt defaults.All of this says that while China itself is in big trouble, the consequences for the rest of us should be manageable. But I have to admit that I\u2019m not as relaxed about this as the above analysis says I should be. If you like, I lack the courage of my complacency. Why?Part of the answer is that business cycles across nations often seem to be more synchronized than they \u201cshould\u201d be. For example, Europe and the United States export to each other only a small fraction of what they produce, yet they often have recessions and recoveries at the same time. Financial linkages may be part of the story, but one also suspects that there is psychological contagion: Good or bad news in one major economy affects animal spirits in others.So I worry that China may export its woes in ways back-of-the-envelope calculations miss, that the Middle Kingdom\u2019s troubles will one way or another have the effect of depressing investment spending in America and Europe as well as in other emerging markets. And if my worries come true, we are woefully unready to deal with the shock.After all, who would respond to a China shock, and how? Monetary policy would probably be of little help. With interest rates still close to zero and inflation still below target, the Fed would have limited ability to fight an economic downdraft in any case, and it has probably reduced its effectiveness further by signaling its eagerness to raise rates at the first excuse. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank is already pushing to the limits of its political mandate in its own so far unsuccessful effort to raise inflation.And while fiscal policy \u2014 essentially, spending more to offset the effects of China spending less \u2014 would surely work, how many people believe that Republicans would be receptive to a new Obama stimulus plan, or that German politicians would look kindly on a proposal for bigger deficits in Europe?Now, my best guess is still that things won\u2019t be that bad \u2014 nasty in China, but just a bit of turbulence elsewhere. And I really, really hope that guess is right, because we don\u2019t seem to have a plan B anywhere in sight.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "During Market Turmoil, Just Listen to Your Financial Plan", "Date": "2016-01-25", "News": "Supported bySketch Guy\u201cWhipsawed\u201d is the only word I can come up with to describe this feeling. One day you\u2019re told to sell everything, the next you\u2019re supposed to buy because the market is 11 percent undervalued. What are we left to do?Do we listen to R.B.S. or Goldman Sachs? Or both? Or neither?There are many reasons having a financial plan is valuable, but maybe the most significant is that it can help you understand how to react to this kind of news. As a quick reminder, when I say financial plan, what I mean is that you have clearly articulated your values. You\u2019ve taken a guess at your goals, and you\u2019ve built a reasonable plan to get there. Out of that process should naturally flow an investment plan, which will explain how you divide your money between stocks, bonds and cash in order to give you the greatest likelihood of meeting your goals.Any well-designed financial plan will consider two important realities. First, the market will go up and down, sometimes a lot. Second, we don\u2019t know when the market is going to go up or down, and neither does Goldman or RBS. Any attempt to guess and trade accordingly amounts to something known as market timing. And that unfortunately, is a fool\u2019s errand. Few people have the skill (or is it luck?) to guess right repeatedly, fewer still can predict who the good guessers will be anyway.So Instead of trying to time the market based on someone\u2019s forecast, why not use your financial plan as a touchstone? Every time you\u2019re tempted to follow the advice of someone who sounds really smart, go back to your plan.Remind yourself that it takes into account the fact that the markets are going to go up and down. It reflects some reasonable assumptions about how markets are going to behave. But, perhaps most important, your financial plan is built upon the understanding that there are going to be good years and bad years, and that nobody can predict what kind of year the coming one will be.By having (and using) your financial plan, you get to let go of all the anxiety that can come from listening to these forecasts. Sure, you can listen to them if you want. But tune in for entertainment, instead of advice. Think of these forecasters like circus clowns. They are perfectly harmless over in the corner trying to attract attention, juggling flaming bowling pins. As long as you don\u2019t try to join them, you won\u2019t get burned when the pins drop.

Interfax, a nongovernment news agency, reported that the central bank held an emergency meeting Thursday evening with Russian bankers.A main stock market index, the dollar-denominated RTS, recovered from an early decline to close up by 0.6 percent for the day. But it is still just above its post-2008-crisis low, and not much higher than in the late 1990s, indicating the severity of the retreat of Russia\u2019s market.Another benchmark index, the Micex \u2014 which is denominated in rubles \u2014 was up 2.9 percent for the day.Aleksei L. Kudrin, a former finance minister, said at the World Economic Forum on Thursday that Russia should brace for oil\u2019s bottoming out at $16 to $18 a barrel for a short period this year.\u201cThe price will, of course, correct and rise,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly, there is a shock. But in a year or two the economy will pull through to positive growth.\u201dOil prices are nearing a level that could be catastrophic for Russia\u2019s budget, analysts say, given that the government cannot tax oil companies more than the cost of producing oil in Siberia.The production cost in Russia is estimated to average about $15 a barrel. With roughly half of Russia\u2019s budget derived from taxes on oil and natural gas, a sustained drop in oil prices to the levels Mr. Kudrin predicted would compel tax increases or a budget reduction known as a sequester, forcing salary cuts for teachers, soldiers and police officers, and lower pensions.Futures contracts for Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, traded below $28 on Wednesday, but were back in the $30 range on Thursday.In another reflection of the severity of the oil-price shock for Russia, the government is considering canceling a five-year-old social security program. It had deducted contributions from wages to build up funds for future retirees. The government plan would shift to financing pensions from current taxes, the daily newspaper Kommersant reported, even though demographic changes mean more workers will retire in future years.Also on Thursday, the Russian central bank revoked the banking licenses of three lenders \u2014 Vneshprombank, Miraf-Bank and Turbobank \u2014 that had become insolvent.Advertisement"}

And simplistic trading strategies relying on the momentum of currencies and the \u201ccarry trade,\u201d of borrowing money in a currency with low interest rates and investing it in a currency with a higher rate, outperformed his more judgment-driven choices, at least during the 1920s.\u201cIn many cases he called currencies right in terms of direction,\u201d Mr. Chambers said. \u201cBut his great frustration was how to time a trading position.

You can lose a lot of money having the right idea at the wrong time.\u201cKeynes\u2019s experience shows how difficult currency speculation is,\u201d Mr. Chambers said. \u201cHe was trading his own money and he understood what he was doing. He was able to absorb losses.

{"Headline": "The Timeshare Hard Sell Comes Roaring Back", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "Supported byFor more than 25 years, Mary Ann Gutierrez, 77, has spent several weeks a year at on the southern shore of Lake Tahoe, Calif., often playing host to her children and grandchildren at one of two timeshare units she owns.When she checked into one of the properties last year, she was stopped at the front desk. A $100 gift card would be hers if she attended a presentation by Diamond Resorts International, the company that owns the resort. But first she had to fill out some papers and supply her credit card information.The gift card came with a cost, as Ms. Gutierrez soon learned. For five hours, she said, Diamond representatives pushed her to give up both of her timeshare deeds, including one at the nearby Tahoe Beach & Ski Club, a resort that Diamond does not own. With the upgrade and membership in Diamond\u2019s ownership points system, they said, she would keep her maintenance costs low and could use her points at other resorts in the company\u2019s network. It would cost just $30,000 upfront, they said.Even when representatives suggested her maintenance fees would rise if she didn\u2019t switch, Ms. Gutierrez kept declining, saying that the cost was too high. Undeterred, the Diamond representatives suggested that she ask her children to pay for the upgrade. She continued to say no and, at last, they let her go.\u201cThey weren\u2019t going to let me out that door,\u201d Ms. Gutierrez said. \u201cI was shaking, I was so nervous.\u201dThe feeling turned to shock, however, when a Diamond representative handed her a record of a voided charge in the amount of $4,840 on her credit card. The representatives had been so certain that she would agree to the offer that they had charged her card for the down payment \u2014 even though she had not given approval.After crashing in the financial collapse, timeshare sales are rising again, and with them high-pressure sales practices such as those Ms. Gutierrez described. Perhaps acknowledging these problems, some in the industry have cautioned in recent months that regulators from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau could increase their oversight. New rules would affect all operators, including big players like Diamond, Interval Leisure Group, Marriott Vacations Worldwide and Wyndham Worldwide. But tighter regulation might have an especially big impact on Diamond, because its business is devoted solely to timeshare sales and management.Interviews with timeshare owners, lawyers and other specialists in the arena, moreover, suggest that Diamond\u2019s sales practices can be especially forceful.\u201cIn my experience, Diamond is much more ambitious, aggressive and downright nasty in their sales presentations compared to Marriott and Westin,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cDiamond just has an amazing reputation of being tough on people.\u201dDavid F. Palmer, Diamond\u2019s chief executive, sees its sales methods in a very different light. In an interview, Mr. Palmer described how Diamond tries to bring fun to its customer interactions, both before an initial sale and once a member buys in. \u201cThe industry didn\u2019t quite realize that you have to engage and create intimacy and pervasiveness with somebody that you don\u2019t really know,\u201d he said. \u201cOur lifetime subscription model creates a series of systems where you can track that engagement and make sure you are constantly providing a series of experiences that exceed their expectations over many, many years.\u201dNeither Mr. Palmer nor the company\u2019s spokeswoman would discuss Ms. Gutierrez\u2019s experience. But on the topic of high-pressure sales tactics, Mr. Palmer said, \u201cI have belligerently zero tolerance for anyone who goes off script.\u201dDiamond has had great success in the industry. In less than 10 years, the company\u2019s revenue reached $845 million last year, more than double the 2010 figure. Its average timeshare transaction price was $21,700 last year, up from $12,510 in 2012.But while Diamond\u2019s growth has benefited its executives \u2014 Mr. Palmer received a total of $19 million in compensation in the most recent two years for which figures are available \u2014 the company\u2019s business practices seem to have alienated some customers.In lawsuits and in interviews, customers complain not only of high-pressure sales, but also of sky-high maintenance fees and frustration at procedures that block club members from taking vacations where and when they want. Perhaps most distressing to owners is the fact that once you buy into a timeshare it is almost impossible to get out.Larry Vicks, a retired engineer in upstate New York, is a disgruntled Diamond resort member who read the transcript of a Diamond conference call with Wall Street analysts and investors. \u201cIt made me laugh how they are making boatloads of money,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe reason I\u2019m laughing is that it\u2019s all at my expense.\u201dIn the early years of timeshares, owners received deeds specifying their ownership. Now, the industry has moved to a system where buyers receive a certain number of points they can use for time and amenities, rather than a deed.Many timeshare buyers say they like being assured time at a resort they enjoy without the hassle of owning a second home. Using their points for a vacation at a different location managed by their timeshare company is another potential benefit.Diamond, which was created in 2007 by Stephen J. Cloobeck, a veteran of the vacation ownership industry, has its headquarters in Las Vegas. The company operates 99 resorts worldwide and has associations with an additional 255 resorts and four cruise itineraries that it says its members can use. The company\u2019s tagline: \u201cWe Love to Say Yes.\u201dBut two lawsuits filed against Diamond suggest a less solicitous attitude, one that reflects the experience of Ms. Gutierrez in Lake Tahoe. One case was filed in October 2014 in California. In it, 11 timeshare owners said they had agreed to pay to upgrade their membership in the Diamond resorts. After the upgrade, the lawsuit says, the members were unable to use the resorts they had hoped to and their maintenance fees rose even though Diamond\u2019s representatives had told them they would fall.A Florida lawsuit filed in March 2015 said that Diamond tried to pressure the plaintiffs to upgrade to what amounted to \u201cprograms to fleece more and more money out of the plaintiffs.\u201dThe two suits seek cancellation of the contracts, money back and unspecified damages.Diamond declined to comment on the California case; it said that the litigants in the Florida suit \u201cnever made a purchase from Diamond\u201d but were owners in a resort company it had purchased without assuming such liabilities.Not all of Diamond\u2019s customers are unhappy, of course. Six members whose names were supplied by Diamond were all complimentary.Walter Hunter, a retired chemist who lives in Fort Collins, Colo., is one. A member of the homeowners\u2019 association board at Daytona Beach Regency, a Diamond resort in Florida, Mr. Hunter, 94, said in an interview that he was happy with the company\u2019s management. With Diamond, \u201cwe\u2019ve been more pleased, the resort is better managed,\u201d he said. Although he acknowledged that maintenance costs rose significantly after Diamond came in, he said, \u201cWe are convinced that they are doing a good job.\u201dOwners of timeshares in desirable resorts with unusual attributes, like a private beach, can often sell their ownership interests on the secondary market. But in areas glutted with condos for sale or rent, selling a timeshare can be almost impossible. In these cases, timeshare ownership can become an almost perpetual liability.Rub\u00e9n Pe\u00f1a\u2019s experience is a case in point. An engineering consultant with Pro Data Inc. in Jersey City, Mr. Pe\u00f1a has never been inside the Las Vegas timeshare he bought 15 years ago. After spending roughly $42,000 to buy and maintain the property over those years, Mr. Pe\u00f1a stopped paying his loan, which had an original interest rate approaching 17 percent, and maintenance fees. He bought the timeshare from a company called Pacific Monarch Resorts, which went bankrupt. Diamond now owns and manages the resort.\u201cI wanted to deed back the property to Diamond and get my equity of about $27,000 out,\u201d Mr. Pe\u00f1a said in an interview. \u201cBut I got no response whatsoever.\u201dBefore he stopped paying his loan in 2014, Mr. Pe\u00f1a was being charged $3,262 a year in interest, taxes and maintenance fees for his ownership interest in the timeshare. Expedia.com offers a week at the propertyfor, at most, a little over $2,000.Diamond declined to comment on Mr. Pe\u00f1a. But the company said that one reason it doesn\u2019t buy back members\u2019 stakes is that it would create accounting problems related to how Diamond had booked the revenue.Don Nelms is a Diamond member and longtime owner of an insurance agency in Sedona, Ariz. In an interview at the company\u2019s suggestion, he said that he was pleased with Diamond\u2019s resort management. But he added that he was troubled by the company\u2019s refusal to buy back timeshare holdings from customers who can no longer afford them or just want out. Acknowledging that this practice is industrywide, he said changing it would be an \u201cowner-friendly\u201d move by Diamond.\u201cIf it\u2019s paid-up on the principal, they could purchase that from an owner at maybe a reduced market value that helps the person who wants to say goodbye,\u201d he said. Not making that effort, he added, \u201ccould be something that blows up in their face.\u201dCompanies like Diamond benefit from the lack of an organized buyers\u2019 market for timeshares. The company\u2019s most recent annual financial filing noted that if such a market \u201cwere to become more organized and liquid,\u201d the resulting availability of vacation units \u201ccould adversely affect our sales and our sales prices.\u201dAnd even if an owner defaults and walks away from maintenance fees, Diamond can prosper. It simply repossesses the unit at little cost and tries to resell.An official at the bureau declined to comment on the industry.Aggressive sales tactics are among the most common complaints. Typically, potential timeshare buyers are invited to a free or low-cost mini-vacation at a resort if they agree to attend a sales presentation during their stay. Participants say fast-talking, commission-paid sales representatives often run these events, emphasizing the merits of timeshares as investments and downplaying their shortcomings.Customers are told the meetings will last less than two hours, but they often go on far longer, and participants find it difficult to leave.Speaking about the industry generally, Mr. Finn said that buyers are often led to believe they are making a real estate deal and that their holding will have a value that they can recoup in a resale or pass on to their children.\u201cNothing can be further from the truth,\u201d Mr. Finn said.In November, Diamond said that over the last 12 months it had conducted about 221,000 tours at its 53 sales offices around the world. The company says that 15.1 percent of tours result in sales.Diamond says its innovative programs \u201cinfuse hospitality into our sales and marketing efforts.\u201d Its \u201cEvents of a Lifetime\u201d include golf outings with a professional, spring training with Reggie Jackson, the baseball Hall of Famer, or tickets to a show near a Diamond-owned resort.In the interview, Mr. Palmer said he was proud that roughly 60 percent of the company\u2019s sales came from existing customers. \u201cI wear it like a badge of honor,\u201d he said. \u201cThese people bought from us, and they want to own more.\u201dIn addition, he noted, sales are regulated by state authorities. \u201cNo one stumbles into a purchase here,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have five to 10 days to think about it.\u201dBut even fans of Diamond recognize that accusations of high-pressure sales tactics in the industry can be problematic for property managers. \u201cThere\u2019s some natural tension between management who wants to create the best experience possible, and the sales organization \u2014 they are motivated to want different things,\u201d said Terry Timm, a Diamond timeshare owner who is chief administrative officer of Thrivent, a financial services company. \u201cThe way timeshare sales are structured have really really incentivized the wrong things.\u201dDiamond often buys resorts that have fallen into bankruptcy, acquiring timeshare owners as part of the deals. After Diamond takes over a resort, it usually becomes the management company and often raises maintenance fees.Some of these increases reflect the costs of necessary improvements at resorts that have fallen on hard times. But Diamond members who are critical of the company say that it typically gains control of the resort\u2019s governing board, known as the homeowners\u2019 association, giving timeshare owners little say in how money is spent.Owners at some resorts are wary about ceding any board control to Diamond. Jacob Bercu, is a retired Silicon Valley software engineer and longtime resort owner at Tahoe Beach & Ski. A few years ago, some of the resort\u2019s roughly 7,000 owners noticed that Diamond was buying up defaulted timeshare segments at county tax auctions. Last September he won a board seat sought by a Diamond representative. \u201cWe took aggressive action to keep them away from the ownership, to convince our owners not to sell out and, instead, to vote for us so we keep control,\u201d Mr. Bercu said.Timeshare owners of the Grand Beach Resort, a 192-unit property in Orlando, Fla., on the other hand, learned in a letter in September that their annual maintenance fee would rise 14.9 percent this year. Management fees paid by the resort members, the letter said, are expected to jump to a total of $1.15 million from about $366,000 in 2015.Diamond said the increases at Grand Beach resulted from a new management contract, consistent with the company\u2019s deals elsewhere, and higher operating costs and reserves for renovations.The chief beneficiary of these cost increases is Diamond, which levies management fees at the properties it owns and operates. Diamond tells investors that it typically reaps a fee equal to as much as 15 percent more than the costs of running a resort: labor, utilities, taxes and other overhead, including the reserve funds kept for emergencies.\u201cAnything that is put in the budget that gets expended on an annual basis, we get our 15 percent fee,\u201d Mr. Palmer explained to investors at a September 2014 conference, according to a transcript. \u201cThat is basically a 100 percent profit business.\u201dIn the interview, Mr. Palmer added that the company was completely transparent with owners about its charges. \u201cAll the costs are disclosed on a private website,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are no hidden fees.\u201dDiamond\u2019s founder, Mr. Cloobeck, is something of a celebrity.This compensation disturbs owners faced with rising maintenance costs extracted by Diamond. Among them is Eleanor Varkel, a caterer from South Africa who has two of the company\u2019s timeshares, one in Las Vegas and another in Hawaii. Both were taken over by Diamond after the companies operating the resorts collapsed.\u201cEvery year the maintenance fees go up, up, up,\u201d Ms. Varkel said in an interview. \u201cWe were paying $300 a year in maintenance 15 years ago, and now it\u2019s gone up to $2,000 a year.\u201d Ms. Varkel said she had tried, unsuccessfully, to sell her ownership stake either to Diamond or elsewhere. \u201cYou can\u2019t give it away, not even to charity.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the number of resorts operated by Diamond. It is 99 resorts, not 93.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Year Junk Bonds Lived Up to Their Name", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byInvestors chasing high yields have been battling high anxiety.Many of the woes of the junk-bond sector are a result of the steep dive in commodity prices.The North American shale rush was financed largely with junk bonds. According to MarketAxess, high-yield bonds issued by gas and oil companies grew to more than $250 billion last year from $95 billion in 2012. Yet with the price of oil 65 percent below its 2012 peak, many energy companies now find themselves in a cash-flow pinch. Energy companies that defaulted on debt in 2015 include SandRidge Energy, Halc\u00f3n Resources, Quicksilver Resources and Walter Energy.Plenty of others are in rough shape. For example, some bonds issued by Chesapeake Energy, a natural gas and oil exploration and production company, fell more than 70 percent in 2015.S&P Dow Jones Indices tracks \u201cdistressed\u201d high-yield corporate bonds. By its definition, a bond that yields at least 1,000 basis points (10 percentage points) more than a Treasury issue with a comparable maturity earns a spot in the distressed heap. About 15 percent of the $1.6 trillion high-yield United States bond market is distressed right now. Thirteen commodity-related industries account for nearly 40 percent of the distressed market, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices; the rest is spread among more than 85 industries.Unless a sharp rally in commodity prices provides relief for energy and mining companies, there is likely to be more bloodletting in the high-yield world. Moody\u2019s Investors Service expects the 3.4 percent default rate for domestic junk bonds at the end of last year to rise to 4.1 percent by late this year. The pain is expected to be highly concentrated: The default rate is expected to rise to near 7 percent for metals and mining issuers and more than 5 percent for bonds issued by oil and gas companies.Gershon Distenfeld, director of high yield at AllianceBernstein, points out that falling commodity prices are a boon for companies that use them \u2014 as well as for consumers, who drive about two-thirds of the domestic economy. Moreover, the broad sell-off in junk bonds over the last 18 months has made the high-yield bond market more compelling.That sell-off was painful, of course. An index of high-yield bonds that yielded 5 percent before commodities collapsed was at 8.75 percent at the end of 2015. If you owned junk during that climb, you felt the pain. That is because bond prices fall when yields rise, and a fund\u2019s total return is the sum of the yield plus the changes in the price of the bond. The negative returns of late reflect the fact that the income payouts were not enough to offset the decline in bond prices.But those past declines may help now. \u201cOdds are that high yield will do better going forward given where yields are now,\u201d Mr. Distenfeld said. He added that a \u201cpretty good guide\u201d for forward annualized returns over a four- or five-year rolling period was the yield at the beginning of the period. That is more than 8 percent now.Just do not expect anything resembling a smooth ride. The Fed has signaled its belief that a still-weak economy is at last strong enough to merit lifting interest rates off the zero level in place since the financial crisis. But with that less-than-robust backdrop, every bit of disappointing economic data could set off an outsize investor reaction. And if recession chatter picks up meaningfully, losses in high-yield bonds could be big. Case in point: The average junk fund lost more than 25 percent in 2008.One indication that the high-yield market is dicey comes from actively managed high-grade core bond funds, which typically have the freedom to invest 10 to 20 percent or so of their assets in high-yield issues. It makes sense to do so when they surmise they are getting a big enough yield payoff to compensate them for the risk. (Core index funds do not own junk bonds.)But these funds are holding back. According to Morningstar, the average actively managed core bond fund holds less than 10 percent of assets in issues rated below investment grade, and that includes investments in low-rated mortgage- and asset-backed securities. The two largest actively managed core bond funds, Pimco Total Return and Metropolitan West Total Return, have little to no exposure to high-yield corporate bonds.The third-largest active bond fund, DoubleLine Total Return, has never trafficked in high-yield corporate bonds (it does own lower-rated mortgage- and asset-backed issues), and the DoubleLine Core Fixed Income Fund has just 5.3 percent of its assets invested in high-yield corporate bonds and bank loans. \u201cJust because it is cheap doesn\u2019t mean it is a deal,\u201d said Bonnie Baha, head of DoubleLine\u2019s Global Developed Credit Group. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on slowing U.S. growth, slow global growth and the fact that the Fed can\u2019t justify raising rates based on fundamentals,\u201d Ms. Baha said.Given the evident risks, now is a time to play it as safe as possible within the junk world.That starts with the quality of the bonds a fund owns. The bond rating scale starts at AAA for the high-quality issues, and then continues to AA, A, BBB, BB, B, all the way to C and unrated. Any bond rated below BBB is considered high yield. Junk bonds rated BB and B are the most solid part of the high-yield market. Once you get into the C range, you\u2019re not trawling just among the riskiest companies, but among bond issues that are the hardest to trade in volatile times.Those trading difficulties are what brought down Third Avenue Focused Credit Fund, a high-yield portfolio that specialized in distressed debt, which it bought with the expectation that it would rebound in value, sooner or later. But nearly 90 percent of the portfolio was in issues rated CCC and lower. When investor redemption requests increased, the fund\u2019s managers decided to shutter it rather than be forced to promptly meet redemptions by selling bonds at fire-sale prices. Dan Gagnier, a spokesman for Third Avenue, said there was no timetable for how long it would take the fund to liquidate and make final payments to shareholders. With a loss of more than 40 percent since the middle of 2014, many shareholders are facing net losses.Sarah Bush, a bond fund analyst at Morningstar, said the emphasis on distressed issues made Third Avenue Focused Credit an extreme outlier, and she did not expect there to be similar implosions among other junk funds. \u201cMost junk funds focus on BB- and B-rated debt,\u201d she said, \u201cbut Third Ave. explicitly invested in much lower-quality issues from firms that were known to already be in trouble.\u201dIn fact, the average high-yield mutual fund has about 17 percent of its assets in bonds rated CCC or lower. That is about what the SPDR Barclays High Yield Bond E.T.F. holds. The iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond E.T.F. has about 10 percent invested below B.Anthony Valeri, fixed-income strategist at LPL Financial, said that index funds, which are required to track the market even when it includes very risky constituents, may be at a disadvantage when it comes to junk bonds now. \u201cWe recommend investors seek out actively managed high-yield mutual funds, where the manager can avoid the land mines,\u201d he said.The actively managed Vanguard High-Yield Corporate Fund recently had less than 6 percent invested in issues rated below B. Last year it lost 1.4 percent. That may not seem like anything to boast about, but passively managed competitors did worse: The SPDR E.T.F. lost more than 7 percent, and the iShares E.T.F. lost more than 5.5 percent.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stocks Slide as Worries Persist Over Global Growth", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported byHopes for a recovery in the United States stock market were dashed on Wednesday as investors\u2019 deepening fears about the strength of the world\u2019s largest economies drove another wave of selling.The 2.5 percent slide in the market\u2019s main benchmark, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, was the worst so far this year, and came after two days of slight gains that had suggested some confidence was returning after a rocky start to the year. The index is now in what Wall Street calls a correction: a decline of 10 percent or more from its most recent high.The market decline indicates that investors still see plenty of risks lurking, many of them stemming from China\u2019s slowing economy. The persistent weakness in the price of oil is another market indicator that has raised questions about global growth.The United States economy has been showing some signs of steady growth. But investors are concerned that problems in China\u2019s economy, and the stress that creates for other countries, could unleash forces that ultimately weigh on the United States.\u201cWhen you change perceptions for the growth rate of the third-largest economic region in the world,\u201d said Jim Vogel, interest rates strategist at FTN Financial, \u201cyou have to reprice across all financial markets to account for that slowing growth.\u201dThe last time stocks slid into a correction was in August, when a small but surprising devaluation of China\u2019s currency rattled investors.Stocks rallied after the summer rout, as a recovery in Europe appeared to take hold and the Chinese currency steadied. As the year closed, most Wall Street analysts released mildly optimistic forecasts for the stock market in 2016.But it didn\u2019t take long for the fear to return.One of the headwinds that investors now face is higher interest rates in the United States. The Federal Reserve in December raised interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. Higher rates can tighten financial conditions in markets and push the dollar up against other currencies, which can in turn make it harder for United States companies to compete.Some economists, fearing that the markets are giving an early signal of a slowdown, may now call on the Fed to hold off on any further interest rate increases.And China is again unsettling investors. Figures show that capital is continuing to rush out of the country, a phenomenon that can add downward pressure to its currency, the renminbi.One of the ways that China\u2019s slowing can hurt the United State is through energy prices. As China has less demand for commodities, their prices have fallen. Oil-producing countries have continued to oversupply the markets with cheap crude.Lower oil prices lead to cheaper gasoline prices, which can prompt consumers to increase their spending on other goods and services, usually a fillip for the wider economy. But lower energy prices are hurting the United States companies that produce oil and gas.Energy stocks generally performed poorly on Wednesday. The Williams Companies tumbled 17.7 percent, while ConocoPhillips closed down more than 3 percent.Some of the fiercest selling took place in technology stocks that did extremely well in 2015. Netflix, for instance, plummeted 8.6 percent on Wednesday. Amazon declined 5.8 percent. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index ended down 3.4 percent.Stocks of consumer companies whose products or services are considered nonessential were among the hardest hit on Wednesday. Shares of the hotel chain Marriott closed down 6.3 percent, while Royal Caribbean Cruises ended down 5.3 percent.The market decline has been broad and even some of Wall Street\u2019s most successful and sophisticated investors have not been spared the downturn. William A. Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square Holdings, for example, has already lost 11.4 percent through Jan. 12In this fraught environment, investors are looking for any early clues on how the global economy is performing. They are now scouring the fourth-quarter earnings of large companies, which are starting to come out.\u201cThe low gas prices, the low commodity prices, the strength of the dollar \u2014 all three of those together are really pushing,\u201d he said.Investors will most likely listen carefully to the earnings calls of the large banks, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo included, that will report results on Thursday and Friday.Since the financial crisis of 2008, the major banks have built up buffers that help them withstand turbulent markets. But their earnings are always vulnerable if consumers and companies demand fewer loans and struggle to pay back existing ones. Senior bank executives most likely will be called upon to give their impressions of financial conditions.If the stock market continues to fall and deplete households\u2019 savings, consumers may then pull back on their spending, which can weigh on the economy. Already this year, the value of the companies in the S.&P. 500 has fallen by $1.3 trillion, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.Still, the selling may pass. Many Wall Street analysts say there are reasons a bear market \u2014 a decline of more than 20 percent from a high \u2014 will not occur. Stocks, they say, aren\u2019t wildly overvalued. Jobs growth in the United States is starting to create competition for hiring, which could push up wages, giving consumers more money to spend. Europe appears to have stabilized.But few analysts are expecting a big bounce in the stock market. Investors may now have to get used to lower returns from stocks, after several years of strong gains.\u201cWe believe this year is going to look very much like 2001, 2002,\u201d said Mark Yusko, the chief investment officer at Morgan Creek Capital Management. \u201cPeople forget the markets basically went down for 30 months and the economy slowed and eventually went into a mini-recession.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the decline in the Dow. It closed down 9.9 percent on Wednesday from its most recent high, not 10 percent or more, which would have put it in correction territory.Stanley Reed and Alexandra Stevenson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "6 Tips for Investors When the Stock Market Tumbles", "Date": "2016-01-07", "News": "Advertisement\nThe impulse when the stock market falls hard for a few days in a row is to do something. Anything. Our life savings are often on the line, after all. But that\u2019s the idea: Stocks are most useful for long-term goals. So unless those goals have changed in the last few days, it probably doesn\u2019t make much sense to overhaul an investment strategy based on a blip of market activity.Consider the following points.If you were in stocks from 2009 to 2015, or in the 1990s or consistently since the early 1980s, you are most likely a big winner. It\u2019s generally a bad idea to look at your investment statements too often, but take a quick peek at your long-term performance. That outsize gain you see is one reason you were in stocks in the first place. Plenty of research shows that if you miss just a few days of the market\u2019s biggest gains, your long-term portfolio will suffer badly. If you decide to put a lot of your money in cash right now, how will you know when to get back in the market? You\u2019ll probably be looking for a sign, and that sign will be the rebound days on which you missed out. At some time in the past, when you were not scared, you made a decision to construct your portfolio a certain way. You knew that stocks involved risk and that the returns they have traditionally delivered, above and beyond what cash and bonds do, was the reward for your persistence. Nothing about recent market events suggests that the fundamentals of capitalism have changed. So neither should your confidence in very long-term ownership of the pieces of the for-profit enterprises that benefit from your fortitude.Too many 70-year-olds sold all of their stocks in 2009 and are healthy enough to live to 100. They would be going on a lot more vacations now and be worrying less about long-term care if they had held firm. Worried about a 529 college savings plan for a 12-year-old? Let\u2019s hope you weren\u2019t 100 percent in stocks with six years to go before needing money for tuition. Still, you have at least nine years for a portion of that portfolio to recover from any sustained downturn.Maybe you are one of them. But try to give this more time, and consider the alternatives. There are few investments that can deliver the kinds of returns that stocks can without their own accompanying anxiety. An alternative is to save a lot more in safer investments like cash or certain bonds. Most people don\u2019t have enough income to do that easily, so settling for lower returns will mean a combination of working longer and living modestly. For some people, that is a fine trade-off. There is absolutely nothing abnormal about what is going on here. Most of us have to save somewhere, and history suggests that stocks are the most accessible route to getting the returns you will need to retire someday. It would take decades of systemic economic erosion to prove otherwise, and a few days of market declines do not suggest that anything like that is upon us.Advertisement"}

For companies like Square and Twitter, which no one would accuse of doing extraordinarily well, 2016 has been even tougher. And for Jack Dorsey, the chief executive of both companies, recent stock drops have resulted in paper losses that have pushed him out of the billionaire\u2019s club.Twitter dropped dramatically Wednesday morning, only to spike dramatically around midday \u2014 thanks to what some reports said was a single, large transaction \u2014 and to close up 4.1 percent for the day. The company\u2019s share price is still down 25 percent this year.Square had an equally odd day on Wall Street. It fell below its $9-a-share I.P.O. before recovering. For the year, Square\u2019s stock price is down 28 percent.In fairness to Mr. Dorsey, despite outsize expectations from some on Wall Street, few have been as blunt regarding Twitter\u2019s challenges since he returned to the San Francisco company\u2019s chief executive office over the summer. In fact, his first few months on the job looked more like a resetting of expectations than a dramatic turnaround.

The continuing sabotage of the Libyan oil industry was another blow to the prospects that Libya, North Africa\u2019s primary oil producer, can reverse sagging exports.Adding to the uncertainty, Saudi Arabia and Iran continued their saber-rattling in the Persian Gulf, threatening a spread of hostilities in Iraq, Bahrain and other countries with deep sectarian divides.But traders shrugged off the geopolitical risks and looked to the fundamentals of supply and demand.Economic data released in China this week showed slower growth, while the Energy Department reported that gasoline stockpiles last week rose by 10.6 million barrels, the largest weekly amount since 1993, to 232 million barrels. Nationwide oil stocks climbed to a record 2.1 billion barrels, including the strategic petroleum reserve, sending the American benchmark price tumbling to just more than $34.\u201cOversupply will continue to hold down commodity prices in 2016,\u201d said Terry Marshall, a senior vice president at Moody\u2019s. \u201cOPEC and many non-OPEC oil producers continue to produce without restraint as they battle for market share. Increased production has vastly exceeded growth in oil consumption, including from major consumers like China, India and the U.S.\u201dOver the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.A new report by Moody\u2019s Investors Service projected a rise in company defaults and a decline in capital spending of 20 to 25 percent, a drop in investment nearly as large as that last year.Analysts at Moody\u2019s and other consultant firms are predicting that companies will increasingly be forced to sell assets, particularly because a growing number of them are under pressure to meet debt payments and are losing price hedges that buttressed their balance sheets in the last two years of slumping prices.\u201cMounting distress will force more companies to market,\u201d said Luke Parker, corporate analysis research director at Wood Mackenzie, a consultancy. \u201cBalance sheets will become ever more stretched without asset sales to balance the books.\u201dOil executives have been equally downbeat about 2016, especially as it compares with recent years in which producers nearly doubled output as they learned to produce in vast shale fields with hydraulic fracturing that blasted through hard rock with water, sand and chemicals.\u201cWe\u2019re in a capital-constrained world,\u201d Darrell E. Hollek, executive vice president for onshore exploration and production at Anadarko Petroleum, said in a recent interview. \u201cWe won\u2019t have the cash flow with oil and gas prices where they are.\u201dConsumers have benefited, as gas prices have continued to slide. The average price of a gallon of regular gas nationwide fell to slightly less than $2 this week, 4 cents below a month ago and 19 cents below last year, according to the AAA motor club.But the economies of oil-producing states like Texas and North Dakota are slowing. This week, Gov. Bill Walker of Alaska announced a state government hiring freeze, after proposing the state\u2019s first income tax in 35 years.Many of the factors that reduced oil prices by a third in 2015 show no signs of changing. Saudi Arabia, Russia and several other important oil suppliers are producing at record or near-record levels to sustain their income and market share in global markets, particularly China. Iran hopes to export more than 500,000 barrels a day once nuclear sanctions are lifted, probably this year.American oil producers have decommissioned more than half of their rigs, and production growth has been halted since last April when output peaked at nearly 9.6 million barrels a day. But production is not falling fast enough to balance the market.A big reason American production is so resilient is that offshore Gulf of Mexico production continues to recover from the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon disaster and subsequent federal exploration moratorium with new wells continuing to come online. Meanwhile, shale drilling continues to become more efficient.Advertisement"}

Citigroup managed just 6 percent for the three months to December. Wells hit a decent 12.2 percent, but as with rivals, revenue is barely growing. Yet all are doing more business: JPMorgan\u2019s core loans rose 16 percent last year, and credit losses are near record lows.Banks will have very little leeway once debt problems arise. Those seem limited at the moment to the energy sector, with low unemployment and falling oil prices cause for optimism. And if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates again, banks should earn a bit more, though not enough to substantially increase returns.Low or nonexistent growth is nothing new, though.

{"Headline": "A New Economic Era for China Goes Off the Rails", "Date": "2016-01-07", "News": "Supported byA stock market plunge last summer, and a messy currency devaluation that followed, had faded from global view. In the relative calm, he seemed to usher in a new era of economic management, promising policy coordination at the highest levels to prevent another bout of turmoil.Less than three weeks later, his plans have been derailed as China\u2019s stock market and currency once again rattle investors around the world. The latest rout sets up a challenge for Mr. Xi, who has positioned himself as the master of the country\u2019s economy.At every turn, the president\u2019s efforts to manage the economy, market and currency have been undercut by global headwinds and haphazard policy making. Three initiatives this week, involving currency depreciation and two sets of stock market rules, have been particularly discordant. All three were hastily suspended after China\u2019s stock market plunged on Thursday morning.He also cannot move forward on the bolder actions needed to head off a more serious economic slump, such as forcing hopelessly indebted state-owned enterprises to stop borrowing money and shut down. Otherwise, he risks further eroding short-term confidence and growth, which have depended heavily on this borrow-and-spend mentality, and mass layoffs could follow.Mr. Xi\u2019s options are also more limited than in the past. He and his aides engineered the elevation of the renminbi to the ranks of the world\u2019s leading currencies, a status bestowed by the International Monetary Fund in November. But in doing so, he gave up some control, allowing market forces to play a bigger role.In the last couple of years, China had begun allowing, even encouraging, companies and people to invest more of their wealth overseas. Doing so helped reduce deflationary pressures at home from chronic overinvestment and overcapacity, and increased China\u2019s influence around the world.But a trickle of money leaving China to buy houses and other overseas investments has become a flood this winter. The central bank has responded by trying for the last three weeks to slowly guide the currency down as a way to help bolster exports and also make overseas investments seem more expensive and less appealing.The result has been chaotic. With the renminbi worth less by the day in the international markets, Chinese families and companies worry that their renminbi wealth will buy less tomorrow, spurring faster capital flight and worsening the currency turmoil.This week, regulators also put in place a so-called circuit breaker for the stock market, a mechanism that halts trading when shares fall too steeply. The new measure, which followed last summer\u2019s market slide, was aimed at stabilizing stocks. But in practice, it has amplified anxiety.Another measure, which banned large shareholders from selling stock, was supposed to expire on Friday. The looming deadline prompted smaller investors to dump shares.\u201cThese very high-level bodies were supposed to coordinate policy, and in this case there really was a failure of coordination,\u201d said Victor Shih, a specialist in Chinese financial policy at the University of California, San Diego.The resulting stress has driven share prices in China down 12 percent so far this week. The fall would have been even steeper if the new rules had not shut down the market repeatedly.In a stark about-face, the Chinese stock market regulator said Thursday night it would suspend the new measure, \u201cin order to preserve market stability.\u201d It is also extending the selling ban for another three months.With circuit breakers repealed on Thursday night and large shareholders told that they would have to wait another three months before they would be allowed to resume selling shares, the Shanghai Composite Index rebounded 1.5 percent on Friday morning.The combination \u2014 a troubled stock market and currency \u2014 has proved worrisome for global investors. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, the main benchmark in the United States, was off 2 percent on Thursday, and European and Asian shares were down broadly.Few analysts had expected such a quick retreat. \u201cRemoving the circuit breakers now means they have to admit they made a mistake,\u201d Hao Hong, the chief strategist at Bank of Communications International, the overseas arm of a big Chinese bank, said earlier in the day.For years, the response to economic weakness has been the same in China: spend, spend, spend.In some way, China is reverting to its old tactics.Over the last few months, the government has cut interest rates and introduced numerous measures to help stimulate growth. The central bank\u2019s response to the latest stock market fall has been to inject more money into the financial system, so that banks can keep lending.In the face of Monday\u2019s tumult, Prime Minister Li Keqiang visited one of the country\u2019s largest and most troubled state-owned steel companies, Taiyuan Iron and Steel Group. There, Mr. Li reassured workers, urging them to \u201crevive your strength and power.\u201dThe strategy, though, risks deeper problems down the road.By not shutting down struggling companies, China is putting off a much-needed shakeout. The country is also piling on debt to keep such businesses on life support.That makes it difficult to discern the underlying health of the economy, and runs counter to Mr. Xi\u2019s tough promise that China will clean up its corporate mess.Mr. Xi also cannot easily ask the central bank to print huge sums of money to bail out the stock market and struggling companies. Doing so now would risk flooding the economy with cash, causing a further decline in China\u2019s currency against the dollar.Some economists see ominous signs of a broader slowing.A quarterly survey of 2,000 Chinese manufacturers and other industrial companies shows that almost none are currently investing in new equipment and factories. \u201cIn the past four quarters, it\u2019s only 2 to 3 percent that are making expansionary investments,\u201d said Gan Jie, the director of the Center on Finance and Economic Growth at the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business in Beijing, who oversees the quarterly survey.Controlling the currency is already a problem. China has found itself in the difficult position of setting the value of the renminbi lower and lower each day, culminating in a fall of 0.51 percent Thursday morning alone. But the central bank tried to halt the renminbi\u2019s slide on Friday morning by fixing it 0.015 percent higher than the day before in mainland trading.China faces a similar steady drip of stock declines.China\u2019s stock markets have tended to be less correlated with the local economy than most countries\u2019 markets. That is because trading tends to be a speculative activity in China, mainly undertaken by retail investors who frequently have a herd instinct.The problem was on full display this week, as the new circuit breaker mechanism kicked in. The rule imposed a cooling-off period, halting trading for 15 minutes when losses reached 5 percent. After trading resumed, the steep slide continued, prompting the markets to close early twice this week when they reached a second circuit breaker of 7 percent.To some analysts, it was unnecessary. China already has a rule that each stock cannot drop more than 10 percent in a day.Even China tacitly admitted it had made a mistake. When the country\u2019s regulator abandoned the policy on Thursday night, it noted in a statement that it had imposed the policy despite having \u201cno experience\u201d in using a circuit breaker.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chinese Markets Rise After Volatile Opening", "Date": "2016-01-07", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 With Beijing\u2019s grip slightly looser, Chinese markets steadied on Friday.Exchanges in Europe also rose modestly at the start, and futures trading indicated that Wall Street would open higher.Trading on Friday followed a decision by the Chinese government to stop using measures known as circuit breakers that were intended to keep China\u2019s markets from dropping disastrously over the course of a single trading day. The circuit-breaker system, used for the first time on Monday and scrapped Thursday night, was tripped twice this week. Those halts, once activity resumed, seemed to spur nervous investors into broader sell-offs.On Friday, shares in both Shanghai and Shenzhen rose despite a shaky opening hour, with sharp drops and rises within minutes of each other.Markets seemed \u201ca little more normal,\u201d said Thomas Gatley, a corporate analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics, a financial research company. Of the seesawing early in the morning, Mr. Gatley said, \u201cWe think that is in part a bunch of mutual funds who couldn\u2019t liquidate the previous day.\u201dChina\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.\u201cThe removal of the circuit breaker has removed that magnet effect that when things were down 3 percent, there was the other risk that everyone got stuck,\u201d Mr. Gatley added.The China Securities Regulatory Commission also extended a ban on sales by major shareholders, which had been set to expire on Friday. Some feared the sell-off was in part prompted when those with smaller holdings sold before the bigger shareholders did.Stocks opened higher on Friday morning in China, but in the early volatility, a quick sell-off within 30 minutes was followed by another increase by midmorning. Shares continued to rise after lunch, and by the close of trading, the CSI 300 blue-chip index was up about 2 percent. The Shanghai composite index finished nearly 2 percent higher, while the Shenzhen composite index, which had been down as much as 4 percent, ended 1.2 percent higher.Hao Hong, the chief market strategist at Bank of Communications International, noted that funds had been forced to sell at the open as investors pulled out their money. He added that it also seemed likely that the so-called national team of state-influenced brokerage firms had been pushed to shore up the markets.On Friday morning, the country\u2019s central bank slightly raised the trading range for the renminbi and strengthened the currency, whose depreciation in the preceding three weeks had stoked concerns among investors. It was set at 6.5636 renminbi to the dollar, compared with 6.5646 on Thursday. It remains near its weakest point since early 2011.\u201cIt certainly helped to stabilize sentiment today,\u201d said Mitul Kotecha, head of Asia foreign exchange and rates strategy for Barclays. \u201cThere were major concerns that China would continue to weaken the fixings.\u201dThe Chinese government has been allowing the value of the renminbi to decline steadily, which could bolster exports and growth. But the movement has also unsettled investors and pushed money out of the country.Although the shift on Friday was slight, it still provided a sense of respite, Mr. Kotecha said.\u201cWhen you have several days of weaker fixings, markets are fearing the worst,\u201d he said. \u201cTo have a break is a calming factor.\u201dThe aftershocks of Thursday\u2019s plunge rippled through global markets. The S.&P. 500 ended the day on Thursday down 2.3 percent, while the Euro Stoxx 50 finished 1.7 percent lower.In the early afternoon on Friday, the Euro Stoxx 50 was flat, and the FTSE 100 in London was up 0.5 percent.Markets were mixed in Asia and Australia. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 finished down almost 0.4 percent. The S.&P./ASX 200 in Australia closed down nearly 0.4 percent after spending most of the day down, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index ended up 0.6 percent.Although the Chinese markets looked a little more stable on Friday, Mr. Gatley, the corporate analyst, said he expected more volatility, noting that valuations were pretty high.\u201cThe other thing you can\u2019t write out is more policy missteps from C.S.R.C. and more anticorruption probes, which are profoundly destabilizing,\u201d he added.Mr. Hong at the Bank of Communications was similarly apprehensive.\u201cWe have a small reprieve,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be jumping for joy. The fundamentals are still weak. Valuations are still high.\u201d\u201cThe stock market is starting to reflect what is really going on in the economy,\u201d he added.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "S.E.C. Is Criticized for Lax Enforcement of Climate Risk Disclosure", "Date": "2016-01-23", "News": "Supported byRevaluedAs recently as 2011, shares in Peabody Energy, the world\u2019s biggest private sector coal company, traded at the equivalent of $1,000. Today, they hover around $4 each. Over that time, investors who held the stock lost millions.Peabody, like other coal companies, has been hammered as cheap natural gas erodes the demand for coal. But concerns about climate change are also an issue for the company as customers and investors turn away from fossil fuels.Peabody saw this coming. Even as the company privately projected that coal demand would slump and prices would fall, it withheld this information from investors. Instead, Peabody said in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it was not possible to know how changing attitudes toward climate change would affect its business.In theory, however, Peabody should have been making such disclosures all along.In 2010, the S.E.C. told companies how it expected them to address the risks posed by climate change in their regular securities filings.Initially, the S.E.C. appeared to put muscle behind its guidance. In the two years after the interpretive guidance, the S.E.C. issued 49 comment letters to companies addressing the adequacy of their climate change disclosures. But it issued only three such letters in 2012 and none in 2013.The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.To advocates of more robust climate change disclosure, the impression was that the S.E.C. had taken its eye off the ball.\u201cThey did back it up in the first few years,\u201d said Jim Coburn, senior manager of investor programs at Ceres, a nonprofit organization that advocates sustainability in business and that has lobbied the S.E.C. on the disclosure. \u201cBut the current chair hasn\u2019t shown much interest in this issue.\u201d\u201cWe are concerned that oil and gas companies are not disclosing sufficient information about several converging factors that, together, will profoundly affect the economics of the industry,\u201d wrote the investors, which included Calpers, the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System; the Connecticut state investment fund; and Calvert Investments.\u201cThe S.E.C. has been underreacting in the extreme,\u201d Senator Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii and one of the lead authors of the letter, said in an interview.At the same time, officials in New York and California are investigating whether Exxon understood the risks posed by climate change decades ago, but withheld that information from investors. Exxon denies the allegations.The investors, comptrollers and lawmakers think that while companies should already be addressing climate change risk as part of their regular disclosures, only a minority are telling shareholders how warming oceans and extreme weather will affect their business.\u201cOur markets work best when investors are provided with the necessary disclosures, and the S.E.C. needs to take action by enforcing the disclosure rules on the books,\u201d Senator Jack Reed, a senior member of the Senate banking committee, said in an emailed statement.The S.E.C. declined to comment for this article. But in a response to Mr. Reed reviewed by The New York Times, Ms. White said her staff members examined the adequacy of climate change disclosures as part of its routine analysis of company filings, and were looking for instances where energy companies, for example, might need to disclose more. According to people briefed on the matter, the S.E.C. has made staff members aware of the Peabody settlement, encouraging them to be more vigilant in reviewing climate change disclosure.In her response to Senator Reed, Ms. White said that since the S.E.C. issued its interpretive guidance, \u201cincrementally\u201d more companies were making disclosures related to climate change. Yet many of these are vague generalizations that give investors little to work with.Chevron, for example, wrote that \u201cincentives to conserve or use alternative energy sources\u201d might reduce demand for its products. Exxon noted that new laws might \u201creduce demand for hydrocarbons.\u201d Neither company made clear to investors what the financial costs might be.Evidence that climate change issues are already affecting big companies continues to mount. In December, on the first full day of trading after negotiators in Paris agreed to limit greenhouse gas emissions, Peabody shares dropped another 13 percent. This month, President Obama announced new limits on coal mining on federal lands. The next day, coal stocks, including Peabody, plunged once more.The S.E.C. is now reviewing what it requires companies to disclose, and it could introduce new rules this year. As part of the public comments process, some groups have suggested that the S.E.C. specify that companies address issues such as climate-related legal proceedings, or so-called stranded assets \u2014 oil and gas reserves that may never be used. But for now, the S.E.C. has no plans to require companies to be more forthcoming than they are now about climate change.At a time of upside-down weather patterns, volatile energy markets and mounting climate-related regulatory action, that is simply not enough for many lawmakers and investors, who worry that companies\u2019 reticence is costing shareholders.\u201cWe\u2019re not asking for anybody to predict the weather or to become climate scientists,\u201d Senator Schatz said. \u201cWe\u2019re simply asking that the S.E.C. acknowledge that there is real risk for companies, and that it ought to be disclosed.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "For E.T.F. Traders, Lessons From the Panic", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byA selling point of exchange-traded funds over traditional mutual funds is that they can be traded at any time during a market session, but when stocks plunged as soon as trading began on Aug. 24 \u2014 that feature of E.T.F.s became a bug.Investors found that while they could continue to trade E.T.F.s, so many shareholders wanted to bail out simultaneously that prices on many funds fell well below the sharply falling values of their underlying stock portfolios.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index dropped as much as 5.3 percent soon after opening that day. Two actively traded E.T.F.s that track that index suffered greater intraday losses: SPDR S.&P. 500 fell 7.8 percent, and Vanguard S.&P. dropped 7.2 percent.Other E.T.F.s were down far more. Guggenheim S.&P. 500 Equal Weight, for example, fell as much as 43 percent, while iShares Select Dividend dropped as much as 35 percent.What happened, fund specialists say, is that many of the constituent stocks in the S.&P. 500 and other indexes could not open during the panic because circuit breakers were activated on the New York Stock Exchange that halted trading in those stocks. The affected issues represented all walks of corporate life, from Ford to CVS to Service Corporation International, the nation\u2019s largest owner of funeral homes.Although halts affected some E.T.F.s that tracked stock indexes, any E.T.F. that continued to trade or had resumed trading used lowball price estimates for any index components that were halted.Post-mortems indicate many of the causes of the problems, but suggest that the short-term solution for many investors may simply be greater wariness.Short-term trading of E.T.F.s has some hidden dangers that may not be remedied immediately. Some problems may stem from the overall markets, some from the structure of E.T.F.s themselves.In a report examining trading on Aug. 24, for example, BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest fund management company and owner of the iShares E.T.F. brand, attributed the outsize declines in stock E.T.F.s partly to a flood of market and stop orders. Market orders are filled at the prevailing price, even during disorderly trading; in stop orders, a stock is sold if the price falls to a level set by the seller.Along with the trading halts that left E.T.F. market makers unable to determine fair prices, these orders \u201cadded to selling pressure and proved especially risky on the morning of Aug. 24,\u201d the BlackRock report said. A report issued by Vanguard highlighted the same culprits.The Securities and Exchange Commission has proposed no new rules nor taken other action in response to the E.T.F. pricing discrepancies. The New York Stock Exchange announced that stop orders on stocks would no longer be accepted beginning on Feb. 26, and it widened the price moves needed to prompt a trading halt.Stop orders were already not allowed on the exchange\u2019s Arca market, where E.T.F.s are listed. But E.T.F.s also trade on other markets, where some brokerage firms execute stop orders on them (they do so by placing a market order when the stop price is hit). The status quo is murky, but maintaining a semblance of it for E.T.F. trading may be the best move for now, some investors say. They worry that any cure will be worse than the affliction.\u201cWhen I look at what took place, it leaves me perplexed,\u201d said Philip Blancato, chief executive of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management, a firm that builds portfolios for financial advisers and rich investors. \u201cIf more safeguards are put in, it may be even harder in a panic situation to trade E.T.F.s. If I\u2019m not able to control my own destiny and get in and out of the market, that\u2019s extremely concerning.\u201dBut he\u2019s not against the idea of certain restrictions, including limiting sales early or late in a trading session through market and stop-loss orders. It might be reasonable, Mr. Blancato said, to limit trading when an E.T.F. moves 1 percent above or below its intrinsic value, or if trading volume reaches a given proportion of the number of shares outstanding.Vanguard anticipates \u201cenhancements to the existing rules\u201d governing trading in general, not E.T.F.s specifically. In its report, it contends essentially that the market failed E.T.F.s rather than the other way around.Todd Rosenbluth, director of fund research at S&P Capital IQ, part of Standard & Poor\u2019s, came to a similar conclusion. \u201cThis is a problem in the market that E.T.F.s got caught up in,\u201d he said. \u201cThey weren\u2019t the cause.\u201dThe BlackRock report recommended several steps to avoid a repeat performance, including greater efforts by exchanges to maintain trading in securities rather than limit E.T.F. trading, and measures to encourage E.T.F. market makers to play a more active role during stressful periods.Mr. Rosenbluth finds such solutions \u201clogical,\u201d but he foresees little substantial change.\u201cI\u2019m not sure anything gets done,\u201d he said. \u201cE.T.F.s are still a small piece of what investors trade, so I don\u2019t think much will change.\u201dThe discounts during the plunge were an egregious example of E.T.F. pricing discrepancies, but hardly the only one. Tim Clift, chief investment strategist at Envestnet/PMC, another firm that uses E.T.F.s to build portfolios for third parties, said that mispricing \u201cis not just an Aug. 24 thing.\u201d Modest deviations from net asset values occur often, he said, especially in funds that invest in less frequently traded niches like high-yield bonds and foreign stocks.High-yield bond E.T.F.s can be particularly problematic, Mr. Clift said, because bonds in the indexes they track might not trade for days. That makes it difficult to know the true value of the bonds, and the E.T.F. issuers must therefore rely on services that determine prices for illiquid bonds based on corporate and market developments.To complicate matters further, E.T.F.s are inclined not to own bonds that trade irregularly; instead, they hold portfolios of more liquid issues that they expect to correlate highly \u2014 but not perfectly \u2014 with a relevant index. That also creates pricing distortions.The chronic mispricings in bond E.T.F.s are minor compared with the ones that stock E.T.F.s experienced on Aug. 24. But a shocking event, such as an unforeseen increase in interest rates, could change that, Mr. Blancato warned.\u201cIf we get a rate rise and there\u2019s panic selling in the bond market, you\u2019ll see prices gap down 8, 10, 20 percent,\u201d he predicted. Bond mutual funds would be hit too, he added, but professional managers would be less inclined to engage in knee-jerk selling, and shareholders would be somewhat insulated because mutual fund shares are redeemed at face value, with no premium or discount.With the difficulties of Aug. 24 in mind, small investors may want to adjust the way they trade E.T.F.s. Mr. Blancato recommended avoiding ones in niches where the underlying instruments trade infrequently, like hedge fund strategies, private equity and floating-rate notes, a type of debt whose interest payments change when market rates rise or fall.Mr. Rosenbluth is concerned less with what investors buy than with how they buy it. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to buy or sell at the open or close when there\u2019s a lack of clarity in the market and you won\u2019t get a fair price for your efforts,\u201d he said.He encouraged investors to stick to the basics and use E.T.F.s to meet long-term goals. They may trade all day long, but you are not required to do the same.\u201cHaving access to trading doesn\u2019t mean you should trade or that you\u2019ll make the right decisions,\u201d Mr. Rosenbluth said. \u201cThe benefits of E.T.F.s outweigh the drawbacks, but people should go in with their eyes open and be aware that there are challenges.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Signs of a Retail Rebound as Consumers Take On More Debt", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byConsumer debt is rising. How Americans handle that load and how much cash they spend will determine the fortunes of an important stock sector.Stocks that benefit from consumer spending \u2014 including those in categories like autos, home furnishings, retailers and restaurants \u2014 have been very strong performers recently. Over the three years through December, consumer discretionary stocks returned more than 18 percent annually, on average, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.But what does the future hold for this sector? On the positive side, unemployment rates continue to decline, wages have grown modestly among lower-income earners, and plummeting energy prices have given consumers more spending firepower.Consumer debt cuts both ways, of course. In moderation, it can help encourage economic activity. Carried too far, it can create bubbles that threaten the economy. Some analysts say debt is still in the helpful stages and consumer spending therefore has room for nontoxic growth. \u201cWe still see the consumer leading economic growth,\u201d said Sam Stovall, United States equity strategist with S&P Capital IQ. He predicted consumer spending would grow 3.1 percent in 2016, spurred by gains in jobs and wages.Jay Nogueira, head of the global consumer sector for T. Rowe Price, was cautiously bullish about the consumer discretionary sector. Credit card debt per household is $6,900, he said, placing it only at 2004 levels, well below the 2007 peak of $8,600. In addition, he said, \u201cHousing is set up for a long and steady recovery, as opposed to boom and bust.\u201d He favors stocks like Home Depot, Williams-Sonoma, Whirlpool and Mohawk Industries.One argument for a continuing housing rebound comes from Brad Sorensen, head of market and sector analysis for the Schwab Center for Financial Research. Homeownership peaked before the financial crisis at 69 percent, he said, and has fallen to about 63 percent. There is room for growth, he said.But even bulls on consumer spending see areas of concern. For example, auto lending has emerged as a highly profitable area for banks, and just about anyone can get a car loan these days, said Ernesto Ramos, head of equities for BMO Global Asset Management. \u201cOnce you walk into a showroom, money will be no object,\u201d he said.Similarly, Mr. Sorensen warned: \u201cThe standards have loosened, and all people are able to get loans. They are letting the weakly creditworthy get loans.\u201dMark Hamrick, senior economic analyst with Bankrate.com, said only a small fraction of auto loans were made at the zero percent interest rates trumpeted on television. In an auto showroom recently, he said, a salesman told him that at that moment the dealership was negotiating several loans at \u201c20 percent or above.\u201dStill, auto loans are not that big, in aggregate, compared with housing debt. Statistics from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York show that auto loans increased by more than 12 percent from the third quarter of 2014 to the third quarter of 2015. That left the total of auto credit at $1.05 trillion, a small fraction of the more than $8 trillion of mortgage debt.Also of concern for the consumer sector, some large retailers have had disappointing performances recently. Among the worst hit was Macy\u2019s. Its stock has fallen to roughly $35 a share from a mid-July peak above $70.Mr. Nogueira of T. Rowe Price said the sell-off had gone too far. \u201cI think it\u2019s an overreaction,\u201d he said. One big reason for poor sales at Macy\u2019s and other chain stores was the warm November and December weather, he said. Macy\u2019s has also been hurt by the strong dollar, which has depressed its traditionally robust tourist business.The level of prevailing interest rates will affect consumer spending, but the impact of the Federal Reserve\u2019s recent increase in short-term rates is far from clear. Mr. Stovall said that even if the Fed continued to raise rates, they were likely to remain very low for some time.It is even possible that if inflation increases as the Fed expects, real interest rates will lag, essentially giving consumers negative inflation-adjusted interest rates down the road. That would be good news for borrowers and for an economy that depends on hefty but manageable consumer debt. \u201cConsumers will be leading the way in economic growth,\u201d Mr. Stovall said. Investors in the consumer discretionary sector will certainly hope so.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Roller Coaster Year Ends With U.S. Markets Mostly Down", "Date": "2015-12-31", "News": "Supported byInvestors may be disappointed with the lackluster performance of the United States stock market in 2015, but, given all that happened, it could have been worse.It was a year when corporate earnings underwhelmed, Greece nearly crashed out of the euro, China carried out a shock devaluation of its currency, the price of oil slumped and the Federal Reserve increased interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.After its close on Thursday, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index finished the year down 0.73 percent. The performance was well below the solid gains of the last three years.But the index was still up 63 percent over the last five years. What is more, the stock market was able to bounce back from a summer rout that dragged the S.&P. 500 more than 10 percent below the nominal high it reached in May. After reinvesting dividends, the benchmark was up 2.35 percent in 2015.\u201cI don\u2019t remember a year where there were so many roller coasters along the way,\u201d said David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff. \u201cThe whole year was like a giant theme park.\u201dIn short, after many months of low volatility in the markets, the convulsions of 2015 were a jarring reminder that investing in stocks can be a risky business. And while plenty of analysts on Wall Street have relatively optimistic forecasts for 2016, many of the forces that upset markets in 2015 \u2014 like uncertainties about currencies and commodities and the potentially chilling effect of higher interest rates \u2014 could continue to buffet markets.The S.&P. 500 on Thursday fell 19.42 points, or 0.94 percent, to close at 2,043.94. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 178.84 points, or 1.02 percent, leaving it down 2.2 percent for the year, its first annual decline since 2008. The technology-heavy Nasdaq index did better than the other two benchmarks in 2015, rising 5.73 percent for the year.And technology firms were among the top performers in 2015.Shares in Netflix, which continues to add subscribers at a fast pace, were the biggest gainer in the S.&.P 500 index in 2015, soaring 133 percent. Amazon\u2019s stock was the second-best performer, more than doubling in 2015 as the company surprised investors with stronger profits. In contrast, Walmart, its bricks-and-mortar rival, dropped 29 percent.Lower oil and gas prices hurt the prospects of energy companies. This caused the energy companies within the S.&P. 500 to lose nearly one-fourth of their value in 2015.The pain in the oil and gas sector also caused stress in the junk bond market, where energy companies have borrowed huge amounts in recent years. The prices of junk bonds fell over 10 percent in 2015, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch\u2019s United States high-yield master index.The selling in the more speculative reaches of the credit markets is a sign that several years of speculation, brought about by ultralow interest rates, may now be unwinding. Some analysts expect the shakeout to intensify.\u201cHigh-yield credit is going to get a lot worse,\u201d said Atul Lele, chief investment officer at Deltec International, an investment firm. He also thinks emerging markets, where stock markets fell steeply in 2015, will continue to suffer in 2016, as companies in developing countries struggle to repay dollars that they borrowed in recent years. \u201cThe problem is that they are going to be defaulting on U.S. dollar debt and they don\u2019t have the dollar liquidity,\u201d Mr. Lele said.The crucial question is whether the United States economy can continue growing at around its current rate as the Fed raises interest rates. Away from the stock market, there were indications that investors are not confident about the outlook for the economy. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note might have been expected to rise considerably in 2015 as the economy grew and unemployment fell. Yet the note closed on Thursday with a yield of 2.27 percent, barely higher than the 2.17 percent at the end of 2014.Likewise, the price of oil, as measured by the benchmark United States crude contract in New York, fell by nearly a third in 2015. Some analysts saw the plunge as a portent of weak global growth, since it might indicate that companies are buying less oil to fuel their operations.Yet despite such indicators, many analysts said they saw activity within the United States economy that could keep it growing at a moderate pace. For instance, they said, United States consumers, benefiting from potentially higher wages and lower energy costs, could gain further confidence in 2016. While higher wages might dent profit margins for firms, higher spending by consumers could also bolster sales for certain companies. \u201cNext year is going to be the year of the wage breakout,\u201d said Mr. Rosenberg, the strategist. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be a pervasive theme.\u201dGloomier stock market watchers, however, said that problems they perceived in the global economy would most likely deepen in 2016, undermining the United States\u2019 recovery and the country\u2019s stock market. In their view, the monetary stimulus of the world\u2019s central banks has been of limited effectiveness. As a result, countries are choosing to let their currencies fall as a way of stoking their exports and thus their economies. The starkest example of this occurred in August, when China shocked the world by letting its long-stable currency, the renminbi, devalue slightly.As others have devalued, the United States dollar has strengthened. This can hurt companies based in the United States in two ways. They might find it harder to export and they might have to sell their goods at lower prices within the United States to compete with foreign firms. Their profits would suffer as result, and the deflationary forces in the economy might gain strength. To the bearish analysts, the devaluations and the problems they cause are an indication that policy makers are running out of ideas.\u201cI look around the world and see financial markets believing that the authorities are in control \u2014 but they are not,\u201d said Albert Edwards, a strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale in London.The bulls, of course, scoff at such pessimism. But even they say the days of indiscriminately buying stocks and watching them go up are over for now. Many of the financial moves that companies have recently deployed to increase profits \u2014 like stock buybacks and borrowing at ever-lower interest rates \u2014 may become harder to carry out.\u201cThe era of throwing a dart against the wall, of the rising tide lifting all boats, is behind us,\u201d Mr. Rosenberg said, \u201cYou\u2019ll have to do more homework in the coming year.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Make Sense of Plummeting Global Markets", "Date": "2016-01-20", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsThe price of oil is where most of the action is, with West Texas Intermediate Crude trading below $27 a barrel Wednesday, down from around $37 at the end of December, $60 in June and $100 in mid-2014. The broad S.&P. is down 9 percent so far in 2016, and stock indexes in many emerging economies are down even more. Bond and currency markets point to economic troubles in oil-producing nations. (Considering a trip to Quebec? Good move. The Canadian dollar is down 19 percent against the United States dollar since May).What makes these falling prices unnerving is that it\u2019s hard to tell a simple story about what is driving them. It could be that the markets are moving according to their own internal logic, driven by money managers\u2019 psychology, with their habitual toggle between fear and greed turning back toward the former. More frightening: The markets could be pricing in some darker facts about the outlook for the world that economists don\u2019t fully understand.In the past, when signals were so negative, there usually was a clearer story to tell.In the summer and fall of 2011, markets were tumbling on fears that the union using the euro currency would dissolve; in 2008, it was fears that the global financial system would collapse; in 2000 it was on the realization that stock prices, especially for tech companies, had gotten out of line.Oil prices are down so much that profits of oil companies will suffer mightily, and some will surely go bankrupt. They have already been cutting way back on investment in oil exploration. But traditionally, that has been counterbalanced by celebrations from industrial and transportation companies and from ordinary people over lower bills for gasoline and other forms of fuel.The impulse when the stock market falls hard for a few days in a row is to do something but it probably doesn\u2019t make much sense to overhaul an investment strategy based on a blip of market activity.One piece of evidence for this theory: Bank stocks have fallen even more in 2016 than the stock market over all, implying that investors believe banks did a little too much oil-field lending, though certainly this won\u2019t amount to the kinds of declines and major troubles of 2008.Another possibility is that this sell-off reflects the unwinding of \u201cherd\u201d behavior among global asset managers, who piled into similar investments during the 2009 to 2014 stock market rally and are now racing to unload the same high-yield bonds, emerging market stocks and energy investments all at once. In this telling, the moves in market prices reflect more the psychology of money managers than fundamental information about the state of the global economy.Financial markets are always more volatile than the underlying economy; the stock market has predicted nine of the last five recessions, as an old line often credited to the economist Paul Samuelson has it.At the same time, sometimes markets know something that smarty-pants economists (or economic writers) don\u2019t. It was certainly true in the fall of 2007, when the stock and bond markets were more prescient about the looming recession in the United States than the consensus view of economists.The challenge for investors is to determine whether the stock market moves of the last few weeks represent the rational kind of fear or the irrational kind of fear, and we probably won\u2019t know the answer anytime soon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Aramco I.P.O., Questions of Splitting Revenue With Saudi Government", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsOn the face of it, buying shares in Saudi Aramco \u2013 the world\u2019s largest oil company \u2013 is a no-brainer for any investor, even with the price of crude threatening to fall below $30 a barrel. But dig a little deeper and a potential initial public offering of Saudi Arabia\u2019s wholly owned state oil producer comes with significant risks that could outweigh its access to the kingdom\u2019s vast reserves of crude.The idea of listing Aramco has been muttered in the corridors of power in Riyadh for years, but these conversations may now be turning into concrete plans. Mohammed bin Salman \u2013 the influential deputy crown prince and favored son of the king \u2013 told The Economist magazine on Jan. 7 that a decision to float the kingdom\u2019s most valued asset could come in weeks.That has whetted the appetite of investors, but also raised questions about how a newly listed entity would split revenue from tapping into 18 percent of the world\u2019s oil reserves with the Saudi government. Aramco\u2019s original concession agreement dates back to its foundation in 1933 and the exact terms of the existing deal are unknown.Dependent on the oil and gas sector for 85 percent of its export earnings, Saudi Arabia will be reluctant to allow Aramco to keep more income from crude for the benefit of shareholders. Potential investors will want to see how earnings are divided with the publication of a full balance sheet for a company that could easily command a valuation above $1 trillion, based on its current output of more than 10 million barrels a day of crude.There are also important questions over governance, and whether international investors will be allowed to buy shares in a listing. Last April\u2019s decision to take the chairmanship of Aramco away from the oil minister Ali al-Naimi may help address the first concern, by reducing the ministry\u2019s control. But even though the Saudi stock market has underperformed over the last year and is relatively small with a value of about 1.5 trillion riyals ($400 billion), any listing could yet be limited to local investors. Given many domestic investors are state pension funds, it would be a way for the state to maintain its grip.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Goldman Sachs\u2019s Profit and Revenue Fell in Quarter", "Date": "2016-01-20", "News": "Supported byEarnings were dragged down, in part, by a recent government settlement over mortgage securities the bank produced before the financial crisis.But the firm\u2019s revenue also fell 5 percent in the fourth quarter from the same quarter a year ago, bringing revenue down 2 percent for all of 2015.New regulations and volatility in the global markets have diminished business opportunities for the bank, considered by many to be the most elite firm in the industry.\u201cClearly, it has been a challenging environment for the entire industry,\u201d the firm\u2019s chief financial officer, Harvey M. Schwartz, said in a call with analysts on Wednesday.Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks\u2019 bottom lines.But Mr. Schwartz said that the recent difficulties had not led the company\u2019s executives to question their mix of businesses.\u201cWe run the firm for multiple years,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see opportunities.\u201dMany other firms on Wall Street have recently announced big cuts to businesses on which Goldman is heavily reliant \u2014 most of all the fixed-income trading businesses that has been hit hard by new regulations.On Tuesday, one of Goldman\u2019s closest competitors, Morgan Stanley, detailed significant cutbacks in fixed income and elsewhere. The firm\u2019s chief executive, James P. Gorman, argued that regulation had changed the firm\u2019s long-term business outlook in ways that it had not anticipated a year ago.Goldman Sachs has also been struggling in fixed income, a business that comes with much higher regulatory costs than it has in the past. In the fourth quarter, the business reported 8 percent lower revenue than it did a year ago. For the year, fixed-income revenue was down 13 percent.But Mr. Schwartz reiterated the bank\u2019s belief that with so many competitors leaving the field, Goldman will benefit when there is any sort of turnaround in the global markets.That did not quiet all the questions from analysts, some of whom asked when the continuing slide in revenue would convince Goldman that it, like other banks, needed to take more drastic action.Mr. Schwartz defended Goldman\u2019s more cautious approach and said that it had been making cuts slowly over time, often ahead of competitors, but did not want to overreact to recent events.\u201cWe\u2019re certainly not sitting still here,\u201d he said.The lower revenue helped push the bank\u2019s fourth-quarter profit down to $765 million, or $1.27 a share, compared with $2.17 billion, or $4.38 a share, in the final quarter of 2014.Shares of Goldman fell about 2 percent on a day when financial stocks and the overall market were sharply lower.The firm\u2019s profit for the year as a whole declined 31 percent, to $5.6 billion.Goldman Sachs, led by Lloyd C. Blankfein as chief executive, has kept investors satisfied largely because it has kept profits high, particularly relative to competitors like Morgan Stanley.Goldman\u2019s business of advising companies continued to perform well, growing 27 percent from a year earlier. But nearly every other major business line produced smaller revenue, including the stock trading division that has been doing so well in recent quarters.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "One Market Prediction Is Sure: Wall Street Will Be Wrong", "Date": "2016-01-09", "News": "Supported byStrategiesThe stock market ended 2015 with a whimper and began the new year with a shudder. Even before Wall Street showed up for business on Monday morning, stocks fell 7 percent in China, and the turmoil that started in Asian markets cascaded around the world.The stock market in the United States fell 1.5 percent that day, based on the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. In the face of troubles in the Chinese markets and a flare-up of geopolitical worries, including news of a North Korean nuclear test and heightened tensions in the Persian Gulf, the S.&P. 500 had the worst five-day start in its history, ending down almost 6 percent.That unsettling start could have a salutary effect. It provides yet another reminder that investing in stocks is inherently risky: Unless you are prepared to accept losses, you should not be in the market.In interpreting the week\u2019s news, it\u2019s also worth remembering that a few days or even a month of stock returns will not tell us much about where the market will be a year or more from now. In fact, although everyone would like to know where the current gyrations will take us, the unpleasant truth is that there is simply no reliable way to foretell the short-term path of the market.You might not know that from the forecasts of major Wall Street investment houses. The start of a new year is the season for prognostication, and many analysts have issued very specific predictions. The consensus on Wall Street is that the S.&P. 500 will rise 7 percent for all of 2016.Not everyone has come up with a year-end target for the index, however. Among the reports on the future path of the market, one was perhaps the most useful and certainly honest. Bespoke Investment Group published it. Its three authors, Paul Hickey, Justin Walters and George Pearkes, began their 2016 forecast with this disarming statement: \u201cWe have no idea.\u201dThis candid disclosure ensured that the authors will not have to eat their words. They acknowledged that their lack of specificity might be unsettling: \u201cThat\u2019s probably the last thing you wanted to hear from us regarding our views towards the next year in the stock market. In all honesty, though, to try and look out one year from now and tell people what the market will or will not do is a fool\u2019s errand.\u201dYet they had plenty of interesting and skeptical things to say in the 161-page report. They explained why it is possible that the market will soar and finish 2016 with a double-digit gain \u2014 and why it is also quite possible that the long bull market is coming to an end this year. There is no certainty about either outcome, of course.What is likely, if not absolutely certain, is that the Wall Street consensus will be wrong.The Bespoke report reviewed the recent history of Wall Street predictions and found them wanting. Since 2000, it found, the consensus has called for an average yearly increase in the S.&P. 500 of about 9.5 percent. The actual average annual change was less than 4 percent, however, and consensus predictions were inaccurate in every single year, sometimes by preposterous margins. In 2001, for example, the consensus called for a gain of 20.7 percent. But the index fell by 13 percent. In the horrible year of 2008, the consensus was that the market would rise 11.1 percent. As many investors may recall, it fell by 38.5 percent. Not once since 2000 has Wall Street predicted that the market would decline in a calendar year. Yet the market actually fell in five of those years.This doesn\u2019t mean market analysis is useless. There is evidence, for example, that factors like stock valuations affect overall market returns over periods of five years or more, and that the level of prevailing interest rates influences returns over shorter periods. At the moment, those two factors point in different directions, however.After years of gains, overall valuations are stretched, by most measures, which may augur poorly for future returns. The price-to-earnings ratio of the S.&P. 500, for example, ended the year above 18, compared with an average since 1926 of a little over 15. That implies that investors are paying more for stocks than they have in the past. Higher prices often lead to price declines, but there is no assurance that this will happen on a known timetable, or that it will happen at all.On the positive side, interest rates, both the short-term ones set by the Federal Reserve and the longer-term rates established in the bond market, are extremely low by historical measures. That\u2019s the case even though the Fed has begun raising short-term rates. At the moment, for example, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes is about 2.1 percent, compared with an average of more than 6 percent since 1962. With the rates on relatively riskless investments in Treasuries remaining so low, the stock market may seem attractive as long as the economy grows and companies generate profits \u2014 in other words, unless the economy falls into a recession.On that score, the bond market may offer helpful clues. No recession since 1962 has occurred without an advance signal from the bond market known as an \u201cinverted yield curve.\u201d This simply means that short-term rates become higher than longer-term rates, reversing the typical order of things. When that reversal happens, the Bespoke report said, it \u201crepresents a belief by the market that current inflation and real interest rates are too high, and that activity will eventually contract, reducing inflation and forcing the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.\u201dThe yield curve right now is rising sharply, indicating that the bond market does not see a recession on the horizon. While the market has often predicted recessions that have never occurred, no recession has occurred without such a prediction. In short, this is a portent of stability. But like other indicators, it is not infallible.That is worth remembering, too. If there were a single reliable indicator of the market\u2019s direction, smart managers would use it and profit handsomely. But systems and methods aimed at ensuring investment outperformance rarely prevail for very long.It tracked domestic mutual funds through September 2015, and there were no surprises. As in the past, the numbers showed that active mutual funds that performed well in one year were rarely able to sustain that performance in subsequent years. In fact, the statistics indicated that they performed no better as a group than you would have expected if their managers had merely flipped coins. The data suggested, once again, that most people would fail if they tried to predict the direction of the overall market or of particular stocks and bonds.\u201cI feel the game is rigged against the average investor,\u201d Ms. Soe said.People often pay high fees for investment management that produces scant measurable benefit. It\u2019s usually wiser, for longer-term investments, to hold them in broadly diversified, low-cost holdings, probably in index funds.As for where the market is heading this year, you might as well flip a coin.Advertisement"}

She will be a part of the company\u2019s nominating and corporate governance committee as well as its finance and investment committee, SunEdison said.A seat at the table will give Mr. Einhorn the chance to turn things around, for both his investors and the company.Mr. Einhorn is not the only one to have suffered a blow from SunEdison last year. And he is not the only voice to go up against the company, which has become a so-called hedge fund hotel, with more than 160 hedge funds in the stock in September, according to report by the research firm Novus.David Tepper and his firm, Appaloosa Management, are investors in TerraForm Power, a subsidiary of SunEdison, and filed a lawsuit this month over some details involving TerraForm\u2019s acquisition of Vivint Solar, a rooftop panel installer.As part of the deal with Greenlight Capital, SunEdison will not be able to issue equity without the approval of nearly all of its board members over a two-year period.

{"Headline": "Chinese Stocks Fall Sharply, Leading Asian Markets Lower", "Date": "2016-01-26", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s stock market sank on Tuesday amid accumulating evidence of the Chinese economy\u2019s deeply rooted troubles and as the central bank pushed huge sums of money into the banking system.The drop took Chinese stocks to their lowest level in 13 months. It followed a sell-off in the United States on Monday that was caused by a fall in the price of oil, an indicator of global economic health. But it also comes at a time of lingering market volatility in China stemming from growth concerns and questions about Beijing\u2019s ability to manage its markets.European shares were down slightly in midday trading, while futures trading suggested that Wall Street stocks could be set to fall on Tuesday. Oil also resumed its decline on Tuesday in Asian trading, dropping less than 1 percent after falling beneath the psychologically important $30 level earlier in the Asian trading day.China\u2019s economy grew last year at the slowest pace in 25 years. Among other problems, it has a glut of old-line factories that make products like steel, glass and cement. That industrial overcapacity stems from years of debt-financed investment in industries that now show little sign that they can repay those loans.Beijing, which is seeking to rebalance its economy to focus more on consumer spending and services, is slowly moving to address those concerns. The country\u2019s State Council, or cabinet, decided on Sunday that it would close 100 million to 150 million tons of steel-making capacity. That is enough capacity to potentially rival the total annual steel output of Japan, the world\u2019s No. 2 steel maker, which totaled 110.7 million tons in 2014.By contrast, China produced 804 million tons of steel last year, even as demand faltered. Over all, China\u2019s steel-making capacity was set to reach 1.17 billion tons last year, according to estimates from Fitch Ratings.Li Xinchuang, the head of the China Metallurgical Industry Planning and Research Institute, told the official Xinhua news agency that the planned steel mill closings could cost 400,000 jobs. \u201cLarge-scale redundancies in the steel sector could threaten social stability,\u201d he warned.The State Council decision, which was released on Monday, also called for large reductions in coal mining capacity, without providing a target figure.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.China\u2019s markets are falling even as policy makers are attempting to rein in soaring capital outflows prompted by investors\u2019 seeking to avoid China\u2019s slowing growth and wide expectations that its currency will weaken. Excluding foreign investment, capital outflows probably rose to as much as $900 billion in 2015, economists at Standard Chartered wrote Tuesday in a research note.In response to the outflows, China\u2019s central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, has been eating into its reserves at a record pace in recent months. The central bank is selling dollars in an effort to prop up the value of the Chinese currency, the renminbi, which is under pressure to depreciate as China\u2019s growth prospects weaken.China\u2019s stock markets have also suffered from worries about whether the government will eventually allow the sale of a flood of additional shares. Government-backed groups have been buying shares since last summer in an unsuccessful effort to stem the markets\u2019 decline. That has raised the government\u2019s overall holdings at a time when many economic reformers had hoped the government would privatize more companies to increase efficiency.China\u2019s large private-equity funds also have a large and growing backlog of companies for which they would like to conduct initial public offerings, so as to exit their investments and pay back investors. \u201cThe exit numbers are too low compared to what has been invested,\u201d said David Brown, a PricewaterhouseCoopers partner who leads the consulting firm\u2019s greater China private equity group.Shanghai\u2019s main share index plunged in late trading on Tuesday to close down 6.4 percent, at a new one-year low. Japan\u2019s main share index closed 2.4 percent lower, while stocks in Hong Kong closed down about 2.5 percent.Investors in Asia were reacting in part to the sell-off in the United States on Monday, where the Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.3 percent and the broader Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-share index closed 1.6 percent lower.The renewed volatility in China\u2019s markets comes after a senior Chinese leader sought to reassure investors that the government would curb volatility.The FTSE 100 index in Britain was down 0.7 percent at midday, and the Euro Stoxx 50 index had fallen 0.3 percent.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Activist Investors May Have Met Their Match: A Down Market", "Date": "2016-01-26", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorThe stock market slump has hit activist hedge funds particularly hard, raising the question of whether shareholder activism can survive a down market.Activist hedge funds specialize in taking aim at troubled companies. The core idea is for the fund to push for a new strategy that will turn the company around or, more commonly, to instigate some event that crystallizes value, like a spinoff or a sale. In the rising stock market of the last five years, this was a wonderful strategy.Acquisitions were hot and the exits were easy. Mistakes in picking targets were covered up by gains in the market. Activist hedge funds tend to invest in stocks that are more volatile than the overall market, so these stocks tended to rise more than the market itself. Activism seemed to be a surefire way to mint millions in stock profits.In a down market, this exuberance has come tumbling back to earth. What was volatile on the upside is now shooting downward. And although the downturn is recent, takeover activity \u2014 if it follows past patterns \u2014 will certainly slow.And those troubled companies will become more troubled and harder to turn around, while the activists beat a hasty retreat.This is what happened in the financial crisis of 2008. The wave of bad news almost overwhelmed the activists, and the number of activist campaigns fell by 35 percent, according to FactSet SharkRepellent.So far this year, history is repeating itself as activist hedge funds have been buffeted by the downturn. Take William A. Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square Capital Management, which has a publicly traded investment vehicle in the Netherlands, Pershing Square Holdings, that allows individual investors to put their money directly in Pershing Square\u2019s activist funds. The vehicle\u2019s stock price is therefore a good proxy for the performance of Pershing Square, arguably the most prominent activist fund in the world.It isn\u2019t pretty.So far this year, Pershing Square Holdings\u2019 stock is down 12.8 percent as of Friday. Compare that with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, which was down only 6.7 percent. Pershing Square\u2019s main holdings have on average fallen more than twice as much as the stock market index. Among its holdings are Valeant Pharmaceuticals, which has fallen 12.84 percent; Air Products, down 8.56 percent; and Platform Specialty Holdings, down 39.28 percent. The only up stock in Pershing Square\u2019s portfolio is probably Mr. Ackman\u2019s huge short bet on Herbalife, which these days is simply functioning as a hedge.Mr. Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square is known for having a particularly volatile portfolio, so not all funds are doing as poorly. Still, Carl C. Icahn\u2019s publicly traded vehicle, Icahn Enterprises, is down 11.5 percent for the year so far.The destructive effect of a down market is intensified for activist hedge funds because they tend to herd. Witness the decline of Valeant stock, in which Pershing Square, ValueAct and John Paulson\u2019s Paulson & Company, among other hedge funds, all invested.This degree of concentration is one reason 2015 was an annus horribilis for many big hedge funds. Last year, Pershing Square lost 20.5 percent, Jana was down 5.4 percent, and Greenlight Capital fell 20 percent. Even Mr. Icahn, who does not announce results, most likely lost a fair amount of money. This was even before the market downturn in January.This sector was due for a shake-up anyway. New entrants were emerging, and funds were searching ever wider for targets and were willing to take riskier bets. Witness the apex of this with the combination of DuPont and Dow Chemical with a plan for the combined behemoth to then split into three companies in the next year and a half. The transaction may have been driven by the hedge funds invested in both companies and the need to cater to their desires.Stocks could bounce back, of course. Even if that does happen, however, the recent slump is likely to make activist hedge funds more conservative.And if the downturn persists, we\u2019re likely to see a sharp drop in activism. Many activist hedge funds have only one-year lockups. This means that investors can pull their money out after a year. This short lockup period has been a central complaint of hedge fund critics, which they say supports a claim that hedge funds look only at the short term, aiming to meet their yearly return and keep their investors.If these lockups expire when the stock market remains sharply down, the strong flow of money into this strategy will reverse. And this, of course, will not just reduce the number of activist attacks; it may do more.One or two of these highflying funds may collapse as money heads out the door. After all, that is what happens with hot investment strategies on Wall Street. In good times, people herd into bubbling strategies without heed to what the downside may bring. But in this case, we know what is happening \u2014 losses far in excess of declines in the market indexes. The upside may support this risk, but in down times, people tend to head for the exits.Some of the stronger funds may survive and buy opportunistically in the wreckage. There is no doubt that is going on now. But not all funds will stay strong or be able to keep enough cash on hand to invest.In the interim, companies may get the breather they have been desperate for after rising activism, which reached a record last year, according to FactSet SharkRepellent.It will also most likely pause the spinoff trend, which has been accelerated by the activist hedge funds, as companies focus on core operations and not financial engineering. And it may also separate the activists who have real skill from the rest of the herd.That\u2019s what downturns do; they purge, something the targets of activist hedge funds over the years can now tell their once-and-future hunters. Wall Street is funny that way.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Barclays to Scale Back Asia Businesses as Part of Overhaul", "Date": "2016-01-21", "News": "Supported byThe changes, a person with knowledge of the plans said on Thursday, would include cutting as many as 1,200 jobs across the global investment banking operations of Barclays, which has a major presence in New York as well in its home, London.About two-thirds of the cuts would be in Asia, said this person, who spoke on condition of anonymity.Barclays plans to focus on its home markets in Britain and the United States. The bank said it would build its global franchise around business lines where it has a \u201ccompetitive advantage,\u201d while closing some product lines.The bank is committed to having a \u201cstrong presence\u201d in Asia and in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, he said.Shares of Barclays ended up nearly 1.8 percent in London trading.Mr. Staley, a former top JPMorgan Chase executive who joined the bank as its chief in December, is expected to update investors on the lender\u2019s strategy when its full-year results are announced in March.Barclays said on Thursday it expected to report that the investment bank\u2019s income, similar to what American banks count as revenue, was \u201cbroadly flat\u201d in 2015.As part of its latest moves, Barclays plans to shut its cash equity sales and trading and convertible bond operations in Asia. Clients in Asia were notified on Thursday morning about the closing of the cash equities desk, which trades stocks for customers.The bank also said that it would close offices in countries including Brazil, Russia, South Korea and Taiwan.\u201cWe are sharpening our focus on the geographies and products where we have a clear competitive advantage\u201d in Asia, Thomas King, the head of Barclays\u2019 investment banking business, said in an internal memo sent to employees on Thursday.In Asia, Barclays said, it would only maintain offices in China, Hong Kong, India, Japan and Singapore.The bank would continue to provide debt financing, risk management and cross-board mergers and acquisitions services in Asia, as well as certain services to clients with cross-border requirements, particularly those with connections to the United States and Europe.The bank would also cut back on the number of products it offers through its business in the Americas and is considering getting out of the precious-metals business.In recent years, Barclays has sold or withdrawn from several underperforming businesses, and it says it is focusing on what it calls its core operations.The bank announced the sale of its retail banking operations in Italy, Portugal and Spain last year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "BlackRock\u2019s Profit Up as Money Pours Into Exchange Traded Funds", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest money manager, reported a 6 percent increase in its fourth-quarter earnings on Friday as investors continued to allocate money to the company\u2019s exchange traded funds despite a volatile stock market.For the full year, BlackRock\u2019s fast-growing iShares franchise took in $130 billion, consolidating the company\u2019s position as the largest provider of E.T.F.s. In the fourth quarter alone, the company had net E.T.F. inflows of $60 billion.E.T.F.s are funds that trade on the stock exchange and track a wide variety of indexes. Although many investors have been pulling money out of traditional actively managed mutual funds, BlackRock\u2019s E.T.F.s, especially those that invest in bonds, have consistently taken in money.That money has continued to come in even after the market disruption last August, when the stocks of some of the company\u2019s largest E.T.F.s plunged, suggesting that investors have not lost confidence in these investment vehicles.Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks\u2019 bottom lines.Regulators and numerous industry experts have warned that some E.T.F.s, especially those that invest in hard-to-sell assets like high-yield bonds and leveraged loans, might pose broader risks to the market.E.T.F. providers have countered that their funds have held up well, not least over the last few months, when many investors were pulling money out of high-yield funds.In late December, when the investment firm Third Avenue Management closed the door on investors who wanted to remove money from its poorly performing high-yield fund, similar credit E.T.F.s were able to satisfy redemption requests with no serious disruptions.\u201cDespite all the worries, the E.T.F market has proven to be the best liquid and safe way to get exposure to the markets,\u201d Laurence D. Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, said in an interview on Friday.Mr. Fink pointed out that during the worst period of the turbulence in the junk bond market last month, investors bought and sold $20 billion worth of the $14 billion iShares high-yield exchange traded fund, with only $1 billion of actual redemptions.\u201cPeople were able to buy and sell however much they wanted without upsetting the market,\u201d Mr. Fink said.At BlackRock, total assets under management remained flat for the quarter at $4.6 trillion \u2014 an achievement given that many investors, spooked by the market\u2019s downward turn, have been pulling their money out.The company earned $861 million, or $5.11 a share, up from $813 million, or $4.77 a share, in the quarter a year earlier.For the full year, earnings grew 2 percent, to $3.2 billion.The company\u2019s other main business areas, funds offered to retail and institutional investors, grew modestly in the quarter.With each year, BlackRock is becoming ever more reliant on its E.T.F. business as investors keep moving away from higher-price and less-liquid actively managed funds. BlackRock now manages $1.1 trillion in E.T.F.s, the most in the industry.And this year, the company\u2019s bond E.T.F.s, which invest in a range of sectors including corporate bonds, emerging markets and Treasury securities, attracted $50 billion of new money.Nevertheless, Mr. Fink was quick to highlight that BlackRock in 2015 attracted $61 billion in assets for its stock and bond funds that actively try to beat the market.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "North Korea Is Newest Frontier for a Daredevil Investor", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported byNow, he is betting on North Korea.James Passin, a hedge fund manager at Firebird Management, believes the nuclear-armed country sits on as much as a billion barrels of crude \u2014 enough to make it as big a producer as Oklahoma. If the oil exists, he wants to help unlock it.\u201cYou have a country with 25 million people \u2014 young, highly disciplined, literate \u2014 and a strong military-industrial complex,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that the early investors will be rewarded with potential for massive appreciation.\u201dThe risks of sinking cash \u2014 even just $7 million or so of Firebird\u2019s $700 million in assets \u2014 into a neo-Stalinist state with labor camps and virtually no private property are obvious. The geopolitical volatility was on full display last week, as North Korea claimed that it had tested a hydrogen bomb. And Mr. Passin is treading on murky investment territory, given the American sanctions against the country.His investors have experienced the wild rides that come with such frontier markets. Two of his funds are being liquidated after deep losses, including on banking in Iraq, gold in Armenia and oil and gas in Kenya.But Mr. Passin isn\u2019t deterred. \u201cI see opportunities when other people are afraid,\u201d he said.Mr. Passin, 44, studied philosophy at St. John\u2019s College in Maryland. He was inspired to enter finance, he said, in part by the story of Thales, a philosopher in ancient Greece who got rich by monopolizing olive presses before a bumper harvest he had foreseen in the stars.After graduating, Mr. Passin began his career as an editor at Taipan, a financial newsletter in Baltimore, recommending obscure foreign stocks.Peter Schiff, the chief of Euro Pacific Capital in Connecticut, met Mr. Passin in his newsletter days and later invested, on his advice, in Hurricane Hydrocarbons, an oil company in Kazakhstan, buying shares for as little as 25 cents apiece. Eventually, the company was sold at $55 a share, Mr. Schiff recalled.\u201cI\u2019ve bought some stocks from him that have gone to zero,\u201d Mr. Schiff said. \u201cBut this was such a big winner.\u201dIn 1999, Mr. Passin joined the New York-based Firebird, becoming one of several fund managers at the firm.\u201cHe took a very different path than your typical hedge fund manager,\u201d Mr. Schiff added. \u201cHe\u2019s not a Harvard M.B.A., he didn\u2019t work at Goldman Sachs, he didn\u2019t do a two-year internship \u2014 he\u2019s just a smart guy.\u201dContrarian instincts have led Mr. Passin to out-of-the-way markets like Chechnya, Congo and Somalia.Joseph Naemi, one of Mr. Passin\u2019s longtime business partners, recalled joining him in a brash attempt in 2002 to buy Uzbekistan\u2019s national oil company, Uzbekneftegaz. They had a meeting with a dozen Uzbek government officials, and Mr. Passin\u2019s pitch was simple: He was there to write a check for $600 million to $700 million to buy the entire company. But the country did not go for the proposal.\u201cThe skeptical look around the boardroom was actually hilarious,\u201d Mr. Naemi wrote in an email.In 2006, Mr. Passin toured Mongolia and zeroed in on its stock exchange. It was \u201cjust a room with some computers,\u201d Mr. Passin recalled.He said he snapped up shares in \u201canything that was listed.\u201d By 2011, the country\u2019s economy was clocking one of the fastest growth rates in the world \u2014 17 percent a year \u2014 as vast troves of minerals were discovered under the steppes.Since then, Mongolia\u2019s bull market has crashed, Mr. Passin said, and the economy has slowed. But he is redoubling his efforts there, aiming to construct a set of world-class Mongolian corporations \u2014 a project he has broadly likened to the empire-building of Genghis Khan.Mr. Passin is also wagering on distressed debt in the South Pacific. Firebird has been suing the tiny, destitute island nation of Nauru for repayment on about $24 million of defaulted government-backed bonds, equal to about one-sixth of the country\u2019s gross domestic product.Firebird, which bought the bonds from the original creditors at a fraction of their face value, stands to make money if it wins. The hedge fund has been fighting in Australian courts to garnish Nauru\u2019s state bank accounts \u2014 and briefly succeeded in freezing the accounts.The tactics are similar to those used by larger, more prominent firms like Elliott Management, run by the billionaire investor Paul E. Singer, who has sued Argentina over debt repayment.In December, Australia\u2019s highest court denied Firebird access to Nauru\u2019s state bank accounts. But Mr. Passin might still try to claim any wealth the eight-square-mile coral atoll holds outside Australia.\u201cWe will go to every corner of the world to find assets,\u201d he said.Mr. Passin\u2019s North Korean investments may be his most contentious.Firebird owns nearly half of a Mongolian company, HBOil, that entered a joint venture with the government of Kim Jong-un in 2013. The partnership gave the small company expansive rights to overhaul North Korea\u2019s primitive energy sector by opening 100 gas stations, restarting a derelict refinery and drilling for oil and gas.The projects have yet to materialize. Companies have been searching for oil and gas there since the 1980s, and it remains unclear whether the country has any significant quantities.Mr. Naemi, who is advising HBOil, believes there are deep reserves of oil \u2014 perhaps as much as a billion recoverable barrels on land. But the current low price of oil means that if it exists, and can be extracted, it still might not be profitable.Mr. Passin\u2019s investment also raises legal questions. Alexandra L\u00f3pez-Casero, a sanctions lawyer at the Boston-based law firm Nixon Peabody, said the investment might violate American sanctions against North Korea absent a license from the Treasury Department in Washington. Other experts disagree, noting that the United States has not issued a blanket prohibition on investing in the North.Mr. Passin said that Firebird had neither sought such a license nor needed one. He added that an expert had reviewed the venture for him and concluded that it was legal.Some analysts worry that any oil exploitation would fortify Mr. Kim and others in the country\u2019s ruling elite. \u201cThe security risk is not small, as the oil business in D.P.R.K. is exclusively handled by the Communist Party and the military,\u201d said Keun-Wook Paik, an expert on North Korean oil at the research institution Chatham House, using the abbreviation for the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, the country\u2019s official name. \u201cIt will be a kind of Pandora box opening.\u201dMr. Passin dismisses such concerns.He said business with North Korea would both benefit ordinary people and encourage the totalitarian state apparatus to become \u201cmore open and less harsh.\u201d Besides, he argued, if the West avoided commerce with unsavory nations, much of the world would be off limits.\u201cI believe there are companies that will emerge out of the D.P.R.K. that will be of lasting importance,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will survive for centuries.\u201dRick Gladstone contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Transcript of Republican Presidential Debate", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byFollowing is a transcript of the main Republican presidential debate, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.NEIL CAVUTO: It is 9:00 p.m. here at the North Charleston Coliseum and Performing Arts Center in South Carolina. Welcome to the sixth Republican presidential debate of the 2016 campaign, here on the Fox Business Network.I\u2019m Neil Cavuto, alongside my friend and co-moderator Maria Bartiromo.MARIA BARTIROMO: Tonight we are working with Facebook to ask the candidates the questions voters want answered. And according to Facebook, the U.S. election has dominated the global conversation, with 131 million people talking about the 2016 race. That makes it the number one issue talked about on Facebook last year worldwide.CAVUTO: Now, the seven candidates on the stage tonight were selected based on their standing in six national polls, as well as polls in the early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire, those standings determining the position on the stage of the candidates tonight. And here they are.Businessman Donald Trump.(APPLAUSE)Texas senator Ted Cruz.(APPLAUSE)Florida senator Marco Rubio.(APPLAUSE)Neurosurgeon Ben Carson.(APPLAUSE)New Jersey governor Chris Christie.(APPLAUSE)Former Florida governor Jeb Bush.And Ohio governor John Kasich.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Tonight\u2019s rules are simple: up to 90 seconds for each answer, one minute for each follow-up response. And if a candidate goes over the allotted time, you\u2019ll hear this.(BELL RINGS) So let\u2019s get started. Candidates, jobs and growth \u2014 two of the biggest issues facing the country right now. In his State of the Union address earlier this week, the president said, quote, \u201cwe have the strongest, most durable economy in the world.\u201dAnd according to our Facebook research, jobs is one of the biggest issues resonating across the country, including here in South Carolina. The president is touting 14 million new jobs and an unemployment rate cut in half.The president said that anyone who claims America\u2019s economy is in decline is peddling fiction. Senator Cruz, what do you see that he doesn\u2019t?CRUZ: Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.Let me start \u2014 I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something. Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.In that State of the Union, President Obama didn\u2019t so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran. President Obama\u2019s preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei. And I\u2019ll tell you, it was heartbreaking.But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage. (APPLAUSE)And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)Now, on to your substantive question. The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs. And you know, he\u2019s right. If you\u2019re a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great. The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama. But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977. Median wages have stagnated. And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Governor Kasich, we are not even two weeks into this stock trading year, but (inaudible) investors already lost $1.6 trillion in market value. That makes it the worst start to a new year ever. Many worry that things will get even worse, and that banks and financial stocks are particularly vulnerable.Now, if this escalates, like it did back when Barack Obama first assumed the presidency, what actions would you take if this same thing happens all over again just as, in this example, you are taking over the presidency?KASICH: Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs. And I\u2019ve done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt. And our economy was growing like crazy. It\u2019s the same thing that I did in Ohio. It\u2019s a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety. It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way. And if you tax cuts \u2014 if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you\u2019re going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the \u2014 in the world.But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline. We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget. And when you do that, when you\u2019re in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.Right now, you don\u2019t have the \u2014 you have taxes that are too high. You have regulations \u2014 I mean, come on, they\u2019re affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses. They are \u2014 they\u2019re in a position where they\u2019re smothering people. And I mean, are you kidding me? We\u2019re nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise. You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy. And how do I know it? Because I\u2019ve done it. I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici. And I\u2019ve done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.Our wages are growing faster than the national average. We\u2019re running surpluses. And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: We know that recent global events have many people worried \u2014 Iran detaining American sailors, forcing them to apologize; North Korea and its nuclear ambitions; an aggressive China; and a Middle East that continues to deteriorate, not to mention ISIS is getting stronger.Governor Christie, sometimes it seems the world is on fire. Where and when should a president use military action to restore order?CHRISTIE: Well, Maria, I\u2019m glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what\u2019s going on in the world. Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama. And I\u2019ve got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?(APPLAUSE)The fact is, there\u2019s a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess. The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world. And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they\u2019ve never said about me is that I\u2019m misunderstood. And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we\u2019re going to keep it.Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience. And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he\u2019s absolutely right. It\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what\u2019s going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.The president doesn\u2019t understand \u2014 and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton \u2014 and here\u2019s my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight. If you\u2019re worried about the world being on fire, you\u2019re worried about how we\u2019re going to use our military, you\u2019re worried about strengthening our military and you\u2019re worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama\u2019s leadership.I will not do that. If I\u2019m the nominee, she won\u2019t get within 10 miles of the White House.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Just to be clear Governor, where and when would you use military action?CHRISTIE: MIlitary action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world. We are not the world\u2019s policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either. We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships. It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Governor Bush, the president just told the nation two nights ago that America is back and that the idea that our enemies are getting stronger or that this country is getting weaker, well, it\u2019s just rhetoric and hot air. Now other Democrats go even further, sir, saying Republicans even suggesting such comments actually embolden our enemies. I guess they would include you. What do you say?BUSH: Well first of all, the idea that somehow we\u2019re better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe. The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.Think about it. With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists. He\u2019s missing the whole point, that America\u2019s leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who\u2019s the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.(APPLAUSE)I\u2019ve learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military. In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can\u2019t even project force. Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we\u2019re in a much difficult \u2014 we\u2019re in a much different position than we should be.And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well. Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military. We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world\u2019s policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: So I take it from that you do not agree with the president.BUSH: No. And worse \u2014 worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.Think about it. She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have \u2014 that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess. And that is wrong.And you know what? Here\u2019s the problem. If she gets elected, she\u2019s under investigation with the FBI right now. If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse. We need to stop that. (LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Senator Rubio, the president says that ISIS doesn\u2019t threaten our national existence like a Germany or a Japan back in World War II, that the terror group is nothing more than twisted souls plotting attacks in their garages.But House Homeland Security Committee recently said that over 1,000 ongoing investigations of homegrown extremism in 50 states. So how do you define the threat? Germany then or dangerous nut cases now?RUBIO: Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton. She wouldn\u2019t just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.(APPLAUSE)Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States. Ever.(APPLAUSE)On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power. Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size. And that\u2019s how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.He doesn\u2019t understand the threat in ISIS. He consistently underestimates it but I do not. There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.When I\u2019m president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS. The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them. And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Thank you, Senator.BARTIROMO: Dr. Carson, the president says he does not want to treat ISIS as a foreign army, but ISIS is neither a country nor a government. How do you attack a network that does not respect national borders?CARSON: Well, I\u2019m very happy to get a question this early on. I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.(LAUGHTER)You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president\u2019s proclamations. The fact of the matter is he doesn\u2019t realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before. Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid. And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously. And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.I mean, just think about a scenario like that. They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse. They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs. Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point? He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.But here\u2019s the real key. We have the world\u2019s best military, even though he\u2019s done everything he can to diminish it. And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don\u2019t tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Mr. Trump, at the State of the Union, the president pointed to a guest who was a Syrian refugee you might recall whose wife and daughter and other family members were killed in an air attack. Now he fled that country seeking asylum here, ultimately ended up in Detroit where he\u2019s now trying to start a new life.The president says that that doctor is the real face of these refugees and not the one that you and some of your colleagues on this stage are painting; that you prefer the face of fear and terror and that you would refuse to let in anyone into this country seeking legitimate asylum. How do you answer that?TRUMP: It\u2019s not fear and terror, it\u2019s reality. You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.(APPLAUSE)You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there\u2019s a \u2014 the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow. They\u2019re very, very badly wounded. They will \u2014 some will follow. And you look around, and you see what\u2019s happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor \u2014 very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.That could be the great Trojan Horse. It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction. When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women? It looked like very few women. Very few children. Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they\u2019re saying what\u2019s going on?You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized \u2014 they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 \u2014 going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look \u2014 a good strong look and that\u2019s what we have. We are nineteen trillion dollars \u2014 our country\u2019s a mess and we can\u2019t let all these people come into our country and break our borders. We can\u2019t do it.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Senator Cruz, the New York Times is reporting that you failed to properly disclose a million dollars in loans from Goldman Sachs and CitiBank. During your senate race, your campaign said, \u201cit was inadvertent.\u201d A million dollars is inadvertent?CRUZ: Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times. You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don\u2019t hide their views. The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, \u201cAnybody But Cruz.\u201d Had that actually \u2014 that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, \u201cIt Follows\u201d that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.So you know the New York Times and I don\u2019t have exactly have the warmest of relationships. Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate \u2014 unlike Hillary Clinton, I don\u2019t have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars. When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars. He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks. And the entire New York times attack \u2014 is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing. But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other. But if that\u2019s the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well. BARTIROMO: Thank you.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO: All right. Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate, right here in North Charleston, South Carolina. Let\u2019s get right back to the questions. And I\u2019ll start with you, Senator Cruz.Now you are, of course, a strict constitutionalist \u2014 no one would doubt that. And as you know, the U.S. Constitution says only natural-born citizens are eligible for the office of president of the United States. Stop me if you\u2019ve heard this before. Now, you were born...(LAUGHTER)... you were born in Canada to an American mother. So you were and are considered an American citizen. But that fellow next to you, Donald Trump \u2014 and others \u2014 have said that being born in Canada means you are not natural-born, and that has raised questions about your eligibility.Do you want to try to close this topic once and for all tonight?CRUZ: Well, Neil, I\u2019m glad we\u2019re focusing on the important topics of the evening.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there. There was nothing to this birther issue.(LAUGHTER)Now, since September, the Constitution hasn\u2019t changed.(LAUGHTER)But the poll numbers have.(APPLAUSE)And I recognize \u2014 I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa. But the facts and the law here are really quite clear. Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen. That\u2019s why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen. That\u2019s why George Romney, Mitt\u2019s dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on \u2014 some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.(APPLAUSE)(UNKNOWN): Not me.CRUZ: Because \u2014 because Donald\u2019s mother was born in Scotland. She was naturalized. Now, Donald...TRUMP: But I was born here.CRUZ: ... on the issue \u2014 on the issue of citizenship, Donald...TRUMP: (inaudible). Big difference.CRUZ: ... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I\u2019m not going to use your mother\u2019s birth against you.TRUMP: OK, good. Because it wouldn\u2019t work.CRUZ: You\u2019re an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who\u2019s best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that\u2019s the most important question facing the country.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Mr. Trump...(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: ... that you raised it because of his rising poll numbers.TRUMP: ... first of all, let me just tell you something \u2014 and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself \u2014 NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll \u2014 headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down. I mean, so don\u2019t \u2014 so you can\u2019t \u2014 you can\u2019t...(BOOING)... they don\u2019t like the Wall Street Journal. They don\u2019t like NBC, but I like the poll.(LAUGHTER)And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I\u2019m beating you. So \u2014 you know, you shouldn\u2019t misrepresent how well you\u2019re doing with the polls.(APPLAUSE)You don\u2019t have to say that. In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that\u2019s a misrepresentation, number one.Number two, this isn\u2019t me saying it. I don\u2019t care. I think I\u2019m going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way. Thank you.Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard \u2014 of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this. OK? There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.Here\u2019s the problem. We\u2019re running. We\u2019re running. He does great. I win. I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can\u2019t take him along for the ride. I don\u2019t like that. OK?(LAUGHTER)The fact is \u2014 and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible). See, they don\u2019t like that. They don\u2019t like that.(AUDIENCE BOOING)No, they don\u2019t like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.(LAUGHTER)But \u2014 if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit. You have a big lawsuit over your head while you\u2019re running. And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office? So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide. And you shouldn\u2019t have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: Why are you saying this now \u2014 right now? Why are you raising this issue now?TRUMP: Because now he\u2019s going a little bit better. No, I didn\u2019t care (inaudible). It\u2019s true. No, it\u2019s true. Hey look, he never had a chance. Now, he\u2019s doing better. He\u2019s got probably a four or five percent chance.(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: Neil...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: The fact is, there is a big overhang. There\u2019s a big question mark on your head. And you can\u2019t do that to the party. You really can\u2019t. You can\u2019t do that to the party. You have to have certainty. Even if it was a one percent chance, and it\u2019s far greater than one percent because (inaudible).I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can\u2019t run. If there was a \u2014 and you know I\u2019m not bringing a suit. I promise. But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty. You can\u2019t have a question. I can agree with you or not, but you can\u2019t have a question over your head.CAVUTO: Senator, do you want to respond?CRUZ: Well, listen, I\u2019ve spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court. And I\u2019ll tell you, I\u2019m not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.TRUMP: You don\u2019t have to. Take it from Lawrence Tribe.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Take it from your professors...(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero. And Mr. Trump is very focused...TRUMP: He\u2019s wrong. He\u2019s wrong.CRUZ: ... on Larry Tribe. Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is. He\u2019s a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore\u2019s lawyer in Bush versus Gore. He\u2019s a major Hillary Clinton supporter. And there\u2019s a reason why Hillary\u2019s supporters are echoing Donald\u2019s attacks on me, because Hillary...TRUMP: He is not the only one.CRUZ: ... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.TRUMP: There are many lawyers.CRUZ: And I\u2019ll tell you what, Donald, you \u2014 you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P. slot.(LAUGHTER) I\u2019ll tell you what. If this all works out, I\u2019m happy to consider naming you as V.P. So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.TRUMP: No \u2014 no...(LAUGHTER)... I think if it doesn\u2019t...(APPLAUSE)I like that. I like it. I\u2019d consider it. But I think I\u2019ll go back to building buildings if it doesn\u2019t work out.CRUZ: Actually, I\u2019d love to get you to build a wall.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: I have a feeling it\u2019s going to work out, actually.(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: Let me (inaudible). I was invoked in that question, so let me just say \u2014 in that answer \u2014 let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.(LAUGHTER)But the real \u2014 but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about. OK? Listen, we \u2014 this is the greatest country in the history of mankind. But in 2008, we elected a president that didn\u2019t want to fix America. He wants to change America. We elected a president that doesn\u2019t believe in the Constitution. He undermines it. We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage. We elected a president that doesn\u2019t believe in the free enterprise system.This election has to be about reversing all of that damage. That\u2019s why I\u2019m running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders. When I\u2019m president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military. And when I\u2019m president, we\u2019re not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world. When I\u2019m president, we\u2019re going to have a president that acts like it.BARTIROMO: Thank you, senator.BARTIROMO: Mr. Trump, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley in her response to the State of the Union address(APPLAUSE)BARITROMO: appeared to choose sides within the party, saying Republicans should resist, quote, \u201cthe siren call of the angriest voices\u201d. She confirmed, she was referring to you among others. Was she out of line? And, how would a President Trump unite the party?TRUMP: Okay. First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I\u2019m a friend of hers. Actually a close friend. And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I\u2019m a friend. We\u2019re friends. That\u2019s good.(LAUGHTER)But she did say there was anger. And I could say, oh, I\u2019m not angry. I\u2019m very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger. Our military is a disaster.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Our healthcare is a horror show. Obamacare, we\u2019re going to repeal it and replace it. We have no borders. Our vets are being treated horribly. Illegal immigration is beyond belief. Our country is being run by incompetent people. And yes, I am angry.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: And I won\u2019t be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I\u2019m very, very angry. And I say that to Nikki. So when Nikki said that, I wasn\u2019t offended. She said the truth.One of your colleagues interviewed me. And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she\u2019s right. I\u2019m not fighting that. I didn\u2019t find it offensive at all. I\u2019m angry because our country is a mess.(APPLAUSE)BARITROMO: But what are you going to do about it?CAVUTO: Marco Rubio. I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s the time constraints. You and Governor Christie have been exchanging some fairly nasty words of late, and I will allow the governor to respond as well.The governor went so far to say, you won\u2019t be able to slime your way to the White House. He\u2019s referring to a series of ads done by a PAC, speaking on your behalf, that say quote,\u201dOne high tax, Common Core, liberal, energy-loving, Obamacare, Medicaid-expanding president is enough. You think you went too far on that and do you want to apologize to the governor?RUBIO: You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country\u2019s security and expanding the role of...CAVUTO: That is not my question.RUBIO: Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil. He is \u2014 this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government. This president is undermining our military. He is undermining our standing in the world. I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control. This president, this president is more interested in funding \u2014 less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned \u2014 he\u2019s more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood. All I\u2019m saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country. It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary. Let me tell you, if we don\u2019t get this election right, there may be no turning back for America. We\u2019re on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage. No one is a socialist. No one here is under FBI investigation. So we have a good group of people.CAVUTO: Is he a liberal?RUBIO: Our next president...CAVUTO: Is he a liberal?RUBIO: Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood. Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.CAVUTO: Governor?(APPLAUSE)CHRISTIE: I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we\u2019re running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco\u2019s ear too.(LAUGHTER)So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then. So let\u2019s set the facts straight. First of all, I didn\u2019t support Sonia Sotomayor. Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban. I have vetoed a reduction this clip size. I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey. So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator. See when you\u2019re a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk. And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you\u2019re saying is accurate or not.When you\u2019re a governor, you\u2019re held accountable for everything you do. And the people of New Jersey, I\u2019ve seen it.(APPLAUSE)And the last piece is this. I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed. That was before he was running against me. Now that he is, he\u2019s changed his tune.I\u2019m never going to change my tune. I like Marco Rubio. He\u2019s a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: Neil, my name was mentioned here. Neil, my name was mentioned as well.Here\u2019s the deal, Chris is totally right. He\u2019s been a good governor, and he\u2019s a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton. And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it\u2019s going to be \u2014 this is not being bad.These attack ads are going to be part of life. Everybody just needs to get used to it. Everybody\u2019s record\u2019s going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.(APPLAUSE)Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn\u2019t disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you\u2019re going to hear in these ads, and discount the \u2014 the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.CARSON: Neil, I was mentioned too.CAVUTO: You were?CARSON: Yeah, he said everybody. (LAUGHTER)And \u2014 and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we \u2014 and when I say we, Republicans \u2014 tore themselves apart.You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it. And we got to look at the big picture here.BARTIROMO: Governor Kasich...(APPLAUSE)... Governor Kasich, Hillary Clinton is getting some serious competition from Senator Bernie Sanders. He\u2019s now at 41 percent in the latest CBS/New York Times poll. Vice President Biden sang his praises, saying Bernie is speaking to a yearning that is deep and real, and he has credibility on it.So what does it say about our country that a candidate who is a self-avowed socialist and who doesn\u2019t think a 90 percent tax rate is too high could be the Democratic nominee?KASICH: Well, if that\u2019s the case, we\u2019re going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee. That\u2019s not even an issue. But look...(APPLAUSE)... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he\u2019s not going to be president of the United States. So here\u2019s this \u2014 the situation, I think, Maria.And this is what we have to \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2019ve got to tell you, when wages don\u2019t rise \u2014 and they haven\u2019t for a lot of families for a number of years \u2014 it\u2019s very, very difficult for them.Part of the reason why it hasn\u2019t risen because sometimes we\u2019re not giving people the skills they need. Sometimes it\u2019s because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in \u2014 in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.People are upset about it. I\u2019ll tell you what else they\u2019re upset about: you\u2019re 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you\u2019re out of work, and you don\u2019t know where to go and where to turn. Do we have answer for that? We do. There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they\u2019ve got great value.I\u2019ll tell you what else people are concerned about. Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can\u2019t get a good job. We got to do a lot about the high cost of high \u2014 higher education, but we\u2019ve got to make sure we\u2019re training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.(APPLAUSE)Let me tell you that, in this country \u2014 in this country, people are concerned about their economic future. They\u2019re very concerned about it. And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to \u2014 keeping them from getting it.That\u2019s not the America that I\u2019ve ever known. My father used to say, \u201cJohnny, we never \u2014 we don\u2019t hate the rich. We just want to be the rich.\u201d And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America \u2014 and I mean everybody in America \u2014 having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.I\u2019m president \u2014 look, I\u2019ve done it once. I\u2019ve done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes. The economy was really booming.And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the \u2014 than the national average. A growth of 385,000 jobs.(BELL RINGS)It\u2019s not that hard. Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts. Get it done, because our \u2014 our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done. And, folks, we will. You count on it.BARTIROMO: Dr. Carson, one of the other candidates on this stage has brought Bill Clinton\u2019s past indiscretions. Is that a legitimate topic in this election? And what do you think of the notion that Hillary Clinton is an enabler of sexual misconduct?CARSON: Well, there\u2019s not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they\u2019re married to somebody who\u2019s running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means. But you know, here\u2019s the real issue, is this America anymore? Do we still have standards? Do we still have values and principles?You know, you look at what\u2019s going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society. You know, we have a war on virtual everything \u2014 race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars. Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other\u2019s throat and our strength is actually in our unity.You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section \u2014 you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names. Where did that spirit come from in America? It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that. And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong. And let\u2019s not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great. They\u2019ve been beaten into submission. It\u2019s time for us to stand up for what we believe in.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Well, we are not done. Coming up, one of the top things people are talking about on Facebook, guns. And you can join us live us on this stage in the conversation during this commercial break right from home. You can go to Facebook.com/(inaudible). We will be streaming live and talking about how we think the debate is going so far.We\u2019re back in a moment in Charleston, South Carolina.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debates, right here in North Charleston. Let\u2019s get right back to the questions.Governor Bush, gun rights, one of the top issues seen on Facebook with close to 3 million people talking about it in the past month. Right here in Charleston, Dylann Roof, who has been accused of killing nine people in a nearby church, reportedly had not passed his background check when he got his gun. What is the harm in tightening standards for not only who buys guns, but those who sell them?BUSH: First of all, I\u2019d like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the \u2014(APPLAUSE)BUSH: The Emanuel AME church killings. And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: I don\u2019t know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place. Look, here\u2019s the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake. The law itself requires a background check, but that didn\u2019t fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.We don\u2019t need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job. Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not \u2014 would not have passed a background check. The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.That\u2019s what they do, whether it\u2019s the San Bernardino attack or if it\u2019s these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is. It isn\u2019t law-abiding gun owners.Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you\u2019re going away. You\u2019re going away for a long, long while.And that\u2019s what we should focus on is the violence in our communities. Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you\u2019re going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there\u2019s a big divide.The other issue is mental health. That\u2019s a serious issue that we could work on. Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: The president\u2019s first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn\u2019t have. Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don\u2019t have access to guns.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.Mr. Trump, are there any circumstances that you think we should be limiting gun sales of any kind in America?TRUMP: No. I am a 2nd amendment person. If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn\u2019t have 14 or 15 people dead right now.If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn\u2019t have 130 people plus dead. So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.We have a huge mental health problem in this country. We\u2019re closing hospitals, we\u2019re closing wards, we\u2019re closing so many because the states want to save money. We have to get back into looking at what\u2019s causing it. The guns don\u2019t pull the trigger. It\u2019s the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order. He doesn\u2019t want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress. You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation. He just writes out an executive order. Not supposed to happen that way.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you sir.XXX where you get Congress.TRUMP: You get the Congress. You get the Senate. You get together. You do legislation. He just writes out an order, executive order. It\u2019s not supposed to happen that way.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Senator Rubio, you said that President Obama wants to take people\u2019s guns away. Yet under his presidency, gun sales have more than doubled. That doesn\u2019t sound like a White House unfriendly to gun owners.RUBIO: That sounds like people are afraid the president\u2019s going to take their guns away.(APPLAUSE)Look, the Second Amendment is not an option. It is not a suggestion. It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families. I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would. I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would. I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.Here\u2019s my second problem. None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he\u2019s doing these things would have been preventive. You know why? Because criminals don\u2019t buy their guns from a gun show. They don\u2019t buy their guns from a collector. And they don\u2019t buy their guns from a gun store. They get \u2014 they steal them. They get them on the black market.And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show. These...(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)... his answer \u2014 you name it. If there\u2019s an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control. Here\u2019s a fact. We are in a war against ISIS. They are trying to attack us here in America. They attacked us in Philadelphia last week. They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago. And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.When I\u2019m president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: But what fact can you point to, Senator \u2014 what fact can you point to that the president would take away everyone\u2019s gun? You don\u2019t think that\u2019s (inaudible)?RUBIO: About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can\u2019t wait to restrict people\u2019s access to guns. He has never defended...(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: I\u2019ll give you a fact. Well, let me tell you this. Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, \u201cThese Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion.\u201d That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.(APPLAUSE)He doesn\u2019t meet \u2014 here\u2019s the difference. When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it\u2019s not \u201chow can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans.\u201d It\u2019s \u201cgive me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns.\u201d That will never happen when I am president of the United States.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Governor Christie, you, too, have criticized the president\u2019s recent executive action on gun control, saying it\u2019s unconstitutional, another step to bypass Congress. But hasn\u2019t your own position on guns evolved, sir? The New Jersey Star-Ledger reports that you signed several laws to regulate the possession of firearms, and that you argued back in August 2013, and I quote, \u201cThese common sense measures will strengthen New Jersey\u2019s already tough gun laws.\u201dSo isn\u2019t that kind of what the president wants to do now?CHRISTIE: No, absolutely not. The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people. And the fact is that that\u2019s not a democracy. That\u2019s a dictatorship. And we need to very, very concerned about that.See, here\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident. I don\u2019t think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat. I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit. We have made it easier to do that, not harder. And the way we\u2019ve done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders. This guy is a petulant child. That\u2019s what he is. I mean, you know...(APPLAUSE)... the fact is, Neil, let\u2019s think about \u2014 let\u2019s think about \u2014 and I want to maybe \u2014 I hope the president is watching tonight, because here\u2019s what I\u2019d like to tell him.Mr. President, we\u2019re not against you. We\u2019re against your policies. When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate. You had only 21 Republican governors in this country. And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we\u2019ve had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.The American people have rejected your agenda and now you\u2019re trying to go around it. That\u2019s not right. It\u2019s not constitutional. And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: So what is the answer, Senator Cruz, to stop mass shootings and violent crime, up in 30 cities across the country?CRUZ: The answer is simple. Your prosecute criminals. You target the bad guys. You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do \u2014 done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general. Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns. He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials. And I\u2019ll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters \u2014 the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president\u2019s going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.And I\u2019ll note that California senator \u2014 Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, \u201cgive me your guns, I\u2019m rounding them up,\u201d she would.And let me make a final point on this. Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment. Unless you are clinically insane...(LAUGHTER)... that\u2019s what you say in a primary. But the voters are savvier than that. They recognize that people\u2019s actions don\u2019t always match their words. I\u2019ve got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.There\u2019s a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race. There\u2019s a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...(BELL RINGS) ... and there\u2019s a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans \u2014 we defeated that gun control legislation.And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.BARTIROMO: Senator...(APPLAUSE)... let me follow up and switch gears.Senator Cruz, you suggested Mr. Trump, quote, \u201cembodies New York values.\u201d Could you explain what you mean by that?CRUZ: You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: I am from New York. I don\u2019t.CRUZ: What \u2014 what \u2014 you\u2019re from New York? So you might not.(LAUGHTER)But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.(APPLAUSE)And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York. But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.And \u2014 and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked \u2014 my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen\u2019s \u201cBorn in the USA\u201d, and I was asked what I thought of that.And I said, \u201cwell, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, \u2018New York, New York\u2019?\u201d And \u2014 and \u2014 you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.The New York Times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign.Not too many years ago, Donald did a long interview with Tim Russert. And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he\u2019s describing now.And his explanation \u2014 he said, \u201clook, I\u2019m from New York, that\u2019s what we believe in New York. Those aren\u2019t Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York.\u201d And so that was his explanation.And \u2014 and I guess I can \u2014 can frame it another way. Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan. I\u2019m just saying.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: Are you sure about that?CAVUTO: Maria...TRUMP: So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.(APPLAUSE)And just so \u2014 if I could, because he insulted a lot of people. I\u2019ve had more calls on that statement that Ted made \u2014 New York is a great place. It\u2019s got great people, it\u2019s got loving people, wonderful people.When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York. You had two one hundred...(APPLAUSE)... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down. I saw them come down. Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction. I was down there, and I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death \u2014 nobody understood it. And it was with us for months, the smell, the air. And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers. And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Governor bush, for the third time in as many months, the Iranians have provoked us, detaining us, as we\u2019ve been discussing, with these 10 Navy sailors Tehran had said strayed into their waters. The sailors were released, but only after shown on video apologizing for the incident. This occurring only weeks after Iran fired multiple rockets within 1,500 yards of a U.S. aircraft carrier and then continued to test medium range missiles.Now you\u2019ve claimed that such actions indicate Tehran has little to fear from a President Obama. I wonder, sir, what would change if they continued doing this sort of thing under a President Jeb Bush?BUSH: Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military. Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy\u2019s going to be cut again. It\u2019s now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.The deployments are too high for the military personnel. We don\u2019t have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment. The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman. The planes are older than the pilots. We\u2019re gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we\u2019re back in the game.Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board. We should reimpose sanctions, they\u2019ve already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we\u2019re back in the game with Israel \u2014(APPLAUSE)... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations. The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak. This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran. We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Thank you, Governor. Governor Kasich, while everyone has been focusing on Iran\u2019s provocations, I\u2019m wondering what you make of what Saudi Arabia has been doing and its recent moves in the region, including its execution of a well-known Shi\u2019ite cleric and its move to dramatically increase oil production, some say in an effort to drive down oil prices and force a lot of U.S. oil producers out of business.Sure enough, oil prices have tumbled. One brokerage house is predicting a third or more of American oil producers and those heavily invested in fracking will go bankrupt, and soon Saudi Arabia and OPEC will be back in the driver\u2019s seat.U.S. energy player Harold Hamrie similarly told me with friends like these, who needs enemies? Do you agree?KASICH: Well, let me \u2014 let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience. I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina. Let em also tell you...(APPLAUSE)... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense. And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems. So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it\u2019s so critical for us to be energy independent, and we\u2019re getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.We\u2019re seeing it in my state and we\u2019ll see it in this country. And that\u2019s why we must make sure we continue to frack.In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they\u2019re funding radical clerics through their madrasses. That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way. And I was going to tell you, whether I\u2019m president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we\u2019re going to support you, we\u2019re in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you\u2019ve got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.(APPLAUSE)So look, in foreign policy \u2014 in foreign policy, it\u2019s strength, but you\u2019ve got to be cool. You\u2019ve got to have a clear vision of where you want to go. And I\u2019m going to tell you, that it \u2014 I\u2019m going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can\u2019t do on the job training.I\u2019ve seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War. You see what the Saudi\u2019s \u2014 deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they\u2019re going right with us. And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.Thank you.CAVUTO: Thank you John.BARTIROMO: There\u2019s much more ahead including the fight against ISIS. More from Charleston, South Carolina when we come right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: We welcome back to the Republican Presidential Debate, right back to the questions.Candidates, the man who made fighting ISIS the cornerstone of his campaign, South Carolina Senator, Lindsey Graham is out the race but he joins us tonight in the audience.(APPLAUSE)He says, \u201cthe air-strike now in their 16th month have been ineffective.\u201d Dr. Carson ...CARSON: Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?BARTIROMO: The air-strikes.CARSON: OK.BARTIROMO: Now in their 16th month are ineffective. Dr. Carson, do you think Senator Graham is right in wanting to send 20,000 troops \u2014 ground troops to Iraq and Syria to take out ISIS?CARSON: Well, there\u2019s no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don\u2019t believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.I think we need to do a lot more than we\u2019re doing. Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, \u201cwhat do you need in order to accomplish this goal?\u201dOur decision is, then, do we give them what we need. I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don\u2019t tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.In addition to that...(APPLAUSE)... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue. You know, some of these \u2014 these engagement rules that the administration has \u2014 \u201cwe\u2019re not going to bomb a tanker that\u2019s coming out of there because there might be a person in it\u201d \u2014 give me a break.Just tell them that, you put people in there, we\u2019re going to bomb them. So don\u2019t put people in there if you don\u2019t want them bombed. You know, that\u2019s so simple.(APPLAUSE)And then we need to shut down \u2014 we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers. Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go. They should be running all the time, then they won\u2019t have time to plan attacks against us.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir. Senator Graham has also said that the U.S. will find Arab support for its coalition if it removes Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. And I quote, \u201cThe now king of Saudi Arabia told us, \u2018you can have our army, you just got to deal with Assad.\u2019\u201cThe emir of Qatar said, \u2018I\u2019ll pay for the operation, but they are not going to fight ISIS and let Damascus fall into the hands of the Iranians. Assad has to go.\u2019\u201dGovernor Christie, how important is it to remove Assad from power and how would you do it?CHRISTIE: Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot. You think about it \u2014 this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state \u2014 drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we\u2019re going to attack.He used chemical weapons, he\u2019s killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing. In fact, he\u2019s done worse than nothing.This president \u2014 and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer \u2014 she called Assad a reformer. Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad. The fact of the matter is we\u2019re not going to have peace \u2014 we are not going to have peace in Syria. We\u2019re not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don\u2019t have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.The Syrians should stay in Syria. They shouldn\u2019t be going to Europe. And here\u2019s the last piece...(APPLAUSE)... you\u2019re not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge. You\u2019re simply not. And so Senator Graham is right about this.And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.And believe me, Assad is not worth it. And if you\u2019re going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you\u2019re going to give her another four years, that\u2019s why I\u2019m speaking out as strongly as I am about that.Hillary Clinton cannot be president. It will lead to even greater war in this world. And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.That makes the world less peaceful, less safe. In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.(APPLAUSE)Mr. Trump \u2014 Mr. Trump, your comments about banning Muslims from entering the country created a firestorm. According to Facebook, it was the most-talked-about moment online of your entire campaign, with more than 10 million people talking about the issue.Is there anything you\u2019ve heard that makes you want to rethink this position?TRUMP: No.(LAUGHTER)No.(APPLAUSE)Look, we have to stop with political correctness. We have to get down to creating a country that\u2019s not going to have the kind of problems that we\u2019ve had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the \u2014 with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world. I just left Indonesia \u2014 bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.We have to find out what\u2019s going on. I said temporarily. I didn\u2019t say permanently. I said temporarily. And I have many great Muslim friends. And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, \u201cDonald, thank you very much; you\u2019re exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it.\u201dAnd unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what\u2019s going on, he can\u2019t use the term for whatever reason. And if you can\u2019t use the term, you\u2019re never going to solve the problem. My Muslim friends, some, said, \u201cthank you very much; we\u2019ll get to the bottom of it.\u201dBut we have a serious problem. And we can\u2019t be the stupid country any more. We\u2019re laughed at all over the world.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: Donald, Donald \u2014 can I \u2014 I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS. The Kurds are our strongest allies. They\u2019re Muslim. You\u2019re not going to even allow them to come to our country?The other Arab countries have a role to play in this. We cannot be the world\u2019s policeman. We can\u2019t do this unilaterally. We have to do this in unison with the Arab world. And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.(APPLAUSE)So I hope you\u2019ll reconsider. I hope you\u2019ll reconsider. The better way of dealing with this \u2014 the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the \u2014 Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it\u2019s harder if they\u2019ve been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder \u2014 make the screening take place.We don\u2019t have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously? What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?CAVUTO: But you said \u2014 you said that he made those comments and they represented him being unhinged after he made them.BUSH: Yeah, they are unhinged.CAVUTO: Well \u2014 well, after he made them...(APPLAUSE)... his poll numbers went up eight points in South Carolina. Now \u2014 now, wait...TRUMP: Eleven points, to be exact.CAVUTO: Are you \u2014 are you saying \u2014 are you saying that all those people who agree with Mr. Trump are unhinged?BUSH: No, not at all, absolutely not. I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically. I totally get that. But we\u2019re running for the presidency of the United States here. This isn\u2019t \u2014 this isn\u2019t, you know, a different kind of job. You have to lead. You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it\u2019s just politics.Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength. And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I\u2019m asking him to consider changing his views.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: I want security for this country. OK?(APPLAUSE)I want security. I\u2019m tired of seeing what\u2019s going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot. I want security for this country. We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam. We have a tremendous problem. It\u2019s not only a problem here. It\u2019s a problem all over the world.I want to find out why those two young people \u2014 those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them \u2014 people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them. I want to find out \u2014 many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment. Why weren\u2019t they vigilant? Why didn\u2019t they call? Why didn\u2019t they call the police?According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.And by the way, the police are the most mistreated people in this country. I will tell you that.(APPLAUSE)The most mistreated people. In fact, we need to \u2014 wait a minute \u2014 we need vigilance. We have to find out \u2014 many people knew about what was going on. Why didn\u2019t they turn those two people in so that you wouldn\u2019t have had all the death?There\u2019s something going on and it\u2019s bad. And I\u2019m saying we have to get to the bottom of it. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying. We need security.BARTIROMO: We \u2014 we want to hear from all of you on this. According to Pew Research, the U.S. admits more than 100,000 Muslim immigrants every single year on a permanent lifetime basis. I want to ask the rest of you to comment on this. Do you agree that we should pause Muslim immigration until we get a better handle on our homeland security situation, as Mr. Trump has said?Beginning with you, Governor Kasich.KASICH: I \u2014 I\u2019ve been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees. And the reasons why I\u2019ve done is I don\u2019t believe we have a good process of being able to vet them. But you know, we don\u2019t want to put everybody in the same category. And I\u2019ll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago. If we\u2019re going to have a coalition, we\u2019re going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states. We need Jordan.We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.(BELL RINGS)It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we\u2019re going to need it again. And if we try to put everybody in the same \u2014 call everybody the same thing, we can\u2019t do it. And that\u2019s just not acceptable.But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir, we want to hear from the rest of you,Governor Christie, your take.CHRISTIE: Now Maria, listen. I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind. And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe. That\u2019s the end of the conversation.I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue. Here\u2019s the way you need to deal with it. You can\u2019t just ban all Muslims. You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists. You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.(BELL RINGS)And this summer, we didn\u2019t do that. We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president. Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I\u2019m president, we\u2019ll make our intelligence community strong, and won\u2019t have to keep everybody out, we\u2019re just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don\u2019t harm us.BARTIROMO: Senator Rubio, where do you stand?RUBIO: Well, first of all, let\u2019s understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that\u2019s out there about this whole issue. Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck. They are much more than that. This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region. This is not some small scale group.They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world. So you know what needs to happen, it\u2019s a very simple equation, and it\u2019s going to happen when I\u2019m president. If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Senator Cruz, where do you stand? Senator Cruz?CRUZ: You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism. What should we do? First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I\u2019ve introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I\u2019ve introduced...(BELL RINGS)... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory. Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.If I\u2019m elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida. When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS(APPLAUSE).BARTIROMO: Dr. Carson, where do you stand? Do you agree with Mr. Trump?CARSON: Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem. But like all of our problems, there isn\u2019t a single one that can\u2019t be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics. And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that. And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place. They have infrastructure. All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November. Let\u2019s listen to them and let\u2019s not listen to our politicians.BARTIROMO: So, to be clear, the both of you do not agree with Mr. Trump?BUSH: So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies \u2014 that we need to build better relationships with? Of course not. What we need to do is destroy ISIS.I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a \u201cNo Fly Zone\u201d and \u201cSafe Zones\u201d to make sure refugees are there. We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria. We need to embed with \u2014 with the Iraqi military. We need to arm the Kurds the directly. We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters. That\u2019s how you solve the problem. You don\u2019t solve it by big talk where you\u2019re banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.BARTIROMO: Thank you governor.CAVUTO: Mr. Trump, sometimes maybe in the heat of the campaign, you say things and you have to dial them back. Last week, the New York Times editorial board quoted as saying that you would oppose, \u201cup to 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods.\u201dTRUMP: That\u2019s wrong. They were wrong. It\u2019s the New York Times, they are always wrong.CAVUTO: Well...TRUMP: They were wrong.CAVUTO: You never said because they provided that...TRUMP: No, I said, \u201c I would use \u2014 \u201c they were asking me what to do about North Korea. China, they don\u2019t like to tell us but they have total control \u2014 just about, of North Korea. They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.They say, \u201c well, we don\u2019t really have control.\u201d Without China, North Korea doesn\u2019t even eat. China is ripping us on trade. They\u2019re devaluing their currency and they\u2019re killing our companies. Thousands of thousands \u2014 you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we\u2019ve lost \u2014 50,000 because of China.(CROSSTALK) CAVUTO: So they\u2019ve never said to put a tariff on their...TRUMP: We\u2019ve lost anywhere between four and seven million jobs because of China. What I said then was, \u201cwe have very unfair trade with China. We\u2019re going to have a trade deficit of 505 billion dollars this year with China.\u201d A lot of that is because they devalue their currency.What I said to the New York Times, is that, \u201cwe have great power, economic power over China and if we wanted to use that and the amount \u2014 where the 45 percent comes in, that would be the amount they saw their devaluations that we should get.\u201d That we should get.What I\u2019m saying is this, I\u2019m saying that we do it but if they don\u2019t start treating us fairly and stop devaluing and let their currency rise so that our companies can compete and we don\u2019t lose all of these millions of jobs that we\u2019re losing, I would certainly start taxing goods that come in from China. Who the hell has to lose 505 billion dollars a year?CAVUTO: I\u2019m sorry, you lost me.TRUMP: It\u2019s not that complicated actually.CAVUTO: Then I apologize. Then I want to understand, if you don\u2019t want a 45 percent tariff, say that wasn\u2019t the figure, would you be open \u2014 are you open to slapping a higher tariff on Chinese goods of any sort to go back at them?TRUMP: OK, just so you understand \u2014 I know so much about trading about with China. Carl Icahn today as you know endorsed. Many businessmen want to endorse me.CAVUTO: I know...TRUMP: Carl said, \u201cno, no \u2014 \u201c but he\u2019s somebody \u2014 these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing and we have problems like this. If these are the kinds of people \u2014 we should use our best and our finest.Now, on that tariff \u2014 here\u2019s what I\u2019m saying, China \u2014 they send their goods and we don\u2019t tax it \u2014 they do whatever they want to do. They do whatever what they do, OK. When we do business with China, they tax us. You don\u2019t know it, they tax us.I have many friends that deal with China. They can\u2019t \u2014 when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed. If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal \u2014 so we don\u2019t have an equal playing field. I\u2019m saying, absolutely, we don\u2019t have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.I\u2019m a free trader. I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate. I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine. I sell tens\u2019 of millions of (inaudible).I love China. I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can\u2019t believe how stupid the American leadership is.CAVUTO: So you\u2019re open to a tariff?TRUMP: I\u2019m totally open to a tariff. If they don\u2019t treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed. You can\u2019t deal in China without tariffs. They do it to us, we don\u2019t it. It\u2019s not fair trade.KASICH: Neil, Neil \u2014 can I say one thing about this. I\u2019m a free trader. I support NAFTA. I believe in the PTT because it\u2019s important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China. And we do need China \u2014 Donald\u2019s right about North Korea.I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don\u2019t proliferate all these dangerous materials. But what he\u2019s touching \u2014 talking about, I think has got merit. And I\u2019ll allow putting that tariff or whatever he\u2019s saying here...TRUMP: I\u2019m happy to have him tonight...(LAUGHTER)KASICH: For too long \u2014 no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people\u2019s jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us. And guess what? The worker\u2019s out of a job.So when they \u2014 be found against that country that\u2019s selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker? Oh, well, you know, it just didn\u2019t work out for you.I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade. And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need \u2014 we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.And I want to just suggest to you. How do I know this? Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn\u2019t work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar. And the fact is those jobs are critical, they\u2019re hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they\u2019re Americans and they carry the load. So let\u2019s demand open trade but fair trade in this country. That\u2019s what I think we need to do.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: All right.RUBIO: But on this point, if I may add something on this point. We are all frustrated with what China is doing. I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here\u2019s why.China doesn\u2019t pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff. If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there\u2019s a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.It begins with tax reform. Let\u2019s not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world. Let\u2019s allow companies to immediately expense.(APPLAUSE)It continues with regulatory reform. Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.How about Obamacare, a certified job killer? It needs to be repealed and replaced. And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger. That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.TRUMP: Neil, the problem \u2014BARTIROMO: We\u2019re getting \u2014TRUMP: \u2014 with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they\u2019re sucking us dry and it takes too long. It would just \u2014 you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money. We just can\u2019t do it any longer.CAVUTO: He is right. If you put a tariff on a good, it\u2019s Americans who pay.BUSH: Absolutely.TRUMP: You looking at me?BUSH: Yeah.BARTIROMO: Prices go higher for \u2014TRUMP: Can I tell you what? It will never happen because they\u2019ll let their currency go up. They\u2019re never going to let it happen.Japan, the same thing. They are devaluing \u2014 it\u2019s so impossible for \u2014 you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what\u2019s happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph). Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan. Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they\u2019ve de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can\u2019t buy a Caterpillar tractor. And we\u2019re letting them get away with it and we can\u2019t let them get away with it.And that\u2019s why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: Here\u2019s \u2014 apart from the \u2014 apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.BARTIROMO: Yeah.BUSH: So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes \u2014 the equivalent of it goes to China. Or how about Boeing right here within a mile? Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn\u2019t retaliate and start buying Airbus? Of course, they would. This would be devastating for the economy. We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.BARTIROMO: Real quick, Senator \u2014 go ahead, Senator Cruz.(APPLAUSE)And then we have to get to tax reform.TRUMP: And we don\u2019t need a weak person being president of the United State, OK? Because that\u2019s what we\u2019d get if it were Jeb \u2014 I tell you what, we don\u2019t need that.AUDIENCE: Boo.TRUMP: We don\u2019t need that. That\u2019s essentially what we have now, and we don\u2019t need that. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re in the trouble that we\u2019re in now. And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look. They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China. They don\u2019t want them made here. They want those planes made in China.BUSH: They\u2019re a mile away from here.TRUMP: That\u2019s not the way the game is supposed to be played.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Governor Bush. Thank you, Mr. Trump. Very briefly.BUSH: My name was mentioned. My name was mentioned here. The simple fact is that the plane that\u2019s being build here is being sold to China. You can \u2014 if you \u2014 you flew in with your 767, didn\u2019t you? Right there, right next to the plant.TRUMP: No, the new planes. I\u2019m not talking about now, I\u2019m talking about in the future they\u2019re building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Mr. Trump.BUSH: When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the \u2014BARTIROMO: Thank you, Mr. Trmup. Thank you, Governor.TRUMP: I\u2019ll check for you.BUSH: Check it out.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: Senator briefly.CRUZ: Thanks for coming back to me, Maria. Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground. Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere. They discussed how \u2014 how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers. They\u2019re protectionist.History suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they\u2019ll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I\u2019ve introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...(APPLAUSE)... and here\u2019s the critical point, Maria \u2014 the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they\u2019re border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.It\u2019s tax-free \u2014 a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers \u2014 and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax. It\u2019s like a tariff, but here\u2019s the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there\u2019s no reciprocal...(BELL RINGS)... tariffs that come against us. It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...(UNKNOWN): Maria...CRUZ: ... and as president, I\u2019m going to fight for the working men and women.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: We\u2019ve got to get to tax reform, gentlemen. We\u2019ve got to get to tax reform, and we\u2019ve got to get to the...(UNKNOWN): Yeah, but I want to talk about taxes.BARTIROMO: ... we\u2019ve got to get to the national debt as well. Coming up next, the growing national debt, the war on crime, tax reform. More from North Charleston, South Carolina, when we come right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate here in North Charleston. Right back to the questions.(APPLAUSE)Governor Christie, we have spoken much about cutting spending, given the $19 trillion debt. But according to one report, America needs $3.6 trillion in infrastructure spending by 2020.Here in South Carolina, 11 percent of bridges are considered structurally deficient, costing drivers a billion dollars a year in auto repairs. What is your plan to fix the ailing roads and bridges without breaking the bank?CHRISTIE: Well, I\u2019m glad you asked that, Maria. Here\u2019s \u2014 here\u2019s our plan. We\u2019ve all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world \u2014 and we double tax, as you know.And what that\u2019s led to over $2 trillion of American companies\u2019 monies that are being kept offshore, because they don\u2019t want to pay the second tax. And who can blame them? They pay tax once overseas. They don\u2019t want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given \u2014 bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.Bring the money \u2014 the $2 trillion \u2014 back to the United States. We\u2019ll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money. And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.It would not necessitate us raising any taxes. It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about. And \u2014 and \u2014 and the last piece of this, Maria, is this. You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America. He\u2019s penalized \u2014 and doesn\u2019t understand. In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.You\u2019ve seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration. That\u2019s wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country. We\u2019d rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we\u2019d work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.And remember this \u2014 I\u2019m credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I\u2019ve vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history. We don\u2019t need to raise taxes to get this done.We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir. Dr. Carson...(APPLAUSE)... it is true U.S. companies have $2 trillion in cash sitting overseas right now. That could be used for investment and jobs in America.Also, several companies right now are pursuing mergers to move their corporate headquarters abroad, and take advantage of much lower taxes. What will you do to stop the flow of companies building cash away from America, and those leaving America altogether?CARSON: Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that\u2019s what we have proposed. A flat tax for everybody \u2014 no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money. You know, I \u2014 my \u2014 my mother taught me this. You know, she only had a third-grade education, but \u2014 you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn\u2019t make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car. In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation. But...(LAUGHTER)... you know, the \u2014 the \u2014 the fact of the matter is \u2014 you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations \u2014 because every regulation is a tax, it\u2019s a \u2014 on goods and services. And it\u2019s the most regressive tax there is.You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up \u2014 you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that. A rich person does not. Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our \u2014 our \u2014 our people like this. And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it\u2019s those evil rich people.It\u2019s not the evil rich people. It\u2019s the evil government that is \u2014 that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can\u2019t survive.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.Senator Rubio...TRUMP: Maria \u2014 Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion. It\u2019s one of the biggest problems our country has. Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs \u2014 leave them behind. They\u2019re leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can\u2019t get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in. But they can\u2019t get along. They can\u2019t even make a deal.Here is the case, they both agree, they can\u2019t make a deal. We have to do something. Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have. So many companies are going to leave our country.BARTIROMO: Which is why we raised it.Senator Rubio?Thank you, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: Thank you.BARTIROMO: One of the biggest fiscal challenges is our entitlement programs, particularly Social Security and Medicare. What policies will you put forward to make sure these programs are more financially secure?RUBIO: Well, first let me address the tax issue because it\u2019s related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: Here is the one thing I\u2019m not going to do. I\u2019m not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan. It\u2019s called the value added tax. And it\u2019s a tax you find in many companies in Europe.Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.And that\u2019s why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that\u2019s what Ronald Reagan said. Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.Now, you can support one now that\u2019s very low. But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors. Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job. And therefore, they don\u2019t get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.When I am president of the United States, I\u2019m going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you senator.CRUZ: Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.BARTIROMO: Senator Cruz, yes. You were meant to. Yes, of course.CRUZ: Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat. A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.This is a business flat tax. It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax. It goes away. It enables us to eliminate the death tax.If you\u2019re a farmer, if you\u2019re a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone. We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes. And listen, there is a real difference between Marco\u2019s tax plan and mine.Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent. Marco\u2019s top tax rate is 35 percent. My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS. Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity. We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...(BELL RINGS)... the mandates and have a simple flat tax. The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan. I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan\u2019s chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.BARTIROMO: Thank you senator.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: But that\u2019s not an accurate description of the plan. Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that\u2019s going to collect your vat tax. Someone\u2019s going to be collecting this tax.In fact, Ronald Reagan\u2019s treasury, when Ronald Reagan\u2019s treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found? That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax. Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make. They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.So there are people watching tonight in business. If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from? You\u2019re going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don\u2019t see it on the bill.And that\u2019s why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold. You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government. Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at. But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...(BELL RINGS)and they decide, we\u2019re going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we\u2019re going to raise the income tax to 30 percent. Now, you\u2019ve got Europe.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Thank you senator. I have to get to a question for Mr. Trump.CRUZ: Maria...BARTIROMO: Yes.CRUZ: Maria, I\u2019d just like to say...(CROSSTALK)CHRISTIE: Maria, I\u2019d like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements. Do you remember that, everybody? This was a question on entitlements.And the reason \u2014 and the reason...(CROSSTALK)CHRISTIE: ... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it. Here\u2019s the thing.(CROSSTALK)CHRISTIE: The fact is, the reason why...RUBIO: If you\u2019ll answer the (inaudible) core question.CHRISTIE: ... the fact is \u2014 the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s a hard problem. And I\u2019m the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this \u2014 avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes. Bernie Sanders has already said it. And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she\u2019s moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress \u2014 this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund. A Republican Congress did that.And the fact is it was wrong. And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security. We need to reform Social Security. Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that\u2019s why I\u2019m answering your question.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Governor. Thank you, Governor.(APPLAUSE) CARSON: Can I just add one very quick thing? And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan. And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best. Just want to get that out there, just saying.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Dr. Carson.Coming up, how would the candidates protect America, and another terror attack, if we were to see it. But first, you can join us live on stage during the commercial break right from home. Go to facebook.com/foxbusiness. We\u2019ll be streaming live and answering your questions during this break next.More from South Carolina coming up. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Mr. Trump, your net worth is in the multi-billions of dollars and have an ongoing thriving hotel and real estate business. Are you planning on putting your assets in a blind trust should you become president? With such vast wealth, how difficult will it be for you to disentangle yourself from your business and your money and prioritize America\u2019s interest first?TRUMP: Well, it\u2019s an interesting question because I\u2019m very proud of my company. As you too know, I know I built a very great company. But if I become president, I couldn\u2019t care less about my company. It\u2019s peanuts.I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again. I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there. Run the company kids, have a good time. I\u2019m going to do it for America.So I would \u2014 I would be willing to do that.BARTIROMO: So you\u2019ll put your assets in a blind trust?TRUMP: I would put it in a blind trust. Well, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it. If that\u2019s a blind trust, I don\u2019t know. But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn\u2019t ever be involved because I wouldn\u2019t care about anything but our country, anything.BARTIROMO: Thank you sir.TRUMP: Thank you.CAVUTO: Governor Christie, going back to your U.S. Attorney days, you had been praised by both parties as certainly a tough law and order guy. So I wonder what you make of recent statistics that showed violent crimes that have been spiking sometimes by double digit ratings in 30 cities across the country. Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn said, \u201cmost local law enforcement officials feel abandoned by Washington.\u201d Former NYC Police Chief Ray Kelly, says that, \u201cpolice are being less proactive because they\u2019re being overly scrutinized and second guessed and they\u2019re afraid of being sued or thrown in jail.\u201dWhat would you do as president to address this?CHRISTIE: Well, first off, let\u2019s face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey. He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan. He said, \u201cthere\u2019s a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country.\u201d Here\u2019s why, the president of the United States and both his attorney\u2019s general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.That\u2019s the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president. Every time he\u2019s got a chance, going all the way back to \u2014 remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time. This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey. I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here\u2019s the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country. That\u2019s where crime is happening in these cities where they don\u2019t enforce the immigration laws. And this president turns his back \u2014 this president doesn\u2019t enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn\u2019t agree with them.And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that\u2019s illegal. This president allows lawlessness throughout this country. Here\u2019s what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General. I\u2019d say, \u201cGeneral, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively. Make our streets safe again. Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them.\u201dWe do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well. I\u2019m the only person on this stage who\u2019s done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.CAVUTO: Thank you governor.Governor Kasich, as someone has to deal with controversial police shootings in your own state, what do you make of Chicago\u2019s move recently to sort of retrain police? Maybe make them not so quick to use their guns?KASICH: Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat. She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety. KASICH: And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.KASICH: And they came back with 23 recommendations. One of them is a statewide use of deadly force. And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio. Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for \u2014 for training.But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police. Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not \u2014 not to lose their life. Their family is waiting for them.At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn\u2019t work for them, but works against them.See, in Ohio, we\u2019ve had some controversial decisions. But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong. And it has been a remarkable situation in our state. And as president of the United States, it\u2019s all about communication, folks. It\u2019s all about getting people to listen to one another\u2019s problems.And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have. Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed. I\u2019ve heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I\u2019ve got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can\u2019t do it alone. You\u2019ve got to bring people together. You\u2019ve got to give people hope.And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America. And that is what\u2019s so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Thank you, Governor.BARTIROMO: Senator Rubio?(APPLAUSE)Under current law, the U.S. is on track to issue more new permanent immigrants on green cards over the next five years than the entire population of South Carolina. The CBO says your 2013 immigration bill would have increased green cardholders by another 10 million over 10 years.Why are you so interested in opening up borders to foreigners when American workers have a hard enough time finding work?RUBIO: Well, first of all, this is an issue that\u2019s been debated now for 30 years. And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who\u2019s in this country, maybe they\u2019re here illegally, but they\u2019re looking for a job. This issue is not about that anymore.First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe. And here\u2019s why. There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system. And not just green cards. They\u2019re looking \u2014 they\u2019re recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances. They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.They\u2019re looking \u2014 they\u2019re looking to manipulate our \u2014 the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States. So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States. So whether it\u2019s green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I\u2019m president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.BARTIROMO: So your thinking has changed?RUBIO: The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago. Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally. They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS. Because they\u2019re recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees. We know this for a fact. They\u2019ve contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border. And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I\u2019m president we will.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Senator.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida. We had Boko Haram. We had Hamas. We had Hezbollah. We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America. It\u2019s the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it\u2019s clear now, that border security is national security.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you, Senator.CRUZ: It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama\u2019s power to let in Syrian refugees. It enabled him \u2014 the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.I think that\u2019s a mistake. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been leading the fight to stop it. And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries. I voted yes to suspend that. Marco voted on the other side. So you don\u2019t get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.RUBIO: Maria, let me clear something up here. This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration. RUBIO: Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you\u2019re against it. You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you\u2019re against it. You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you\u2019re against it. You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.And by the way, it\u2019s not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you\u2019re against it. I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.(APPLAUSE)That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation. When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant. Edward Snowden is a traitor. And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.(APPLAUSE)And one more point, one more point. Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it. Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz. In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.Here\u2019s the bottom line, and I\u2019ll close with this. If I\u2019m president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: There\u2019s \u2014 look, there\u2019s \u2014CAVUTO: Gentlemen, gentlemen \u2014CRUZ: I\u2019m going to get a response to that, Neil. There\u2019s no way he launches 11 attack \u2014CAVUTO: Very quick, very quick. CRUZ: I\u2019m going to \u2014 he had no fewer than 11 attacks there. I appreciate your dumping your (inaudible) research folder on the debate stage.RUBIO: No, it\u2019s your record.CRUZL But I will say \u2014CAVUTO: Do you think they like each other?CRUZ: \u2014 at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false. They\u2019re absolutely false.AUDIENCE: Boo.CRUZ: So let\u2019s start \u2014 let\u2019s start with immigration. Let\u2019s start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity. Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty. I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King. Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals. I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion. What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it\u2019s simply not true. And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.CAVUTO: All right, gentlemen, we\u2019ve got to stop. I know you are very passionate about that.(APPLAUSE)Governor Bush, fears have gripped this country obviously, and you touched on it earlier since the San Bernardino attacks. Since our last debate, the national conversation has changed, according to Facebook data as well.Now this first graphic shows the issues that were most talked about right before those attacks and now after: the issues of Islam, homeland security and ISIS now loom very large. The FBI says Islamic radicals are using social media to communicate and that it needs better access to communication. Now the CEO of Apple, Governor, Tim Cook said unless served with a warrant private communication is private, period. Do you agree, or would you try to convince him otherwise?BUSH: I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators \u2014 back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country. We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff \u2014CAVUTO: Would you answer this question?BUSH: Oh, I\u2019ll talk about that, too. But you haven\u2019t asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I\u2019d get that off my chest if you don\u2019t mind.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO: Fair enough. So Tim Cook \u2014 so Tim Cook says he\u2019s going to keep it private.BUSH: I got that. And the problem today is there\u2019s no confidence in Washington, D.C. There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies. They understand that there\u2019s a national security risk. We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they\u2019re not fearful of a lawsuit.We need to make sure that we keep the country safe. This is the first priority. The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely. Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is \u2014 that is just shameful. 23 million files in the hands of the Chinese? So it\u2019s not just the government \u2014 the private sector companies, it\u2019s also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well. That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.CAVUTO: But if Tim cook is telling you no, Mr. President.BUSH: You\u2019ve got to keep asking. You\u2019ve got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue. If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship \u2014CAVUTO: Do you ask or do you order? BUSH: Well, if the law would change, yeah. But I think there has to be recognition that if we \u2014 if we are too punitive, then you\u2019ll go to other \u2014 other technology companies outside the United States. And what we want to do is to control this.We also want to dominate this from a commercial side. So there\u2019s a lot of balanced interests. But the president leads in this regard. That\u2019s what we need. We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you\u2019re talking about amendments that don\u2019t even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.CAVUTO: Governor, thank you.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: When we come right back, closing statements. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Candidates, it is time for your closing statements. You get 60 seconds each.Governor John Kasich, we begin with you.KASICH: You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don\u2019t have the power. You know, they feel like if they don\u2019t have a lobbyist, if they\u2019re not wealthy, that somehow they don\u2019t get to play.But all of my career, you know, having been raised in \u2014 by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English. You see, all of my career, I\u2019ve fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.Whether it\u2019s welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it\u2019s engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it\u2019s taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.Look, that\u2019s who I stand up for. That\u2019s who\u2019s in my mind(BELL RINGS)And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you\u2019re the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Governor Bush?BUSH: Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer? Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I\u2019ve laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.Credibility counts. There\u2019ll be people here that will talk about what they\u2019re going to do. I\u2019ve done it. I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Governor Chris Christie?CHRISTIE: Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week \u2014 the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they\u2019re feeling.They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore. They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn\u2019t understand their pain, and doesn\u2019t have any plan for getting away from it.I love this country. It\u2019s the most exceptional country the world has ever known. We need someone to fight for the people. We need a fighter for this country again.I\u2019ve lived my whole life fighting \u2014 fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.But here\u2019s the best way that we\u2019re going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Dr. Ben Carson?CARSON: You know, in recent travels around this country, I\u2019ve encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.We\u2019re not going to solve this problem with traditional politics. The only way we\u2019re going to solve this problem is with we, the people. And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity. Bencarson.com \u2014 we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Senator Marco Rubio?RUBIO: You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don\u2019t come from government. Our rights come from God.That\u2019s why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world. That\u2019s why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel. This country is changing. It feels different. We feel like we\u2019re being left behind and left out.And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn\u2019t interested in fixing America. We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.

I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who\u2019s responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter. This will end. It will end on January 2017.And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Mr. Donald Trump?TRUMP: I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers. They\u2019re tough, they\u2019re strong, they\u2019re great people. Half of them had tears pouring down their face. They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads. It was a terrible sight. A terrible sight. And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion. If I\u2019m president, there won\u2019t be stupid deals anymore.We will make America great again. We will win on everything we do. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Candidates, thank you.CAVUTO: Gentlemen, thank you all. All of you. That wraps up our debate. We went a little bit over here.

{"Headline": "Trying to Understand China\u2019s Market Upheaval", "Date": "2016-01-07", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsThe Chinese currency is down 1.5 percent against the United States dollar in fewer than four full days. That is only slightly less than the supposedly one-time depreciation that surprised global investors last summer. The latest slide prompted a sell-off in Chinese stocks, twice activating circuit breakers, which suspend trading when the benchmark CSI 300 index moves more than 7 percent. On Thursday morning, the market closed within half an hour of the opening bell.Broadly, there are two theories for what is going on. The first is that the Chinese authorities have concluded a hefty devaluation is the least bad solution to the country\u2019s economic predicament. Renewed fears of a currency war have prompted investors to flee major trading partners like Australia and South Korea, while also putting pressure on commodity prices. A barrel of Brent crude oil now sells for little more than $33.Chinese authorities counter that the renminbi is weak only when compared with the dollar. Measured against a broader basket of currencies, the renminbi was more or less flat last year. Besides, China is still running a healthy trade surplus, which lessens its incentive to seek a competitive advantage by devaluation.Yet if China really has no grand plan, that gives weight to the second theory: that planners are losing their grip on the world\u2019s second-largest economy.Last year\u2019s bungled stock market intervention and mini-devaluation punctured the myth of Chinese bureaucratic infallibility. The latest ructions reinforce the belief that officials are struggling to reconcile contradictory demands: promoting market forces while preserving stability; and rebalancing the economy while continuing to meet increasingly unrealistic growth targets.Whether China\u2019s latest market upheaval is by design or default, it\u2019s little surprise that investors are assuming the worst.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New Year, Old-Fashioned Investment Strategy", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "Supported byWealth MattersWhile no one knows how the year will play out, plenty of so-called experts are lining up to offer their opinions. But how should you weigh what they advise?Philipp Hensler, president and co-chief executive of Vontobel Asset Management, has some thoughts from his academic days. He wrote his doctoral dissertation in 2013 on how financial advisers reacted after the financial crisis.As part of his research, in 2010 he asked financial advisers around the United States what they were doing differently in their advisory practices. They all said that the financial crash had been a game changer, but 80 percent of them said they weren\u2019t doing anything differently.The advisers gave typical reasons for inaction: They didn\u2019t cause the crash; they couldn\u2019t change anything; they believed the markets would eventually heal themselves.What struck Mr. Hensler was that 20 percent of the advisers had used the crisis to rethink their roles. These advisers focused the most on their clients\u2019 specific concerns, and not on investment returns alone.This group had three characteristics in common. They were tuned in to the present investing environment. They were not leaning on what they had done in the past or what had happened years ago. And when new information came in, they tried to understand it without prejudging it.\u201cOthers made 2008 an exogenous event,\u201d Mr. Hensler said \u2014 an event that they considered beyond their control. \u201cThese advisers made it an endogenous event. They said, \u2018It\u2019s part of the system.\u2019\u00a0\u201dThese advisers had \u201chigh contextual sensitive behavior,\u201d he said. The rest were likely to be part of what he termed the \u201cequilibrium of collective wrongness\u201d \u2014 they had no desire to change what they had done wrong, because everyone had been wrong and they wouldn\u2019t be penalized for it.This distinction matters, Mr. Hensler wrote in his dissertation, because the smaller group of advisers persuaded their clients to focus on what they needed the money for and had better results for it.\u201cThey were humble, and it made them contextually aware,\u201d he said. \u201cThey weren\u2019t focused too much on the market but more on the client.\u201dFor investors who rely on advisers, these traits could matter if markets continue to be bumpy this year, as some experts predict. But relying on advisers alone, even in good times, is misplaced, said Norton Reamer, the former chief of Putnam Investments and the founder of two asset management firms that he has since sold.He said individuals, no matter their background, needed to take a greater role in their financial lives. Mr. Reamer, who is 80, has laid out four principles to help the layperson think through investing.Mr. Reamer readily admits that none of these ideas are new. \u201cThe book wasn\u2019t intended to give investment advice, but I couldn\u2019t see us creating an entity of this kind without some guideposts,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best way to look at these things is to understand what\u2019s deep down inside. You can\u2019t always do that yourself. But you can work with people who do.\u201dEven this may seem like more than many people want to do. But Mr. Reamer makes an argument akin to what doctors tell patients: There is only so much that even the best physicians can do if patients do not do their part.\u201cIt\u2019s not sensible or reasonable for any person to be completely mindless about investment,\u201d he said. \u201cInvestment is a basic element of human identity. As assets have grown in the hands of the common man or woman, and not nobility, it\u2019s become an opportunity and a responsibility to have a reasonable understanding of what investment opportunity and risk is.\u201dAs for advice on what to do this year, recommendations from Mr. Hensler, Mr. Reamer and others were not what anyone would describe as hot tips. They were sensible suggestions, regardless of the investing environment.Mr. Hensler said people should focus on companies with strong competitive positions and high earnings growth that they could understand. And, he said, they should avoid overconfident advisers.\u201cIf I was a client, the adviser I\u2019d stay away from is the mechanical adviser,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the one who has some sort of process \u2014 \u2018I\u2019m going to ask you three questions and plug in the numbers and take the 50-year average as the assumption.\u2019 That mechanical behavior is contextually insensitive.\u201dKarl Wellner, chairman of Papamarkou Wellner Asset Management, which manages about $3 billion, made an argument, akin to Mr. Reamer\u2019s, for looking closely at where your money is going.\u201cJust because it says Dec. 31 doesn\u2019t change the fundamentals,\u201d Mr. Wellner said. \u201cCompanies don\u2019t change overnight because the calendar says so. We talk about quality. Quality wins at the end of the day.\u201dHe added, \u201cMore than ever when times are volatile, it\u2019s more important to have managed mandates.\u201dJohn Apruzzese, chief investment officer at Evercore Wealth Management, which advises wealthy clients, said he was directing all clients to focus on making good choices. Constructing a portfolio strategically is the key to staying on track if markets get scary this year, he said.\u201cAs far as the stock market goes, you can\u2019t predict it over one to two years,\u201d Mr. Apruzzese said. \u201cOver a longer period stocks represent the highest return on investments, so it\u2019s a time horizon issue. That gets back to portfolio construction. You don\u2019t want to have such a high proportion of stocks that they panic and sell out at the bottom.\u201dAs for Mr. Reamer, with his six decades of experience he offered the surest advice of all: diversification. \u201cThe lessons of investment theory have shown that diversification is a powerful tool whose risk-adjusted benefits are practically free,\u201d Mr. Reamer wrote.That\u2019s boring advice, but it may be some of the best when there is so much uncertainty going into this year.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "After a Tumultuous Year for Investors, the Experts Look Ahead", "Date": "2015-12-31", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseBut low gas prices and a strong dollar were good for United States consumers, who had more money to spend, lifting the American economy. Even though broad market averages were flat, United States stocks reached lofty valuations by historical measures.These are some of the big questions preoccupying investors as the new year gets underway. For answers, I turned to some of 2015\u2019s most successful investors and analysts for my annual look at the year ahead.\u25a0So much went wrong for investors in energy and other commodities this year that it\u2019s hard to imagine that 2016 could be any worse. This week, a barrel of Brent crude approached $36, the lowest since 2004, continuing what appears to be a record decline from over $100 a barrel in June 2014.The strong dollar added downward pressure on oil and commodities, which are priced in dollars, as the Federal Reserve pursued a tighter monetary policy. Global demand for oil grew in 2015, but not nearly fast enough to keep pace with supply. And China\u2019s economy, where rapid growth was supposed to drive demand for years, cooled noticeably.With oil prices so low, it\u2019s tempting to say the worst is over, as many hedge fund managers did earlier in 2015, only to get burned. But Damien Courvalin, senior strategist in the Global Investment Research Commodities team at Goldman Sachs, told me this week that it was too soon for the all-clear signal. While Goldman expects oil prices to recover eventually, even by late 2016, over the near term the same forces that drove prices to new lows in the last year, starting with oversupply, shadow the market. Goldman\u2019s three-month forecast for oil prices is $38, about where they are now, but they could go as low as $20, Mr. Courvalin suggested.\u201cWe\u2019re more concerned about the downside risks than the upside potential at this point,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople keep asking if it\u2019s time to get excited about energy, but we believe that conversation is premature.\u201dIn theory, slumping prices, and the resulting financial stress for marginal producers, should lead to cutbacks in production. There have been some, \u201cbut supply has proven surprisingly resilient,\u201d Mr. Courvalin said. After a long period of capital investment driven by high prices for oil and other commodities, many production facilities are only now coming on line, \u201cand they\u2019re going to produce, no matter what the price,\u201d Mr. Courvalin said.He compared recent oil price moves to the period from 1976 to 1989. After peaking in 1980, oil prices fell through much of the \u201880s, finally bottoming in 1988. So far, the current period, beginning in 2005, looks similar. If the pattern continues \u2014 a big if \u2014 a recovery should begin by 2018, which is still two years away. \u201cIt could even be another decade,\u201d Mr. Courvalin said, \u201cbefore prices sustainably return to the levels of the past few years.\u201d\u25a0Mr. Heugh, who is based in Hong Kong, manages the Morgan Stanley Institutional Fund Global Opportunity Portfolio, which gained over 20 percent in 2015. Mr. Nadel is senior portfolio manager in New York for Royce\u2019s International Premier Investment Fund, which gained over 17 percent in 2015, and the Royce European Small-Cap Fund, up nearly 14 percent. Both managers invest in relatively concentrated portfolios, by fund standards, that don\u2019t closely track broad indexes, which helped them outperform their respective indexes in the last year by a large margin. And both avoided the energy sector. Mr. Heugh\u2019s largest holdings as of November were Facebook, the software concern Epam Systems and Amazon. Mr. Nadel\u2019s were VZ Holding, a Swiss financial services company; Clarkson P.L.C., a shipping firm based in London, and Bajaj Finance in India.Several money managers are predicting another flat-to-down year for United States equities for the same reasons stocks were flat in 2015 \u2014 high valuations, expectations of rising interest rates, a strong dollar and continued weak oil and commodity prices.But both Mr. Heugh and Mr. Nadel see future opportunities in international stocks. \u201cThe U.S. has outperformed the rest of the world for quite a few years now, and the strong dollar has been exacerbating this trend,\u201d Mr. Heugh said. \u201cThese cycles tend to reverse themselves over time, sometimes violently.\u201dHe sees many opportunities in Asia, including China, which he notes is still growing, even if at a slower pace. \u201cAsia is trading at a discount to its historical multiples of free cash flow and earnings, while the U.S. and Europe are trading at premiums,\u201d he said.But Mr. Heugh focuses more on fundamental stock analysis and less on broad geographic or macroeconomic forces. He said he looked for high-quality companies with competitive advantages that deter potential competitors. Then, \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter which region outperforms in a given year or three- or five-year period, you will become partners in great businesses and have the potential to benefit as partners over time.\u201dMr. Nadel said he also looked for stocks of international companies that benefit from high barriers to entry. \u201cI\u2019m not big on predictions, but the stage is set nicely for investing internationally,\u201d he said. While the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has risen 75 percent over the last five years, international small-cap indexes have contracted slightly. \u201cDividend yields are over twice as generous outside the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cI think in 2016 we could see some catch-up.\u201dHe especially likes some companies based in India, a country with \u201csome of the best 10-year prospects in the world,\u201d and Brazil, whose market \u201chas to have hit rock bottom \u2014 at least, I hope so.\u201d He said he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about the prospects for emerging markets. He praised structural reforms in Japan and said a wave of immigration should eventually benefit developed European economies.\u25a0The long bull market in bonds sputtered in 2015, as the Fed finally raised its target federal funds rate by a quarter point for the first time since 2006. United States Treasuries and most investment-grade corporate bonds barely eked out positive returns, and junk bonds plunged in a panicky sell-off late in the year.Travis King, head of investment-grade credit at Voya Investment Management in New York, managed a 1.3 percent return for the Voya Investment Grade Credit Fund. While modest, that was better than most fixed-income funds, and Morningstar has ranked his fund the No. 1 corporate bond fund over the most recent three-year period. Mr. King said that even with the Fed expected to continue a slow but steady rise in interest rates, he anticipated modest positive returns again in 2016.\u201cOur market view is for a slow and gradual rise in the Fed funds rate, with Japanese and European rates staying very low,\u201d Mr. King said. \u201cIn that environment, we think corporate bonds will be a winning trade, but you have to be selective.\u201d In 2015, his fund rotated toward bonds from money center banks and other financial concerns, which helped it outperform its benchmark. He said he expected to continue that emphasis in 2016. \u201cWe think financials are still a good place to be overweight,\u201d Mr. King said.As for junk bonds, he said he thought that the worst of the sell-off might have run its course. \u201cYields are starting to push 9 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are still avoiding high-yield debt from the energy sector, but elsewhere you\u2019re seeing some stability. In a world where the 10-year Treasury is yielding 2.25 percent, 8 percent or 9 percent starts to look pretty interesting.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Investment Strategy to Save the Planet", "Date": "2016-01-05", "News": "If one of your New Year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resolutions was to do your part against climate change, keep reading. Now you can \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with your investments.You\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be following New York State\u00e2\u0080\u0099s example. At the Paris climate change talks last month, the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comptroller, Thomas DiNapoli, announced that the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Common Retirement Fund, for public employee pensions, will put $2 billion into a new investment fund created by Goldman Sachs that prioritizes companies with smaller carbon footprints. If that goes well, the retirement fund will put in more.The Common Retirement Fund is the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s third-largest pension fund, so it often makes news in the world of institutional investing. But this announcement is also big news for climate change.That trade-off is vanishing. In the last year, investors have been able to put money into funds that mimic the risk and return on benchmark indexes, while slashing the amount of carbon emitted by the included companies. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe expect returns equal to \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or we think could be superior to \u00e2\u0080\u0094 what we get in the Russell 1000,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said DiNapoli, referring to an index of large American companies. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be assessing the returns, and make sure it keeps to the Russell 1000. Our goal is to put even more of our public equities into the fund.\u00e2\u0080\u009dGoldman created the investment fund only for New York State. But similar funds introduced in 2014 or 2015 are open to other investors, although they have not yet attracted the capital to match New York State\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investment. And more are likely to come \u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially after New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vote of confidence in a form of green investing that may become mainstream.\u00e2\u0080\u009cGreen investing\u00e2\u0080\u009d to most people still means divestment \u00e2\u0080\u0094 selling stock in companies that produce fossil fuels, especially coal, the worst for climate change.But even McKibben acknowledges that divestment doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t affect the stock prices of fossil-fuel companies \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and it might not matter even if it did. The companies are so big that divestment has next to no financial impact on them.A second form of green investment is putting money into companies making products or services that reduce climate change: for example, solar- or wind-power producers, manufacturers of emission-cutting devices and systems, and companies that do carbon trading or energy-efficiency management. DiNapoli also announced that New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fund would invest some $1.5 billion more in its Green Strategic Investment Program, which already has $500 million in such companies.New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investment in Goldman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fund is an example of a third way. The fund starts with the Russell 1000, excluding coal producers. Then it groups companies by sector, such as health care or information technology, and within each sector increases the shares of companies with the lowest emissions, and reduces those of companies with higher emissions. Goldman will periodically re-weight the fund to try to mimic the returns of the benchmark, but to do so in the lowest-carbon way possible. Goldman says the historical performance of the basket of stocks matches the performance of the Russell 1000 while reducing carbon emissions by 70 percent.This is called index or passive investing because there is no active money manager trying to beat the market by picking stocks. Passive funds seek only to match the market, but they outperform active funds for investors 75 percent of the time, largely because the passive funds\u00e2\u0080\u0099 fees are much lower.Why do these funds matter? First, because they could become very, very big.\u00c2\u00a0Second, all companies, not just energy producers, emit carbon, and burning carbon releases far more greenhouse gas than extraction of it does. So these funds use the market to encourage all companies to reduce their emissions. By putting money into the most environmentally responsible companies in each sector, they help those companies grow at the expense of less responsible ones, while creating an incentive for all to bring down emissions.Investors have long been able to choose indexes made of companies that are mid-sized, or companies located in Eastern Europe, or pharmaceutical manufacturers, or companies that are consistent with Islamic law. Now they can also choose low-carbon companies.Can these funds be sure they will match the benchmark index? Nope. As every prospectus says, past performance is not a guarantee of future returns. But matching is easier to do with a low-carbon fund than with many other types. The portfolio is still broadly diversified, with carbon-efficient companies in each category.

{"Headline": "A Smarter\u00a0Plan to Make Retirement Savings Last", "Date": "2016-01-01", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsLAST month, President Obama inaugurated yet another way to encourage Americans to save for retirement. In the new myRA accounts, workers can save up to $15,000 in a low-fee investment plan that, like a government savings bond, guarantees the principal. The accounts are a small step toward helping households save, but they are not an effective solution to the coming retirement crisis.Starting in 2020, the numbers of very low-income elderly will rise sharply as the retired population soars to almost 56 million. More middle-class working Americans will be poor or near poor after they reach the age of 65. Most currently have inadequate 401(k)-type accounts or no retirement account at all. For good reason, voters tell pollsters that their top economic concern is retirement security.We need a bolder plan, which we are calling the guaranteed retirement account (G.R.A.). Under our proposal, all workers and employers will have to make regular payments into a G.R.A., which builds until retirement age, then pays out a supplemental stream of income until that person and his or her beneficiary die.The current system \u2014 a mix of 401(k)s and individual retirement accounts (I.R.A.s) \u2014 is broken. These plans are individually directed, voluntary and leaky. Just over half of workers don\u2019t have access to a workplace retirement plan. According to the National Institute on Retirement Security, Americans between the ages of 40 and 55 have retirement savings of $14,500, when they will need between 20 and 30 times that amount. Many people take money out before they retire. And the wealthy tend to pay lower fees and get higher subsidies for their savings.A bigger flaw is the way these plans hinder wise investing. Individualized retirement accounts are effectively restricted to short-term liquid stocks and bonds because they are designed to allow people to withdraw their money before retirement. So employees are paying for liquidity they don\u2019t need and achieving subpar results. Traditional pension plans consistently perform better because they are diversified in long- and short-term investments.In our plan, the more than 95 million workers without a pension plan would each have his or her own G.R.A. managed by an independent federal agency. Workers and employers would each contribute a mandatory minimum of 1.5 percent of the salary or contract. The current tax deduction for retirement savings would be converted to a $600 refundable tax credit to pay for the contributions of households below median income.Workers could not withdraw money early, even for emergencies \u2014 and they won\u2019t like that. But allowing exceptions creates a slippery slope. Just as Social Security is protected from early withdrawal, retirement accounts should be used for old-age income. Employers won\u2019t like paying more. But in return, they are free from administrating and worrying about providing retirement plans if they don\u2019t offer a 401(k) or pension. In the long run, employers would benefit because a nation of financially secure retirees would pre-empt higher corporate taxes.Individuals would not make investment decisions directly. Instead, low-fee diversified retirement portfolios would be created by a board of professionals who would be fiduciaries appointed by the president and Congress and held accountable to investors. The fees and investments would be much less prone to corruption because the managers\u2019 income would not depend on the investments, the fees would be disclosed, and the accounts separated from government funds and owned by the individuals.Since contributions would be pooled and fees kept low, a guarantee of a return of around 3 percent \u2014 about half the expected return on stocks over the long term \u2014 would be essentially costless even as the underlying rate fluctuated with the market and inflation. For someone making an average salary of about $48,000, a 3 percent contribution would yield about $170,000 over a lifetime. Three percent is not an adequate saving rate, it is a starting base. Our plan would provide a lifelong annuity, like a defined benefit plan, so no one would face the risk of outliving his or her money.This proposal would require federal legislation. Many states, like California, are now implementing a version of what we are proposing, but the plans aren\u2019t mature enough for us to know if they work. People in their 50s and 60s won\u2019t be helped as much as younger people, but some savings can help delay collecting Social Security. Most nations support retirees through universal two-tier systems consisting of a Social Security-type plan and funded workplace pensions. Our plan would guarantee millions of Americans safe and secure retirements that would benefit them, their families and the nation\u2019s economy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Asian Markets Follow U.S. Stocks Downward", "Date": "2016-01-20", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Markets in Asia sank on Thursday, as traders surrendered to the fears that had sent shares tumbling in Japan, Europe and the United States the previous day.Markets have been volatile this year, as slowing growth in China and lower oil prices have worried investors. Those concerns drove global markets lower on Wednesday; at the close of trading, London and Japan were down more than 20 percent from their near-term highs, in bear market territory.But through midday trading in Europe on Thursday, the Asian decline was not carrying over. All the major European indexes, including the FTSE 100 in London, were strongly higher.Markets sank shortly after opening in the United States, but quickly turned positive.Oil prices, which are expected to continue to slide when Iran increases its production and adds to the glut that has already pushed prices down, could be a boon for companies and consumers, reducing their costs. But traders have worried that the low price is also a sign of waning demand, already an issue with the slowdown in China\u2019s economy.Asian markets seemed to reflect few of these worries Thursday morning, but the calm did not last past midday. The Nikkei 225-share index, which had closed down 3.7 percent on Wednesday, lost an additional 2.4 percent Thursday. The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong reversed the 1.5 percent it had gained in the morning and was down 1.8 percent at the close.Markets in mainland China were nervous through the day. The main Shanghai index finished 3.2 percent lower, while Shenzhen shares closed 4 percent lower. The CSI 300 index of blue-chip stocks, the measure for the new \u201ccircuit breakers\u201d that caused turmoil at the start of the year, fell 2.9 percent.In Europe, the FTSE 100, which closed 3.5 percent lower on Wednesday, was up more than 1 percent through early afternoon on Thursday.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "European Central Bank Says It\u2019s Ready for New Stimulus \u2014 but Not Yet", "Date": "2016-01-21", "News": "Supported by\u201cConditions have worsened\u201d since the central bank\u2019s Governing Council met in December, Mr. Draghi said at a news conference after the central bank announced that it would leave key interest rates unchanged. He indicated that the Governing Council had been surprised by the extent of recent market turmoil as well as by plummeting oil prices, which are a factor in the eurozone\u2019s dangerously low inflation. Mr. Draghi and the council would meet again on March 10.Mr. Draghi emphasized on Thursday that the European Central Bank was poised to take further actions in the future if necessary. \u201cThere are no limits to how far we are willing to deploy our instruments,\u201d he said.Buoyed by the hope of more monetary policy intervention sooner than most analysts had expected, investors drove up eurozone stocks even as Mr. Draghi was still speaking. And the euro headed lower against the dollar \u2014 a potential positive sign for the eurozone, whose exports could become cheaper on the global market as a result.The central bank left its benchmark rate at 0.05 percent on Thursday, already a record low. The rate on deposits held at the central bank remained at negative 0.3 percent, a penalty rate intended to encourage banks to lend rather than hoard cash.For the eurozone, sustaining meaningful economic growth has been hard to achieve in recent years. And inflation has remained so low that at times the bigger concern has been that the economy might slip into a downward, deflationary spiral.More recently, the eurozone has been buffeted by the worldwide stock sell-off prompted by uncertainty in China, worries about global growth and plunging oil prices. The main stock indexes in France, Germany, Italy and Spain have all fallen 10 percent or more over the past month.Mr. Draghi expressed concern about data indicating that investors are pulling money out of China in response to market turbulence there. But he added: \u201cThe Chinese authorities have a reputation for acting responsibly. What they have done in the last few weeks shows that they are gaining control over their policy making.\u201dBut he said that conditions had changed significantly since then. \u201cThe Governing Council is open to using all the necessary instruments to cope with a situation that is materially different than the beginning of December,\u201d he said.Inflation in the eurozone has been hovering near zero since late 2014, and it was 0.2 percent in December. Such low inflation makes central bankers and economists nervous because it is dangerously close to deflation, a self-reinforcing downward price spiral that is poisonous to growth and job creation.Slumping oil prices, which the European Central Bank cannot control, are a big reason for the low inflation. Slow economic growth and 10.5 percent unemployment in the eurozone are also factors, because they make it hard for companies to raise prices.Mr. Draghi noted at the news conference that plunging oil prices alone would not necessarily be something the central bank would worry about, as they could also be a stimulus for the economy in helping businesses and households that consume energy. The problem, he said, is when low oil prices feed into a bigger downward price spiral.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to be very vigilant about that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have many reasons to be optimistic about that.\u201dIn addition, in December the central bank increased the interest penalty it charges banks to hold money in its vaults to 0.3 percent from 0.2 percent. In normal times, banks earn interest on their deposits at the central bank. But the current so-called negative deposit rate, which the central bank first put into effect in June 2014, is intended to prod banks to lend money.The measures the central bank announced in December were seen by many analysts as too timid and led to a sell-off of eurozone shares as investors had expected more aggressive action.Mr. Draghi said the expression of resolve on Thursday had the unanimous support of the 25 members of the Governing Council.\u201cOne should not have any doubt that the Governing Council not only has the power and the willingness and the determination but also the cohesion that\u2019s necessary to take the actions that are needed,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
