{"Headline": "Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum Slammed for Appearing at Donald Trump Event", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "From the looks of the polls, they had little to lose, but Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum might have lost something by choosing to attend a Trump campaign rally: respect. The winners of the last two Iowa Republican caucuses, Mr. Santorum and Mr. Huckabee have failed to catch on in the 2016 race. But some conservatives said Friday that they had sold out their campaigns and their supporters by embracing Mr. Trump, the Republican front-runner in the polls, while still running for president. Erick Erickson, the conservative blogger, said the moment marked the unofficial conclusion of their campaigns. Mr. Huckabee and Mr. Santorum also drew disdain on the conservative website Red State, where some mused that they were baldly vying to be Mr. Trump\u2019s vice-presidential pick. The mockery spilled onto social media, where some on Twitter suggested that Mr. Santorum, a former Pennsylvania senator, and Mr. Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor, were looking for scraps of exposure before they bow out of the race after the Iowa caucuses. Huckabee and Santorum are hucksters duping their supporters for money and time while selling out to the Trump + Coulter wing to sell books.Theie joint appearance could benefit Mr. Trump, however, by lending him some additional credibility with social conservative and evangelical Christians. Supporters of Mr. Santorum and Mr. Huckabee could also decide to abandon them and back Mr. Trump in the caucuses on Monday, potentially tipping the state in his direction.Mr. Huckabee defended his decision to attend the event on Thursday, arguing that it was about supporting veterans rather than embracing Mr. Trump. \u201cI\u2019m still running for president,\u201d Mr. Huckabee told CNN. \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

Chris Christie of New Jersey and former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida have begun to deliver attacks on Mr. Kasich on television and in the mail. Right to Rise, a pro-Bush PAC, is battering Mr. Kasich with harsh television ads and mail that label him \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe worst on spending of any governor in the country.\u00e2\u0080\u009dOn television, commercials attack Mr. Kasich for supporting \u00e2\u0080\u009cmassive defense cuts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and highlight his support in the 1990s for a military base-closing commission that shuttered a base in New Hampshire.A strategist for America Leads, a pro-Christie super PAC, confirmed that the group was also sending mail to New Hampshire voters that criticized Mr. Kasich\u2019s record.And separately, the American Future Fund, a conservative group that began running anti-Kasich ads on television this week, has started going after him on the radio as well, a strategist for the group said. The group, a nonprofit that does not disclose its donors, is not tied to a specific candidate in the race.Right to Rise has jabbed at Mr. Kasich on television in the past, in commercials that compared him and Mr. Christie unfavorably with Mr. Bush. But the new offensive hits a more strident note against a candidate who is perceived as being on the rise in the polls here.Chris Schrimpf, a spokesman for the Kasich campaign, said in an email that it was \u00e2\u0080\u009csad that the final legacy of Jeb Bush is to falsely tear down his fellow Republicans.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He defended Mr. Kasich\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record.\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs governor, he turned an $8 billion budget hole in Ohio into a $2 billion surplus, while cutting taxes by $5 billion including killing the death tax,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Schrimpf said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFalse attacks are what happens when you rise in the polls, but Governor Kasich is continuing his positive vision of solving problems.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIf Mr. Kasich\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign has responded with restraint to the attacks against him, a super PAC supporting his candidacy has not. The group, New Day for America, filed a complaint with the New Hampshire television station WMUR, demanding that the American Future Fund ads be pulled.Nick Ryan, the fund\u2019s president, said that it would only intensify its criticism of Mr. Kasich, and that it intended to file public-record requests in Ohio for information regarding Mr. Kasich\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to expand Medicaid in the state under the Affordable Care Act.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

In recent years, there had been suggestions that Ms. Pelosi, 75, might depart at the end of President Obama\u2019s tenure, after helping him enact an agenda and working to protect it from Republicans after they gained the upper hand in Congress.But multiple House Democrats said they saw no signs that Ms. Pelosi was preparing to step aside and that, in fact, they expected quite the opposite.

Mr. Israel dismissed that idea and said he saw no reason for her to leave. He called Ms. Pelosi one of the most driven and effective politicians ever, as evidenced by her ability to influence policy from the minority, including her impact on the compromise budget deal Congress passed last month.\u201cI can\u2019t think of anyone who has made a parliamentary minority more relevant,\u201d Mr. Israel said.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

A Republican who cares deeply about reducing income inequality, he is even considering switching parties and backing Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.Mrs. Fiorina is a former Hewlett-Packard chief executive who has brokered multibillion dollar mergers, but with polls in Iowa showing her mired in single digits, she is treating every voter like the last deal she will ever close.\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know I make sense,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Fiorina said, looking intensely into Mr. Thielges\u2019s eyes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cVote for me, come on, come on, come on.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDespite her best efforts, he remained torn.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m wavering,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Thielges said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf she was doing better I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d caucus for her, but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think she has a chance this time.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMany Iowans who came out to give Mrs. Fiorina another look only days before the caucuses on Monday said they were impressed with her presentation and thought she was warmer in person than she comes off on television.

{"Headline": "Ten Theses on Immigration", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "This is unlikely to happen; even less likely is the resignation of Angela Merkel, which I concluded the column by suggesting would be appropriate at this point. But whatever comes in Germany it\u00c2\u00a0seems very likely\u00c2\u00a0that immigration, and with it what the former National Review editor John O\u2019Sullivan calls \u201cthe national question,\u201d will dominate European and American debates for at least as long as the refugee emergency continues in the Middle East and North Africa. And since the immigration debate has long been dominated at the elite level by voices that blend an economistic view of immigration as always and everywhere a net plus\u00c2\u00a0with a cosmopolitan-utilitarian\u00c2\u00a0view of open borders (or something close) as a humanitarian obligation, it seems worth laying out some premises that I think ought to underly\u00c2\u00a0the conservative alternative to that consensus.Now to my own premises:This is true up to a point, but its logic assumes that immigrant assimilation goes reasonably well \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0that immigrants find it relatively easy to learn the language, to adapt (at least up to a point) to Western social norms, to find and hold jobs in a post-industrial economy, and that they don\u2019t simply become another set of\u00c2\u00a0 clients of the welfare state they were supposed to save. And under conditions of demographic decline the pressure to adapt\u00c2\u00a0will necessarily be weaker, because there are simply fewer natives around to define the culture into the new arrivals are expected to assimilate. (In the German case, as my column suggested, a few more years of migration at this pace could forge a rising generation in which Middle Eastern and North African immigrants are actually a near-majority.)\u00c2\u00a0In which case the odds of fragmentation and balkanization go up, because \u2026And these commonalities are a complex, in which no single variable is necessarily a trump. For instance, race and racism are obviously potentially powerful obstacles to assimilation. But as Schwarz points out, the English experience suggests that racial differences need not preclude immigrant success in cases where other cultural variables favor integration:Take a black immigrant from Jamaica in the 1950s. He\u00e2\u0080\u0094the first New Commonwealth immigrants were overwhelmingly men\u00e2\u0080\u0094was probably Anglican, likely cricket-playing, and quite possibly a wartime veteran of the British armed forces or merchant navy. Had he been schooled, he would have learned England\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history and been introduced to its literature. (Probably owing to these commonalities, today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s black Caribbean population has the highest rate of intermarriage with British whites of any minority group.) The cultural distance that separated him from a white British native was almost certainly smaller than is the chasm that today separates a white British resident of, say, Sheffield from her new neighbor, a Roma immigrant. Yet that immigrant, having almost certainly arrived from Bulgaria, Slovakia, or Romania, would be classified by UK immigration authorities as a European Union migrant\u00e2\u0080\u0094EU citizens enjoy the unfettered right to live and work in Britain\u00e2\u0080\u0094and would therefore be presumed \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhite\u00e2\u0080\u009d by researchers making extrapolations from immigration data.Likewise, immigrants whose\u00c2\u00a0ethnicity (or race or religion) looks similar on a bureaucratic spreadsheet can have very different trajectories depending on where they\u2019re actually coming from. A \u201cSouth Asian immigrant\u201d immigrant fleeing\u00c2\u00a0Idi Amin\u2019s purge of Uganda\u2019s Indian petit-bourgeoisie\u00c2\u00a0is not a \u201cSouth Asian immigrant\u201d from rural Kashmir.\u00c2\u00a0A \u201cMuslim immigrant\u201d\u00c2\u00a0from Istanbul\u00c2\u00a0is not a \u201cMuslim immigrant\u201d from eastern Syria is not a \u201cMuslim immigrant\u201d from\u00c2\u00a0Afghanistan.This dynamic applies to other ethnic groups as well. In 2007, Zhenchao Qian of Ohio State and Daniel T. Lichter of Cornell found that over the course of the 1990s, the percentage of Asians marrying whites, and Hispanics marrying whites, fell sharply, a development they attribute to rising immigration. As the size of an ethnic group increases, in-group contact and interaction increases. This in turn strengthens in-group ethnic solidarity while reducing intermarriage.This effect is particularly strong, as Schwarz notes, when marriage itself becomes a transmission belt for migrants, as it has been for many people (especially women) passing from the Muslim world to England:Two-thirds of British Muslims only mix socially with other Muslims; that portion is undoubtedly higher among Pakistanis and Bangladeshis specifically. Reinforcing this parallel life is the common practice of returning \u00e2\u0080\u009chome\u00e2\u0080\u009d for a few months every two or three years and an immersion in foreign electronic media. Integration into a wider national life is further hindered\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the retention of a deeply foreign culture is further encouraged\u00e2\u0080\u0094by the fact that most Pakistani marriages, even if one spouse is born in Britain, essentially produce first-generation-immigrant children: the one study that measured this phenomenon, conducted in the north England city of Bradford, found that 85 percent of third- and fourth-generation British Pakistani babies had a parent who was born in Pakistan. (Incidentally, that study also found that 63 percent of Pakistani mothers in Bradford had married their cousins, and 37 percent had married first cousins.)This pattern applies to economic assimilation as well: The one place\u00c2\u00a0where even the most pro-immigration\u00c2\u00a0economists generally concede\u00c2\u00a0that new immigration drags down\u00c2\u00a0low-skilled wages is among the previous cohort of immigrants. Thus the faster immigrant populations replenish themselves, the more slowly they can hope to gain ground economically relative to natives.When critics of open immigration raise this point, the rebuttal is often that well, the immigrants themselves tend to favor more immigration, so we should defer to their ethnic solidarity rather than trying to impose our view of their economic best interests. But deferring to their ethnic solidarity is a good way to ensure that assimilation happens very slowly, because \u00e2\u0080\u00a6Now, though, there is a palpable sense in the liberal circles that in the ideal society everyone would be a true citizen of the world, a dilettante of culture and religion, equally comfortable around neighbors of any race or faith or background, with no unchosen preferences or loyalties.But how much caution depends on context, and here it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to stress that \u00e2\u0080\u00a6We also aren\u2019t just a narrow sea away from\u00c2\u00a0an array of broken, chaotic, fundamentalism-ravaged societies,\u00c2\u00a0and we don\u2019t face the kind of demographic mismatch with Latin America that Europe faces with Africa. Immigration enthusiasts on the right often overstate and oversentimentalize the \u201cCatholic values\u201d that Latin American migrants share with religious conservatives in the U.S., but there is no question, none, that much of Latin America has more in common culturally with the contemporary U.S. than the Iraqi hinterland has in common with contemporary England \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or at least the parts of England that haven\u2019t become, as Schwarz puts it, \u201cmetaphorical foreign encampments\u201d within a late-modern society.So while we should be guided, no less than Europe, by a greater prudence than our leadership has shown to date, we should also recognize that what is (for Germany especially) now a crisis Over There remains as yet an opportunity for us.FollowAdvertisement"}

On Wednesday, DeepMind, a research organization that operates under the umbrella of Alphabet, reported that a program combining two separate algorithms had soundly defeated a high-ranking professional Go player in a series of five matches.Go is seen as a good test for artificial intelligence researchers because it is more complex than chess, with a far larger range of possible positions. This makes strategy and reasoning in the game more challenging.The Alphabet approach relies on the newest so-called deep learning approach combined with a more traditional type of algorithm known as a Monte Carlo, which is designed to exhaustively explore large numbers of possible combinations of moves. The researchers said they had also trained their program using input from expert human Go players.The research and the game have created a rivalry among the public relations departments of companies like Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook.There will be a $1 million prize for the winner, and Mr. Hassabis said that Alphabet would donate the prize to charity if AlphaGo won. The match will be streamed live on YouTube.Mr. Hassabis, who is a skilled chess player and has been a professional gamer as well, said that Go was a beautiful game, but that \u00e2\u0080\u009cbuilding an A.I. is also a human endeavor and a kind of ingenious one, too.

{"Headline": "Brazil\u2019s Digital Backlash", "Date": "2016-01-12", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsBrazilians take their social media very seriously. The country has one of the fastest growing populations of Internet users in the world. Online tools like Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp are used not only to express opinions; they are an affordable alternative to exorbitantly priced Brazilian telecom providers. One recent study in Brazil found that WhatsApp was used by 93 percent of those surveyed who had Internet access.The official reason for the judge\u2019s decision to suspend WhatsApp was because its parent company, Facebook, refused to comply with requests to provide personal information and communications records to prosecutors in an investigation into organized crime and drug trafficking. This is not the first time that the Brazilian authorities have jousted with tech companies. Notwithstanding the seriousness of the crimes being investigated, the judge\u2019s action was reckless and represents a potentially longer-term threat to the freedoms of Brazilians.The ruling was not entirely out of the blue. Brazil\u2019s Congress has been considering legislation that would roll back key provisions of the country\u2019s freshly minted digital bill of rights, known as the Marco Civil da Internet, which was passed in 2014. The new proposal is expected to make it easier for prosecutors to access citizens\u2019 personal information without the nuisance of having to obtain a court order.Described by critics as \u201cthe big spy bill,\u201d it would require Brazilians to register personal details like their home address, telephone number and other private information when accessing websites. It would also expose citizens to possible charges of libel for comments made on social media. At a time when political dissent is vigorous, this bill would surely chill debate.When Brazilian legislators passed the Marco Civil, the government signaled to its citizens and the international community that it took \u201cnet neutrality\u201d and digital sovereignty seriously. It was, in effect, declaring that the democratic principles of freedom, privacy and human rights were equally applicable in cyberspace as in the physical world.Last month\u2019s judicial injunction, together with retrograde proposals like the spy bill, set a dangerous precedent. For a while, the country looked to be a progressive voice for digital freedom. No one expected Brazil to become a leader in cyber surveillance and censorship.

Trump and Ted Cruz, the senator from Texas, are deploying different surrogates but similar playbooks in the state, where the Republican electorate is conservative and where each is trying hard to win.Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s closing argument began on Tuesday night with the endorsement of Sarah Palin, the Republican vice-presidential nominee in 2008, who built a grass-roots following from the ashes of defeat that year. Mrs. Palin could be a significant help to Mr. Trump, certainly in terms of news media attention.But much of the coverage of her endorsement speech was negative. Pundits and reporters took note of her rambling, edgy-seeming, sometimes-rhyming presentation in Iowa, with Mr. Trump standing nearby, occasionally looking as if he wished it would wrap up. That may not matter much, since Mrs. Palin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supporters are mistrustful of the \u00e2\u0080\u009clamestream media,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as she has described the press in recent years. And Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team was mindful enough of the potential impact of her endorsement that he clarified a negative comment from his spokesman about her support for Mr. Trump.But some Republicans see an upside for Mr. Cruz in the performance of Mrs. Palin, who, like Mr. Trump, has reality television star as a line on her r\u00c3\u00a9sum\u00c3\u00a9 and who has been absent from the national scene for many months.Those Republicans argue that Mrs. Palin and Mr. Trump could make Mr. Cruz look more presidential.But 2016 has been an unusual, and unpredictable, cycle. Mr. Cruz has criticized government subsidies of the renewable fuels industry in Iowa, but, instead of being praised by small-government conservatives, he was denounced by Gov. Terry E. Branstad, Iowa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Republican governor, and few others came to Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defense. And Mrs. Palin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s support was seen as a boon for Mr. Trump, despite Republicans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 frustration with what they see as a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccelebrity\u00e2\u0080\u009d president in Barack Obama.Her endorsement has also raised expectations for Mr. Trump in Iowa. It is a state that he can afford to lose, but it becomes harder to explain away a loss if he campaigns hard there. However, Mr. Trump is not used to losing, and he does not seem interested in starting now.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s War With Ted Cruz Turns to the Airwaves", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "In his first negative ad, Donald J. Trump targets his Republican presidential rival, Ted Cruz, and the Texas senator's stance on immigration.By NICK CORASANITIMr. Trump, in a new negative commercial, assails Mr. Cruz over immigration using footage from Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s past that shows him uncomfortable and off-script.The sparring signaled a new and more combative phase in a nomination battle that many Republicans view as rapidly narrowing to a choice between Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump, who has a substantial lead in the polls over all his rivals in New Hampshire and who in recent days appears to have erased Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advantage in Iowa, which will hold the first presidential nominating contest, on Feb. 1.On Friday, Mr. Trump released his first negative ad of the campaign, assailing Mr. Cruz as \u00e2\u0080\u009cpro amnesty\u00e2\u0080\u009d on immigration with a video of Mr. Cruz stammering his way through a Fox interview about his role in failed 2013 legislation. The Trump campaign declined to discuss specifics about future spending on the minute-long ad, including where it would air. But the negative spot \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the latest salvo in a $2 million-per-week Trump blitz on the airwaves \u00e2\u0080\u0094 suggested a protracted line of attack intended to keep Mr. Cruz on the defensive through the Feb. 20 primary in South Carolina, where Mr. Trump has a substantial lead in the polls.A Republican media buyer said that Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign had switched all of its ad reservations to 60-second spots, suggesting that it would be running the Cruz attack exclusively in the coming days. The shift underscores Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s increasing confidence that he can sweep the first three nominating contests, steamrollering Mr. Cruz and making it prohibitively difficult for other candidates to challenge him.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will do whatever it takes to win,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign manager. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will take every opportunity to outline opponents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 positions to win the nomination.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBy NICK CORASANITIIn a new ad, Senator Cruz attacks Mr. Trump over a decades-old battle to expand his casino in Atlantic City, portraying his wealth as a product of government overreach.The ad employs footage of Mr. Trump calling eminent domain \u00e2\u0080\u009cwonderful\u00e2\u0080\u009d and tells viewers that the practice is \u00e2\u0080\u009ca fancy term for politicians seizing private property to enrich the fat cats who bankroll them, like Trump.\u00e2\u0080\u009dResponding in a statement, Mr. Trump called Mr. Cruz \u00e2\u0080\u009ca total hypocrite and, until recently, a Canadian citizen who may not even have a legal right to run for president.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Cruz has endured the most challenging week of his campaign since he rose to the top tier of candidates late last year. His difficulties have been particularly acute in Iowa: On Tuesday, Iowa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long-serving Republican governor, Terry E. Branstad, publicly called for his defeat, citing Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opposition to federal ethanol subsidies for Iowa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s corn industry. On the same day, Mr. Cruz was hit from the right, when Sarah Palin, the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2008 vice-presidential candidate, swooped into Iowa to bestow her endorsement on Mr. Trump.Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump have been exchanging increasingly personal barbs and backhanded compliments in recent days. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople do not like Ted, to put it mildly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump told a New Hampshire crowd last weekend. In an interview with ABC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s George Stephanopolous that aired Friday morning, Mr. Cruz described Mr. Trump as \u00e2\u0080\u009can entertainer and marketer par excellence\u00e2\u0080\u009d who the Washington establishment believed was someone they could \u00e2\u0080\u009cmake a deal with.\u00e2\u0080\u009dYet Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign has been reluctant until now to attack Mr. Trump more directly on Iowa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s airwaves, fearing that the senator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s positive image among Republican voters could be undermined by the use of harsh ads. Polls of Iowa Republicans indicate that Mr. Cruz is the most popular candidate in the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s race, and the Texas senator is counting on picking up support from some voters now backing Mr. Trump.The campaign has also been uneasy about the potential effects of targeting an unconventional candidate like Mr. Trump, given his ability to weather the kind of headlines that would badly damage most politicians. Privately, Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aides wonder how the public will receive traditional negative commercials against the businessman.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re at the Machine Shed the Sunday before the caucuses,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a senior Cruz aide said, referring to a popular restaurant chain in Iowa, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo you want that lady to approach the table and say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Thank you for giving that Donald Trump hell\u00e2\u0080\u0099 or for her to say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I was so inspired by that last ad, thank you for doing what you are doing, God bless\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The aide commented on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly about campaign strategy.Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attack ad made it easier for the Cruz campaign to go negative, and Cruz aides argue that the story of the Atlantic City woman losing her home could undercut the real estate mogul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s populist appeal by raising questions about whether he would look out for working-class voters.Moving to highlight those distinctions, Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign on Friday announced that it had received an endorsement from Gary Bauer, a former head of the Family Research Council, a conservative organization.Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attacks echo the criticisms of Republicans who view Mr. Trump as an opportunistic convert to their ideals and as unreliable, a contrast with Mr. Cruz, who is not particularly popular among the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leaders and his fellow senators but whose commitment to conservatism is rarely questioned.Mr. Trump responded on Twitter, telling his 5.7 million followers that National Review was \u00e2\u0080\u009ca failing publication that has lost it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way.

Shortly after he took over, he rehired Franklin Foer, a well-regarded former editor.In the weeks that followed, and again in his letter to the staff, Mr. Hughes, 32, described the difficulty of maintaining tradition and carrying out his new ideas. \u201cI will be the first to admit that when I took on this challenge nearly four years ago, I underestimated the difficulty of transitioning an old and traditional institution into a digital media company in today\u2019s quickly evolving climate,\u201d he said. Mr. Hughes declined to comment beyond his letter.The New Republic, it turned out, was far removed from the Silicon Valley mind-set that Mr. Hughes and his chief executive, Guy Vidra, espoused. The magazine was partly conceived in Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s living room and, since its founding in 1914, has featured writers including Virginia Woolf and Philip Roth. It is famed for its intellectual rigor and its left-leaning political views, and has a reputation as an incubator for talented young writers and editors.At a meeting not long after he joined in 2014, Mr. Vidra, using a profanity, told the magazine\u2019s staff that he wanted to break stuff, a phrase common in the tech industry that many present felt was incongruous. Journalism was, to him, content, a view that immediately put him at odds with the literary-minded staff. The magazine\u2019s history, he said later, was a \u201ccompetitive advantage\u201d to be \u201cleveraged.\u201dDespite many changes in the last year and more than a dozen new hires, the magazine still does not make a profit, according to three people with knowledge of its finances. The atmosphere at its offices in Manhattan\u2019s Union Square on Monday was unsettled, according to former staff members, and an all-hands meeting Monday morning was described as tense.Gabriel Snyder, the magazine\u2019s top editor, declined to comment. He did post a message on Twitter saying The New Republic\u2019s staff was \u201cfocused on what we do every day: trying to make great journalism.\u201dMr. Hughes, according to two people with knowledge of his plans, has already begun to meet with prospective buyers. When he bought the magazine, those who had been interested included Yahoo and Bloomberg L.P. A person with knowledge of those talks said that the Wall Street executive Steven Rattner had also expressed interest. But the magazine has now perhaps lost some of its luster, and many of its prominent writers, and it is not clear who might follow Mr. Hughes.\u201cThe New Republic has been a money-losing proposition for 100 years,\u201d said Jacob Weisberg, who once worked for the magazine, and is now the chairman of the Slate Group. \u201cThe idea that anyone is going to turn it into a business now, when it has never been harder, is implausible.\u201dIn his letter, Mr. Hughes said that his aim \u201cis to place The New Republic in the hands of the most promising and dedicated potential steward.\u201d That might take many forms, he said. \u201cPerhaps it should be run as part of a larger digital media company, as a center-left institute of ideas, or by another passionate individual willing to invest in its future,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere are many possibilities.\u201dBut for many of those who hold The New Republic dear, Monday\u2019s letter was another unfortunate moment in Mr. Hughes\u2019s tenure.\u201cIf Chris Hughes had simply sold the magazine a year ago he would be in a much better position financially and in terms of his prestige,\u201d said Jonathan Chait, one of the contributing editors, who asked to be removed from the magazine\u2019s masthead last year and is an outspoken critic of Mr. Hughes\u2019s stewardship. \u201cThe talented people who placed their hopes in the vision of a reconstructed magazine are unfortunate victims here, and no one can feel good about this.\u201dMr. Chait said that, to him, The New Republic was fundamentally not a business proposition. \u201cA business is something that is trying to make money,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re in a town and you\u2019re trying to sell hamburgers, and everyone wants pizza, you\u2019d switch to pizza.

{"Headline": "Longer Tweets Said to Be Coming Soon to Twitter", "Date": "2016-01-05", "News": "For nearly a decade, the defining characteristic of the tweet \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the unit of communication on Twitter \u00e2\u0080\u0094 has been its brevity: Users are restricted to 140 characters.That may soon change. Twitter is experimenting with introducing a longer form of tweet, according to two people familiar with the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plans, in what would be another gradual move away from the simplistic design sensibility that the service was originally founded upon.The project, which internally has been referred to as \u00e2\u0080\u009cbeyond 140,\u00e2\u0080\u009d is still in its testing phase and is not set to be introduced until at least March, said the people, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plans. Twitter has not determined what the final tweet character limit will be, according to people familiar with the discussions. One number that has been tossed around internally is 10,000 characters, the same limit that users have inside private Twitter messages. Another possibility could be 5,000 characters, these people said. Mr. Dorsey has made clear to employees that as far as redesigning the product is concerned, no feature is sacred. Twitter has experimented with tweaking its reverse chronological timeline, for example, a move that drew some comparisons to the algorithmically curated Facebook News Feed.That being said, the new character limit extension is not likely to look drastically different than what Twitter users are familiar with. In the new design, tweets will still appear limited to 140 characters in the stream, as has typically been the case. If the content of the tweet is longer than 140 characters, users can expand it with the click of a button to read further.The idea, according to the people familiar with Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plans, stemmed from seeing the creative ways people work around the service\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current 140-character count. Some users post screenshots of large blocks of text, for instance, or so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009ctweetstorms\u00e2\u0080\u009d of multiple tweets in rapid succession, in order to circumvent the text limitations on the service. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBeyond 140\u00e2\u0080\u009d is an attempt to appease those users without completely disrupting the visual layout of Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current design.Many Twitter users were quickly up in arms after news of the possible character limitation extension became public, tweeting their disapproval for how the service might change. \u201cWe didn\u2019t start Twitter with a 140 character constraint. We added that early on for it to fit into a single SMS message,\u201d Mr. Dorsey wrote. \u201cWe will never lose that feeling.\u201d This article, by the way, is 3,501 characters in length.FollowAdvertisement"}

Mr. Dorsey confirmed some of the changes late Sunday night in a tweet.The shake-up is taking place as Mr. Dorsey, 39, attempts to reshape Twitter. The social networking service, used by presidential candidates such as Donald J. Trump and sports stars like the basketball player Stephen Curry, has failed to attract droves of new users. That has investors questioning how useful the service is for people and whether it will become a mainstream hit on the scale of Facebook or Instagram. Shares of Twitter have plunged nearly 55 percent in the last year.Mr. Dorsey has been pointed in his critique of Twitter\u2019s problems and what needs to be done to solve the issues. \u201cA greater clarity of our purpose, our objectives and putting the people that use Twitter first drives the urgency we now feel,\u201d he said last year. \u201cYou should expect Twitter to be as easy as looking out your window to see what\u2019s happening.\u201dTo grapple with Twitter\u2019s problems, Mr. Dorsey is turning to a bigger slate of directors. The San Francisco-based company plans to announce the appointment of two new board members soon, said the people familiar with the plans. While the names of the new directors could not be learned, one of them was a high-profile media personality, the people said. Twitter also plans to appoint a new chief marketing officer, they said.The additions are to be accompanied by several departures of Twitter executives. At least one executive was asked to leave, according to people familiar with the matter, while others are departing of their own volition.\u201cAll four of them will be taking some well-deserved time off,\u201d said Mr. Dorsey, who added that all of the departures were voluntary.Jason Toff, general manager at Vine, the social video app that Twitter acquired in 2012, also announced his plans to rejoin Google to work on virtual reality projects on Sunday evening.If the company meets expectations, Mr. Dorsey has said, \u201cTwitter will become the first thing everyone in the world checks to start their day and the first thing people turn to when they want to share ideas, commentary or simply what\u2019s happening.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Investors welcomed the performance by pushing up Facebook\u2019s stock more than 12 percent in after-hours trading.The results were largely a result of Facebook\u2019s enormous success in selling advertising on mobile devices, a business that the company was not even in just a few years ago. Mobile ads made up 80 percent of the company\u2019s total ad business in the fourth quarter, compared with 23 percent in the same quarter of 2012.\u201cWe have a Super Bowl on mobile in the U.S. every single day,\u201d Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook, said in an interview.The results offer a bright spot in a tumultuous climate for many American technology stocks. Shares of Twitter, Facebook\u2019s most visible social networking competitor in the United States, have tumbled more than 55 percent during the last year. Yelp, the local-review service, is down about 60 percent. LinkedIn, the professional social networking service, is off more than 15 percent.Facebook is a much larger company than many of its peers, yet it is able to keep its growth rate high. The company has notched double-digit jumps in ad revenue and in the expansion of its user base. Facebook now has 1.59 billion monthly visitors, up 14 percent from a year ago. About 1.44 billion of those people visit the site on a mobile device; 1.04 billion visit Facebook every day.That growth engine has given Facebook lots of room to play in different areas \u2014 like virtual reality, messaging and even building drones capable of delivering Internet service to far-flung places around the world \u2014 that seem to have little to do with Facebook\u2019s core business of advertising.Facebook is spending billions of dollars developing those projects, and Mr. Zuckerberg has repeatedly said the company has no plans to make money on them in the near term. In an earnings call with investors, David Wehner, Facebook\u2019s chief financial officer, said the company projected that expenses would increase roughly 30 to 40 percent over the course of 2016 compared with last year.\u201cThese are long-term bets, but we don\u2019t think they\u2019re particularly large bets relative to the size of Facebook,\u201d said Ben Schachter, an Internet analyst at Macquarie Securities. \u201cThey\u2019ve gone out of their way to say they\u2019re not Google and going after health care, for instance.\u201dOther analysts said they also saw potential for profit in the hundreds of millions of people who regularly use Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, a messaging service also owned by Facebook.They are also bullish on the potential for Instagram, the photo-sharing service that has more than 400 million regular monthly users, to become a significant source of revenue in the future. The company does not disclose what portion of revenue Instagram accounts for in Facebook\u2019s overall sales.

{"Headline": "How to Speak of the Dead", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorA MINOR media kerfuffle followed the recent passing of the Eagles guitarist, songwriter and co-founder Glenn Frey.The backlash was immediate. A day later, Mr. Kuntzman reported receiving an \u201cavalanche of hate mail\u201d and even calls for his own death.This took place atop the dissing of another acclaimed and departed musician. Even as David Bowie\u2019s life and work were being celebrated, a friend of mine noted online that some Facebook acquaintances felt obliged to say in effect, \u201cI never cared/listened/understood the attraction.\u201dIs it O.K. to publicly dump on the newly deceased \u2014 or for that matter, to offer them not-quite-heartfelt praise? It\u2019s a tough call. No one likes a hypocrite. Just the same, there is surely a time and a place for everything.The journalist and cultural critic H. L. Mencken had no doubts. When William Jennings Bryan died in 1925, he denounced the muddle-headed three-time presidential candidate and notorious opponent of evolution as \u201ca charlatan, a mountebank, a zany without sense or dignity.\u201d He added: \u201cHe was a peasant come home to the barnyard. Imagine a gentleman, and you have imagined everything that he was not.\u201dToday, plenty of naysayers are aping Mencken.In an elephantine piece for Salon in 2011 on the \u201cprotocol for public figure deaths,\u201d the journalist Glenn Greenwald scoffed at the effusive coverage years before of Tim Russert, the moderator of \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d and of Ronald Reagan. Dismissing the former as \u201cawful\u201d and \u201cpower-worshipping,\u201d Mr. Greenwald complained, \u201cWe were all supposed to pretend we had lost some Great Journalist.\u201d The latter\u2019s post-mortem \u201ccanonization,\u201d he charged, virtually ignored the Iran-contra scandal, exorbitant military spending, indifference to AIDS, vast income disparities, implicit racism and the Supreme Court nomination of Robert Bork \u2014 all in a sentence of about 160 words.The proximate peg for this invective, incidentally, was the expiration of Christopher Hitchens. Rejecting the \u201cremarkably undiluted, intense praise lavished on him by media discussions,\u201d Mr. Greenwald exhaustively savaged Mr. Hitchens for his \u201crepellent\u201d advocacy of the war on terror.Mr. Hitchens most likely would have loved it. In 1997, baffled by the worldwide grief over Princess Diana\u2019s fatal car accident, he ripped into her as \u201ca spoiled child bride, a sulky wife, a narcissist, a borderline airhead with zero interest in books, history or tradition.\u201d After the Rev. Jerry Falwell departed, he said, \u201cI think it a pity there isn\u2019t a hell for him to go to.\u201dThe Internet age and postmodern decorum being what they are, kicking at folks when they\u2019re permanently down will surely continue. Myself, having written hundreds of obituaries in my career, I tend to tilt toward balance and qualification \u2014 as called for, that is.Of course, much depends on the personality. \u201cWhen it comes to private individuals,\u201d Mr. Greenwald suggested in Salon, \u201cit\u2019s entirely appropriate to emphasize the positives of someone\u2019s life and avoid criticisms.\u201d By contrast, he felt this tone \u201ccompletely inapplicable to the death of a public person.\u201dBut who\u2019s to say where private ends and public begins? And how much posthumous opprobrium should be shoveled without tossing a posy or two, if only for decency\u2019s sake? Even the crusty Mr. Hitchens allowed that Princess Diana opposed anti-personnel land mines, enjoyed children, was kind to an AIDS-stricken friend of his, disdained excessive ceremony and \u201cwas quite nice-looking.\u201dPerhaps the best tactic in these cases is to keep mum. Silence, after all, can speak volumes. When Senator Joseph R. McCarthy died in 1957, this newspaper\u2019s publisher, Arthur Hays Sulzberger, told his editorial page editor, Charles Merz, \u201cI don\u2019t think we need an editorial on this.\u201dMr. Merz agreed. \u201cWhy dignify the bastard,\u201d he said, \u201clet him pass from the scene without more attention.\u201dOr, if you feel the need to speak out about a contentious individual, consider this advice from Dean Acheson, the secretary of state in the Truman administration.

Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, said the Bangladeshi government was wary that any indication that transnational jihadi groups were active in Bangladesh would discourage tourists and foreign investors.\u201cThis fits with the government\u2019s adamant stance that there is no I.S. connection in Bangladesh,\u201d he said, referring to the Islamic State. \u201cIn the past, they always said attacks were not by Al Qaeda, and now they are saying the attacks were not by I.S.\u201dMr. Gunaratna said that the Singaporean government was in a state of high alert after the discovery of the Bangladeshi group, and that he expected officials to continue investigations into the group\u2019s activities in the coming months and years.A spokeswoman for Singapore\u2019s Home Ministry said Saturday that the 27 Bangladeshis \u201csupported the armed jihad ideology of terrorist groups and several contemplated traveling to and participating in armed jihad in the Middle East and Bangladesh.\u201dAn article last Sunday about the filing of terrorism charges in Bangladesh against 14 Bangladeshi construction workers deported from Singapore misstated the timing of their deportation. It was in December, not the middle of January.Joe Cochrane contributed reporting from Jakarta, Indonesia; Ellen Barry from New Delhi; and Weiyi Lim from Singapore.Advertisement"}

Popular among evangelical Christians and conservatives, Mr. Cruz has become a favorite to win the first contest of the nominating process.The clash represents a shift in the Republican race because Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz have largely steered clear of each other thus far, professing mutual admiration and agreement on many issues. The billionaire businessman warned, however, that he would eventually have to go after Mr. Cruz if he continued to rise in the polls. This week he has started to make good on that threat.\u201cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a problem for him, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a problem obviously for the Republicans,\u201d Mr. Trump said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d program. \u201cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assume he got a nomination and the Democrats bring suit, the suit takes two to three years to solve, so how do you run?\u201dMr. Trump raised questions about whether Ted Cruz was eligible to be president because he was born in Canada.

Discussing the subject on Fox News on Wednesday, he said that Mr. Cruz might want to consider taking the issue to court in a pre-emptive fashion to alleviate any questions about his citizenship.As for his motives this time, Mr. Trump said that he was hopeful that Mr. Cruz\u2019s citizenship would not be a problem.\u201cI want to beat him on his own merits,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI like Ted a lot.

{"Headline": "Italians Mock Cover-Up of Nude Statues for Iranian\u2019s Visit", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Supported byROME \u2014 A decision to cover up nude statues from Roman antiquity during a visit by President Hassan Rouhani of Iran has drawn ridicule and scorn in Italy \u2014 much of it directed at the Italian government \u2014 and spurred a debate about the national identity.The statues, in a corridor leading to a grand hall in Rome\u2019s renowned Capitoline Museums, were encased in tall white boxes ahead of a news conference that Mr. Rouhani held on Monday with Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy. One of the statues was the \u201cCapitoline Venus,\u201d a Roman copy of a legendary fourth century B.C. work by Praxiteles; some of the other sculptures were of ancient Greek and Roman gods, dressed minimally, if at all.But it also left Italians asking a basic question: Who ordered the cover-up?Some media reports suggested the Iranian delegation had asked Italian officials to hide the statues to avoid Mr. Rouhani any potential embarrassment. Other reports fingered nervous (and perhaps overzealous) Italian bureaucrats. One newspaper even reported that in the grand hall at the Capitoline where the two leaders spoke, the lectern was placed to the side \u2014 not the front \u2014 of an equestrian statue of the emperor Marcus Aurelius, apparently to avoid having images of the horse\u2019s genitals appear in news photographs.The Italian government evidently did not anticipate the uproar and mocking that ensued. One cartoon making the rounds showed a bewildered Mr. Rouhani, with the boxes in the background, asking Mr. Renzi: \u201cWhere did you bring me? Ikea?\u201dBut many Italian critics said the decision to box up the nudes was no laughing matter.\u201cCovered statues, a global affair,\u201d blazoned the Milan daily newspaper Corriere della Sera, which devoted two pages of articles and commentary to the issue.Massimo Gramellini, a columnist for the Turin newspaper La Stampa, called the covering of the statues a cowardly act of \u201csubmission\u201d in a front-page editorial. It was intended, he wrote, to ensure that Mr. Rouhani did not have a \u201chormonal shock and rip up the freshly signed contracts with our Italian industries.\u201dMr. Rouhani is meeting Europeans leaders this week after the lifting of sanctions against his country under the accord Iran signed last summer with six world powers, and the European Union, to curb its nuclear program. Along with Mr. Renzi, Mr. Rouhani met with Pope Francis and was scheduled to meet with France\u2019s president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, in Paris on Thursday.Mr. Rouhani, 67, comes from a religious family, but he has a Ph.D. in law from Glasgow Caledonian University, in Scotland, and is not known as a religious hard-liner. Iran\u2019s politics are extremely complex, however, and religious matters are carefully policed by the theocratic regime that exercises ultimate power in Tehran, including the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Public depictions of nudity are largely forbidden in Iran.Mr. Rouhani himself addressed the issue on Wednesday morning, admonishing the media for stirring up a hornet\u2019s nest. \u201cI know Italians are very hospitable people and try to do everything to put their guests at ease, and I thank them for this,\u201d he said diplomaticallySome Italian critics, while not attacking Mr. Rouhani personally, accused the government of putting economic interests ahead of cultural legacy.\u201cThe problem is that those statues \u2014 yes, those icons of classicism and models of humanism \u2014 are the foundation of European and Mediterranean culture and civilization,\u201d the columnist Michele Serra wrote in La Repubblica. To conceal them, he wrote, \u201cis to conceal ourselves.\u201d To not offend the Iranian president, he wrote, \u201cwe offended ourselves.\u201dOpposition politicians accused Mr. Renzi of being spineless. \u201cThis submission, the surrendering of our art and culture, is the essence of Renzi\u2019s politics,\u201d a Forza Italia lawmaker, Renato Brunetta, wrote on his Facebook page Wednesday, accusing the prime minister of using nationalist rhetoric to gain votes but then selling out Italian values.\u201cYou can make deals, discuss ways of achieving peace, without abdicating oneself,\u201d Mr. Brunetta wrote. \u201cJust take the pope. He didn\u2019t cover the crucifixes when he greeted Rouhani.\u201dIt was noted by some that the whole brouhaha could have been avoided by holding the news conference in a different, less potentially offensive setting.Officials at the Capitoline Museum said Wednesday that the decision had been made by Mr. Renzi\u2019s office, but government officials said they had not known about it.Culture Minister Dario Franceschini insisted that neither he nor Mr. Renzi had been informed of the decision. \u201cI think there were easily other ways to not go against the sensibility of such an important guest than this incomprehensible choice to cover the statues,\u201d he told reporters Wednesday, clearly annoyed by the attention the issue has gotten.As Mr. Rouhani left Italy for his meetings with France, some Italians continued to hold forth. \u201cLet\u2019s just see what the French do,\u201d said Stefano Dorelli, a native Roman, musing over tricky questions of protocol. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t believe they would cover statues even if I saw it with my own eyes.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated when Mr. Rouhani was to meet President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France. It was Thursday, not Wednesday.Advertisement"}

The decision to break with tradition and endorse Mrs. Clinton comes as the House has approved a measure, endorsed by the leading Republican presidential candidates, that would repeal parts of the Affordable Care Act and strip away federal financing for Planned Parenthood, which provides reproductive and health care services.\u00e2\u0080\u009cEverything Planned Parenthood has believed in and fought for over the past 100 years is on the ballot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood.In a statement, Mrs. Clinton said she was \u00e2\u0080\u009chonored\u00e2\u0080\u009d by the endorsement and called the bill to defund the group \u00e2\u0080\u009ca jarring reminder of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at stake in 2016,\u00e2\u0080\u009d adding that as president she would \u00e2\u0080\u009cdefend against attacks on reproductive health care, and protect access to affordable contraception and safe and legal abortion across the country.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe endorsement, technically made through the nonprofit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advocacy arm, the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, brings with it at least $20 million to spend in this election cycle on presidential and Senate races in crucial battleground states, including New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania and WisconsinOther groups that support abortion rights, including NARAL Pro-Choice America PAC, have already endorsed Mrs. Clinton. But in Planned Parenthood\u2019s case, Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future and the group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s are intrinsically linked: Planned Parenthood needs to have a Democrat elected president to protect its funding, and Mrs. Clinton is hoping abortion rights and the Republican candidates\u2019 positions will motivate female voters to support her.In almost every speech, Mrs. Clinton receives some of her most rousing applause with the line: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am for a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right to choose, and I will fight against efforts to defund Planned Parenthood.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe Clinton campaign has functioned almost as a marketing arm for Planned Parenthood, featuring a section on its official website titled \u00e2\u0080\u009c17 times Hillary Clinton stood with Planned Parenthood,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Facebook messages and Instagram posts with the hashtag #StandwithPP. (Ms. Richards\u2019 daughter works on the campaign\u2019s staff in Iowa.)The strategy has merits. While Republican promises to restrict abortion rights resonate with conservative voters, polls show that access to legal abortion is one of the most motivating issues for female voters, particularly in critical swing states.The endorsement does not come without risks for Mrs. Clinton. Planned Parenthood is a polarizing topic and the group suffered damaging public relations setbacks this summer when anti-abortion rights activists released video of an official from the group discussing the price of providing fetal parts. Mrs. Clinton promptly called the video part of a \u00e2\u0080\u009cconcerted attack\u00e2\u0080\u009d against \u00e2\u0080\u009ca woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right to choose.\u00e2\u0080\u009dConservatives accused the group of profiting from the sale of fetal tissue (a charge Ms. Richards called \u201ccategorically untrue\u201d) and threatened to shut down the government rather than continue federal funding for the group. Republican presidential candidates, most notably the lone woman in the Republican field, Carly Fiorina, seized on the controversy to denounce the Planned Parenthood\u2019s videos in visceral terms.Both Mrs. Clinton and Planned Parenthood have tried to remind voters that the group\u2019s clinics around the country provide more than reproductive services to nearly three million mostly low-income and minority patients. \u201cFor many women, we are their only doctor,\u201d Ms. Richards said. At the rally on Sunday in Manchester, Natarsha McQueen, a 40-year-old Planned Parenthood volunteer from Brooklyn, N.Y., is set to tell her story of detecting breast cancer at a local Planned Parenthood clinic.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in the same economic state or haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been to our communities, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t relate to how important this is to women of color,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. McQueen said.Mrs. Richards said the Planned Parenthood Action Fund sent endorsement surveys out to all the presidential candidates on both sides, but only heard back from Democrats. She said Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record on women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s issues and health care gave her an edge against her Democratic rivals, including Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders Widens Lead Over Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lead, 60 percent to 33 percent, is stunning by New Hampshire standards, given that most polls have shown a tight race there and that Mrs. Clinton won the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primary in 2008. But Mr. Sanders, a well-known figure in New Hampshire after a 30-year political career in neighboring Vermont, has been enjoying a burst of political momentum in recent weeks, and he appears to be consolidating support among New Hampshire voters who viewed him favorably but had yet to commit to his candidacy.Among the harshest findings for Mrs. Clinton, 55 percent of likely Democratic voters said she was the \u201cleast honest\u201d of the party\u2019s presidential candidates, compared with 33 percent who said that in September and 46 percent in December. Only 2 percent of those surveyed described Mr. Sanders as the least honest in the Democratic field.And one-third of those surveyed said that Mrs. Clinton had the \u201cpersonal characteristics and qualities\u201d that a president should have, compared with 58 percent who described Mr. Sanders that way.Some Clinton allies privately expressed surprise over the margin of Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lead, and even some advisers to Mr. Sanders said they did not believe he was as far ahead as the new poll showed. No Democrat has received more than 45 percent of the primary vote in New Hampshire since 1972, aside from sitting presidents or vice presidents.Mrs. Clinton, who held double-digit leads over Mr. Sanders in New Hampshire though midsummer, continues to have many political advantages in the Feb. 9 primary, including support from its governor and Democratic senator. Her husband, former President Bill Clinton, is also deeply popular there, and on Wednesday he was scheduled to make his third campaign trip to New Hampshire this month. Yet Mrs. Clinton never took a repeat victory in New Hampshire for granted: No neighboring-state Democrat has lost the primary in the last 30 years, except when former Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont finished second to Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts in 2004.The poll was mostly conducted before Sunday night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Democratic debate, where Mrs. Clinton tried to blunt Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s momentum with attacks on his new plan for broad-based tax increases and on his past votes against some gun control legislation. She received mixed reviews in that debate, while Mr. Sanders received strong praise in some quarters and skepticism from others about his call for broad-based tax increases.In the previous CNN/WMUR poll, released in early December, Mr. Sanders had 50 percent of the vote to Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 40 percent. In the new poll, the bulk of Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s support came from younger voters and independents, but he also had the edge among registered Democrats as well. More than half of those surveyed said they had definitely decided who they would support, compared to 36 percent who expressed that view in December.After the poll was released, Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign manager, said that the Sanders operation was taking nothing for granted.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis poll suggests that our campaign has real momentum and that the American people want to go beyond establishment politics and establishment economics,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Weaver said.Shortly after the poll was released, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s communication\u2019s director, Jennifer Palmieri, released a statement arguing that the Republican National Committee and other conservative groups were \u201caiding\u201d Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign because they were scared to face Mrs. Clinton in a general election.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile Senator Sanders tries to make a case on electability based on meaningless polls, Republicans and their \u2018super PACs\u2019 have made clear the candidate they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re actually afraid to face,\u201d Ms. Palmieri said. \u201cBoth Sanders and the Republicans know that Hillary is the candidate who can take them on and ensure the White House isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in Donald Trump or Ted Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Sanders has also been gaining strength in Iowa, which holds its first-in-the-nation caucuses on Feb. 1, with polls showing a close race there between him and Mrs. Clinton. She had held a fairly steady lead in Iowa through the fall and early winter.By JASON HOROWITZIn the two weeks left before the Iowa caucuses, Mr. Sanders is traversing the state the old-fashioned way, and bringing with him an arsenal of poll numbers.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Iowa\u2019s Republican Governor Warms Even More to Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "DES MOINES \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa, a Republican and the longest-serving governor in American history, is something of a guardian of the Iowa presidential caucuses.So when he appeared Thursday at a breakfast sponsored by The Wall Street Journal, he had an opportunity to criticize Donald J. Trump for skipping Thursday night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debate, the only one Iowa Republicans will host before next week\u2019s caucuses.Mr. Branstad not only declined to bash Mr. Trump for his decision to hold a separate event in Des Moines at the same time as the debate, but he also marveled at what he described as the Trump phenomenon and predicted a record Republican turnout on Monday.The governor did indicate that he would not have advised Mr. Trump to skip the debate, but pointed out that it would not be the first unconventional move the real estate mogul has made in this campaign. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s held up through all of this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Branstad, with a touch of wonder in his voice. The governor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to give Mr. Trump a degree of political cover comes as Senator Ted Cruz, Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief rival in Iowa polls, portrays Mr. Trump\u2019s refusal to debate as an affront to Iowa voters.  Mr. Branstad brought up that same issue again Thursday, but he had considerably less appetite to weigh in on Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s contentious viewsAsked by Gerald Seib of The Wall Street Journal if Mr. Trump was \u00e2\u0080\u009cexploiting the dark side of populism,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Branstad responded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to try to pass judgment on any of the candidates.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIt is also a sign that the two canny Republicans recognize Mr. Trump has tapped into a powerful political current and do not want to find themselves crosswise with voters they may need. Mr. Grassley is running for re-election this year and Mr. Branstad may seek another term in 2018.The governor acknowledged on Thursday that Mr. Trump had been \u00e2\u0080\u009cable to effectively appeal to the concern that our leaders have not been effective\u00e2\u0080\u009d and even highlighted his slogan.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe wants to make America great again and I think that theme has resonated with a lot of people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Branstad said. As for whether he was concerned that Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments about Hispanics, veterans, Muslims and women could hurt the Republican Party in the general election, Mr. Branstad again took a pass.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThings change pretty rapidly in this business,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the governor said.

{"Headline": "What\u2019s New in the Dietary Guidelines", "Date": "2016-01-18", "News": "Jane Brody on health and aging.If, like me, you are a fan of high-fat foods like nuts or avocados, high-cholesterol foods like shrimp or eggs, coffee or an occasional alcoholic drink, the new guidelines provide some additional reassurance. They emphasize the need to focus on a health-promoting eating pattern \u00e2\u0080\u009cacross the life span\u00e2\u0080\u009d that includes these and other foods, in moderation, while cutting down on added sugar.On the other hand, the new guidelines can be confusing, containing what seems like conflicting messages and bowing, in some cases, to industry pressures, especially with regard to meats.The new guidelines emphasize a lifelong eating pattern that contains adequate essential nutrients, a caloric intake that supports a healthy body weight and foods that reduce the risk of chronic disease. This means diets with a rich variety of vegetables and fruits; whole grains; fat-free or low-fat dairy foods like milk, yogurt and cheese, and protein foods that contain little or no saturated fat, including eggs, shellfish, lean meat and poultry, beans and peas, soy products, nuts and seeds.However, the new guidelines do not suggest restricting total fat, a nutrient that has been much maligned, albeit unfairly it is turning out, as something to avoid to maintain a normal body weight. While it is true that ounce for ounce, fat has more calories than sugars and proteins, it is also more satiating and can curb overeating.It is critical, though, to understand the difference between fats. Most experts consider saturated fats to be the bad actors; they are found in butter, whole milk, well-marbled meats, poultry fat (especially the skin) and tropical oils like coconut and palm oil.With saturated fat widely considered the primary culprit in raising blood serum levels of cholesterol, most experts are far less worried about cholesterol intake from low-fat foods like eggs, shrimp and other shellfish. Although a small fraction of the population may be sensitive to dietary cholesterol, for most people on an otherwise wholesome diet, cholesterol naturally produced by the liver is the main reason for rising serum cholesterol that prompts people like me to control it with a daily statin.More good news, this time for fellow coffee-lovers. For the first time since the 1980s, when five-year updates to Dietary Guidelines for Americans were first issued, they specifically mention that moderate consumption of coffee \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a couple of cups a day \u00e2\u0080\u0094 can be part of a healthful eating pattern. Moderation is also urged with regard to alcohol, up to one drink a day for women and up to two for men.But white rice and breads, cakes, cookies and pastries would take a hit if most Americans abided by the new guidelines. They urge that at least half of the grains we eat be whole ones, not refined and stripped of their essential nutrients. Refined grains amount to empty calories that are not much better than eating straight sugar, which they quickly turn into when digested.Two decades ago, a friend of mine suffered a heart attack shortly after eating a pastrami sandwich rich in both saturated fat and salt. While health problems can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be attributed to eating a single sandwich, a lifetime of avidly consuming steaks, burgers, sausages and other processed meats can load the body with unhealthful fats and salt.The guidelines do suggest that teenage boys and men eat less protein. But because the guidelines do not specifically say how this should be accomplished, these groups could still derive much of their protein from unhealthful meats.Economics clearly comes into play here. The sugar industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economywide annual impact is $19 billion, which may sound like a lot until you compare it with the meat and poultry industry \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the largest segment of the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agricultural economy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which has a ripple effect that generates $64.2 billion a year.

{"Headline": "The War for the West Rages On", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorBozeman, Mont. \u2014 THE armed siege of a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon, which continued Friday even after one of the occupiers was killed in a confrontation with authorities, is the latest battle in a Nevada family\u2019s war with the federal government.It shows little sign of abating.Anger over the federal government\u2019s control of hundreds of millions of acres across the West has been smoldering for over a hundred years. The takeover was part of a campaign that has its roots in the settlement of the West and the desire to transfer control of these lands \u2014 the national forests, parks, wildlife refuges and rangeland \u2014 to the states.The Oregon confrontation was led by two sons of Cliven Bundy, the Nevada rancher who led an armed standoff of his own against federal authorities in 2014 over his illegal grazing on land owned by the Bureau of Land Management.The difference between the Bundys and many other ranchers who rage over federal control of land is that they believe God is on their side.I visited the Bundy family last year on their remote ranch and melon farm in southeastern Nevada for research I\u2019m conducting on the history of Mormon culture and the use of public land. The Bundys are Mormons and interested me because of their extreme position against the government and their engagement of militia groups in their cause.They were welcoming and eager to answer my questions. What emerged in our three hours of conversation in the living room of their modest ranch house was a passion and a sense of entitlement that they believe is anchored in their deep history in the region. They also embrace a strange amalgamation of Mormonism, libertarianism and a right-wing reading of the Constitution.The Bundys trace their roots to some of the first Mormons who settled along an isolated and rugged stretch of the Virgin River, in a place so desolate that it seems impossible to make a living there. But they did, and in doing so, they put their stamp on it, in the Bundys\u2019 view.From the moment their ancestors\u2019 horses took a sip of water or ate the grass, \u201ca beneficial use of a renewable resource\u201d was created, Cliven Bundy told me.\u201cThat\u2019s how our rights are created,\u201d he explained. \u201cSo now we have created them and we use them, make beneficial use of them, and then we protect them. And that\u2019s sort of a natural law, and that\u2019s what the rancher has done. That\u2019s how he has his rights. And that\u2019s what the range war, the Bundy war, is all about right now, it\u2019s really protecting those three things: our life, liberty and our property.\u201dIn Mormon doctrine, the American Constitution is a divinely inspired text that must be protected. This view goes back to the days of the prophet Joseph Smith, who believed the Constitution existed to provide religious freedom and agency, the right of people to choose how they lived.In 1840, Smith warned that \u201cthis Nation will be on the very verge of crumbling to pieces and tumbling to the ground when the Constitution is upon the brink of ruin; this people will be the Staff upon which the Nation shall lean and they shall bear the Constitution away from the very verge of destruction.\u201dThe Bundy family sees itself as that Staff. Mr. Bundy carries in his pocket a copy of the Constitution, which he believes draws its inspiration from the Bible. He told me: \u201cDon\u2019t we believe that Jesus Christ is basically the author of the Bible? Well, if the Constitution is inspired, who is the author? Wouldn\u2019t that author be Jesus Christ again?\u201dMr. Bundy\u2019s reading of the Constitution has been heavily influenced by the work of W. Cleon Skousen, a Mormon, fervent anti-Communist and right-wing political thinker who believed that most federal landholdings are unconstitutional.The Los Angeles Times reported that many Bundy followers in Oregon carried with them a copy of the Constitution annotated by Skousen. \u201cThat\u2019s where I get most of my information from,\u201d Cliven Bundy told the paper.But while Joseph Smith focused on the First Amendment as a bulwark against the persecutions of Mormons, the Bundys are focused on the 10th Amendment, which they believe severely restricts the federal government\u2019s power to possess land. (Leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have condemned the Oregon takeover and said in a statement that they were \u201cdeeply troubled by the reports that those who have seized the facility suggest that they were doing it based on scriptural principles.\u201d)The Bundy worldview aligns closely with the states\u2019 rights movement and efforts in the West to transfer federal lands to the states and local governments. Just last week, eight ranchers in Utah announced that they would stop paying grazing fees to the federal government and put the money into escrow until ownership of the federal land they lease is resolved. \u201cThis is as an act of civil disobedience in response to a long trail of abuses,\u201d a lawyer connected to the effort told The Salt Lake City Tribune.\u201cALERT! From Ammon\u2019s wife, Lisa: Ammon would not have called for the patriots to leave. We have lost a life but we are not backing down. He didn\u2019t spill his blood in vain! Hold your ground \u2026 Ranchers come and stand! \u2026 Militia come and stand!\u201dThe war with the federal government over the West seems far from finished.Betsy Gaines Quammen is a doctoral candidate at Montana State University.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Fix the Country\u2019s Failing Schools. And How Not To.", "Date": "2016-01-09", "News": "Supported byA QUARTER-CENTURY ago, Newark and nearby Union City epitomized the failure of American urban school systems. Students, mostly poor minority and immigrant children, were performing abysmally. Graduation rates were low. Plagued by corruption and cronyism, both districts had a revolving door of superintendents. New Jersey officials threatened to take over Union City\u2019s schools in 1989 but gave them a one-year reprieve instead. Six years later, state education officials, decrying the gross mismanagement of the Newark schools, seized control there.In 2009, the political odd couple of Chris Christie, the Republican governor-elect, and Cory Booker, Newark\u2019s charismatic mayor, joined forces, convinced that the Newark system could be reinvented in just five years, in part by closing underperforming schools, encouraging charter schools and weakening teacher tenure. In 2010 they persuaded Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, to invest $100 million in their grand experiment. \u201cWe can flip a whole city!\u201d the mayor enthused, \u201cand create a national model.\u201dNo one expected a national model out of Union City. Without the resources given to Newark, the school district there, led by a middle-level bureaucrat named Fred Carrigg, was confronted with two huge challenges: How could English learners, three-quarters of the students, become fluent in English? And how could youngsters, many of whom came from homes where books were rarities, be turned into adept readers?Today Union City, which opted for homegrown gradualism, is regarded as a poster child for good urban education. Newark, despite huge infusions of money and outside talent, has struggled by comparison. In 2014, Union City\u2019s graduation rate was 81 percent, exceeding the national average; Newark\u2019s was 69 percent.What explains this difference? The experience of Union City, as well as other districts, like Montgomery County, Md., and Long Beach, Calif., that have beaten the demographic odds, show that there\u2019s no miracle cure for what ails public education. What business gurus label \u201ccontinuous improvement,\u201d and the rest of us call slow-and-steady, wins the race.Slow-and-steady was anathema to Mr. Booker and Mr. Christie, who had big dreams for Newark. But as Dale Russakoff writes in her absorbing account \u201cThe Prize,\u201d the politicians\u2019 optimism proved misplaced. What went wrong had as much to do with their top-down approach as with the proposals themselves.The mayor pledged to involve the public before making any decisions, but efforts at community engagement, orchestrated by out-of-town advisers, proved shambolic. The only recommendations that got traction \u2014 closing 11 public schools, opening charters and themed high schools \u2014 were advanced by consultants, who gobbled up more than $20 million in fees.In 2011, Mr. Christie appointed 39-year-old Cami Anderson \u2014 a Teach for America alumna \u2014 superintendent. She introduced some solid ideas, like replacing the weakest performers with \u201crenew schools\u201d and persuading charters to enroll more poor kids. But she ran into trouble with parents when she did away with neighborhood schools and laid off hundreds of workers to pay for her initiatives.Her hurry-up style made matters worse. \u201cShe didn\u2019t listen,\u201d contends Ms. Russakoff. \u201cShe said her plan \u2014 \u201816-dimensional chess\u2019 \u2014 was too complex for parents.\u201d After repeated heckling by teachers and parents, Ms. Anderson stopped attending board meetings.One of Mr. Booker\u2019s goals was to make Newark the nation\u2019s \u201ccharter school capital,\u201d and he largely succeeded. While these schools have recorded higher test scores and graduation rates than the traditional schools, money explains much of that gap. Freed from the district\u2019s bureaucracy, the charters have nearly a third more dollars to spend on each student, $12,650 versus $9,604, which buys additional teachers, tutors and social workers.The push to expand charters angers activists like Junius Williams, director of the Abbott Leadership Institute at Rutgers University. \u201cCharters have drained resources necessary to teach most Newark students,\u201d he told me.In 1989, with one year to shape up Union City, Mr. Carrigg, with a cadre of teachers and administrators, devised a multipronged strategy: Focus on how kids learn best, how teachers teach most effectively and how parents can be engaged. Non-English speakers had previously been expected to acquire the language through the sink-or-swim method. So the district junked its old approach. Instead, English learners are initially taught in their own language, mainly Spanish, and then are gradually shifted to English. The system started hiring more teachers who spoke Spanish or had E.S.L. (English as a Second Language) training.The bilingual approach went beyond the classroom. Even though many parents speak only Spanish, meetings had been conducted and written information prepared only in English. In the new era, bilingualism quickly became the norm. Parents, made to feel welcome in the schools, were conscripted to help with their children\u2019s homework and reinforce the schools\u2019 high expectations for them.To get students excited about reading, the schools became word-soaked environments, with tons of reading and daily writing assignments linked even to subjects like art and science that traditionally don\u2019t require as much writing.The Union City reformers opted to focus initially on the youngest children, whose potential for improvement was greatest. When New Jersey began to fund preschool for poor urban districts in the late 1990s, the district seized on the opportunity to devise a state-of-the-art program that enrolled almost every 3- and 4-year-old in the community.Teachers rethought skill-and-drill instruction, instead emphasizing hands-on learning and group projects. Help came, in the form of coaches \u2014 veteran teachers \u2014 working side by side with newbies and time set aside for teachers to collaborate. Students were frequently assessed, not to punish teachers but to pinpoint areas where help was needed.Stable leadership proved essential. In the years preceding the state\u2019s near-takeover, superintendents were hired and fired based on their politics; during the past quarter-century there have been just three superintendents, all of them products of the district. Nationwide, the average tenure of a city schools chief is only three years.Newark\u2019s big mistake was not so much that the school officials embraced one solution or another but that they placed their faith in the idea of disruptive change and charismatic leaders. Union City adopted the opposite approach, embracing the idea of gradual change and working within existing structures.Newark is beginning to do the same. Since the appointment in 2015 of Christopher Cerf, formerly New Jersey\u2019s education commissioner, as Newark\u2019s superintendent, more attention is being paid to the positive side of the school district ledger. While charters remain controversial in Newark, Mr. Cerf emphasizes helping the public schools achieve similar results. \u201cCharters are succeeding,\u201d he told me, \u201cbecause they have substantially more discretion. We need to level the playing field.\u201dMr. Cerf and Raz Baraka, who succeeded Cory Booker as mayor, recently announced that up to $12.5 million of the Zuckerberg gift will be invested in a network of \u201ccommunity schools\u201d \u2014 sunrise-to-sunset schools that offer health care and social services, located in the city\u2019s most troubled neighborhoods.\u201cMark Zuckerberg\u2019s $100 million gift isn\u2019t a lot of money in a district that spends $1 billion a year, but it sparked the conversation,\u201d Dominique Lee, the executive director of Brick, which runs two Newark schools, told me. \u201cPeople are angry now at what\u2019s been going on, but it\u2019s \u2018good angry,\u2019 not \u2018bad angry,\u2019 like before. They\u2019re asking: \u2018What do we need to do to save traditional public schools?\u2019 \u201dDavid L. Kirp is a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, a senior fellow at the Learning Policy Institute and a contributing opinion writer. \u201cImprobable Scholars,\u201d his most recent book, focuses on Union City\u2019s schools.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Youngblood,\u2019 an Urgent Novel About the Iraq War", "Date": "2016-01-21", "News": "Supported byBooks of The TimesMatt Gallagher\u2019s 2010 memoir, \u201cKaboom: Embracing the Suck in a Savage Little War,\u201d grew out of a popular blog he wrote while stationed in Iraq for 15 months, beginning in 2007. By turns thoughtful and irreverent and darkly funny, that book possessed an electric immediacy \u2014 a you-are-there sense of what it was like to be a grunt in the hot desert sands outside Baghdad, hunting for I.E.D.\u2019s and bomb factories, negotiating with local sheikhs and frightened civilians, and grappling with the absurdities of military bureaucracy.In his first novel, \u201cYoungblood,\u201d Mr. Gallagher also provides a visceral sense of what young American soldiers experienced during their Iraq deployments \u2014 the camaraderie, the fear, the exhaustion and boredom, and the sheer discomfort of being encased in 60 pounds of body armor, like a turtle, in triple-digit heat while keeping an eye out for snipers and roadside bombs. But \u201cYoungblood\u201d is a novel, written with more distance and perspective on the war than \u201cKaboom.\u201d It possesses the retrospective knowledge of what happened in Iraq, as the hopeful days of the surge gave way to growing doubts about the war, and, as we know now, to the rise of ISIS after the full withdrawal of American troops in 2011.\u201cYoungblood\u201d reads like several stories at once. It\u2019s a bildungsroman about a young lieutenant named Jack Porter trying to live up to his older brother\u2019s heroics and learning what it means to lead a platoon under combat conditions. It\u2019s a detective story about Jack\u2019s efforts to investigate dark rumors about the past conduct of a bellicose sergeant named Chambers, whom Jack worries will get his own platoon into trouble by \u201ctweaking the rules of engagement.\u201d And it\u2019s a love story about a missing American soldier named Rios, who fell in love with a prominent sheikh\u2019s daughter, Rana, whom Jack will meet and also come to care for.On one level, the novel is a parable \u2014 with overtones of Graham Greene\u2019s \u201cThe Quiet American\u201d \u2014 about the United States and Iraq and the still unfurling consequences of the war. On another, it\u2019s a story about how we tell stories to friends and strangers, trying to convey experiences they will never know firsthand, and how we tell ourselves stories to reckon with the past \u2014 or, perhaps, to live with painful memories that are difficult, if not impossible, to assuage.The detective-story aspects of \u201cYoungblood\u201d are the least convincing part of the novel. Clues about Chambers\u2019s past and his possible involvement with a \u201ckill team\u201d that might have murdered Iraqi civilians can feel shoehorned into the narrative to build suspense. The same is often true of rumors concerning Rios and Rana. There are files containing sworn statements from soldiers, and email and Facebook exchanges with people who might know what happened.These plot points lend structure to the book, but they are not what keep the reader absorbed. As \u201cKaboom\u201d demonstrated, Mr. Gallagher has a keen reportorial eye, a distinctive voice and an instinctive sympathy for the people he is writing about, and he uses those gifts here to immerse us in his characters\u2019s lives. Jack \u2014 who has the irreverence of Hawkeye Pierce from \u201cM*A*S*H,\u201d combined with a boyish earnestness \u2014 insinuates himself immediately in the reader\u2019s mind, as does his interpreter, Qasim, known as Snoop, who \u201chad learned English from British missionaries and refined it with gangsta rap.\u201d We come to understand just how young many of the American soldiers are; how duty and idealism and doubts blur together in combat; and how \u201cthe ambiguities of the desert\u201d could blunt or undermine the best intentions of even the most determined soldiers.The Iraqi characters \u2014 from the spirited Rana, to a sheikh whose great-grandfather worked with the Ottomans and whose grandfather worked with the British \u2014 step briskly off these pages too. Mr. Gallagher leaves us with an appreciation of how war and occupation have affected Iraqi families for generations, and how the losses incurred after the 2003 American invasion remain day-to-day realities for the people who live there.With \u201cYoungblood,\u201d he has written an urgent and deeply moving novel.YoungbloodBy Matt Gallagher340 pages.

{"Headline": "To Catch a Rapist", "Date": "2016-01-05", "News": "FeatureA special-victims unit fights the hidden epidemic of sexual assault that is disturbingly difficult to investigate.Supported byThat morning, in a voice edged with distress, the mother had described a girl who seemed broken by the assault. The mother, too, was overwhelmed. When she broke down sobbing, covering her face, Cuddy placed her hand on the woman\u2019s forearm, saying quietly, \u2018\u2018We\u2019re almost done. We\u2019re almost done,\u2019\u2019 as if she were coaxing her to swim a little longer (they were almost at the shore!), coaxing her even though in all likelihood that shore no longer existed for her.Cuddy shared an office with her partner, Detective Joe Landisio, their two desks facing each other and pushed together, edge to edge. The room was crowded with two printers, a table, another small desk and a huge file cabinet filled with old homicide cases that no one had bothered to move when the units switched offices. The bathroom was next door, so you could hear toilets flushing all day. When she walked into the office, she felt like going straight to sleep. The mother had been so distraught, and Cuddy couldn\u2019t make a dent in that. \u2018\u2018You know what this office needs?\u2019\u2019 she asked as she sat down at her desk, letting out a huge sigh. \u2018\u2018A bar.\u2019\u2019Landisio swiveled in his chair, scanning the room. \u2018\u2018It could go right against that wall there,\u2019\u2019 he said, pointing to a spot beneath a cartoon drawing of a man joyfully kicking a pregnant woman \u2014 a \u2018\u2018gift\u2019\u2019 from Officer Steve Formica, from Firearms, in recognition of the no-taboos humor char\u00adac\u00adteristic of the S.V.U. squad. Its four detectives \u2014 Cuddy and Landisio, along with Nikki Natale and Jesse Agosto \u2014 worked roughly 400 cases a year, investigating mainly sexual assaults but also the abuse and neglect of children and seniors, domestic violence and child deaths, including homicides.That afternoon, as Cuddy and Landisio ate lunch in front of their computers, Landisio read the files for two new cases that had landed on the already-toppling pile on his desk, muttering in singsong, \u2018\u2018Punch me in the face, punch me in the face,\u2019\u2019 while Cuddy made out an arrest-warrant application for the suspect in the child\u2019s rape. The girl had already been interviewed at the Yale Child Abuse Clinic, a five-minute drive from headquarters. The S.V.U. detectives never questioned children or young teenagers, leaving that job to the trained social workers with the clinic. But they observed these forensic interviews on a television screen in an adjoining room, along with a social worker and medical personnel from the clinic and a case worker from the state\u2019s Department of Children and Families. The room was always crowded and often overheated. It was hard for Cuddy to be just an observer \u2014 she would have liked to interview the children herself. Sometimes she talked to them afterward, not to question them but to offer her support, to compliment them on their courage, to try to cheer them up. Landisio never wanted to talk to the victims. He wouldn\u2019t know what to say. The whole thing just made him too sad.Late that afternoon, Cuddy handed her application for an arrest warrant to the supervisor of their unit, Sgt. Betsy Segui, for review. From there it would be submitted to the court, where an inspector for the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office would review it again before the court decided whether to issue a warrant. \u2018\u2018Then we can get this [expletive],\u2019\u2019 Cuddy said. It was her way, the only one she had, of fixing things. But winter turned to spring, spring to summer and then summer to fall, and still Cuddy waited for her arrest warrant.There is another unacknowledged side to the investigation of sexual assault: the huge numbers of victims who are children or teenagers. In New Haven, the detectives estimate that more than 80 percent of their cases involve minors \u2014 a number above but not that far afield from national statistics. In a 2014 study published by the National Center for Juvenile Justice, which analyzed data from the F.B.I.\u2019s National Incident-Based Reporting System for the years 2009 and 2010, 61 percent of the female victims and 84 percent of the male victims of sexual assaults reported to law enforcement were younger than 18. For females, the age with the most sexual-assault victimizations was 14, and for males it was 4.These cases are rarely reported immediately because children often feel confused, afraid or to blame, and because the perpetrators are often family members or family friends. Even many adult victims don\u2019t report a sexual assault before the 72-to-120-hour cutoff after which hospitals will no longer conduct a forensic medical exam. Delayed reporting is the norm in sexual-assault cases, not the exception. In New Haven, the vast majority of the detectives\u2019 cases are reported days, weeks, months, even years after the fact. Not only is there bias against a victim who waits to report an assault, but the delay also means that there is rarely any physical evidence \u2014 neither forensic evidence taken from the bodies of the victims or suspects nor crime scenes to investigate.These prejudices about \u2018\u2018real rape\u2019\u2019 happen to dovetail with those rapes that are easier to investigate and prosecute. In a 2002 review of charging decisions made by prosecutors in three major cities, Cassia Spohn, now director of the School of Criminol\u00adogy and Criminal Justice at Arizona State University, found that prosecutors were substantially more likely to file charges \u2018\u2018if the victim was injured, if the suspect used a gun or knife and if there was physical evidence,\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018if the victim reported the crime promptly\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018if there were no questions about the victim\u2019s moral character or behavior at the time of the incident.\u2019\u2019In spite of the difficulties of these investigations, it\u2019s far too common for special-victims units to be understaffed and low on resources, according to Joanne Archambault, a retired sergeant with the San Diego Police Department and executive director of End Violence Against Women International. Police chiefs and sheriffs are often pressured by the community and the media to focus on more visible problems. \u2018\u2018They are focusing their energy on gangs and narcotics because that\u2019s what the community is talking about,\u2019\u2019 Archambault says. Rarely is there an outcry over police response to sexual assaults. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s the hidden epidemic, right? Nobody really wants to know about it.\u2019\u2019These are also the first units to be plundered if more officers are needed elsewhere. At one time New Haven\u2019s S.V.U. had 15 detectives, two supervising sergeants and a lieutenant, but in August 2011, a year that saw the city plagued by 130 shootings and 34 homicides (more than four times the per-capita murder rate in New York City that year), it was disbanded, and all the detectives were assigned to Major Crimes. A year and a half later, under the new chief of police, Dean Esserman, the unit was resurrected \u2014 this time with four detectives and one sergeant, though for one memorable month that year, Cuddy was the only detective working on the squad. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t know how you did this all by yourself,\u2019\u2019 Landisio commented one day. Cuddy replied, \u2018\u2018A lot of booze, a lot of booze.\u2019\u2019Most detectives in New Haven dreaded being assigned to the Special Victims Unit. But Cuddy and Landisio wanted to be there. For Cuddy, it was simple: \u2018\u2018It feels like the only unit where what you do really matters.\u2019\u2019 For Landisio, whom colleagues called Lando, it was also simple: He wanted to work with Cuddy. With 13 years on the job, four of them in the S.V.U., she was the detective with the most experience in the unit, but she also had a sense of humor that ran from ridiculously whimsical to jaw-droppingly filthy. In their office, it was not an unusual to see a strapping, dark-suited homicide detective walking away from some raunchy comment she made, shaking his head and murmuring, \u2018\u2018Cuddy, Cuddy, Cuddy.\u2019\u2019 She could be a charismatic flirt (waitresses; female bartenders; their supervisor, Sergeant Segui) and was deeply in love with her wife, whose name was tattooed on the inside of her left wrist. Landisio had eight years on the job and just under a year in the S.V.U. He was short and dark-eyed with a silver barbell piercing his tongue. He had passions for electronic music, firearms, pit bulls and T. rexes. His appearance and personality might have been put together by an eclectic collector. The two detectives kept up a running commentary throughout the day that consisted of lines from \u2018\u2018S.N.L.\u2019\u2019 sketches and YouTube videos, as well as bizarre quotations they\u2019d heard working the job. \u2018\u2018You two are like an old married couple,\u2019\u2019 one detective observed when she happened into the office one day as Landisio was running a lint roller down Cuddy\u2019s back.When a patrol cop ducked in to get Landisio\u2019s and Cuddy\u2019s advice on whether she should take the sergeant\u2019s exam, she asked them, \u2018\u2018Why does everyone hate this unit?\u2019\u2019 Neither Cuddy nor Landisio seemed insulted by the question. Because you work your butt off, they told her. You will do more interviewing here \u2014 of victims, suspects, witnesses \u2014 than you will ever come close to in any other unit. \u2018\u2018It will make you a better cop,\u2019\u2019 Cuddy said.But it wasn\u2019t just the workload; it was the nature of the crimes themselves. Too disturbing for your average cop. Then there was the amorphous character of the investigations: the lack of physical evidence, the time factor when so many of the reports came in long after the incident. A week into her assignment, Detective Natale said: \u2018\u2018It seems like 95 percent of these cases are [expletive],\u2019\u2019 sounding completely frustrated and baffled by the work of investigating a crime without a scene to examine, weapons to trace, eyewitnesses to interview.When the rookies were finally ushered into their office, after a lieutenant laughingly warned Cuddy to go easy on them, they stood just inside the doorway, shoulder to shoulder, looking blank-faced and ill at ease. Landisio swirled around in his chair, kicked off with a description of their caseloads, then looked to Cuddy to chime in. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m just going to sit here and eat my cold sore,\u2019\u2019 she said pleasantly. The rookies stared at her.Landisio tried again, going into a history of his law-enforcement career. \u2018\u2018I started walking in \u201909. \u2026\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018On Milford beach,\u2019\u2019 Cuddy interjected brightly. \u2018\u2018Collecting seashells.\u2019\u2019 The rookies shifted uneasily side to side. One guy finally asked Cuddy whether she had chosen to be in this unit. No, she said, she was assigned, but she had worked in almost every other unit, and none was as satisfying as this one. Not a lot of people want to be here, she said, because \u2018\u201890 percent of our cases are kids being drilled in the ass by their grandfathers. But when you lock up their grandfather, that kid will never forget you for being their voice.\u2019\u2019 When the rookies left, five uncomfortable minutes later, I got the feeling that they were all fervently hoping they would never be assigned there, but Cuddy merely rolled her eyes.In New Haven, unless a victim chooses not to file charges, every case that is assigned to an S.V.U. detective is investigated. According to Segui, the detectives refer about 90 percent of their cases to the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office for an arrest warrant \u2014 though that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll get one. Every recommendation by a detective either to proceed with an application for an arrest warrant or to close a case is first reviewed by Segui, then by the court. The detectives have considerable influence on Segui. \u2018\u2018I trust them,\u2019\u2019 she told me. If the detectives feel they should close a case, she looks it over herself and then occasionally has the prosecutor \u2018\u2018in essence, quote-unquote, check our work.\u2019\u2019During my months with the unit, the detectives closed six cases out of dozens without applying for an arrest warrant. There was a young woman who told an emergency-room nurse that a friend raped her. Her lip was swollen as if she\u2019d been punched in the mouth. She didn\u2019t want to file a complaint, but Cuddy persuaded her to take the sexual-assault exam, so that they would have the evidence if she changed her mind. A mother reported that her 3-year-old son said her ex-partner bit and pulled his penis, but the boy never disclosed this or any other abuse during his forensic interview. If there\u2019s no medical evidence (there wasn\u2019t), and if a child doesn\u2019t mention abuse during the forensic interview, the case doesn\u2019t move forward. Cuddy also noticed that when the mother was asked to repeat exactly what her son said, she used the word \u2018\u2018penis\u2019\u2019; in his interview, the boy always used the word \u2018\u2018pee-pee.\u2019\u2019Some cases were so tangled and muddy that the truth remained unknowable, and they eventually withered because of a lack of probable cause. One of these was a case that came back to the unit: an injured woman whom the detectives interviewed in the hospital two months earlier, after hospital personnel called in a case of possible domestic abuse. The victim told the detectives she didn\u2019t know how her face became bruised and bloodied. She had been sleeping at her ex-boyfriend\u2019s house the night before, so she could drive him to work the next morning, and she woke to the taste of blood in her mouth. She said her ex-boyfriend told her she had fallen. She thought maybe he had elbowed her in her sleep. With no claim of domestic abuse, Landisio referred the case back to patrol, and an officer interviewed the ex. That report concluded: \u2018\u2018Due to [complainant\u2019s] conflicting report and no evidence of domestic violence, there was no arrest made. No further actions were taken.\u2019\u2019But shortly afterward, the victim claimed her ex-boyfriend had beaten and sexually assaulted her, and the case was reassigned to Landisio. \u2018\u2018She definitely got [expletive] up,\u2019\u2019 Landisio said. He was sitting at his desk across from Cuddy, examining a photograph of the woman\u2019s face \u2014 the right side was puffy and purpled, the eye sealed shut, as if she\u2019d been lying half-submerged in water. \u2018\u2018Yeah, but how?\u2019\u2019 Cuddy asked. \u2018\u2018That\u2019s the question.\u2019\u2019Landisio and Cuddy interviewed the victim again, and this time she described her ex asking for sex that night and hitting her after she refused. The last thing she heard before passing out was her clothes being ripped, she said. When Landisio asked her why she didn\u2019t mention the assault before, the woman said it took a few days for the memories to come back to her.Landisio filled out a request for the victim\u2019s medical records, while Cuddy found the suspect\u2019s profile on Facebook. He had posted a handful of photos from fishing trips of himself proudly displaying his catch, the fish gripped in his right hand. All of the woman\u2019s injuries were to the right side of her face, which meant that if she was punched, it was likely to have been by a left-handed person. Landisio and Cuddy started searching on Google for images of facial injuries from falls to see if there was any resemblance between those and the particular bruising and swelling on the woman\u2019s face. The assault story was looking weaker to them, but they both thought the woman\u2019s injuries seemed too severe for just tumbling out of bed.Three weeks later, Landisio interviewed the ex-boyfriend. He didn\u2019t like interviewing suspects. When you asked a victim a hard question, you were doing it for her benefit. But suspects? He worried about the innocent ones tripping themselves up. \u2018\u2018I think of how the implications of what they\u2019re saying could lead to a lifetime in prison,\u2019\u2019 Landisio said. The suspect was voluble and animated to the point of cartoonishness. In his version of events, his ex-girlfriend was drinking and taking prescription medicine that night and didn\u2019t fall off the bed \u2014 he heard a crash while he was in another room and found her lying in the middle of the bedroom. To him, it seemed she had keeled over from a standing position, like a felled tree. When he tried to move her, she told him to leave her alone.Afterward, Landisio felt his account was credible. He never deflected a question or repeated it to buy himself time. He leapt at every query, often interrupting Landisio, eager to explain. And the suspect was all of one piece: amiable, entertaining, self-absorbed and contemptible \u2014 but consistently so. When he heard her fall? He was aggravated by the noise because a family member was sleeping upstairs. When the victim refused to be moved? He went about his night, fixing his dinner, checking in occasionally to see if she was still breathing. When he woke in the morning to find her gone? He called her son, even driving to their house on his suspended license hoping she was there. He still wanted her to drive him around. And the suspect signed his statement with his right hand.The victim\u2019s son later confirmed to Landisio that the suspect had called several times and come to their house looking for his mother. Landisio submitted copies of the interviews, the medical records, the original police report and his own report to Segui. He told her he didn\u2019t think they had probable cause for an arrest warrant. Segui and then the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office agreed. No arrest warrant was issued, and the case was closed.According to the Department of Children and Families report Cuddy was reading, the girl claimed she was raped while in the care of her mother\u2019s friend when her mother was incarcerated. The male relative showed up at the house and told the friend she could leave \u2014 he would watch the child. Then he raped her.The girl had a forensic interview scheduled at the Yale clinic later in the month, but the mother was coming to the station that day. Before she arrived, Cuddy ran her name through various law-enforcement databases. She was looking for dates when the mother was locked up. Yellow highlighter suspended, Cuddy frowned at the printout in front of her. She saw several jail sentences, all suspended. Six months, suspended; one year, suspended. There was no jail time that matched the year the girl would have been raped.In the interview room, Cuddy sat no more than an arm\u2019s length from the mother, taking notes on a legal pad. The mother kept her elbows on the table and her hands clasped. Her face was tense and grave, and at first there was a slight tremor in her voice. Cuddy opened the interview with: \u2018\u2018And this is in regard to your daughter?\u2019\u2019Yes, the mother nodded.\u2018\u2018O.K., why don\u2019t you tell me everything that happened from the beginning?\u2019\u2019The mother described the argument that led to her daughter\u2019s divulging the rape. When her daughter named her rapist, the mother\u2019s voice went hard and flat. \u2018\u2018Walk me through it,\u2019\u2019 she said to her daughter tersely. The girl told her what the man did, and when she repeated the words he said while he raped her, the mother knew her daughter wasn\u2019t lying: He said the same thing before raping her when she was a girl.The interview solved one mystery: The mother told Cuddy that she believed the rape took place while she was detained after being picked up on a misdemeanor charge. She was locked up for only six or seven hours while she waited to be arraigned. Still, the situation felt slightly improbable. How did the relative happen to walk through that narrow window of opportunity?Cuddy went back to the records, no longer looking for a jail sentence during the time period the girl was assaulted but an arrest \u2014 an arrest at a location the mother named that led to approximately six hours of lockup. She would find that first and figure out the suspect\u2019s omniscience later.And then there it was: the right year, the right misdemeanor charge. An arrest and then hours later, the booking. Scanning the police report, Cuddy suddenly said very quietly: \u2018\u2018He was with her. That\u2019s how he knew. He was with her.\u2019\u2019The police arrested the mother in front of him and took her away, and there he was \u2014 with the certain knowledge that she would be gone for hours. \u2018\u2018I got it,\u2019\u2019 Cuddy said. \u2018\u2018Phew!\u2019\u2019 Then she let out a relieved laugh.During the teenager\u2019s forensic interview, which Cuddy watched craned close to the monitor so she could catch every word, her voice was barely audible. She never once made eye contact with the social worker. If she could gesture \u2018\u2018yes\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018no\u2019\u2019 rather than speak, she did. After it was over, Cuddy asked the mother if she could speak to her daughter. In a room set aside for children, they sat over a game of Jenga, and Cuddy told the girl she was proud of her. \u2018\u2018You\u2019re a survivor now, not a victim,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018You\u2019re free from this point on. You\u2019ve talked about it, and you don\u2019t need to talk about it again.\u2019\u2019As she headed back to headquarters, Cuddy said, \u2018\u2018I finally got her to smile.\u2019\u2019 When she told the girl she was going to arrest the relative, Cuddy asked for a high-five. The girl slapped her hand, a smile slipping shyly into view. \u2018\u2018Which makes me feel great, you know?\u2019\u2019 Cuddy said. \u2018\u2018Win-win.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018I came out for [expletive],\u2019\u2019 Cuddy chimed in. Formica\u2019s eyes gleamed briefly, like the pulse from a lighthouse, but his face remained immobile. It was snowing outside. A toilet flushed next door. Landisio continued to read. He had just been assigned a case of a 15-year-old who said a classmate assaulted her in the school auditorium. He had gone to the school to look at the layout and collect any footage from the school\u2019s surveillance cameras. An hour before the girl\u2019s forensic interview, he scanned the police report, reading sections out loud. The teenager told the patrol officer that she and the boy were backstage in the auditorium, making out, and \u2018\u2018the next thing she knows, he was inside of her,\u2019\u2019 Landisio read.\u2018\u2018There you go, those are the key words,\u2019\u2019 Cuddy said. \u2018\u2018\u2009\u2018The next thing I knew.\u2019 She\u2019s leaving something out.\u2019\u2019 That was one of the verbal cues they paid attention to, those time gaps in a subject\u2019s story. \u2018\u2018And before I knew it. ... \u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The next thing I remember. ... \u2019\u2019 During interviews, they would first let the subject proceed with her unprompted narration, and then they would return to those gaps \u2014 slowing the narration down, backfilling the account with details. Those specific questions could make the case stronger. Or they could reveal that the subject was evasive on purpose. Understanding why was essential. Many victims will try to present themselves as \u2018\u2018better victims,\u2019\u2019 embarrassed or afraid to admit they were drunk at the time, for instance, or that they were close to their attacker. The detectives almost never interviewed a victim more than once, because even the smallest contradiction between their statements was a gift for a defense attorney. So they had to get it right the first time. If they didn\u2019t, they might not be able to pursue a case. The heart of every investigation was that victim interview \u2014 if done right, it provided exploratory avenues for the detectives. It became the road map for the investigation.As Landisio continued to prepare for his interview with the 15-year-old, Cuddy took a call from the Connecticut state laboratory: There was a DNA match linking a suspect to two stranger rapes that occurred in 2012 and 2013. The first victim, who worked as a prostitute, was attacked late at night; the second, a mother in her 40s who was assaulted as she was walking to work before dawn. Each woman was yanked off the street at knife point, pulled into an empty lot, forced to her knees and then onto her back and then upright again as she was orally, vaginally and anally raped.Rapes by strangers are more likely to be reported, and reported immediately, but they have their own investigative challenge: identifying the perpetrator. Images from a surveillance camera at one of the crime scenes were too fuzzy to be of use, even after Cuddy sent them to the F.B.I. lab for enhancement. The victims\u2019 descriptions of the rapist narrowed it down to a light-skinned man with a Spanish accent, no facial hair, possibly in his 30s \u2014 it was hardly much to work on. Victims\u2019 identifications are usually too fragmentary to be helpful, Cuddy told me. \u2018\u2018Sometimes they can\u2019t tell you anything, but they can tell you he had a black thumbnail because they just focused on that to get out of the moment. When you think of what\u2019s happening, they have to focus on something, and it\u2019s not gonna be his face.\u2019\u2019DNA evidence from a sexual-assault exam can be the key to solving stranger rapes \u2014 but only if the rapist\u2019s DNA is in the F.B.I.\u2019s national database, known as the Combined DNA Index System (Codis). In 2011, the Connecticut state lab lost its accreditation after federal audits found a backlog of thousands of DNA cases. A year later, the lab regained its accreditation and underwent a major expansion with a new director. This fall, Connecticut passed new legislation mandating that the police submit rape-kit evidence to the lab within 10 days of a crime and that the lab test the evidence within 60 days. But in some parts of the country, many kits are still never tested at all. Tens of thousands sit untested in police storage units and public lab facilities. And those are the ones that have been counted. Many police agencies do not even inventory the rape kits in their evidence lockers. Underfunded and poorly staffed forensic labs have been partly responsible for the backlog, because processing a single rape kit typically costs between $1,000 and $1,500. Last year, the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office, along with the Department of Justice, awarded a total of nearly $80 million in grants to local jurisdictions across the country to eliminate rape-kit backlogs. (To provide the grants, the Manhattan district attorney used asset-forfeiture funds from settlements with international banks that had violated United States sanctions.)Another cause is police discretion: In most jurisdictions, investigators decide whether to forward a rape kit to the lab for processing. Officers may shelve the evidence because they think the case is unlikely to be taken up by the prosecutor. Many also mistakenly believe that DNA testing is useful only in identifying an unknown rapist. And yet acquaintance-rape cases with DNA evidence do better in court \u2014 not only are these cases more likely to be pursued by prosecutors, but they\u2019re also more likely to end in a successful conviction. Having that DNA in the database also often helps solve other cases, because many rapists are repeat offenders. (In a 2006 study, interviews with 41 serial rapists found that their first victims were younger siblings, neighborhood children, girlfriends, spouses; in other words, they started as acquaintance rapists.)A lack of leads led Cuddy to close both stranger-rape cases almost a year earlier, though they were subject to being reopened if any new evidence came in. And so it did \u2014 nearly three years after the first assault. The DNA had been matched to a man who was in prison for another, nonsexual offense.\u2018\u2018Yes!\u2019\u2019 Cuddy declared when she got off the phone with the state lab, after hearing about the Codis match.\u2018\u2018That\u2019s awesome!\u2019\u2019 Landisio said.\u2018\u2018That\u2019s some \u2018Law & Order\u2019 [expletive] right there,\u201d Formica added. When Segui came into the office, Cuddy told her the news. \u2018\u2018That deserves a drink,\u2019\u2019 the sergeant said.\u2018\u2018I think that deserves breast milk from the supervisor,\u2019\u2019 Cuddy replied. Segui tilted her head, smiling and looking at Cuddy the way you might at a particularly precocious and captivating child, then headed off to a meeting.\u2018\u2018So good, so good,\u2019\u2019 Cuddy said emphatically, talking to herself, as she looked up the suspect\u2019s criminal record. \u2018\u2018Stranger rapes never get solved.\u2019\u2019 She stared at his mug shot for a minute: a slight, rabbity-looking man in his early 20s with an almost concave face. \u2018\u2018That\u2019s the little [expletive].\u2019\u2019 Immediately, she made out the arrest warrant for each attack, handing them to Segui for review. Segui submitted them to court a week later. The suspect was due to be released from prison in November, so it seemed as if nothing could possibly go wrong. The man would be served with the warrant while he was still locked up; no other woman would be forced through that terrible ordeal.Victim No. 1 had dropped out of sight, but Cuddy phoned victim No. 2, the mother in her 40s. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m calling to let you know I received a Codis match, and I will be doing an arrest warrant for your attacker. As soon as I serve it, I will let you know.\u2019\u2019 There was a pause. \u2018\u2018You\u2019re welcome. Goodbye.\u2019\u2019 Cuddy said the victim started crying at the news. She turned to me, her face lit from the inside, and said, \u2018\u2018And that, my dear, is why I do this job.\u2019\u2019In most of these model cities, victims aren\u2019t interviewed in the bare-bones rooms used for suspects but in more comfortable ones, with couches, artwork and lamps. They\u2019re given handouts describing how the criminal-justice process works, how to apply for victims\u2019 compensation and information on victims\u2019 support groups. Austin and Grand Rapids have a blind reporting option that allows the victim to be anonymous but still give useful information to the detectives.All these police agencies have extensive reviews in place, so detectives aren\u2019t allowed to shelve a case without oversight. Philadelphia significantly revamped its sex-crimes unit after a 1999 Philadelphia Inquirer investigation revealed that the unit was misclassifying \u2014 basically burying \u2014 about a third of all complaints it received. Since then, an external oversight committee made up of experts in women\u2019s legal rights, children\u2019s advocates and staff members from rape-crisis centers has examined 300 to 400 cases annually, including all \u2018\u2018unfounded\u2019\u2019 rape reports.In these units, detectives and victims stay in contact. The No. 1 complaint of sexual-assault survivors, according to Archambault, is that law enforcement doesn\u2019t keep them up to date on the status of their investigations; often detectives don\u2019t even return victims\u2019 phone calls. Yet keeping in touch with the victims is espe\u00adcially important in the case of sexual assault, she says, \u2018\u2018because there are so few good outcomes.\u2019\u2019 Denied justice, victims especially need to feel respected by law enforcement. But the reason that it\u2019s crucial to stay in contact with the victims is the same reason that detectives often don\u2019t \u2014 they hate being the bearers of bad news. As noted in the policy and training guidelines published in 2015 by the International Association of Chiefs of Police: \u2018\u2018Virtually all sexual-assault victims want validation from the authorities that the crime occurred, and this may be a more critical element of a successful response and investigation than a criminal prosecution or conviction. Regardless of the investigative results, responding officers and investigators have the power to help a person heal from sexual assault.\u2019\u2019Many educators and leaders in this field say that arrest rates are not the best indicators of success. Instead, the thoroughness of the investigation and whether the victim stays in the process are more useful. Crime numbers are also not a good indicator of successful policing, unless you\u2019re willing to use what feels like reverse logic: Better, more responsive policing means more victims come forward. And more honest record-keeping means more of those assaults are counted.The assistant state\u2019s attorney had decided that the office was going to, in his words, \u2018\u2018wait\u2019\u2019 on the warrant regarding the prostitute\u2019s rape, because there was semen from multiple men on the vaginal swab. Cuddy was furious. \u2018\u2018The guy is a serial rapist,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018And obviously, there\u2019s a mix \u2014 she\u2019s a prostitute.\u2019\u2019 And although there was a mix of DNA on the vaginal swab, only the suspect\u2019s DNA was found on the swab taken from the woman\u2019s mouth.The state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office had also requested an additional piece of information for the other warrant. Now that it had a suspect, the court wanted Cuddy to ask the second victim whether she knew the man or ever had a sexual relationship with him. Cuddy had no choice but to make that call, and later that day she typed two additional sentences into the warrant application saying the victim did not know the suspect and never had sex with him before the rape. She looked angry and tired, and Landisio kept casting worried glances her way.There were dark moments at the S.V.U., and this was one of them; they moved in fast and sucked the light out of the room. And then you saw how much sense it would make to chuck everything \u2014 the sobbing mothers, the kids and the women muscling their way through their statements, every word like a nail in their mouths.That afternoon, a fresh-faced intern, a criminal-justice major from the University of New Haven, popped into the office. \u2018\u2018The copy machine\u2019s not working again,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018It says it needs resources. It has paper, it has toner, what resources does it want?\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018It wants your soul,\u2019\u2019 Cuddy told her. \u2018\u2018Just slip it in the slot. We all have.\u2019\u2019 There was a beat of silence, then Landisio, the intern, Natale and Formica (who had ducked into the office to see why it was so weirdly quiet) broke into laughter. Cuddy lowered her sharp little chin and, glancing coyly at them all, flashed a grin.This is what they lived on, what drove them forward \u2014 a sense of justice, of course, but that justice was so infrequent, so arbitrary, that their fuel had to be camaraderie and humor. They carried one another, quite literally in one case \u2014 Landisio hauling Cuddy into her apartment on his back after a night of drinking on the anniversary of her father\u2019s death. Once, when I asked them what the toughest part of their job was, they didn\u2019t say mucking through the ugliness of these cases every day; they didn\u2019t mention their huge workload. They said it was waiting for the court to approve their arrest warrants. The average delay, Cuddy said, was three months. One case that I watched them pursue took 10. Victims gave up. \u2018\u2018I just had a victim drop out of a case last week,\u2019\u2019 Landisio told me at one point. \u2018\u2018She said to me, \u2018I didn\u2019t think it would take so long.\u2019 She said she was over it now and just wanted to move on.\u2019\u2019 Months crawled by, and suspects disappeared.By spring, Natale got her wish and was transferred to Major Crimes. Detective Shayna Kendall, from their old crew, got her wish and returned. She moved her desk into Cuddy and Landisio\u2019s office, and you could feel the unit picking up cohesion, efficiency, speed. (By the fall, Detective Lenny Soto would also be returned to the unit, and he, too, would move his desk inside that tiny office, so the four detectives were almost joined at the hip.) A week after Kendall\u2019s return, she had 17 cases, some carried over from when she was still in the squad, cases waiting at court for arrest warrants, as well as new ones assigned by Segui. Cuddy had 22. Landisio, working 21 cases, including a sex-trafficking case he was investigating with the F.B.I., said he felt as if he were \u2018\u2018juggling cannon balls.\u2019\u2019 Segui apologized, saying she tried to hold back those that weren\u2019t as urgent, but Cuddy said, \u2018\u2018Just [expletive] assign them. We\u2019ll prioritize and do what we have to do.\u2019\u2019When Cuddy finally received her arrest warrant for the Codis case, it was six months after her first request, and three months after she was asked to add the follow-up sentences. The inspector at the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office called her with the news, and she reminded him that the suspect was in prison, so the court would serve the warrant. Shortly afterward, the inspector emailed her. When she read the email, she was livid. The suspect was released early \u2014 a month prior, in fact. \u2018\u2018They sat on a Codis case for what? Six months?\u2019\u2019 she said, spitting out the words. \u2018\u2018He\u2019s gonna be in a homeless shelter. I\u2019m never gonna find this guy \u2014 if he\u2019s not already in Mexico.\u2019\u2019 He had been released without parole, so there was no parole officer to contact and no forwarding address.She, Kendall and Landisio began searching databases, trying to find some whiff of him, while Cuddy muttered to herself: \u2018\u2018Don\u2019t get frustrated. Just do all this [expletive]. Do it for nothing.\u2019\u2019 Then Kendall hit on something \u2014 their suspect was stopped by the police three days earlier, and when they asked where he lived, he gave them his sister\u2019s address. Within minutes, the three detectives, Sergeant Segui and Officer Formica were piled into two cars, heading to the address. The suspect\u2019s two sisters were in the second-floor apartment of a multifamily house. Once the detectives were let in to search the premises, Cuddy found a bedroom that was locked. After shouting \u2018\u2018Police!\u2019\u2019 to no response, she kicked the door in while the sisters screamed at her in Spanish. But no one was inside. The sisters said they hadn\u2019t seen their brother since he was locked up over a year ago.On the ride back to the stationhouse, as the detectives recounted the raid, the adrenaline seeped from the car like boiling water from a pot going dry. Cuddy didn\u2019t believe the sisters; in a way, she didn\u2019t want to. But the next day, she found out that her suspect was, indeed, gone for good. He had been deported back to Mexico. \u2018\u2018And these guys never stop,\u2019\u2019 Cuddy said.Over the next 24 hours, her anger died away, morphing into a kind of grim fatalism. She had done everything right, the victims had soldiered through the investigation, submitting to the forensic exam, recounting the attack for the record. They had actually nailed the guy, and now he was gone. Cuddy stared bleakly at the pile of case files on her desk, making no move to open them. Finally she let out a sigh. She had to inform her victim now. The woman had cried with relief when she learned they had identified her rapist. Cuddy decided she had to do it in person. \u2018\u2018I\u2019ll come with you when you do it,\u2019\u2019 Landisio said. Cuddy looked at him and nodded. Then she turned to her newest case file.Kathy Dobie is the author of the memoir \u2018\u2018The Only Girl in the Car.\u2019\u2019 She has written for GQ and Harper\u2019s Magazine.Advertisement"}

By the time Maier took Bertrand\u00e2\u0080\u0099s portrait at the studio in 1954, the older photographer had been working in the field for more than half a century.\u00c2\u00a0Pictured in her hands: Vivian Maier negatives (Slides 2 and 3).Here are six\u00c2\u00a0previous Lens posts exploring work by Vivian Maier.This\u00c2\u00a0portrait and others suggest much about the artistic development of Maier, a street photographer who doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t appear to have made an effort to show her work before she died in 2009 at the age of 83. Not only did Maier know Bertrand, she also went more than once to meet with \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and likely to learn from \u00e2\u0080\u0094 her and her colleagues, who made careers using their cameras.Among the bigger questions that have been asked of Maier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work: Why did she keep it a secret? And how did she, a nanny, take such good photographs?When Maier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grandmother Eugenie Jaussaud moved to New York, she left her daughter, Marie, who was born out of wedlock, in a convent in France. Jaussaud, who was Roman Catholic, worked as a cook in high-society households. Eventually, her daughter joined her.In New York, Marie married Charles Maier, who worked at the National Biscuit Company. According to documents, one of the\u00c2\u00a0witnesses at their wedding was a church janitor; the other was the pastor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife. Their first child, a boy, was born in 1920, baptized Charles in a Catholic church.Ms. Marks made note of the words \u00e2\u0080\u009cfilius naturalis,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which are written on the baptismal record. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBefore the eyes of God,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she writes, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMarie declared Charles Jr. illegitimate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The same baby was baptized a few months later in a Protestant church, under a different name: Karl William Maier Jr.These pieces of information were hints, in Ms. Marks\u00e2\u0080\u0099s view, that Maier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 marriage was unhappy early on. By the time Karl was 5, he was placed in the Heckscher Foundation Children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Home, and later in his grandparents\u2019 custody.In 1926, Vivian Dorothy Maier was born and baptized Catholic. The following year, her parents separated. At 4, Vivian moved to the Bronx with her mother and Jeanne Bertrand, the photographer. It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t long before Jaussaud took young Vivian to France with Bertrand, leaving Karl behind with his grandparents.Meanwhile, Maier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parents divorced and her paternal grandfather, William, died. Ms. Marks found a New York Times obituary from Jan. 30, 1936, that called William the \u00e2\u0080\u009cgrandfather of Charles von Maier Jr.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The next day, another obituary said he had two grandchildren, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCharles von Maier Jr. and Dorothea Vivian von Maier.\u00e2\u0080\u009dKarl started getting into trouble after his grandfather died: He was transferred first to a probationary school and later spent three years in the New York Vocational School at Coxsackie. Ms. Marks dug through records at the New York State Archives, which included a number of letters between Karl and his family, as well as letters to and from the staff at the facility.In letters, Vivian and Karl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s paternal grandmother said that her son was an alcoholic with a gambling problem. Their maternal grandmother spoke disparagingly of her daughter in letters she wrote from the Vanderbilt estate in Florida, where she was working.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn all of the records from these years, there is virtually no mention of Vivian except by Eugenie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Marks said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEveryone else seemed to treat her like wallpaper.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMaier spent some time in Queens in the care of a family that fostered children. Later on, her mother moved out of their apartment and a Frenchwoman\u00c2\u00a0named Emilie Haugmard became her unofficial guardian. Maier\u00c2\u00a0took a series of photos at the beach\u00c2\u00a0with Ms. Haugmard, including one in which they stand smiling, side-by-side, in bathing suits (Slide 1).There are, presumably, dozens of images in Maier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s archives featuring people she cared for \u00e2\u0080\u0094 people who had an impact on her as a photographer and as a person. So far, with Ms. Marks\u00e2\u0080\u0099s help, Mr. Goldstein and Mr. Maloof have found only one series of three portraits of the woman they believe to be Maier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother. A print of one of those portraits was in the possession of relatives in France.In her work, one of Maier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s preoccupations was taking photos of older women of the working class \u00e2\u0080\u0094 women like her mother and grandmother, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe maternal figures of her youth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Marks writes.Ms. Marks has yet to find records indicating that Maier attended school in the United States. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear that she fared better than her brother. When he tried to join the Army in 1941, Ms. Marks found, he was rejected because of a criminal record, according to his military record. The next year, he was drafted and discharged dishonorably because of his morphine addiction.In the years to come, both of Maier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grandmothers died. Eugenie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s estate was split among Vivian, Carl and Marie, who was then living in a boardinghouse. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEugenie stipulated that her grandchildren receive payment outright, but that Marie receive a bond with regular, lifetime payments,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Marks writes, \u00e2\u0080\u009can official acknowledgment that she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t trust her daughter.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThat year, Maier purchased her first camera. She soon returned to the family home in France, where she photographed endlessly: landscapes, local residents and animals. She sold the ancestral home, which had been bequeathed to her by an aunt.\u201cOne of Maier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s preoccupations was taking photos of older women of the working class \u00e2\u0080\u0094 women like her mother and her grandmother.\u201dWhen Maier went back to France for the last time in 1959 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 at the end of an adventurous world tour that included a stop in Shanghai \u00e2\u0080\u0094 she learned there had been a rift between her relatives and her parents, which was described to Ms. Marks by relatives in France. It appears that a rift developed within her immediate family, too.In his will, Charles Maier disinherited his children when he died nearly a decade later. Likewise, when Marie died in New York in 1975 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 at which point she had been living in a less-than-reputable hotel \u00e2\u0080\u0094 her two children went unmentioned.Karl had admitted himself to a psychiatric hospital in New Jersey in 1955 under the name John William Henry Jaussaud (Karl Maier) and given a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. He died in 1977 after spending his final years in a rest home.To Ms. Marks, this information helps clarify why Maier may have been so secretive in her later years. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow many upper middle class families \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 want to hire a nanny with a violent alcoholic father, unstable mother and drug-addicted brother who had a record and lived in psychiatric institutions?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she writes.And yet, perhaps Maier simply wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t one to mix life and work.Ms. Marks is not the only person studying the life and history of Vivian Maier. Pamela Bannos, a professor at Northwestern University who teaches photography in the department of art theory and practice, has been working on Maier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biography for about three years. Ms. Bannos, whose project is called \u00e2\u0080\u009cVivian Maier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Fractured Archive,\u00e2\u0080\u009d is also exploring the posthumous story of the work, which has many layers.There is much more to be discovered about Maier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s past. As more details are revealed, the photography community will gain a better understanding of the perspective behind thousands and thousands of images."}

Microsoft\u2019s cloud services include Azure, which allows organizations to host their own websites and online applications in Microsoft\u2019s data centers, as well as Power BI, Dynamics CRM Online and other Microsoft-made applications for running organizations. CRM Online, for instance, is a customer relationship management service that can be useful for nonprofits in accepting financial contributions from individual donors.   Microsoft has been giving away traditional software for years. Mr. Smith estimates the value of those software donations at about $750 million a year and said that they will continue even as Microsoft gives away cloud services. Microsoft hopes to give away its cloud services to 70,000 nonprofits in the next three years. The company plans to expand by 50 percent an existing program that donates Azure storage and computing resources to university projects. The company will also invest in low-cost Internet access technologies in developing countries. Microsoft says it will not take a tax deduction for the donated cloud services.Mr. Smith said that Microsoft decided against creating an independent foundation for its philanthropic efforts because it believed the effort would have more impact if it was part of the company. \u201cOur philosophy is that philanthropy, at its best, often combines doing well with doing good,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the defining characteristics of Microsoft in 2016 is the degree to which we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a mission-driven company.

Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gloom, Senator Marco Rubio on Monday told an audience here that half of young Americans believe that the American Dream is dead, a warning sign he said should rouse voters to seek a new direction in 2016.Mr. Rubio cited unnamed public opinion surveys in which millenials say that they believe the American Dream no longer applies to them. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a warning sign for America \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a sign that what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at stake in this election is our identity as a special nation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said at a marine supply business here where he discussed economic and tax policy.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere in America, anyone who works hard can leave their children better off than themselves,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is the real American Dream.

But lately he has been more negative, saying for example that the country is in decline.He has also adopted a sharper edge with rivals like Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, whom he attacked again on Monday.

{"Headline": "F.B.I. Is Asked to Investigate Chicago Police Shooting That Left 2 Dead", "Date": "2015-12-31", "News": "Supported byCHICAGO \u2014 The top county prosecutor here\u00a0Thursday\u00a0asked the F.B.I. to investigate the fatal shooting of two people by a Chicago police officer over the weekend, and Mayor Rahm Emanuel\u2019s administration separately released a trove of emails showing how City Hall aides scrambled for months to address an earlier police shooting that was captured on video.\u00a0The request for a federal investigation, made by State\u2019s Attorney Anita Alvarez of Cook County, came five days after an officer fatally shot Quintonio LeGrier, a college student said to have been wielding a baseball bat, and Bettie Jones, a 55-year-old neighbor who police said was accidentally struck by the gunfire. The F.B.I. did not announce an investigation, but said in a statement there was ongoing \u201canalysis and assessment of the circumstances surrounding the incident.\u201d\u00a0On Thursday, as protesters again marched through downtown, his administration released about 3,000 pages of emails related to the McDonald case that spanned more than a year. The messages showed top City Hall officials coordinating a response to the shooting, sharing information about media inquiries with the independent body that investigates police shootings, and in recent weeks seeking to temper dissent and make changes to Chicago\u2019s embattled Police Department.\u00a0Mr. McDonald was carrying a knife and veering away from police on Oct. 20, 2014, when Officer Jason Van Dyke shot him repeatedly, continuing to fire after he collapsed on the ground. The police cruiser camera footage, which City Hall officials sought for months to keep sealed, was released under court order in November on the same day Officer Van Dyke was charged with first-degree murder. Officer Van Dyke told investigators he shot because he feared for his safety.\u00a0The emails, made public after open records requests by news organizations, show a growing awareness among Mr. Emanuel\u2019s aides of the case\u2019s significance in early 2015 and their repeated denials of journalists\u2019 open-records requests for the video or other documents related to the case. Then comes the harried outreach to community leaders after a judge ordered the video be made public.\u00a0\u201cWe have five days to build community buy in and dialogue,\u201d David Spielfogel, a mayoral adviser, wrote to fellow aides after a lawyer offered to help plan a peaceful demonstration before the video was released. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t waste a second.\u201d\u00a0Notably sparse in the documents, which spanned October 2014 to early December 2015, were emails from Mr. Emanuel, who officials said usually communicates with staff by phone and in person.\u00a0In one of the rare emails from Mr. Emanuel in the release, from days before the video was made public, the mayor asked Kelley Quinn, a spokeswoman, about the weather forecast. \u201cHow much snow then,\u201d he wrote, in a partly redacted email chain. Another time, Mr. Emanuel asked aides questions about police body cameras as city officials announced increased use of them in Chicago.\u00a0Though the death of Mr. McDonald has dominated national headlines recently, it received relatively little attention in the days after the shooting. The morning after the shooting, Chicago Public Schools officials copied mayoral aides on a note about the encounter and a request not to publicize it immediately \u201cdue to the sensitivity of the incident.\u201d\u00a0There was, however, growing concern at City Hall, after the election, about how the case could affect Mr. Emanuel at a time of increased scrutiny nationally about police conduct.\u00a0In April, a members of The New York Times editorial board emailed with communications staff about the settlement, one aide asked colleagues whether there was \u201cvalue in making clear that the mayor wants the video out as well\u201d after the criminal investigation was completed. Adam Collins, a spokesman for Mr. Emanuel, suggested that the mayor be left out of the response. \u201cUltimately,\u201d Mr. Collins wrote, \u201cthey want the video out now, so the line isn\u2019t going to be very persuasive anyways and I\u2019m not sure we want to insert him into any more than he already is.\u201dMr. Collins, complained to colleagues in May that the Independent Police Review Authority, the city agency that investigates the most egregious complaints of officer misconduct, did not follow his recommendation on how to respond to a television station about the McDonald case.The messages show regular discussions about news media requests between mayoral staffers and top officials at the review authority. Ms. Quinn, the mayoral spokeswoman, said on Thursday that the correspondence was appropriate, and that the mayor\u2019s office does not interfere with investigations. For months, Mr. Emanuel\u2019s aides monitored news sites, Facebook and Twitter for Mr. McDonald\u2019s name; five days before the video was released, one press aide noted that #LaquanMcDonald was a \u201ctrending topic\u201d on Twitter.\u00a0They were also sensitive to news media coverage that suggested impending unrest. \u201cCan someone please monitor social media on the release of the video?\u201d Ms. Quinn emailed fellow aides. \u201cWant to see if the drumbeat gets louder.\u201d\u00a0Also in the buildup to the release, an aide emailed others for help in arranging a meeting between Mr. Emanuel and Mr. McDonald\u2019s family.\u00a0Ms. Quinn said Thursday\u00a0that the meeting never happened. After the video\u2019s release, though demonstrations remained largely peaceful, there was a growing realization at City Hall that questions about police conduct were not subsiding.\u00a0\u201cFollowing protest, I met with organizers and faith leaders,\u201d the note said.

Trump told a packed hotel ballroom in New Hampshire on Friday that he had shown the world just how tough he could be by standing up to Fox News.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen somebody doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t treat you properly, you gotta be tough, you gotta be strong,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said, adding: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat goes for the country. When you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not treated properly, you have to stick up for your rights.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAnd having vanquished \u00e2\u0080\u0093 by his account \u00e2\u0080\u0093 one adversary in the news media, Mr. Trump reopened his feud with another influential conservative-leaning institution, New Hampshire\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Union Leader newspaper.Mr. Trump has denounced the paper repeatedly since it endorsed Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey for president, but on Friday he let loose with a new and more intense stream of invective against The Union Leader and its publisher, Joseph W. McQuaid.Mr. McQuaid, he said, was a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbad guy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009ca liar,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009ca psycho\u00e2\u0080\u009d and a \u00e2\u0080\u009cdirty dog.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He charged, not for the first time, that Mr. McQuaid had sought to extract advertising and political favors in exchange for an endorsement.

The paper is considered one of the two print outlets with the greatest sway over conservative voters. (The other, The Boston Herald, has also endorsed Mr. Christie.)

The rest, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis familiar and we have responded to it numerous times.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn a followup email, Mr. McQuaid suggested that Mr. Trump may have \u00e2\u0080\u009csome psychological issues.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe seems to be obsessive-compulsive when it comes to Megyn Kelly of Fox,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, referring to the debate moderator with whom Mr. Trump has clashed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u2019m happy to join her on the list!\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Trump spoke only in passing about the substance of the Republican debate on Thursday night, pronouncing it a setback for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, his most formidable opponent in the Iowa caucuses.

{"Headline": "Opposing Factions Take to Facebook in Oregon Wildlife Refuge Dispute", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "Supported byPRINCETON, Ore. \u2014 As more people beg the armed antigovernment protesters who took over the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge here three weeks ago to go home, the protesters this week embarked on a new quest: a search for allies.So far, few people seem to be lining up behind them. Residents of the town of Burns, the largest nearby community, turned out in force on Tuesday to demand that the protesters vacate. The governor of Oregon, Kate Brown, exhorted federal officials to roust the group, which is led by the brothers Ammon and Ryan Bundy and an ally, LaVoy Finicum. The F.B.I. tried talking to them this week, apparently with no luck.On Wednesday, the protesters tried to enlist support from the Burns Paiute Tribe. The message \u2014 that the federally owned land of the Malheur refuge should be returned to its original owners \u2014 might seem like one that would appeal to the tribe, but it did not.The Bundy group is also trying to recruit local ranchers. On Saturday, they plan to hold a ceremony for ranchers to renounce federal ownership of public land and tear up their federal cattle grazing contracts \u2014 an act they are calling a \u201cdeclaration of emancipation.\u201d Just one person has confirmed attendance, a rancher from New Mexico. The conflict has spilled over into social media. One flashpoint was a trove of ancient tribal artifacts belonging to the Burns Paiute and housed at the Malheur refuge. The protesters asserted in a Facebook video that the relics were being neglected, and the government workers also took to Facebook to say they were safeguarding the items at the tribe\u2019s request.In one video posted to the Bundy Ranch Facebook page, Mr. Finicum is seen examining boxes that he said contained grinding stones, projectile points and other Paiute artifacts, which he said were near a rat\u2019s nest. \u201cThis is how the Native Americans\u2019 heritage is being treated \u2014 to me, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s acceptable,\u201d Mr. Finicum said.At the refuge, Mr. Finicum agreed to take a reporter to see the artifacts. Entering one of the Malheur buildings, he climbed down a narrow stairwell into a dark basement. Then he began pulling items from boxes stacked on a metal shelf \u2014 a flint knife, obsidian arrowheads \u2014 each one wrapped in a plastic bag and carefully labeled.Mr. Finicum rolled his hands over a grinding stone. \u201cWhy does the federal government get to keep these things for 30 years down in the basement? Either put them out on display or give them to who they belong.\u201dHe said he wanted to return the items to their owners \u2014 the Burns Paiute Tribe. \u201cWe want to have a powwow or a confab, and we are trying to see what we can do to help them,\u201d he said. collect material for making of traditional crafts like baskets, cradle boards, mats and boats. The artifacts were stored \u201cwith the full knowledge and blessing of the Burns Paiute Tribe,\u201d the posting said.\u201cThe illegal occupants violated the security of the refuge,\u201d the posting said. \u201cThese artifacts have been curated and stored under lock and key.\u201dThe chairwoman of the Burns Paiute Tribe, Charlotte Rodrique, said in an interview this week with the Indian Country Today Media Network that the tribe was \u201creally worried about the status of the artifacts down there.\u201dMs. Rodrique did not return telephone calls or an email on Friday seeking further comment.\u201cThe F.B.I. has reached out to us,\u201d he said in that video. But the talks did not change anything, he said, about the group\u2019s commitment to shift control of the refuge lands into local hands.Refuge employees, in a letter posted on the refuge website, reminded residents of Harney County that government workers are part of the community, too.\u201cWe can have effective disagreements and either find resolution, find compromise, or simply agree to disagree,\u201d the letter said. \u201cBut we do it with respect for the rule of law.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Broken System\u2019 Allows ISIS to Profit From Looted Antiquities", "Date": "2016-01-09", "News": "Supported byLaws around the world are weak and inconsistent, and customs enforcement can screen only a portion of what crosses international borders, according to officials and experts in trafficking. Long-established smuggling organizations are practiced in getting the goods to people willing to pay for them, and patient enough to stash ancient artifacts in warehouses until scrutiny dies down. Despite a near-universal outcry over the Islamic State\u2019s actions, few countries have shown interest in imposing new restrictions to curb the booming trade in antiquities, estimated to be worth billions of dollars a year.Officials still do not know how the artifacts ended up in Shumen or whether they passed through Islamic State territory. For every seizure like the one here, many other pieces are believed to reach dealers and buyers in Vienna, Munich, London and New York. Dealers exploit the legal trade in antiquities to move objects that have been looted for years amid the conflicts in Syria and Iraq, as well as Libya, Yemen and Egypt, officials and experts said.\u201cWe\u2019re faced with the largest-scale mass destruction of cultural heritage since the Second World War, and we\u2019re going to have to do something about it,\u201d said France Desmarais, director of programs and partnerships at the International Council of Museums.The scale of the looting under the Islamic State has prompted many nations to try to stanch the flow, and the revenue, though it is hardly the group\u2019s largest source, given its trade in oil.Still, such efforts have done little to plug gaps in the enforcement of laws against trafficking or to stifle the insatiable demand of the antiquities market. In Germany, like some other countries, privacy laws protect buyers and sellers from scrutiny. The United States has no explicit prohibition on the sale of artifacts from Syria.Some of the collectors willing to buy black-market artifacts are believed to be in Persian Gulf countries. But many others, experts say, are in the West.\u201cThere appears to be an interesting geographic divide: Pre-Islamic objects go to Europe and North America, while Islamic art goes to countries of the gulf,\u201d said Markus Hilgert, director of the Museum of the Ancient Near East in Berlin, who is coordinating a research project on the illicit trade.Since 2011, the authorities in Turkey have seized 6,800 objects, a majority of them coins, and are holding them in regional museums until their origins can be determined, according to Necati Anaz, the deputy manager of the International Center for Terrorism and Transnational Crime in Ankara. Dr. Anaz said the challenge was that many of the smallest objects could easily be carried in bags or in clothes.Many of the recently looted artifacts, antiquities experts say, are probably being kept in warehouses in or near Syria and Iraq until attention has waned.\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate how patient the dealers with international connections are,\u201d he said.After antiquities leave the Islamic State\u2019s territory, experts say they fall into the hands of existing smuggling and criminal networks that are practiced at trafficking people, drugs or other contraband from Syria and Iraq. \u201cOnce they hit these networks, they go everywhere, and they\u2019re very hard to track,\u201d said Brent Easter, a customs special agent in New York who investigates art smuggling.Bulgaria, which is home to scores of ancient sites, has a notorious history as a conduit for smuggling, officials said. When illicit antiquities cross into Europe, it becomes easier for smugglers to create documents listing them as authentic discoveries that can be legally bought and sold.\u201cWe are the most direct route from Turkey and the Middle East,\u201d said Bozhidar Dimitrov, the director of the National History Museum in Sofia.Vladimir Kaidzhiyev, a senior police inspector in Shumen, said the police had acted on information that a smuggling network was moving a shipment through the region. Early one morning in March, dozens of officers raided the shed and three other places.They confiscated more than 9,000 items, including figurines, jewelry and coins that were 2,000 years old, as well as molds and other material that suggested some of them could be fakes. The 19 larger sculptures included a lion\u2019s head, a Gorgon relief and a funerary panel. Many were encrusted with dirt, suggesting they had been excavated recently, not taken from a museum.\u201cI\u2019ve seen something like this only in Rome,\u201d said Inspector Kaidzhiyev, who typically investigates more common crimes.The larger pieces had coded labels; the tablet, for example, was marked 12x. Three suspects were arrested, including the owner of the shed, Veysel Sanli, a Turk with citizenship in Bulgaria. They are free on bail while the investigation continues.The prosecutor overseeing the case, Margarita Georgieva, said in an interview that the items had arrived from Turkey, but that investigators had not been able to establish their destination or provenance, which makes trafficking cases hard to prosecute.She said Mr. Sanli claimed to collect as a hobby and to have acquired some of the items from a shop in Izmir, Turkey, though the shop specializes in reproductions, and the seized goods appeared genuine. She added that investigators had found photographs of more artifacts on Mr. Sanli\u2019s cellphone and on memory cards, suggesting they were being offered for sale in Germany.\u201cThere are not many people who could afford these items,\u201d Ms. Georgieva said.So far, Mr. Sanli has been charged only with possessing cultural property, a crime punishable by one to six years in prison. Reached through his Facebook account, he declined to comment.The State Department is discussing the case with Bulgaria.For now, the items remain in storage in the regional history museum in Shumen. The museum\u2019s director, Georgi Maystorksi, expressed relief that at least they had not fallen into private hands, never to be seen or studied. \u201cThere are so few successes in this world,\u201d he said.An article on Jan. 10 about the barriers that hamper the international fight against the illegal trafficking of antiquities, a crime that reached new heights as the Islamic State terrorist group plundered ancient sites in Syria and Iraq, misstated the year that the group declared its caliphate. It was 2014, not 2013.Milen Enchev contributed reporting from Sofia, Bulgaria, and Ceylan Yeginsu from Istanbul.Advertisement"}

Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, and Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, are circulating a bill that would repeal the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which was passed by Congress in 2005 and which for the most part shields gun manufacturers from liability after gun crimes. The law has been a feature on the campaign trail as well, as Hillary Clinton has criticized Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont over his vote for the bill.The goal of the law, its supporters said, was to protect the gun industry from frivolous lawsuits. One unintended consequence, Mr. Schiff said, was that so-called straw purchasers, or traffickers who buy guns and sell them to people who cannot pass a background check, have also ended up protected. (Mr. Sanders has said he is for closing this loophole.)  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe lost a police officer in Burbank who was killed with a gun purchased by straw purchaser,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Schiff said on Tuesday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGuns are the only industry that is immune to liability, and I don\u2019t think it should be.

Mrs. Clinton recalled her support for those measures \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and that President Bill Clinton had signed them \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and also aligned herself with President Obama on his recent executive action on gun control, while portraying Mr. Sanders as an obstacle to stopping the shooting massacres that have become a constant in the United States.\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk to me about standing up to corporate interests and big powers,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said to strong applause from the audience. \u201cI have the scars to show for it. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m proud of every single one of them.\u201dOn Tuesday Mrs. Clinton even mocked Mr. Sanders at one point, mimicking his voice as she reiterated his defense for supporting the immunity bill. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe says, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m from Vermont,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton noted before pivoting to say that home-state concerns were not a sufficient explanation. She pointed out that Mr. Sanders \u00e2\u0080\u009cconstantly reminds people\u00e2\u0080\u009d that she had ties to Wall Street as a senator from New York, but she then argued that she had challenged banks and hedge funds over their financial practices.Mrs. Clinton was joined on stage by Dan Gross, the president of the Brady Campaign, who also criticized Mr. Sanders and led the audience in shouting \u00e2\u0080\u009cHillary\u00e2\u0080\u009d to credit her as the Democratic candidate who had worked the hardest on gun control legislation. Mrs. Clinton was introduced by Delphine Cherry, who lost two children to gun violence and struggled a bit with her emotions as she told her story; Mrs. Clinton gave her a long hug afterward and whispered to her at some length.Mrs. Clinton also repeated a new line of attack against Mr. Sanders over his support for a single-payer health insurance system administered by states, warning that Republican governors would damage the health care system and urging Democrats to be realistic about what changes could be accomplished.She spoke as Quinnipiac University released its latest poll of likely Democratic caucusgoers in Iowa, which showed Mr. Sanders with the support of 49 percent to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 44 percent, a sharp reversal from last month\u2019s Quinnipiac poll, which showed Mrs. Clinton with 51 percent support to Mr. Sanders\u2019s 40.At a campaign event later on Tuesday at the University of Dubuque, Mrs. Clinton continued to take aim at Mr. Sanders, issuing a direct challenge to him to explain how he will pay for his proposals, some of which she described as \u00e2\u0080\u009cpie in the sky.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve laid out a whole tax plan because I want you to know where I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going and what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going at,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton told an atrium full of supporters. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy friend Senator Sanders said he would lay out his tax plan before the caucus. Well I hope he does, because a lot of what he brings up in his campaign would be very expensive.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDemonstrating that she has been paying closer attention to the details of Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plans, Mrs. Clinton estimated that his policies would end up costing as much as $20 trillion over the next 10 years.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of money, that would raise the federal budget by 40 percent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou deserve to know what the differences are and then you can make an informed decision.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAlan Rappeport contributed reporting from Dubuque.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Spanx for the Holidays", "Date": "2016-01-02", "News": "Supported byMirrorMany of us think of the holidays as the giving season. I think of it as the stalking season. That\u2019s because I have been relentlessly followed online by advertisements for shapewear. The emails have poured in, and every sales site I frequent \u2014 Zulily, MyHabit, Ideel \u2014 has touted their wonders.While the people at Spanx won\u2019t say when their sales peak, they do confess to making a special push for \u201choliday dressing\u201d \u2014 which often means form-fitting, pricier clothes. And that means that the love-hate relationship many women have with their \u201csculpting\u201d undergarments is particularly fraught this time of year.For year-round wearers, holidays are simply business as usual.\u201cHow can you even be asking me this question?\u201d shouted Jennifer Lupo, a New York lawyer who is to Rago Shapewear what Anna Wintour is to sunglasses. \u201cNo woman should ever leave the house without Lycra on her thighs. I don\u2019t want to see my own cellulite, so why would I want to see yours?\u201dAviva Drescher, a former \u201cHousewife\u201d of New York, shared her best shapewear tip. \u201cThe secret to Spanx is double Spanx,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to wear two at a time for serious sucking-in.\u201dFor some, the uses of these undergarments surpass the simple compression of flesh. \u201cThey were great, one, when I fell and broke two ribs, and, two, when I had my spleen removed,\u201d said Lynn Weddington Tucker, a retired public relations consultant in New York.Diane Clehane is the Lunch columnist for FishbowlNY on Adweek\u2019s website, where each week she bears witness to \u201cthousands of dollars of Spanx in one room\u201d at the media hot spot Michael\u2019s.\u201cI can\u2019t imagine leaving the house in a dress without them,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they made one I could put over my head, I would.\u201d(Ms. Clehane may be pleased to know she\u2019s not the first person to think of this. In 2010, an Oklahoma woman wore Spanx over her head while she robbed a McDonald\u2019s.)And then there are those who argue that comfort is paramount. As one friend put it: \u201cI\u2019m 51 years old and I deserve comfort over vanity. In fact, I\u2019ve earned it.\u201dBut many women find themselves caught in the middle; constricted, if you will, by the demands of partygoing, when everyone looks just a little more soign\u00e9e than you do. It\u2019s the reason we rely on our shapewear. Until we don\u2019t.\u201cI have actually gone into a host\u2019s bedroom with a scissors and cut them from my body,\u201d said Lauren Lowenthal, a founder of an academic coaching company in New York.Ms. Lowenthal was at a party in Los Angeles with a date with whom she was smitten. But the shapewear had to be sacrificed. \u201cI buried them at the bottom of the bedroom garbage under tissues, and returned the scissors to the kitchen,\u201d she said.An informal survey on Facebook reveals that a surprising number of garments have met the same fate. Gaylen Ross, a documentary filmmaker in Brooklyn, said she felt bad about it, though. \u201cI have a feeling Spanx have a half-life of 2,000 years,\u201d she said.Lisa DePaulo, a writer, said she believes that sometimes her shapewear is out to get her. \u201cHow about when you\u2019re thinking you look great, and you suddenly realize your cami is slowly rolling up your torso?\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many parties I\u2019ve come back from and I\u2019m hiking them down in the cab.\u201d(Note to cami-sausages everywhere: You\u2019re supposed to step into the garments, not put them over your head. I don\u2019t know why this makes a difference, but it does.)Declaring that she was conforming to gender norms for his benefit, she nevertheless wanted him to know the \u201ccontraptions\u201d under her dress were \u201calmost medical.\u201dSara Blakely, the billionaire founder and owner of Spanx, is fond of saying that your clothes are the art and Spanx is the canvas, and if you don\u2019t have the right canvas, it can affect the painting.Fair enough. But no matter how much shapewear improves the lines of the clothes, they will never be mistaken for corsets or knickers or other thrilling Victoriana.\u201cThere is simply no sexy way to remove them,\u201d said Margaret Kranyak, a San Francisco native. And when you are looking to get lucky at a party, this is a genuine consideration.Ellen Stimson, a writer in Vermont, said: \u201cThe sexy promise of the dress is ruined when you take it off and look like an ad for an orthopedic catalog. Better to jiggle now ... and later.\u201dThe men who weighed in on this subject seemed to agree; the phrase \u201cI don\u2019t want to be thinking of my grandmother\u201d was used more than once. \u201cThe body is fine the way it is,\u201d said Cary Raditz, an institutional investor strategist in Maryland.\u201cWhat are we trying to hide?\u201d he asked. \u201cAre we embarrassed not to conform to some very screwy fashion ideals? I prefer au naturel over artificial.\u201dIf there\u2019s one woman who really reaps the benefit of women\u2019s desire to look good for one another in public, comfort be damned, it\u2019s Ms. Blakely, of course.\u201cI get flashed everywhere I go,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t go to a holiday party where people don\u2019t lift up their dress or show me their butt and tell me, \u2018Hey, I bought this expensive dress and I didn\u2019t think I could fit into it, but now I can.\u2019\u201dOne final word here to every man thinking that since women love shapewear so much, it would be a great gift to support our New Year\u2019s resolutions.That word is: No. Shapewear is something we buy for ourselves. Do you think you\u2019d be praised for giving her a scale?So back away from the Spanx catalog, and pick up something from La Perla.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Get Paid to Organize Your Children\u2019s Closets (and Yours)", "Date": "2016-01-12", "News": "Anyone can clean out a closet. We pull out all the clothes and apply some standard (for children, that\u2019s little more than \u201cdoes it fit?\u201d; for adults, it ranges from \u201chave I worn it recently?\u201d to the organizational guru Marie Kondo\u2019s now-famous question, \u201cDoes it bring joy?\u201d) If an item passes, back it goes, while failures are headed for donation boxes. Typically, especially for ourselves, we hang too many things back up. When clothes are \u201cas good as new,\u201d or were expensive, sometimes it\u2019s hard to persuade ourselves to give them away, even if on some level we know we don\u2019t really want them any more.Last fall, I tried adding another question to the mix: Can I get cash for this? Online consignment stores and what essentially amount to used clothing buyers, particularly for designer goods, began popping up in my Facebook feed, promising to help me \u201creclaim the value\u201d in my closet \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and, I soon discovered, my children\u2019s closets as well.Real world consignment shops are intimidating. It\u2019s just too daunting a task; another errand for the list. Clothing resale sites promise to make the whole thing as easy as returning shoes to Zappos. Maybe, if I could negate the guilt of the \u201cperfectly good\u201d clothes by getting back even a little of the money I had spent on them, I would find it easier to let them go. After some exploring (try searching \u201conline clothing consignment\u201d or \u201conline children\u2019s clothing consignment\u201d) I narrowed my choices. I would use a service only if it would send me a bag and a prepaid label. It had to take a wide variety of clothing brands, promise to donate to charity any clothing that didn\u2019t meet its standards and, most important, pay me immediately and in cash or a cash equivalent. I didn\u2019t want to wait until my clothing sold, or get stuck with a site credit I would never use.I culled the children\u2019s closets, pulling most from my younger children\u2019s (the older children\u2019s clothing tends to become hand-me-downs for younger siblings). I had stacks of pants, a few jackets, a number of collared button-down shirts (which my children only wore under duress.) To see how baby clothes fared in the online consignment world, I asked a friend for a few cast-offs, and she obliged with several sweaters and a pair of teeny overalls. In spite of warnings about backlog, all three sites responded within four weeks to my bags. Dessie Kids was the fastest, getting back to me within two weeks with a friendly email explaining what they did and didn\u2019t want and making a single offer for the whole lot. MaterialWrld and ThredUP made individual offers on each item. (MaterialWrld explained why certain items hadn\u2019t been accepted; ThredUP did not). None of the offers were high; my designer goods netted me just $175 (in the form of a gift card good at major retailers including Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom and Barneys), while Dessie Kids paid $25 for a bag, which included mostly baby clothes and the total from ThredUP for both my clothing and the children\u2019s clothing was just $61.09 (Dessie Kids offered payment through PayPal or a mailed check; ThredUP offers PayPal, a site credit or a donation to one of its selected charities). Still that\u2019s $269.09 (less a dollar or two for the PayPal payments I chose) and five much cleaner closets. I made some mistakes in packing my bags. The most glaring was sending Dessie Kids pants that were above their limit of a size 8 (I hadn\u2019t noticed that). I also sent two items that were apparently stained to MaterialWrld \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it might have been worthwhile, for that higher-end site, to have things professionally cleaned before sending. (I will say I didn\u2019t see the stains.) I also sent in clothing that was simply too worn. \u201cThe wash and wear thing is the thing that trips people up as much as anything,\u201d said Myra Danehy, a founder of Dessie Kids. \u201cHow much wear is too much?\u201d She suggested looking for fading, pilling or wear at the neck. If any of those things are visible, they\u2019re likely to reject the item. \u201cWe\u2019re picky,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want our customers, when they receive an item, to say, \u2018Wow. I paid so little for this and this is such a great deal.\u2019 Because of that, we go over everything with a fine-tooth comb.\u201d They\u2019re always happy to respond to a customer\u2019s questions about what to send, she said, or even about individual items.The best things to sell to online consignment-style stores are exactly the things that are the hardest to take out of the closet without a push \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the things that make you say, \u201cbut this is as good as new.\u201d They\u2019re the things you thought your child would love or the formal clothes worn only a few times, or, for adults, the purchases that just didn\u2019t work out, bought for someone you turned out not to be. The possibility of getting even a little money out of those items makes for an added incentive to let them go \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even if, once it\u2019s out of the closet, you realize something won\u2019t meet resale standards. Now it\u2019s out. Once you\u2019ve recognized you\u2019d be willing to part with something, it\u2019s easier not to hang it back up.Instead, help children navigate the process, Ms. Palau advised. Tell them to take one drawer, or the closet, and make three piles: keep, sell, donate. A fan of ThredUp (she has an unpaid partnership with the service and recommends it to her clients), she allows her two teenage daughters to use any money made from the sale of their clothing toward the purchase of new clothes, often on the site, where their dollars go further. \u201cIt\u2019s an incentive to be mindful and say, \u2018you know what, I don\u2019t wear this, I\u2019m not going to hang on to it just because,'\u201d she said.Online consignment is unlikely to fund an entire fresh wardrobe. But it will help you to make the decision to give up things of your own that you\u2019ve been hanging on to for the wrong reasons (especially if that reason is the all-too-common \u201cbut I spent too much on this\u201d), and move along outgrown children\u2019s clothes with less regret.It\u2019s been a few months since my first foray into selling our clothes online. The seasons have changed; everyone has grown a little, school clothes and holiday clothes have refilled the closets. I think it\u2019s time to send for another resale bag.Advertisement"}

One of his earliest series featured apparition-like shadows on Michigan Avenue in Chicago. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI photographed the people coming at me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said of the willowy silhouettes of nuns and children, which he turned upside down for an ethereal effect. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe sidewalk lines give a very good feeling of composition; it takes it a little bit beyond just a simple shadow on a white surface.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cSequentially Sought,\u00e2\u0080\u009d an exhibition now at the Howard Greenberg Gallery in Manhattan, showcases his tender and sometimes tongue-in-cheek take on 1950s New York and Chicago. The images range from his black-and-white photos of mannequins to color photos of the Coney Island boardwalk in the winter (which fueled his breakout as a color photographer). Mr. Newman was born in 1927 and raised in the Bronx, where his family ran a bakery. He attended Brooklyn College and, in order to study sculpture, had prerequisite classes in photography that placed him under the tutelage of Berenice Abbott and Walter Rosenblum, who encouraged him to take classes at the Photo League in 1948. Mr. Newman credits his visual sensitivity to the post-Mondrian painter Burgoyne Diller, who also taught at Brooklyn College and was his earliest artistic influence. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe had very serious ways of composing a rectangular image,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand it stayed with me throughout all my work.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe moved to Chicago to study at the Institute of Design \u00e2\u0080\u0094 initially intending to be a product designer, as a pragmatic offshoot of sculpture \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but switched to photography.  After obtaining his master\u2019s degree in 1952, he worked at a factory that made wall shelves before moving back to New York. He focused on Wall Street, doing a mix of commissioned work for Esquire as well as personal work flecked with sun filtering through the \u00e2\u0080\u009ccanyons\u00e2\u0080\u009d between towering buildings. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI tried very much to put together this kind of light in a set of photographs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Newman said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like stage lighting, but it\u2019s real!\u00e2\u0080\u009d The aestheticized effect belies what \u00e2\u0080\u009cis actually documentary photography,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat simple sun coming through \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it just captures everything \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 you can see the filigree of the downtown area.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHis vivid images of Coney Island in winter \u00e2\u0080\u0094 featuring groups of bundled women under signs for knishes and the Brighton Bowl \u00e2\u0080\u0094 reflect his embrace of color from the beginning. It was a time when magazines inundated the public with color images, even if the film\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slow speed during the 1950s was a slight impediment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou couldn\u2019t just walk along like Garry Winogrand with his wide-angle camera and Tri-X film,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe could catch moments in black-and-white. You couldn\u2019t get that in color. But you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d get something else: You\u00e2\u0080\u0099d get reality. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099d get the feeling of what you saw \u00e2\u0080\u0094 exactly what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to get when you make a print.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Newman said he had never felt precious or nostalgic about past practices and had been quick to evolve with the medium into digital. In fact, with digital, he is delighted that he can revive the original palette he captured decades ago.\u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople want vintage stuff that went through chemicals,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he noted of today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tastes. But, with digital, he said appreciatively, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can make a print based on what I have seen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The current exhibition showcases just a sample from more than a half-century of work. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt makes the point of who I am \u00e2\u0080\u0094 at the beginning,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said of the 1950s-era focus. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn\u2019t die in the 60s; I was working very hard, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still working.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Himself an athlete in his younger days, Mr. Newman worked for Sports Illustrated after it started up in 1954, photographing football and baseball. More recently, his sports photography has been distinguished by shooting golf courses aerially, flying low in a helicopter with a wide-angle lens, work for which he won a Lucie Award in 2009.He went to Europe and the Middle East in the \u00e2\u0080\u009960s and \u00e2\u0080\u009970s: snapping women on the Riviera for Playboy, the Rome Olympics for Sports Illustrated, the Yom Kippur War for Newsweek, series about the Ozarks and Scandinavian culture for Time/Life Books. In the \u00e2\u0080\u009980s he worked in advertising, before being \u00e2\u0080\u009crediscovered by galleries\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the \u00e2\u0080\u009990s. Today he is shooting and printing digitally, with a new series on birds in flight in Florida. A book surveying his color photography will be published by Taschen in the fall.Authenticity is what ties it all together. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile I was doing all that work, I continued my own thinking and making things,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Newman said of his career. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I saw something that I thought was photographically valuable, I would go and do it, whether it could sell or not sell.

{"Headline": "Denmark\u2019s New Front in Debate Over Immigrants: Children\u2019s Lunches", "Date": "2016-01-20", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 It is being called the \u201cmeatball war.\u201dTo be precise, pork meatballs and other pork dishes such as roasts have become the latest weapons in the culture wars playing out in Europe over immigration after a Danish town voted this week to require public day care centers and kindergartens to include the meat on their lunch menus.Supporters of the proposal, which was passed late Monday by the council of Randers, a former industrial town of about 60,000 in central Denmark, said that serving traditional Danish food such as pork was essential to help preserve national identity.Critics of the requirement, including members of the Muslim population and migration advocates, said it effectively created a problem that did not exist for the purpose of stigmatizing Muslims. There has never been an attempt to ban pork from any public lunch menu in Randers, they said, describing the latest initiative as a polarizing and barely veiled attempt to target Muslims.\u201cDanish food culture\u201d must be a \u201ccentral part of the offering \u2014 including serving pork on an equal footing with other foods,\u201d the proposal says, adding that its intention was not to force anyone to eat something that \u201cgoes against one\u2019s belief or religion.\u201d Pork is forbidden under religious dietary laws for both Muslims and Jews.\u201cIt is unacceptable to ban Danish food culture, including dishes with pork, in Danish child care institutions. What will be next?!\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe Danish People\u2019s Party is working nationally and locally for Danish culture, including Danish food culture, and that means we are also fighting against Islamic rules and misguided considerations dictating what Danish children should eat.\u201dAyse Dudu Tepe, an archaeologist and radio host who was born in Denmark to Turkish parents, noted, with more than a hint of wryness, that she could understand those agitating on behalf of pigs.Charlotte Molbaek, a member of the Socialist People\u2019s Party on the Randers Town Council, said the proposal was politically motivated. The Danish People\u2019s Party has become a potent political force, in part by railing against immigration and fashioning itself as the protector of traditional Danish values.\u201cWhat do children need? Do they need pork? Actually not. But the Danish People\u2019s Party does,\u201d she was quoted as saying by Politiken, a daily newspaper, during a debate on the measure. \u201cChildren need grown-ups.\u201dDenmark is not alone in viewing culture, including food, as a bulwark to protect national identity. In food-obsessed France, where calls to uphold the country\u2019s vaunted secular liberal values have become all the more urgent after two separate terrorist attacks by Islamic extremists, pork has become a sometimes emotive issue in debates over integration.Several towns run by rightist mayors have tried to remove nonpork options from school cafeterias in a professed effort to preserve French identity, even as members of the Muslim and Jewish populations have protested that such policies risk alienating minorities. In Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne, in the French region of Burgundy, elementary school students who do not eat pork have to content themselves with vegetables after the City Council voted in September to stop offering substitutions like fish on their menus on days when pork is served.The boy, from Lancashire, in northwest England, had meant to write \u201cterraced house,\u201d the BBC reported.But in Denmark, it is food at schools that has spurred the latest debate. Fatma Cetinkaya, a member of the Social Democrats on the Randers Town Council, called the new measure \u201cincomprehensible.\u201d\u201cRanders has always been at the forefront when it comes to integration,\u201d she was quoted as saying by Politiken. \u201cWe don\u2019t have problems with crime and a lot of other things, so it\u2019s incomprehensible that pork has been made into a problem. It\u2019s such a shame.\u201dBut she was philosophical. \u201cAs a Muslim, you get thick-skinned,\u201d she said.Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting from Paris.videoAdvertisement"}

Or it could be some dude at a Starbucks texting victims on his cellphone, or a pajama-clad woman in her apartment sending bogus love bombs from her laptop. They may assume the identity of actual soldiers deployed overseas or pretend to be engineers working on projects in far-flung locales. Scammers have also been known to pose as university professors, clergy members, doctors, chefs, swimsuit models, waitresses, nurses and librarians.Maybe the soldier needs a new cellphone so the lovers can better communicate or needs cash to get the necessary papers to go on leave so they can finally meet. The offshore engineer says his child is in the hospital and he\u2019s having trouble wiring money to cover medical expenses. The model or nurse may need money to pay lawyers\u2019 fees to get a restraining order against an abusive ex. Or maybe the scammer doesn\u2019t ask for money at all but requests that the victim receive money and then transfer it to another account, giving marginally plausible reasons.In the latest twist, scammers coax victims into taking explicit photos and videos of themselves and then threaten to distribute them to their Facebook or Skype contacts if they don\u2019t pay them money or help them launder money.\u201cI more often hear from people who call on behalf of a relative or friend who is getting scammed,\u201d said Chris Grey, director of public affairs for the Army\u2019s Criminal Investigation Command who learned quickly not to contact the victim in these cases. \u201cI\u2019ve been cussed out that I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about because they are so infatuated with this person they\u2019ve never even met.\u201dThat puts law enforcement officials in a bind when lovestruck victims so willingly and willfully participate in ruses. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to know what\u2019s behind the curtain,\u201d said Mr. Grey. \u201cThey really don\u2019t.\u201dKate Murphy is a journalist in Houston who writes frequently for The New York Times.Advertisement"}

Jimbo and the others were brought in as cubs suffering from injuries that rendered them unable to survive in the wild, Kerry Clair, a director for Orphaned Wildlife, said in an interview on Tuesday. Along with bears, the group rehabilitates horses, deer and squirrels. But this is not a zoo: Since the main goal is to rehabilitate the animals, the public can\u2019t visit, Ms. Clair said.\u201cOur primary purpose is to release these animals into the wild,\u201d Ms. Clair said. \u201cWe only keep them if there\u2019s some problem.\u201dThe bears that remain on the grounds are as friendly as Jimbo, she said, because they were raised by humans from an early age. The downside is that once they become close to humans, they cannot return to the wild.At this facility, the bears do not need to do any hunting. During their most active months, they can eat 25 to 30 pounds of food in a day. Getting to know a bear means getting to know its dietary preferences and dining behaviors, Mr. Kowalczik said. Some prefer vegetarian meals, while others like meat. Some of the more careful eaters will balance an apple on one paw so the fruit does not roll in the dirt. They all enjoy peanuts (they prefer unsalted varieties), and spit out the husk afterward.And perhaps the most jarring difference is simply observing how close the bears get to humans, and how playful the animals are.As far as personalities go, some bears are brighter than others, he said \u2014 \u201cjust like people.\u201d\u201cWe have a relationship with the bears,\u201d Ms. Clair said, adding of Mr. Treadwell, \u201che was essentially trying to forge a relationship with a pack of wolves.\u201dMr. Kowalczik said that the bears were like \u201cchildren\u201d to him, and he likened the risk to crossing the road and getting hit by a car.\u201cBut I don\u2019t think crossing a street gives back as much as the love you get from these animals,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

There he attracted many thousands of additional followers from all over the world.If Santa Claus and John Maynard Keynes could combine as one, he might well be Edward Hugh. He was roly-poly and merry, and he always had a twinkle in his eye, not least when he came across a data point or the hint of an economic or social trend that would support one of his many theories.His intellect was too restless to be pigeonholed, but when pressed he would say that he saw himself as a Keynesian in spirit, but not letter. And in tune with his view that economists in general had become too wedded to static economic models and failed their obligation to predict and explain, he frequently cited this quotation from Keynes:\u201cEconomists set themselves too easy, too useless a task if in tempestuous seasons they can only tell us that when the storm is long past, the ocean is flat again.\u201dEdward Hugh Bengree-Jones was born in Liverpool, England, on Dec. 29, 1948. He moved to London and received an undergraduate degree from the London School of Economics. He pursued his doctoral studies at Victoria University in Manchester, although he never completed them.Throughout the 1970s and 1980s he bounced from job to job, mostly in education, taking on projects such as teaching English to Chilean refugees.In 1990 he moved to Barcelona, having fallen in love with the city\u2019s multicultural flair during a holiday visit. He quickly became fluent in both Spanish and Catalan and decided that Barcelona would become his home.He would became a champion of Catalonia\u2019s push for independence and was an informal adviser to senior Catalan politicians, including Artur Mas, the leader of the movement\u2019s main party.While Mr. Hugh\u2019s pointed pen often ruffled feathers, especially in Spain, he did become a local celebrity of sorts. He was a regular presence in the papers and appeared frequently on television, where he would expound for hours in Spanish and Catalan.On occasion his prognostications were overly pessimistic, and Spain\u2019s surprisingly quick economic recovery was an event that he, along with many others, did not foresee.Until this summer, when his cancer worsened, he spent his days posting daily economic snippets on Facebook, digging deep into independent films from around the world, and having long, lazy lunches with local notables and friends.That he never finished his doctorate or wrote his great work never truly bothered him, he said in his interview with The Times.\u201cThe last time I was asked what it was I \u2018did,\u2019 I replied rather cantankerously, that I don\u2019t do, I think,\u201d he recalled.Besides his son, Morgan, his survivors include his wife, Barbara; a brother, David, and a half sister, Anne.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech\u2019s \u2018Frightful 5\u2019 Will Dominate Digital Life for Foreseeable Future", "Date": "2016-01-20", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtThere\u2019s a little parlor game that people in Silicon Valley like to play. Let\u2019s call it, Who\u2019s Losing?But don\u2019t expect it to shift much. Asking \u201cwho\u2019s losing?\u201d misses a larger truth about how thoroughly Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft now lord over all that happens in tech.Who\u2019s really losing? In the larger picture, none of them \u2014 not in comparison with the rest of the tech industry, the rest of the economy and certainly not in the influence each of them holds over our lives.But for much of the last half-decade, most of these five giants have enjoyed a remarkable reprieve from the bogeymen in the garage. And you can bet on them continuing to win. So I\u2019m coining the name the Frightful Five.Though competition between the five remains fierce \u2014 and each year, a few of them seem up and a few down \u2014 it\u2019s becoming harder to picture how any one of them, let alone two or three, may cede their growing clout in every aspect of American business and society.Indeed, the Frightful Five are so well protected against start-ups that in most situations, the rise of new companies only solidifies their lead.This gets to the core of the Frightful Five\u2019s indomitability. They have each built several enormous technologies that are central to just about everything we do with computers. In tech jargon, they own many of the world\u2019s most valuable \u201cplatforms\u201d \u2014 the basic building blocks on which every other business, even would-be competitors, depend.These platforms are inescapable; you may opt out of one or two of them, but together, they form a gilded mesh blanketing the entire economy.The Big Five\u2019s platforms span so-called old tech \u2014 Windows is still the king of desktops, Google rules web search \u2014 and new tech, with Google and Apple controlling mobile phone operating systems and the apps that run on them; Facebook and Google controlling the Internet advertising business; and Amazon, Microsoft and Google controlling the cloud infrastructure on which many start-ups run.Many of these platforms generate what economists call \u201cnetwork effects\u201d \u2014 as more people use them, they keep getting more indispensable. Why do you chat using Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp, also owned by Facebook? Because that\u2019s where everyone else is.Then there\u2019s the data buried in the platforms, also a rich source for new business. This can happen directly \u2014 for instance, Google can tap everything it learns about how we use our phones to create an artificial intelligence engine that improves our phones \u2014 and in more circuitous ways. By watching what\u2019s popular in its app store, Apple can get insight into what features to add to the iPhone.\u201cIn a way, a lot of the research and development costs are being borne by companies out of their four walls, which allows them to do better product development,\u201d Mr. Parker said.This explains why these companies\u2019 visions are so expansive. In various small and large ways, the Frightful Five are pushing into the news and entertainment industries; they\u2019re making waves in health care and finance; they\u2019re building cars, drones, robots and immersive virtual-reality worlds. Why do all this? Because their platforms \u2014 the users, the data and all the money they generate \u2014 make these far-flung realms seem within their grasp.Which isn\u2019t to say these companies can\u2019t die. Not long ago people thought IBM, Cisco Systems, Intel and Oracle were unbeatable in tech; they\u2019re all still large companies, but they\u2019re far less influential than they once were.Even with these difficulties, it\u2019s unclear if the larger dynamic may change much. Let\u2019s say that Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce company, eclipses Amazon\u2019s retail business in India \u2014 well, O.K., so then it satisfies itself with the rest of the world.So get used to these five. Based on their stock prices this month, the giants are among the top 10 most valuable American companies of any kind. Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft are the top three; Facebook is No. 7, and Amazon is No. 9. Wall Street gives each high marks for management; and three of them \u2014 Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook \u2014 are controlled by founders who don\u2019t have to bow to the whims of potential activist investors.So who\u2019s losing? Not one of them, not anytime soon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "More Context Needed in Article on Haifa Culture", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a look at how people live in a cosmopolitan city that seems to defy the usual perception \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the focus on the conflict narrative,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the international managing editor, Michael Slackman, told me.A social media storm followed, and that, in turn was followed by commentary from all sides.Of course, this kind of response is not unusual. As Mr. Slackman put it: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe blowback shows that there is a small but relentless group of critics\u00e2\u0080\u009d who want their point of view reflected in the framing of every piece on the Mideast.Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what a few readers had to say about it.Gary D. Friedman of Scarsdale, N.Y., found the article, by Diaa Hadid, inappropriately timed, among other flaws. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the midst of violence against Israelis, Ms. Hadid finds it timely to report on how wonderfully liberal the Palestinians in Haifa are for promoting gay rights.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAnd Joseph Grinblat, a former United Nations staff member, objected to the characterization of those interviewed as Palestinians; they should have been called Arab Israelis, he said. (\u00e2\u0080\u009cPalestinian citizens of Israel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d although a clunky phrase, is for many a more acceptable alternative.) This is a fraught subject, as was reflected in a headline change for the online edition, from \u00e2\u0080\u009cA Liberal Palestinian Culture Blossoms in an Israeli City\u00e2\u0080\u009d to \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn Israeli City of Haifa, A Liberal Arab Culture Blossoms.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAnother reader, Patrick Connors of New York City, objected to the headline change: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI see this as yet another example of biased reporting, with The New York Times choosing to adopt the label for a people that is preferred by Israeli government and Israeli Jews, as opposed to the label preferred by the people themselves, and, through the headline change, doing so in a nontransparent manner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Although headlines often change (and, in my view, such changes do not normally require an editors\u2019 note or other explanation), Mr. Connors is probably right that this one involved something other\u00c2\u00a0than simple word count or search optimization. (I asked Mr. Slackman about the change; he said he was unaware of it but would look into why it was made.)Gabi Kirk of Oakland, Calif., who said she had traveled to the region and had met Mr. Fadel and others in the community described in the article, complained in an email to my office: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis article was orientalist \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it made it seem like Israel is the one who \u00e2\u0080\u0098allows\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Palestinian culture and resilience to thrive, and Palestinians would otherwise be repressive and drab. To the contrary, Palestinian musicians, artists and queer activists in Haifa (and Jaffa, Jerusalem, Ramallah, and in refugee camps around the region) struggle despite apartheid and occupancy.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my take: It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tempting but too easy to simply shrug and say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, you see, this just proves once again that there can be no agreement on any aspect of this situation, no matter how small.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAnd the article was certainly a window into a culture and a scene that many readers may be unaware of. It was written vividly and\u00c2\u00a0was a subject worth exploring.What was largely missing, however, was something else I recommended in my Mideast\u00c2\u00a0column: plenty of context. While it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impossible (and a bad idea) to summarize the history of Israel and Palestine in every piece of news coverage or every feature article, this article needed more political and historical information to put it in perspective.Mr. Fadel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complaint that his interview was much more extensive than what was quoted will be a familiar one to anyone who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ever been quoted in a newspaper article. Only a tiny percentage of any interview will make it into the story, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s frustrating. But the writer can try to make sure that the main points \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the overall thrust of the conversation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is represented. Based on his complaints and those of others interviewed, that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to happen here.And placing the article within geopolitical context would have helped, too. That might have been done, to a limited degree, even in a few paragraphs of background.No framing of an article like this will satisfy everyone. But The Times can do better with providing more context and information, even in a feature story. On balance, I found the article worthwhile as a cultural snapshot, if lacking in some\u00c2\u00a0regards.A second postscript: After this post was written and edited, I heard from Ms. Hadid by email. (She had been traveling and was unavailable earlier.) Because her response is lengthy, I will summarize and quote from it in a separate post, to come\u00c2\u00a0soon.The Times is one of the first major news organizations to take a firm stand against a growing and disliked practice.  \nThe Times has dismantled its environmental pod and discontinued the Green blog.\nThe public editor looks into a test drive of an electric car that caused a storm. The statistical wizard's offer to wager on the outcome of the presidential race is a bad choice. How does The Times decide which comments to post on NYTimes.com? The public editor gets answers from The Times's online commenting managers. \nReaders complained to the public editor over The Times's decision to display a photograph of the unconscious ambassador in Libya.  \nThose who reveal classified material are being punished like never before.When the government asks newspapers to keep quiet, the bar should be very high for saying yes. Editors were asked by the C.I.A. to withhold information and did so for months before publishing it online Tuesday night. Scott Shane, a Times national security reporter, was referred to in the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prosecution of a former C.I.A. official.Bradley Manning and WikiLeaks are a major story for The Times, so why was the paper so late to cover the soldier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretrial hearing? Just who is it that the United States is killing with strikes by unmanned aircraft in Yemen and Pakistan? The First Amendment matters for many reasons, some of them not on the world stage. The public editor travels to Harvard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Shorenstein Center. With audio.Is the concept outdated or even more important in the new media era?The journalistic ideal of impartiality is coming under attack. My column for this week.The public editor speaks with Times editors about how they plan to fact-check the first presidential debate. When opinion appears in news pages, it needs to be labeled and displayed as just that. Whatever the conclusions, whatever the effectiveness, of challenging facts, the idea that we have to debate the necessity of the media doing so strikes me as absurd.The Times is reconsidering the use of the term \"illegal immigrant.\"An article coyly wrote around a business name that used an unprintable word according to The Times's standards.A crisis in North Africa and a reader\u00e2\u0080\u0099s query bring up crucial distinctions in usage.Families are rightfully upset by some of the early reporting done on the Newtown, Conn., shootings.The research and development team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Chronicle tool may distract you while you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re waiting for the returns to come in.Unidentified sources make it difficult for readers to know what to believe regarding negotiations between the United States and Iran. The public editor's judgment is not about immigration reform; it's about clarity and accuracy.  An activist wants The Times to stop using the term \"illegal immigrant\" in its reporting.  After criticism on Twitter and elsewhere, the first sentence of an obituary for Yvonne Brill was changed.A front-page article involving the New York Police Department's internal communication could have provided greater context.A headline ignites a discussion about its \"undermining\" question. News organizations should evaluate the motivations of parents who want to take their child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story public.Parental approval and the child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own willingness should rule the day.Readers complained about the absence of people of color in T: The Times Style Magazine.The Times Magazine interviewer offended some high-profile female writers with his questions.Where, after what seemed like women's night on Tuesday at the Democratic National Convention, was the coverage of pay equity, along with gender-economic issues in general?Michael Kimmelman views architecture in terms of public policy as well as aesthetics.The criticism of a new restaurant in Times Square was delicious, even if the food was not.

{"Headline": "Jack Dorsey Juggles Twitter and Square, Both Caught in Downdraft", "Date": "2016-01-20", "News": "Supported byIt is not shaping up as a happy new year for Jack Dorsey and his two companies.Shares of Twitter hit a record low early Wednesday before going on a wild ride and rising 4.1 percent for the day. The gain did little to erase Twitter\u2019s negative trajectory, with its shares off 25 percent this year. Square, which went public last November, fell below its initial public offering price of $9 for the first time on Wednesday before recovering. In total, the stock is down 28 percent this year.The travails underscore how the stock market\u2019s up and downs are especially hitting companies that have question marks hanging over their heads. While a rising market lifts all boats, doubters tend to flee riskier stocks in a tumultuous market. And plenty of questions \u2014 mostly around growth \u2014 surround Twitter and Square, with scrutiny set to intensify in the next few weeks as Twitter is scheduled to report earnings on Feb. 10 and Square to issue its first earnings as a public company on March 9.\u201cThe market has suddenly found volatility\u201d and that has made Square \u201ca magnet of pessimism\u201d and with Twitter, \u201cpeople are piling onto it because it\u2019s a disliked name that\u2019s poorly understood,\u201d said Max Wolff, the chief economist at Manhattan Venture Partners.As traders seek to protect their portfolios in the rough market, Jason Kupferberg, a senior equity research analyst at Jefferies & Company, said some selling of riskier stocks was to be expected \u2014 including those of Twitter and Square.For Mr. Dorsey, 39, the stock tumult complicates an already complex set of challenges. Twitter, for example, is dealing with questions about whether it can rev up its service\u2019s user growth, while Square needs to graduate from a newly public company to a more mature one. The share declines suggest shareholders are impatient and may potentially shorten the leash they give Mr. Dorsey in achieving his goals at both businesses. Spokesmen from the companies declined to comment.\u201cThere was too much hype and too much hope that once Jack was hired, he would suddenly wave the magic wand and user numbers would somehow go up right away,\u201d said Eric Jackson, managing director of SpringOwl Asset Management, a financial firm based in New York.In an earnings call last October, Mr. Dorsey said Twitter had lots of work to do to make the service easier for regular people to use. Those changes, he said at the time, would not come overnight.Yet Wall Street is now realizing that it will take time for the changes to pay off, Mr. Jackson said. That has led to questions about whether Twitter might become a takeover target. On Wednesday, the market pushed up Twitter\u2019s share price on talk that News Corporation was potentially building a stake in the company, which a News Corporation spokesman denied. \u201cIt\u2019s been Wall Street\u2019s gradual reconsideration of the assumption there would be some immediate effect on user growth,\u201d Mr. Jackson said of Twitter\u2019s stock performance this year. \u201cNow people are saying, \u2018Hey let me out of this thing.\u2019\u00a0\u201dSquare faces its own set of difficulties. Naysayers have long questioned the profit margins on the company\u2019s payments processing business. Square takes a small cut of every credit card payment it processes, a cut that is split with banks and other financial intermediaries. The company has expanded into other areas in recent years, such as food delivery and capital extensions to small businesses.Some analysts said the gyrations in Square\u2019s share price are not all the company\u2019s fault. \u201cSome of it could be out of sympathy with the weakness we\u2019re seeing with Twitter right now, due to the link with Dorsey,\u201d Mr. Kupferberg of Jefferies & Company said. Square also is dealing with a relatively small proportion of shares available for trading, since the company sold less than 10 percent of itself in its public offering, in what is known as a \u201csmall float\u201d offering. Also, many of Square\u2019s executives and major shareholders are still held by the so-called lockup period after the offering, which prohibits them from selling their shares. Companies with relatively few shares outstanding tend to get whipsawed during volatile market periods because it becomes harder to adequately match the small amount of supply for the stock with the demand, or lack thereof.\u201cThose tiny-float I.P.O.s come back to haunt you,\u201d Mr. Wolff of Manhattan Venture Partners said.Leslie Picker and Ravi Somaiya contributed reportingAdvertisement"}

Officer Cottrell was found dead late Sunday, about 20 minutes after a woman told a police dispatcher that her ex-boyfriend was armed and looking to kill a police officer, the authorities said. When Officer Cottrell\u2019s body was found, both his service weapon and police car were missing, officials said. According to Knox County court records, Mr. Jones has a criminal history that dates back to 2001 and includes charges of burglary, breaking and entering and carrying a concealed weapon. In 2011, he pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity on a burglary charge before later entering a guilty plea.Both Officer Cottrell and Mr. Jones were well known in Danville, a community of about 1,000 people, where Danville High School football games are a major social activity. Desirae Eckert, who lives in neighboring Fredericktown, said in an interview over Facebook that Officer Cottrell attended most home games and would talk with fans.\u201cThe kids loved him because he always played football with the kids at the games,\u201d Ms. Eckert, 24, said.She said she would sometimes see Mr. Jones at the football games, too, though his was an unsettling presence. He would sometimes focus his attention on the officers patrolling the game, she said, adding, \u201cHe would just walk by and just glare and then smile.\u201dThe suspect, Cory Lee Henderson, 31, was shot and killed as he exchanged gunfire with the officers, the police said. On Monday, the police were still searching for a woman believed to have been involved in the traffic accident.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders a Target of Ads by Republican Donor", "Date": "2016-01-26", "News": "The spot, being aired by the ESA Fund, describes Mr. Sanders\u2019s policy positions on a range of issues, such as tuition-free college and single-payer health care, saying that it amounts to a flood of new government spending. There will be tax increases on Wall Street, big businesses and the \u201csuper-rich,\u201d the ad goes on to say. The spot is expected to be backed by $600,000 in spending on television ads, and there will be additional expenditures on radio and digital advertising. Mr. Ricketts has been a major Republican donor this cycle in the presidential race, but with the ad, his group is injecting itself into the Democratic nominating contest.\u201cWhen it comes to federal spending and piling on our massive debt, Secretary Clinton is a five-car pile-up, but Senator Sanders is a trainwreck,\u201d said Brian Baker, the president of the ESA Fund. \u201cGiven that Senator Sanders is the leading candidate in Iowa and New Hampshire and way ahead in the general election polls, ESAFund will work hard to inform voters about his record and future plans.\u201d Mr. Sanders leads in many head- many national polls.ESA Fund is the affiliated super PAC of Ending Spending, which was founded by Mr. Ricketts and is operated by his son, Todd Ricketts, who is on the board of the Chicago Cubs. It is laser-trained on fighting what it considers excess spending by the government. The elder Mr. Ricketts gave $5 million to the super PAC that backed Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, a Republican presidential candidate who dropped out of the race last fall. And Todd Ricketts helped run Mr. Walker\u2019s national fundraising efforts for his campaign. Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders, said he had not seen the ad but added, \u201cAre they against strengthening Social Security? Raising the minimum wage? Don\u2019t they want to make college affordable? Do they like Wall Street and big banks? Do they want to keep tax loopholes that let profitable corporations evade taxes?\u201dDespite the current general election match-ups in public polling, Mr. Sanders is far less known nationally than Hillary Clinton, meaning his negative ratings are lower. The strategy of attacking Mr. Sanders seems reminiscent of how Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, a Democrat, ran ads in her 2012 re-election bid targeting Todd Akin, a conservative and the opponent she most wanted to face because he seemed less electable in a general election. That is also the bar that Mr. Sanders has been fighting to clear. The Clinton campaign, mindful of moving fast in the final days of the caucuses, quickly seized on news of the Ricketts ad to point out the similarities to the strategy deployed by Ms. McCaskill. In that race, Mr. Akin was used by Democrats as a poster boy for extreme views. Ms. McCaskill, who endorsed Barack Obama in his 2008 presidential primary fight with Mrs. Clinton but who has since become an ardent Clinton supporter, took to Twitter to highlight that point. \u201cI see you Joe Ricketts. And I know exactly what you\u2019re up to. #ToddAkin Don\u2019t fall for it Iowa Dems,\u201d she wrote. Outside groups receive less bang for the buck on television ad buys, since they pay much higher rates than campaigns do. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how many times Iowans will see the spots during a cluttered final week of ads. \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "The Limits of American Realism", "Date": "2016-01-11", "News": "Supported byIs realism really, really what America wants as the cornerstone of its foreign policy?Stephen M. Walt, a professor of international affairs at Harvard University, has an eloquent ode to realism in Foreign Policy magazine. He argues that, with realism as the bedrock of its approach to the world over the past quarter century, the United States would have fared far better. Realists, he reminds us, \u201chave a generally pessimistic view of international affairs and are wary of efforts to remake the world according to some ideological blueprint.\u201dRealists had a field day with that carnage, beginning with former Secretary of State James Baker\u2019s early assessment that, \u201cWe don\u2019t have a dog in that fight.\u201d This view was echoed by various self-serving assessments from the Clinton White House that justified inaction through the portrayal of the Balkans as the locus of millennial feuds neither comprehensible nor resolvable.True, discerning a vital American national interest in places with names like Omarska was not obvious, even if the wars upset the European peace America had committed to maintaining since 1945. The realpolitik case for intervention was flimsy. Sarajevo was not going to break America, less even than Raqqa today.The moral case was, however, overwhelming, beginning with the Serbian use in 1992 of concentration camps to kill Bosnian Muslim men deemed threatening, and expel Muslim women and children. These methods culminated at Srebrenica in 1995 with the Serbian slaughter of about 8,000 male inhabitants. In the three-year interim, while realists rationalized restraint, Serbian shelling of Sarajevo blew up European women and children on a whim. Only when President Clinton changed his mind and NATO began concerted bombing was a path opened to ending the war.I covered that conflict and its resolution. For my baby-boomer generation, spared Europe\u2019s repetitive bloodshed by American military and strategic resolve, it was a pivotal experience. After that, no hymn to realism pure and simple could ever be persuasive. Walt calls me \u201ca liberal internationalist;\u201d I\u2019ll take that as an honorable badge.He describes the expansion eastward of NATO after the end of the Cold War as \u201ca textbook combination of both hubris and bad geopolitics\u201d that needlessly poisoned relations with Russia. This argument is in fact a textbook example of the cynicism and smallness inherent in realism.Guaranteeing security as the basis for a liberal order in nations from Poland to Estonia emerging from the trauma of the Soviet Imperium amounts to a major American strategic achievement. (Baker was instrumental in it, proof he was more than a Walt-school realist.) Ask any Pole, Lithuanian or Romanian if they think America erred.Realists tend to dismiss human suffering; it\u2019s just the way of the world. Hundreds of millions of people in Europe were ushered from totalitarian misery to democratic decency under the protection of the United States and its allies. A debt incurred at Yalta was repaid. European peace and security were extended, an American interest. There is little doubt that President Vladimir Putin would today have overrun at least one of the Baltic countries, absent their NATO membership.Putin has created havoc precisely in the no man\u2019s lands \u2014 Georgia and Ukraine \u2014 rather than in the NATO lands. Russia\u2019s interest, post-1990, was in the dismemberment of the European-American bond, most potently expressed in NATO. That was the real problem.The United States, almost alone among nations, is also an idea. Excise the notion of the global extension of liberty and its guarantees from American policy and something very meager remains. Putin is a fierce, opportunistic realist. But Americans \u2014 Donald Trump notwithstanding \u2014 do not want that dish on their tables.They especially do not want it after the Syrian debacle. Walt argues that realists would have dissuaded President Obama from saying President Bashar al-Assad \u201cmust go\u201d and setting a \u201cred line.\u201d But the problem was not that uttering these words was unrealistic. It was that failing to follow up on them was feckless.Syria has illustrated the limits of White House realism. Realism has dictated nonintervention as hundreds of thousands were killed, millions displaced, and Islamic State emerged. Realism has been behind acquiescence to Assad\u2019s barrel-bomb brutality. If Iraq illustrated disastrous American pursuit of an \u201cideological blueprint,\u201d Syria has demonstrated a disastrous vacuum of American ideas.Realism is an essential starting point for American foreign policy. It was absent on Iraq: The result was mayhem that, as Walt rightly says, cost America several trillion dollars. Realism brought the Iran nuclear accord, a signal achievement. More of it might help on Israel-Palestine.But this is more a time to acknowledge the limits of realism \u2014 as a means to deal with the evil of ISIS, the debacle of Syria, or the desperate European refugee crisis \u2014 than to cry out for more, or suggest that it is underrepresented in American discourse.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "My Virtual Life at Tech\u2019s Big Consumer Electronics Show", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "LAS VEGAS \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Over the last few days, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve repaired a robot, driven a Rover across Mars and zapped objects with a laser gun.  I did all of that while mostly standing around in a far less interesting place: Las Vegas, where the International CES, the giant consumer electronics trade show, was being held. To escape from the artificial reality of Sin City during the show, I spent a few days trying out different virtual-reality headgear and applications to assess whether virtual reality was a gimmick or a lasting trend.My verdict: Virtual reality is here to stay for the long term, partly because the content looks and feels great (and also because so many tech companies will not stop talking about it). Whether it ends up widely appealing to consumers depends on how the companies market the technology and whether they bring prices down for virtual reality devices. But considering the high quality of the early content and applications already made for virtual reality, and given the amount of cash that companies are investing in the medium, this is probably not a fad that will fizzle out like 3D television. Virtual reality companies said 2016 is the year that many consumers will try out virtual reality for the first time and perhaps be wowed, though it will not be the year that it reaches mass adoption in terms of sales.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI haven\u2019t had anyone yet try the Rift and take it off and say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I didn\u2019t get it, that\u2019s not incredible,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Brendan Iribe, the chief executive of Oculus, in an interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMost people\u2019s reaction is, \u00e2\u0080\u0098That\u2019s probably the best thing I\u2019ve ever seen in technology in my life.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009dDuring my virtual reality jaunts at the trade show, I strapped on the Rift headgear, which connects to a computer, and looped the two controllers around my hands to test two applications. An app called Toybox places a user in a virtual playroom surrounded by objects that you can pick up and interact with, like ping pong paddles, a laser gun, a slingshot and fireworks. Another player can join you in the session, too, to hit the ping pong ball or shoot a paintball at you with the slingshot.Fox Entertainment also demonstrated a virtual reality app it developed for Oculus to promote the movie \u201cThe Martian.\u201d The app gives you the opportunity to be Mark Watney, the astronaut left stranded on Mars, who is played by Matt Damon in the film. The experience, which lasted about 20 minutes, consisted of seven scenarios, including a sequence where you use the hand controllers to operate a crane to load solar panels onto the Mars Rover. A less enthralling scene involved sorting potatoes by throwing them into different buckets. I was lousy at tossing the potatoes into the buckets, just as I am inadequate at throwing objects in real life.The hand controllers for both Rift and Vive took some time getting used to, but it felt natural to interact with objects on both devices. I figured out how to repair the Aperture robot and operate the crane in \u201cThe Martian\u201d app without any help. Chet Faliszek, a video game writer at Valve, said the intuitiveness of virtual reality should open the medium to broad applications, not just games. \u201cThe applications and the different ways that they can be used are so diverse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.Rift and Vive had some major differences. Rift is designed for use while standing or sitting. Vive encourages you to walk around \u00e2\u0080\u0094 there is a front-facing camera on the headgear to let you peek into the real world with the press of a button, in case you want to grab a glass of water, for instance.Both devices had some flaws. Rift was difficult to wear on my face; I failed to orient the device to block out the outside world in a space under my nose (perhaps because I have a long nose) and a quick head movement made the headgear go out of focus and required a readjustment. Because Vive encourages moving around, I tripped over the cord a few times. With both devices, I felt exhausted and overstimulated after 20-minute sessions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 virtual reality feels like media designed to be consumed in small doses, not hours at a time.Oculus and Vive are initially targeting gamers with their products, and there are limits to the appeal of the systems. Consider the aesthetics of the headgear, which could be off-putting to everyday consumers. Both pieces of headgear still look freakishly sci-fi, like something out of a \u201cStar Trek\u201d episode.Jaunt, which hopes to one day to become the \u00e2\u0080\u009cNetflix of VR,\u00e2\u0080\u009d believes that, at least initially, the smartphone, not fancy headgear like Rift or Vive, will be the key to mass consumer adoption of virtual reality.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all about smartphone technology,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said David Anderman, the chief business officer of Jaunt. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEverybody who has a smartphone in their pocket \u00e2\u0080\u0094 quite soon that could be everybody \u00e2\u0080\u0094 can play VR content.\u00e2\u0080\u009dTed Schilowitz, the resident futurist at Fox who helped develop the virtual reality app for \u201cThe Martian,\u201d said the smartphone had trained consumers to embrace virtual reality. Smartphones, he said, act as robots that are our virtual assistants \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and now people should be comfortable with becoming even more intimate with virtual environments.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u2019s happened to our psychology, to our humanity, has set the stage for what\u2019s going on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u2019re ready for this now.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFollowAdvertisement"}

Stay tuned.Winter coat watch: Do we even have to say it?IN THE NEWSCOMING UP TODAYCOMMUTE AND FINALLY \u2026Hurry, or you might miss your last chance to cruise down the Nile \u2026 in a manner of speaking.The exhibition is one of the first major shows of Middle Kingdom art and culture, and displays objects from 37 lenders in North America and Europe.The show forgoes the well-known territory of Ancient Egyptian culture \u2014 mummies, Cleopatra, Nefertiti, and tomb raiding \u2014 in favor of the complex, changing ground of the Middle Kingdom.According to Mr. Cotter, the museum does a better job at illuminating Egyptian art than do most other institutions, and the Middle Kingdom exhibition is \u201ca classic Met product.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ted Cruz\u2019s Diligent Courting of Evangelicals Pays Off in Iowa", "Date": "2016-01-10", "News": "Supported byIn Washington, Iowa, Pastor Joseph Brown of Marion Avenue Baptist Church plans to continue recruiting volunteer captains supporting Mr. Cruz for each of the caucus precincts in his community.\u201cWe have a networking ability that campaigns spend years and years trying to build,\u201d said Mr. Brown, who has taken on the kind of organizing tasks that a campaign normally would.Senator Ted Cruz recently set off on a six-day, 28-town bus tour, which ends Saturday, and we sent one of our reporters, Matt Flegenheimer, along with him. Here are some interesting, selected moments from the tour.Although Mr. Brown does not plan to endorse Mr. Cruz from his pulpit, which is controversial because of the tax-exempt status of religious institutions, he broadcasts his support in other ways \u2014 from displaying a Cruz bumper sticker on his car to speaking on Mr. Cruz\u2019s behalf at meetings of the Republican committee at the county courthouse. \u201cA pastor in Iowa is out in the community,\u201d Mr. Brown said.Mr. Cruz has won over many evangelical voters in Iowa through both pluck and luck. Although he has spent a year aggressively courting them, Mr. Cruz has benefited recently from the decline of Ben Carson, who briefly led Iowa polls thanks to evangelical support, then saw those voters swing to Mr. Cruz after questions arose about Mr. Carson\u2019s grasp of foreign policy.Mr. Cruz first stirred Iowa crowds in March at a Pastors and Pews event, and later at a Christian home-schoolers convention and a Faith & Freedom forum. He seized on the issue of \u201creligious liberty\u201d \u2014 the right of business owners, for example, to refuse services for gay weddings \u2014 and drew thousands to rallies in Iowa and South Carolina.Last month, Mr. Cruz won the endorsement of the most influential leader of Iowa\u2019s politically activist evangelicals, Bob Vander Plaats.\u201cOver two years we have been praying for unity; we have been praying God would lead and he would raise up a candidate,\u201d Mr. Vander Plaats said in introducing Mr. Cruz on the first day of a bus tour of Iowa last week.Behind the scenes, Mr. Vander Plaats is \u201cactivating his personal network,\u201d said Bryan English, the Cruz campaign\u2019s Iowa director.\u201cPart of my job is to say: \u2018Hey, this guy\u2019s for real. He\u2019s one of us,\u2019 \u201d Mr. English said of Mr. Cruz. He said he had reached out to fellow social conservatives \u201cto say to them, \u2018Would you come make some phone calls or knock on doors?\u2019 \u201dThe campaign is also tapping the network of Christian home-school families, a politically active conservative group that turns out many caucusgoers.\u201cI don\u2019t know too many home-schoolers that aren\u2019t politically aware or active on some level,\u201d said Amy Deace, who was named last week as a leader of Mr. Cruz\u2019s home-school coalition. \u201cIt\u2019s a large community that tends to run in the same circles. So we see each other a lot and communicate with each other a lot.\u201dAccording to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.An effort to recruit pastors supporting Mr. Cruz in all of Iowa\u2019s 99 counties was the brainchild of Mr. Brown, who in part was persuaded to support the Texas senator after meeting Mr. Cruz\u2019s Cuba-born father. \u201cHe\u2019d get choked up speaking about America,\u201d Mr. Brown said, recalling a visit to his church by Rafael Cruz.\u201cHis father was tremendously effective in one-on-one and small groups throughout the spring and summer,\u201d said Eric Woolson, who managed the 2008 Iowa campaign of Mike Huckabee. Mr. Huckabee won the caucuses that year with evangelical support, but he trails far behind this year.One pastor supporting Mr. Cruz, Darran Whiting of Liberty Baptist Church in Marion, said he had made more than 150 phone calls to other pastors. He has made announcements about the caucuses during Sunday services since early last month, he said. \u201cFind your polling place and get there,\u201d he tells parishioners.Mr. Cruz has pursued a national strategy of uniting evangelicals and other conservatives behind him, arguing that with the backing of energized conservatives alone he can win not only the nomination, but also the general election.When he took the stage after Mr. Vander Plaats\u2019s introduction, at a theater in Winterset, he said the key to Republicans\u2019 taking the White House was simple, and would not require a compromise with moderates. \u201cWe have to awaken and energize the body of Christ,\u201d he said, referring to faith-driven voters.Rick Tyler, Mr. Cruz\u2019s national spokesman, said, \u201cCarson is our last obstacle.\u201dA supporter of Mr. Carson, Holly Beth Michaels, went to hear Mr. Cruz share the stage in Winterset with James C. Dobson, the Christian broadcaster and the founder of Focus on the Family, who endorsed Mr. Cruz in a surprise visit to Iowa. Ms. Michaels, a freelance writer, said that she had raised her children listening to Mr. Dobson and that she was now considering Mr. Cruz.Mr. Huckabee and Rick Santorum, although in low single digits in the polls, continue to travel the state, with Mr. Huckabee visiting his 99th county on Thursday.With its army of volunteers and six-day bus tour last week, the Cruz campaign has created high expectations of an Iowa victory, and a failure to do well here could damage his momentum in future states.One sign of possible insecurity is the belligerent tone of one of the campaign\u2019s chief surrogates, Steve Deace, an Iowa radio host and the husband of Amy Deace, who has called on Mr. Santorum and Mr. Huckabee to drop out to strengthen Mr. Cruz\u2019s evangelical support.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "\u00e2\u0080\u009cI could feel the momentum of how much the area was changing, even though I was new there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Wolson, a photographer whose work focuses on issues around public space and marginalized communities. To better understand the city, he started a documentary project to examine those changes.Some potential subjects avoided him, thinking he was a police officer. But Shanon Fulcher was open-minded, and he knew it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the safest position for a photographer to be in, an unfamiliar neighborhood with expensive camera equipment, approaching strangers. The possibility of robbery was real. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let that happen to him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Fulcher said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know why, I just couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThat chance encounter turned into a three-year project about one man. It started when Mr. Fulcher, 32, took Mr. Wolson around the area, and although he was a guide, Mr. Fulcher revealed much more than just buildings and blocks, like the daily struggles black men encounter.\u00e2\u0080\u009cOne of the things I learned from Shanon was that living in that area or anywhere you can exist in a little bubble,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Wolson said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can very much curate your experience to interact with who you want to interact with. When I was introduced to his community, in the same places I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d walk around, I realized I had no context for what was happening around me. Those stories and people get pushed to the periphery. I think people just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how much people are struggling, and it was stunning to see that, to see how much of a failure the city is in some ways in helping people in his position or having a safety net for people like him.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Fulcher, like Mr. Wolson, was also new to Oakland: He had relocated there seeking a fresh start after leaving behind gang life in South Central Los Angeles. Mr. Wolson, who was a regular contributor at The San Francisco Chronicle at the time, thought he could cast Mr. Fulcher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tale as one of redemption, but during the course of the next three years, the story wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as straightforward as he had imagined.Soon after Mr. Fulcher moved to Oakland, he began using cocaine and selling drugs, became addicted and lost two jobs. Mr. Wolson documented his ups and downs, including moments with his 5-year-old daughter and family, Mr. Fulcher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s struggles with homelessness and mental illness and an arrest for gun possession. For Mr. Wolson, who grew up on a flower farm in the suburbs of Detroit, the project became one of learning about Mr. Fulcher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s struggles and how to approach the project with dignity and humanity, showing everyday moments as well as the harder ones.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I started the story the first year I had a narrative that I thought I was following,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Wolson said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a big issue when you are documenting something and you come to a story with your own preconceived notions about how the world works. The more you learn, the more you understand that you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand. I started questioning my role as a storyteller. I saw him really struggling. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a straightforward narrative for a newspaper, like a redemption narrative. But that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not real life for most people. As that dissipated, I was forced to see life in his shoes, and I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put his life in a neat little box.\u00e2\u0080\u009dTime spent with Mr. Fulcher also informed his work photographing Black Lives Matter protests for The Chronicle. The long-term project led to friendship, thanks to a certain fearlessness and humanity on both their parts.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI learned that you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a good story without telling the truth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Fulcher said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSometimes that includes hard, personal issues. The rent is too high everywhere. I liked Oakland at first but it is changing. I was homeless for two years. I was trying to stay in hotels, but I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford it. It affected me. People get so down on you and lose respect for you, people you used to take care of. Now, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m back in L.A. with my family and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better for me. If you look at my life, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been through a lot but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still surviving. This is a story about my recovery.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Wolson, who has traveled extensively and is now freelancing in Nairobi, Kenya, says those three years spent in Oakland helped him think about how he would approach projects differently in the future. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn South Africa I spent time with a refugee in Johannesburg,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt primed me for how I would approach such a situation again. But there was no blueprint for this experience.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFayemi Shakur is a writer based in Newark.

Trump is increasingly taking jabs at Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who is riding momentum in Iowa less than a month before the caucuses there. But so far, Mr. Cruz is resisting the bait.

The Constitution restricts the presidency to a \u201cnatural born citizen,\u201d but many legal scholars have said that this would apply to Mr. Cruz, although a similar issue has never been tested in the courts. Mr. Cruz, who was born in Calgary, renounced his Canadian citizenship in 2014.Mr. Cruz sought to brush off Mr. Trump\u2019s questions about his eligibility, posting on Twitter a clip from the \u201cjump the shark\u201d episode of \u201cHappy Days,\u201d which has become a cultural reference for when something once popular has become overdone and gimmicky.\u201cWhat the American people are interested in is not bickering and back and forth,\u201d Mr. Cruz told reporters in Iowa when asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s comments.

Whatever happens there could have a ripple effect in the votes that immediately follow. At a fund-raiser in New York City a few weeks before the holidays, Mr. Cruz raised questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s judgment to the roughly 70 people in attendance.

Scott, who was fatally shot by a police officer in South Carolina, is withdrawing his support from Hillary Clinton and endorsing Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont on Monday afternoon.The lawyer, State Representative Justin T. Bamberg of South Carolina, said he is switching sides because he believes Mrs. Clinton embodies establishment politics, while Mr. Sanders offers a bolder platform that will improve the lives of people in the South and across the country. The endorsement could help Mr. Sanders as he tries to win more support from black voters \u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially in South Carolina \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in the series of southern states that hold contests after Iowa and New Hampshire, where he is well positioned.In April in North Charleston, a police officer, Michael T.

Officer Stuart, 25, was shot in the ankle, but was able to return fire, hitting the gunman four times.It was not immediately clear what started the violence, which broke out at what officials described as an illegal \u201cjump up\u201d party held in a rented hall at 2505 Third Avenue in the Mott Haven neighborhood. The fighting then spilled out into the street.Four firearms were recovered at the scene in the Bronx, including a .380 semiautomatic handgun that the police said had been used by Mr. Rice.A Police Department official with knowledge of the investigation said that a second suspect was in custody and was expected to face weapons charges. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to be identified discussing a continuing investigation.The names of the stabbing victims were not made public. A woman who would identify herself only as an aunt of Marquis Lesane, 19, who attended the party, said he had been injured in the fight, but not seriously.\u201cHe\u2019s good, he\u2019s good,\u201d the woman said in a brief telephone conversation.At a news conference at the hospital on Saturday, Mayor Bill de Blasio praised Officer Stuart, whose father is a New York City police detective, for his \u201cquick thinking and brave actions.\u201d\u201cWhat an impressive young man who went into a very dangerous situation and handled himself so well,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said.In a photograph released by the Police Department on Saturday, Officer Stuart could be seen in a hospital bed smiling and flashing two thumbs up, as Mr. Bratton stood over him.It was a happier scene than one three months ago, when Mr. Bratton appeared at a different hospital and choked back tears as he announced the death of Officer Randolph Holder, who had been fatally shot while chasing a suspect in Harlem. Officials say 100 to 200 people attended the party, which began late Friday. Online advertisements, including a posting on Yelp, named the site of the party as the Sanctuary Party Hall, which can be rented out for large events. A video advertisement on YouTube, apparently filmed with a hand-held camera, shows a spare ballroom with tables and a \u201chookah section,\u201d and boasts of black light and D.J. equipment. A party package includes a hostess, two security guards and a microwave. The cost for 150 people on a Friday is $950, according to a website for the hall.Mr. Bratton said the hall did not have a license for an event like the one held on Friday.Some people who attended the party said they had learned about it on Facebook, which had a flier posted by a group called the Dream Twins advertising free admission for women who arrived before midnight.

{"Headline": "The Improbable Rise of Mississippi Roast", "Date": "2016-01-25", "News": "Supported byFifteen or so years ago, by her recollection, a woman named Robin Chapman made a pot roast in her slow cooker. Now known as Mississippi Roast, it would eventually become one of the most popular recipes on the web, an unlikely star with unlikely ingredients, a favorite of the mom-blog set.Ms. Chapman lives in Ripley, Miss., but she did not call her pot roast Mississippi Roast, not then and not now. She just calls it \u201croast.\u201d She used beef chuck to make the dish that first time, she told me in an interview, and put a packet of dry ranch-dressing mix on top of the meat, along with a packet of dry \u201cau jus\u201d gravy, a stick of butter and a few pepperoncini. It was an on-the-spot variation of a recipe she had learned from her aunt, which called for packaged Italian dressing. Ms. Chapman wanted something \u201cmilder,\u201d she said, so she swapped out the Italian for the ranch.She set the slow cooker to low and walked away. Some hours later, her family dived into their meal with glee. She has made the roast ever since. And largely unnoticed by food writers and scholars, the recipe has slowly taken on a life of its own.The story of that twisting road to fame began a few months after the dish\u2019s creation, when Ms. Chapman prepared the roast for Karen Farese, a friend \u201csince we were diapers,\u201d Ms. Chapman said. Ms. Farese loved her dinner, and eventually contributed a recipe for it to a cookbook put together by her congregation, the Beech Hill Church of Christ, also in Ripley. Ms. Farese did not call the dish Mississippi Roast either. She called it \u201croast beef.\u201d\u201cOh, goodness,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to say that was over 10 years ago.\u201d\u201cThe best roast in the world,\u201d she called it in her post. While admitting that \u201cthe recipe sounded awful\u201d and that she hated ranch dressing, she stood strong on the deliciousness of the meal. \u201cYou have got to make this if you like a good roast,\u201d she wrote. \u201cTrust me on this.\u201dOutside the blogosphere, however, the success of Mississippi Roast has been a quiet one. It has gone widely unnoticed by the journalists and academics who document the food culture of the American South, perhaps because it sounds so unappetizing.To see what the fuss was about, I set out to make Mississippi Roast myself. An initial run at the recipe, strictly as written, yielded a tangle of soft and luscious beef, richly flavored with butter and salt, with a low vinegar zip from the pickled peppers. There was a faint chemical bite, yes, from the packaged dressing and gravy, but the dish was objectively good, even delicious.Still: packaged dry ranch-dressing mix? Packaged dry gravy mix? These are built on foundations of salt and monosodium glutamate, artificial flavors, artificial colors, polysyllabic ingredients that are difficult to pronounce much less identify. Surely they could be replaced without increasing by much the prep time for the roast.As for the full stick of butter Ms. Chapman used, I reckoned I could go with less. There is plenty of fat in a chuck roast. And Ms. Farese called for using \u201c2 or more pepperoncini\u201d in her recipe in the church cookbook. I thought many more \u2014 eight to 10 \u2014 would answer more clearly, providing some zing against the richness of the sauce.I seared the roast before placing it in the slow cooker, browning it aggressively beneath a shower of salt and pepper and a coating of all-purpose flour that I hoped would create a fond, or base of flavor, to replace the gravy mix, and give some structure to the sauce. I placed it in the slow cooker with a half-stick of unsalted butter and all my pepperoncini.While that started to heat, I made a small portion of ranch dressing: some mayonnaise and dried dill, cider vinegar and a splash of buttermilk, just a few tablespoons in all, seasoned with a dash of paprika. And I dumped that over the top of the meat.Eight hours later, my family dived into their meal with glee. It was exactly the same as the original effort, and took about the same amount of time to make.Ms. Farese has twins, Katherine and Michael, both seniors at the University of Mississippi. Recently, she said, a friend of theirs served them the roast for dinner. \u201cWhere did you get this recipe?\u201d Katherine asked. \u201cIt\u2019s a Mississippi Roast,\u201d the host replied. \u201cI found the recipe on Pinterest.\u201dMs. Farese laughed at the children\u2019s response. \u201cNo,\u201d Michael said, \u201cthis is my mama\u2019s roast.\u201dAnd to Drink ...cookingAdvertisement"}

Trump has widened his edge against Ted Cruz in Iowa, according to a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics poll on Saturday that shows the billionaire gaining momentum right ahead of Monday\u2019s caucuses.The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.The results come as the Republican presidential candidates are crisscrossing Iowa in hopes of turning out their supporters and persuading remaining undecided voters to caucus for them.On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders were battling for the lead position, with Mrs. Clinton getting the support of 45 percent of likely caucus-goers to Mr. Sanders\u2019s 42 percent. Martin O\u2019Malley, the former Maryland governor, trails them with just 3 percent.Of Democrats who are planning to caucus, 30 percent say they could still be persuaded, while 45 percent of Republicans remain open to changing their minds.Backed by evangelical Christians and social conservatives, Mr. Cruz, Senator of Texas, had surged to the top of the Iowa polls a month ago only to see his momentum dampened under sustained attacks from Mr. Trump. A poll from the same group in mid-January showed Mr. Cruz with a three-point lead.For months the candidates had been been publicly friendly toward each other, but Mr. Trump has recently raised questions about the eligibility of the Canadian born Mr. Cruz to run for president and has assailed his lack of popularity in the senate.

{"Headline": "Jakarta Attack Raises Fears of ISIS\u2019 Spread in Southeast Asia", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported byJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 The Islamic State claimed responsibility for a terrorist attack in the Indonesian capital on Thursday, raising the specter of an expanded presence by the group in Southeast Asia.The Syrian civil war has been a source of inspiration for violent Islamists in Indonesia, and hundreds have traveled to Syria to join the Islamic State over the past several years. But recently they appear to have sought targets closer to home. Extremists claiming to represent the Islamic State carried out small-scale attacks in Indonesia and the Philippines last year.In Thursday\u2019s attack in the center of Jakarta, militants targeted a police traffic post near an affluent shopping area, then set off explosions, apparently in a suicide attack, outside a nearby Starbucks coffee shop. At least seven people were killed, including five of the assailants, and 23 people were wounded, the police said.The Islamic State took responsibility for the attack in a statement released on its official Telegram channel, an encrypted phone app.Gen. Tito Karnavian, chief of the Jakarta Provincial Police and the former head of the country\u2019s elite national police counterterrorism unit, said at a news conference on Thursday that the perpetrators were linked to leaders of the Islamic State in Raqqa, Syria, and warned that the group was expanding its operations across the region, including in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand.He identified the organizer as an Indonesian citizen believed to be in Syria. The suspect, Bahrun Naim, is a leader of Katibah Nusantara, a Southeast Asia-based military unit under the Islamic State, General Karnavian said. The police appear to have been aware of Mr. Bahrun for some time.At least 16 terrorism suspects have been arrested in Indonesia in the past month alone, and the police said they received information in late November that the Islamic State was planning \u201ca concert\u201d in Indonesia, possibly meaning an attack.Despite the fear caused by gunfire and blasts in the middle of a major Asian city, the limited casualties on Thursday raised questions about the terrorists\u2019 destructive capabilities. The police said the explosives used were small bombs or grenades, much less powerful than those used in previous attacks in the country, including one in which a large car bomb on the resort island of Bali in 2002 killed more than 200 people, the vast majority of them foreigners.Indonesia is the world\u2019s most populous Muslim-majority country, with a tradition of tolerance toward other religions. A tiny fraction of the population is radicalized, analysts say, but in recent years, the country has grappled with rising tensions between moderates and hard-line groups, some of them peaceful and others militant, promoting what they say is a purer interpretation of Islam.8 PhotosIn April 2015, Katibah Nusantara fighters captured territory held by Kurdish forces in Syria, a boon for its online drive to recruit new fighters and supporters among Malay speakers in Southeast Asia, according to a research paper published last year by the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.\u201cThe growing reach of Katibah Nusantara could lead to its expanding influence in Islamic State\u2019s decision-making process, in turn leading I.S. giving greater priority to Southeast Asia as its war zone,\u201d the researches said.The militants initially targeted the police traffic post on Jalan Thamrin, one of Jakarta\u2019s main thoroughfares. Video showed a series of blasts in a parking lot across the street from the post, just yards from the front doors of a Starbucks coffee shop and a Burger King restaurant. Video on local television appeared to show two of the attackers blowing themselves up near the Starbucks.At least one assailant fired at the police post. Security forces stormed the area, and the police later said they had arrested four suspects. An Indonesian television station reported early Friday that the police had arrested three more people suspected of being connected with the attack.More than a dozen countries have had attacks since the Islamic State, or ISIS, began to pursue a global strategy in the summer of 2014.The two civilians killed in the attack were a Canadian and an Indonesian, President Joko Widodo\u2019s cabinet secretary, Pramono Anung, said at a news conference. Canada\u2019s foreign affairs ministry did not immediately confirm whether a Canadian citizen had died.The police department\u2019s public relations division said in a post on its official Facebook page that 23 people had been treated for injuries, including five police officers, four foreigners and 14 other civilians.Thursday\u2019s attack took place just yards from Plaza Sarinah, a shopping mall that was one of the few landmarks President Obama recognized on a 2010 state visit, as his motorcade rolled through Jakarta, where he lived as a child.Numerous high-rise buildings, including offices occupied by the United Nations, lie within yards of the police post, as well as several four- and five-star hotels and Tanah Abang, Southeast Asia\u2019s largest traditional textiles market. The United States Embassy is a little over half a mile from the attack site, which is also near Indonesia\u2019s National Monument and the presidential palace complex.Indonesia\u2019s violent Islamists are made up of at least three overlapping pro-Islamic State groups, including Ansharut Daulah Islamiyah, a sort of umbrella group that claims to be the main Islamic State structure in Indonesia; Mujahedeen of Eastern Indonesia, based in Poso, on the island of Sulawesi, whose commander, Santoso, leads a band of about 30 armed men, including several ethnic Uighurs; and a group based in central Java that is believed to take instructions directly from an Indonesian fighter for the Islamic State in Syria.The country is also home to Jemaah Islamiyah, a group that has been blamed for a number of deadly attacks in Indonesia, according to Ms. Jones. It supports the Qaeda affiliate in Syria, the Nusra Front, and not the Islamic State. Though the group is rebuilding, it does not appear for the moment to be interested in violence in Indonesia, she said.The most severe attacks by Islamic militants occurred on Bali in 2002 and again in 2005, when 25 people were killed.In 2003, an attack on a hotel in Jakarta left 12 people dead. The hotel was struck again in 2009, nearly simultaneously with the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Jakarta, and eight people were killed.Yohanes Sulaiman, a political analyst, said Indonesia\u2019s government had not done enough to contain Islamist radicals in recent years. He said the police had \u201cdone a good job in preventing such attacks, considering that Indonesia is kind of a messy place. What the government hasn\u2019t been doing is to stop the radicalism.\u201dIndonesian extremists are known to have trained and fought in Afghanistan in the 1980s and \u201990s, in the Philippines, possibly in Bosnia and now in Syria.Joe Cochrane reported from Jakarta, and Thomas Fuller from Bangkok.

{"Headline": "The Fashion Crowd Considers J.W. Anderson\u2019s Grindr Debut", "Date": "2016-01-11", "News": "Supported byOn Sunday, just after 10 a.m., Mr. Anderson\u2019s collection hit the runway and the Internet. Those unsuspecting souls surfing Grindr for lust or companionship were offered the chance to see his show unfold: its polka-dot furs and knitted trousers, appliqu\u00e9d snails and boxing-boot shoes.Whether it was what the virtually gathered crowd came to the app for or not, Grindr personnel were sanguine. \u201cYou know as well as I do, there are the fashion gays,\u201d Landis Smithers, the company\u2019s vice president for marketing, said in an interview last week. \u201cThey love them a show and an exclusive.\u201dNot everyone was as eager. In the immediate aftermath of the announcement, rumors circulated that model agencies were leery of sending their charges, many of them underage, to participate in the show. (To be live-streamed via Grindr is not the same as to use Grindr, though the company\u2019s terms of service restrict use to those who are at least 18, and in some places, 21.)But if there were holdouts among the models, it wasn\u2019t immediately evident from the runway, and Mr. Anderson said that he had experienced pushback from potential collaborators only at the outset.33 Photos\u201cI think at the beginning there was a bit of unknowingness, which was stressful,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I believe in this project. I think it\u2019s very important that brands explore media; I think it\u2019s the only way forward. I don\u2019t see any differentiation between Grindr and Tinder or any sort of dating app, or Instagram. I feel like people now can use any sort of social device to meet people.\u201dThe show\u2019s final casting, he added, was \u201cexactly the way it should be.\u201dAmong those who saw the show live, without having to resort to the app, the idea was largely popular.The rapper ASAP Rocky, waiting a turn to congratulate Mr. Anderson, expressed an appreciation for the silk pieces in the collection and the good vibes of the Grindr partnership. \u201cI heard about that last minute,\u201d he said. \u201cGay people supporting gays. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about: support. I support everybody.\u201dSome wariness persisted. \u201cIt is what it is, you know?\u201d said one young model from the show when asked how he felt about appearing on Grindr, before reversing himself and declaring that he was uncomfortable answering the question. He declined to give his name.Certainly the possibilities are large on a platform that engages millions.\u201cEvery single person I know is on Grindr,\u201d said Bryan Grey Yambao, better known as the blogger Bryanboy, after the show. (Even assuming some mild hyperbole on Mr. Yambao\u2019s part, the numbers are formidable: seven million users by Grindr\u2019s own estimate, as many as a million or more users are on the platform at any given moment.)He added, \u201cI think it\u2019s a great audience to tap into.\u201dHe said that he had downloaded the app that morning but had already deleted it.Whether that suggests less overlap between fashion obsessives and would-be couplers than Grindr might like remains to be seen. But according to Mr. Smithers, by Monday morning (an edited version of the video remained accessible via Grindr for 24 hours after its live debut), Mr. Anderson\u2019s show had been streamed about 100,000 times, about a third of them during the event.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump, the Man Who Wasn\u2019t There", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "A debate without Donald J. Trump does not mean that Mr. Trump is really absent.At least that was the takeaway after the first two-hour Republican primary debate held without the real estate developer, who is leading public opinion polls in Iowa and who decided not to attend the final face-off after a running feud with the host, Fox News.Mr. Trump was mentioned repeatedly in the opening moments, mostly in a mocking way. But without him, there was a significant difference in energy. It was a bit like a television series in which a major character disappears midseason, said to be off on a business trip, as the actor playing that character films a movie or deals with a health crisis. The show goes on, but it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel the same.Without Mr. Trump, most of the drama involved Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas, each of whom was asked tough questions by the moderator Megyn Kelly \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who demonstrated that her toughness is not, in fact, limited to Mr. Trump \u00e2\u0080\u0094 about changes in their immigration stances. Fox News played footage of both men talking about the issue in previous years in ways that seemed to clash with their current statements. (One has to wonder whether Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aides had been aware that old videos would be used during the debate when they collectively decided he wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t attend.) At first, Mr. Cruz, a sharp debater, seemed to benefit greatly from Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s absence, but he seemed less sure-footed later. Mr. Cruz also had a terse exchange with another moderator, Chris Wallace.Mr. Rubio, who at times seemed to shout, and Jeb Bush exchanged harsh barbs about immigration overhaul, which represented some of Mr. Bush\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best moments in any previous debate. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey made his presence felt, but his answers felt deeply similar to previous ones.It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not clear if the debate will change many minds in Iowa, but Mr. Bush and Mr. Rubio, who had been drowned out by the Trump-Cruz show, might now get a second look before the caucuses on Monday night. And while Mr. Trump may have halted his momentum by stepping offstage, he did himself no harm, and put Mr. Cruz in the line of fire.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Looking for Signs That Apple\u2019s Runaway Growth Is Waning", "Date": "2016-01-24", "News": "Supported byAlready, some investors have begun to treat Apple in a new way: as a \u201cvalue\u201d stock, a label typically attached to companies that generate predictable business results or a reliable dividend, rather than ones that deliver runaway revenue growth. Value stocks often command much lower valuations than growth stocks.\u201cPeople were in love with Apple because hits like the iPod and iPhone created phenomenal growth,\u201d said Ernesto Ramos, a fund manager at BMO Global Asset Management, which manages $18 billion and counts Apple as its largest holding. \u201cAs investors shifted their minds around the fact that it\u2019s no longer going to deliver the same sort of huge growth over the next five years, the stock became a value play.\u201dMr. Ramos says his firm still owns Apple in some of its growth funds, but began including the stock in value funds in mid-2013.Switching from being a growth stock to being a value stock can also be a long and painful process. Growth investors need to sell a company\u2019s shares and drive down the price until it is low enough to tempt value investors, who buy stocks they think are cheap compared with the intrinsic value of the company. In the tech industry, a shift from growth to value also often signals to investors that a company is facing newer competitors with more innovative products, raising the question of how relevant the company can remain.\u201cInvestors don\u2019t like to see the words tech and value combined because when growth slows at a tech company, it usually means that something essentially is not working,\u201d said Angelo Zino, a senior analyst at the research firm S&P Capital IQ.A spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment.Any change would have repercussions beyond Apple because its soaring performance in recent years helped lift the broader market. If Apple shares were removed from the equation, the performance of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index in five of the last seven years would drop by about 1 percentage point, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices. In 2014, for instance, the index rose 13.7 percent with Apple and 12.9 percent without Apple.The Apple effect is even more pronounced when technology names are isolated. For tech stocks on the S.&P. 500 as a group, annual gain in 2009 declined by 6 percentage points when Apple shares were not included, dropping to 56 percent from 62 percent.The effect was more muted last year as Apple\u2019s growth decelerated, according to the data.Investors have turned to Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet, which owns Google \u2014 collectively referred to as the FANG stocks \u2014 for growth. Those companies are each expected to show annual revenue gains of 23 to 40 percent for the last three months of 2015, while Apple is projected to deliver 3 percent revenue growth, according to Bloomberg data.Mr. Ramos says companies like Amazon have bigger growth potential for his fund than Apple, though he plans to continue owning Apple shares. \u201cAmazon will see about 20 percent revenue growth, and earnings per share are expected to jump considerably,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a very strong growth story.\u201dApple shares have already been buffeted in recent months because of worries about the slowing economy in China, which the company counts as one of its largest markets. Half a dozen companies that provide parts for the iPhone also blamed weak demand from Apple for lower-than-expected earnings, causing worries about the company\u2019s sales trajectory.\u201cIf you wanted to outperform the market, the FANG stocks did better,\u201d said Jonathan Krinsky, an analyst at MKM Partners, though he added that Apple remained a must-watch stock because it composed such a large part of many stock indexes.Investors may still someday reanoint Apple as a growth stock, especially if the company can create a best-selling new product that drives up its sales rate. Wall Street analysts cite Microsoft as an example of a business that lost steam and then made the adjustments necessary to deliver strong revenue growth again.Apple has been reclassified as a value stock before. FTSE Russell, which makes several closely followed stock indexes, found in 2013 that Apple no longer met its criteria to be treated purely as a growth stock. Some of the company\u2019s enormous market capitalization was reallocated to the Russell Value Index, as well as being in the Russell Growth Index. A year later, when the company\u2019s sales had risen strongly with the introduction of the iPhone 6, FTSE Russell placed Apple solely back in the growth index.Tom Goodwin, FTSE Russell\u2019s senior research director, said that stock price, sales growth and analyst expectations determine whether a company is placed in the growth or value index, or in both. About a third of the stocks that Russell tracks are included in both indexes, he said.But until Apple reveals another hit or shows a significant pickup in iPhone sales growth, Apple should be viewed as a value-oriented name, Mr. Zino said.\u201cHistorically Apple was the name to own if you wanted to outperform the market,\u201d he said. \u201cNow there are other places to look.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research from New York.Advertisement"}

On three nights, the freshmen used whatever materials they could find to dress as reindeer, elves or other Christmas icons.But on the fourth night, cadets used \u201cwhat they had close at hand\u201d to dress as \u201cGhosts of Christmas Past,\u201d the statement said, and donned the pillowcases.They had lyrics sheets for Christmas songs that had nothing offensive on them, the investigation showed, but \u201cnot all of the freshmen understood that the costumes could be construed by some as offensive in nature.\u201dOther cadets reported that they had seen the freshmen with the pillowcases on their heads. Two photographs were posted on social media by an upperclass cadet who was in the room.The investigation started the next day, the statement said.\u201cWhile the skit had no ill intent, it did show poor judgment,\u201d General Rosa said. He said a diversity task force was created. \u201cThe bottom line is that the cadets involved now understand that the costumes could be considered offensive and hurtful to many.\u201dMr. Ashworth told reporters that General Rosa also spoke with leaders of civil rights groups before the investigation results were released.The Citadel was founded in 1842 and has about 2,300 students in its undergraduate Corps of Cadets, and another 1,000 students in its civilian program.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ways to Be Free", "Date": "2016-01-21", "News": "Supported byWhen you grew up in an unmapped, unwired world and find yourself in this one \u2014 observing the panic when GPS fails or the extent of online status anxiety \u2014 you can\u2019t help wondering if somewhere along the way freedom got lost.Freedom is still out there. We all have our idea of it, the deferred dream. Your psyche builds layers of protection around your most vulnerable traits, which may be closely linked to that precious essence in which freedom resides. Freedom is inseparable from risk.Technology increases choice, but its prime purpose is to increase productivity; that is the amount that can be extracted from you in any given time. Like debt, it never sleeps. It confines you. It distracts you. It binds you. It depoliticizes you through isolation and through the blurring, in the cacophony it delivers, of fantasy with fact.I don\u2019t know if the world is freer than a half-century ago. On paper, it is. The totalitarian Soviet Imperium is gone. The generals who bossed Latin America are gone, generally. Asia has unshackled itself and claims this century as its own. Media has opened out, gone social.Yet minds feel more crimped, fear more pervasive, possibility more limited, adventure more choreographed, politics more stale, economics more skewed, pressure more crushing, escape more elusive.Three things recently caused me to ponder these matters. The first was the appearance, like a letter in a bottle, of a diary from 1973, recording a time when I was in Afghanistan as a 17-year-old hippie. The second was reading \u201cBarbarian Days,\u201d William Finnegan\u2019s wonderful surfing memoir. The third was a question from my son. I\u2019ll take them in order.The diary, written by Leslie Starr, covers three weeks that, as a young woman, she spent with me in Kabul, Bamian (its Buddhas still intact), Band-e-Amir and Mazar-i-Sharif. Starr, from Annapolis, traveled in a VW Kombi, named Pigpen after the keyboardist of the Grateful Dead, that I had driven with two friends to Afghanistan. It took her only 43 years to transcribe her jottings and so reverse time\u2019s arrow.There I am, on Aug. 2, 1973, my 18th birthday, in a cave beside the beautiful lakes of Band-e-Amir, \u201cpropped against bundles, surrounded by chickens, beautiful children, a kitten, a goat, women in the corners\u201d eating. There, the next day, on the \u201cterrible road\u201d from Bamian to Mazar, \u201czooming, crashing along into the night.\u201dThere again, on Aug.ust 10, at the Salang Pass (12,723 feet), camped out and cold with the engine bust. The next day, \u201cwe coasted 40 kilometers, stopped in desperation.\u201d Back in Kabul, I try a cake of, let us say, Colorado inspiration. It packs a punch. Starr writes, \u201cDuring the night I heard Roger talking to Marcus about dying.\u201d Oh, man. She observes these three young men \u201cabout to enter Oxford\u201d who \u201csit around and write in notebooks or read Turgenev.\u201dI\u2019m struck by the haphazardness of that journey; the fact we drove across Iran; the way names likes Mazar and the Salang Pass have become synonymous with war; the idea of us teenagers thousands of miles from our parents, out of contact.How much freer, in many ways, we were. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that the world\u2019s more dangerous. I think it\u2019s that people are more frightened. Fear is a much-trafficked commodity.Which brings me to Finnegan\u2019s wonderful book, a kind of hymn to freedom and passion. Freedom is inside you. It\u2019s the thing that cannot be denied. For Finnegan, that\u2019s surfing and writing. \u201cHow could you know your limits unless you tested them?\u201d he asks \u2014 a question as true before the ferocious energy of the wave as before the infinite possibilities of the written form.He\u2019s a near- contemporary, embracing Kerouac and the Dead, contemptuous of what a friend calls \u201cSuckcess,\u201d hitting the road without a map to find the perfect wave somewhere between Guam and Cape Town, a child of a zeitgeist he describes as \u201chippie culture, acid rock, hallucinogens, neo-Eastern mysticism, the psychedelic aesthetic.\u201d Like me he laments the loss of the lost places, the beaches he was first to tread.A patch of coast may demand a lifetime of study. Wave love, he observes, \u201cis a one way street.\u201d The wave, implacable, will turn on you. \u201cScenes feel mythic even as they unfold. I always feel a ferocious ambivalence: I want to be nowhere else; I want to be anywhere else.\u201d One near- escape produces this catharsis: \u201cOn my knees in the sand, in the twilight, absolutely spent, I was surprised to find myself sobbing.\u201dWhat my son Blaise, who is 21, asked was whether it\u2019s still possible to have such adventures. He thought not \u2014 too much control, too much Google Earth. I suggested he might be wrong and that, on graduation, he might drive from New York to Patagonia. It\u2019s important to experience that \u201cferocious ambivalence,\u201d the threshold of freedom.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Design Thinking\u2019 for a Better You", "Date": "2016-01-04", "News": "A strategy called \u00e2\u0080\u009cdesign thinking\u00e2\u0080\u009d has helped numerous entrepreneurs and engineers develop successful new products and businesses. But can design thinking help you create healthful habits?Bernard Roth, a prominent Stanford engineering professor, says that design thinking can help everyone form the kind of lifelong habits that solve problems, achieve goals and help make our lives better.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are all capable of reinvention,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Dr. Roth, a founder of the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford and author of the book, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Achievement Habit.\u00e2\u0080\u009dI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve applied design thinking to my own life the past few months, and it seems to be working. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve lost 25 pounds, reconnected with close friends and refocused my energy on specific goals and habits.Design thinking has helped me identify the obstacles that were stopping me from achieving my goals, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s helped me reframe my problems to make them easier to solve.In the words of Dr. Roth, design thinking helped me \u00e2\u0080\u009cget unstuck.\u00e2\u0080\u009dTo get started, design thinkers focus on five steps, but the first two are the most important. Step 1 is to \u00e2\u0080\u009cempathize\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 learn what the real issues are that need to be solved. Next, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdefine the problem\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a surprisingly tough task. The third step is to \u00e2\u0080\u009cideate\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 brainstorm, make lists, write down ideas and generate possible solutions. Step 4 is to build a prototype or create a plan. The final step is to test the idea and seek feedback from others.Design thinking is normally applied by people who are trying to create a new product or solve a social problem or meet a consumer need.For instance, Stanford students went to Myanmar to work on an irrigation project. The first two steps of design thinking \u00e2\u0080\u0094 empathize and define the problem \u00e2\u0080\u0094 meant that the students spent time with the farmers to understand their problems with watering crops.In doing so, they discovered that the farmers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 real problem was not irrigation but light. The farmers used candles or kerosene lanterns, and the fumes filled their small huts. Managing their needs for light without electric power consumed a great deal of time and income.As a result, the design-thinking students used empathy to shift their focus to the actual problem that needed solving. They developed affordable, solar-powered LED task lights. They have since provided millions of lights to 42 countries, creating an affordable lighting solution in parts of the world that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have electricity, or have spotty service.Dr. Roth says the same type of thinking that solved the lighting problem for the poor farmers can be applied inward. To start, think about the problem you want to solve. Then ask yourself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat would it do for me if I solved this problem?\u00e2\u0080\u009dOne example Dr. Roth uses is a person who wants to find a life partner. Ask yourself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat would finding a partner or spouse do for me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d One answer might be that it would bring you companionship. The next step is to reframe the problem: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow can I find companionship?\u00e2\u0080\u009d There are more and easier answers to the new question \u00e2\u0080\u0094 you can meet friends online, take classes, join a club, take a group trip, join a running group, get a pet and spend time at the dog park.\u00e2\u0080\u009cFinding a spouse now becomes simply one of many possible ways to find companionship,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Roth says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy changing the question, I have altered my point of view and dramatically expanded the number of possible solutions.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFor years, I would have told you that my biggest problem was being overweight, but I simply could not find a diet that worked. But design thinking helped me reframe my problem.It happened a few months ago when I declined an invitation to a party with many of my favorite people who I hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen in years. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go because I was embarrassed by my weight, and I just didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel up to seeing people who knew me when I was thinner. I realized that my issues with my weight were getting in the way of me living my life.It was time for design thinking. At this point, a design thinker would ask \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat would losing weight really do for you?\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe answer surprised me. I wanted to feel better about myself, feel less tired and have more energy and confidence to socialize and reconnect with friends. Conducting my own personal empathy exercise helped me realize that weight loss was really not my problem. Instead, I needed to focus on my friendships, on boosting my energy and getting better sleep.So reconnecting with friends and getting better sleep became my focus. I bought new clothes, which made it easier to make social plans.And surprisingly, this new, more empathetic approach to my own needs also illuminated some ways to improve my diet. I realized a carb crash around lunchtime was making me very tired during the day, so I eliminated sugar and processed carbohydrates and immediately had more energy. In shifting my focus away from weight loss to the real issues weighing on my life, I ended up losing 25 pounds.I still have a long way to go, but developing empathy for myself was truly a breakthrough made possible by design thinking.\u00e2\u0080\u009cDesign thinking on the highest level is a way of reframing the way you look at the world and deal with issues, and the main thing is this idea of empathy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Roth says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you have tried something and it hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worked, then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working on the wrong problem.\u00e2\u0080\u009dRelated:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "Starving Syrians in Madaya Are Denied Aid Amid Political Jockeying", "Date": "2016-01-10", "News": "Supported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 In the hills near the Lebanese border, an hour\u2019s drive from downtown Damascus, much of a Syrian town is starving, according to residents and international humanitarian workers.Their plight represents a stark failure of international powers that has worsened even as they intensify military and diplomatic activities, all in the name of resolving the conflict.This is happening as the United Nations plans a new round of peace talks for Jan. 25. It is happening amid escalating military interventions by Russia and the United States. And in some ways, according to diplomats and humanitarian workers, it is happening not just despite those efforts, but also because of them, as the warring parties flout international law while being courted for negotiations.Yet in Madaya and neighboring Zabadani, once popular mountain resorts, thoughts of political change have receded in the face of hunger. Hamoudi, 27, a business-school graduate who took up arms after the government\u2019s crackdown on protests in 2011, said many people would surrender in order to eat, even though they expected arrests and retribution to follow.\u201cIn the revolution I was dreaming of democracy, freedom,\u201d Hamoudi said slowly in an interview via Skype, exhaustion evident in his voice. \u201cToday all my dreams are food. I want to eat. I don\u2019t want to die from starvation.\u201dFive more people, a 9-year-old boy and four men older than 45, died on Sunday of suspected malnutrition, according to the medics working with Doctors Without Borders, who said that 10 more people needed immediate hospitalization to survive, and that 200 more could reach that state in a week. \u201cMadaya is now effectively an open-air prison,\u201d the medical charity\u2019s operations director, Brice de le Vingne, said in a statement.About 400,000 Syrians are trapped behind front lines, denied access to food and medicine. That United Nations count has risen from 240,000 since 2014, when the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted a binding resolution ordering the warring parties to allow aid delivery.Both Russia, the Syrian government\u2019s most powerful ally, and the United States have been carrying out airstrikes that they say are aimed at Islamic State militants. But the airstrikes have complicated the relief efforts. Since last fall, when Russia joined the fray, at least 16 health centers have been hit, and six aid groups have pulled out of Idlib Province, where the Islamic State has little presence but Syrian and Russian forces regularly bomb other groups that oppose President Bashar al-Assad.As they seek to maximize gains before the talks, all sides are inflicting new pain on civilians.Even now, as the Syrian government promises to allow United Nations aid into Madaya as soon as Monday \u2014 as international outrage over reports of starvation mounts \u2014 government forces are tightening a new siege on another rebel-held town, Moadhamiyeh, a suburb of Damascus.\u201cSurrender or you will be annihilated,\u201d was the message residents say Mr. Assad\u2019s negotiators delivered to Moadhamiyeh \u2014 which endured a chemical weapons attack in 2013 and a two-year siege that ended with a deal favoring the government.Using hunger as a weapon flies in the face of international law. Yet global and regional powers \u2014 like Russia, Iran, the United States and Saudi Arabia \u2014 are unable or unwilling to pressure their battlefield allies. The United Nations says that just 10 percent of its requests last year to deliver aid to besieged and hard to reach areas in Syria were approved.The Security Council resolutions have made \u201clittle difference to the Syrian civilians,\u201d said Andy Baker, of the aid group Oxfam.That puts the United Nations in an awkward position: helping to carry out local cease-fires that may permit aid for a time but also reward commanders\u2019 siege tactics.The United Nations has repeatedly found itself in the middle of deals that made bargaining chips of access to food and medicine that should be unconditional. Some deals have required civilians to leave their homes for aid and protection, going against basic principles of humanitarian relief.While the United Nations emphasizes that it is not a party to the agreements, its officials are intimately involved in carrying them out \u2014 aid delivery and evacuations cannot take place without them. In several cases, they have helped facilitate the talks as go-betweens.And with the United Nations special envoy, Staffan de Mistura, pressing for a national cease-fire, the local truces are often perceived and portrayed as United Nations-approved and as steps toward a broader accord.Critics say the United Nations, eager to keep the Syrian government on board for peace talks with opposition groups, is either selling out or getting played.Officials like Mr. de Mistura, who visited Damascus over the weekend, should be pressing loudly and publicly for unconditional aid access, said Bassam Barabandi, a former Syrian diplomat. Instead, he said, they privately tell opposition groups that they do not want Syrian officials \u201cto be upset and spoil the political process.\u201dSieges are nothing new in Syria. Nearly half of the 400,000 Syrians the United Nations counts as besieged are surrounded by government forces, who have used the tactic systematically around Damascus and Homs. The largest group is encircled by the Islamic State, which is blockading 200,000 people in Deir al-Zour, in the east. Other insurgents, mainly the Islamist group Ahrar al-Sham, have also encircled more than 12,000 people in isolated pro-government towns in northern Syria, like Fouaa and Kfarya.Wounded fighters and their families were evacuated simultaneously on both sides, and plans were made for more aid and evacuations. But those plans have stalled as people continue to become sick and die in Madaya \u2014 subject to one of the tightest sieges of the war, including what the United Nations calls \u201ccredible reports\u201d of people being shot as they try to escape.Civilians also suffer in rebel-encircled northern towns, though government helicopters make occasional airdrops.The talks are complex and sensitive, involving discussions between Iran and rebel groups because Zabadani and Madaya are encircled mainly by Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Lebanese militia that supports Mr. Assad. There are divisions within the towns, too, with some accusing fighters of hoarding food and many debating what terms to accept.In the meantime, dozens of people come daily to the Doctors Without Borders-affiliated clinic, said Khaled Mohammad, a nurse anesthetist there who shared photographs of a skeletal man, Suleiman Fares, 63, who was found dead by activists who brought food to his house.Such images have galvanized alarm about the siege. Some of the photographs circulating are from other places in Syria and elsewhere. But the ones shared by Mr. Mohammad were new and corresponded with other witnesses\u2019 accounts.Samar Hussein, a nurse, was one of a dozen residents interviewed. She said she had spent $40 last month for a few spoonfuls of sugar for her 19-year-old daughter, who had passed out, and the baby her daughter was trying to breast-feed. She and several families recently shared a soup made with one cup of bulgur wheat, gathering together to cook it because there was little wood. On the street, she said, she saw a woman picking grass to eat and did not realize at first that it was her neighbor.\u201cShe looks so different,\u201d she said. \u201cSo skinny.\u201dAn article on Jan. 11 about starvation in Madaya, a Syrian city controlled by rebels and besieged by government forces, referred imprecisely to the financing of the Syria Campaign, a group pushing for a no-fly zone over Syria.

{"Headline": "\u2018Making a Murderer\u2019 Town\u2019s Answer to Netflix Series: You Don\u2019t Know", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byMANITOWOC, Wis. \u2014 In the tourism office here, where workers are accustomed to cheery inquiries about Manitowoc County\u2019s best jogging paths and beach views, the questions have suddenly turned dark: How could you possibly promote tourism in such a corrupt town? Why would anyone visit here?Fury \u2014 by telephone, email and on social media \u2014 has also flooded the Manitowoc County Sheriff\u2019s Department, the Manitowoc City Police Department, Manitowoc City Hall and pretty much anywhere else with the name Manitowoc attached to it.Ten years ago, when I first came here, Steven Avery, the county resident now at the center of 10 Netflix episodes over more than 10 hours, had been arrested on suspicion of murder a few days before.Mr. Avery\u2019s past was what drew me to Manitowoc in November 2005: For months, he had been held up in Wisconsin as a symbol of everything wrong with the justice system, having served 18 years in prison for a sexual assault that DNA evidence later linked to a different man.Back then, as I drove to the county seat and along the stark, rural stretches closer to the salvage yard, I found a close-knit community in mourning over a young woman\u2019s death and an array of Avery supporters stunned by the turn of events.\u201cWe lived through this 10 years ago,\u201d Jason Ring, the president of the Manitowoc Area Visitor and Convention Bureau, said from a counter covered in maps and brochures.\u201cWe made our judgment, and the trial came to an end, and locally most people were in support of that,\u201d Mr. Ring said. \u201cNow it\u2019s back \u2014 by no choosing or no doing of anyone in this community.\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s the first point of injustice,\u201d he added. \u201cThat we have to live through it again.\u201dIn downtown Manitowoc, the county seat, the talkative, curious people I had come upon a decade earlier were no longer surprised \u2014 or the least bit pleased \u2014 to see yet another reporter. Many avoided any talk about \u201cMaking a Murderer,\u201d or simply spotted my notebook and walked away. The mayor declined to be interviewed. Business owners refused to discuss it: One said she had read online about a call for a protest in the town, and she was worried about safety.\u201cLook, we lived this whole thing like a juror,\u201d Suszanne Fox, who lives not far from here, told me as she ate a burger at the Fat Seagull. \u201cHe was guilty as sin.\u201dMany viewers of \u201cMaking a Murderer\u201d do not agree. Hundreds of thousands of people signed petitions asking President Obama to pardon Mr. Avery and Mr. Dassey, to which the White House has responded that the president cannot issue pardons in state cases. And Gov. Scott Walker has long pledged to issue no pardons while in office.The series left viewers with unrelenting questions: Did Mr. Avery\u2019s civil lawsuit for his wrongful sexual assault conviction motivate the Manitowoc County authorities to plant evidence against him in the second case, for murder? How was it that an old sample of Mr. Avery\u2019s blood, which was found in the victim\u2019s car, appeared to be tampered with while in the care of the authorities? Should Mr. Dassey, at his young age and with a limited intellect, have been questioned alone by investigators? Was his appointed lawyer working against his cause?But Ken Kratz, who prosecuted the cases against Mr. Avery and Mr. Dassey, said the series was one-sided and omitted significant pieces of evidence, including DNA from Mr. Avery on the latch under the hood of Ms. Halbach\u2019s Toyota RAV4, found in the Averys\u2019 auto salvage yard.\u201cIt\u2019s not a documentary at all; it\u2019s an advocacy piece,\u201d Mr. Kratz said in a telephone interview from New York, where he said he was being put up at the Waldorf Astoria while taking part in television newsmagazine interviews in the wake of the Netflix series.Sheriff Robert C. Hermann of Manitowoc County, who was the undersheriff at the time of the Avery case, said his office had gotten emails and voice mail messages calling the department corrupt.\u201cIt\u2019s not how Manitowoc wants to be put on the map,\u201d Sheriff Hermann said. He said he had few regrets, though he wished, given all he knows now, that only officials from a nearby sheriff\u2019s office, without Manitowoc\u2019s perceived conflicts, had held any role in the investigation.The filmmakers, Laura Ricciardi and Moira Demos, say they believe their series accurately portrayed the essential arguments the prosecutors made. The point, they said in a telephone interview, was to look at the Manitowoc cases as a window into the American justice system.\u201cWe have empathy for Manitowoc because we know that people have been reaching out in unkind ways and posting things about the city and the county,\u201d Ms. Ricciardi said. \u201cThat\u2019s an unfortunate response, because we have always wanted the series to be constructive, not destructive.\u201dMr. Avery, now 53, and Mr. Dassey, now 26, have not seen the series, their lawyers said. Prisoners do not get Netflix. But as Mr. Dassey awaits a federal court decision on claims that his confession was coerced and that he had a right to a lawyer who would mount a defense, Netflix viewers have barraged him with letters of support, said his lawyer, Laura Nirider of the Center on Wrongful Convictions of Youth at Northwestern University.\u201cHe is incredibly hopeful for the first time that when people hear the name Brendan Dassey, they don\u2019t think of a murderer, they think of someone who has been wronged,\u201d she said.And a new lawyer, Kathleen T. Zellner, well known for taking on wrongful conviction cases, has since signed on to handle Mr. Avery\u2019s next legal step.At the auto salvage yard, along dead-end Avery Road, tiny, jittery dogs watch from a green trailer where Dolores Avery, Mr. Avery\u2019s mother, says she is too tired for more interviews. Years ago, I sat with her, her husband and a brother in the living room here as they insisted that Mr. Avery was being railroaded for a second time.Standing in her doorway this month, Ms. Avery, a constant presence in the series, said she hoped people now saw \u201cthe crooked things the county has done\u201d to her family.But all the renewed talk, the calls for interviews from around the world? \u201cI\u2019m too old for this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s too much.\u201dRecently, tourists have been spotted on the property, with its row after row of forgotten, snow-topped cars, stopping in front of the yellow and black Avery\u2019s Auto Salvage & 24 Hour Towing sign to snap selfies.Advertisement"}

Trump, promised a crowd of more than 1,400 people in Burlington, Vt., that he would eliminate gun-free zones in schools on his first day in office.The two events express the divide between the two presidential primary races on the issue of guns, which have been a focal point since the fatal shooting in June of nine churchgoers in Charleston, S.C., the site of next week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Republican debate.Mr. Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposals for curbing the accessibility of guns \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a move he said he was forced to take because previous efforts stalled in Congress \u00e2\u0080\u0094 had support from 67 percent of people surveyed in a CNN poll released on Thursday.

{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders Mailing in Iowa Defends His Record on Guns", "Date": "2016-01-25", "News": "The rah-rah atmosphere at campaign events for Senator Bernie Sanders is often punctured, if only momentarily, by a sharp question from a voter asking him to explain his record on gun regulation and his vote affording special legal protection to the gun industry.It is a question that Hillary Clinton has worked hard to put into the Iowa ether. She has raised it in debates and on air, and her campaign has pressed it on the ground. And, judging from a piece of campaign literature the Sanders campaign has mailed to Iowa voters, it is a criticism that appears to be having some resonance a week before the caucuses. The Clinton campaign and its surrogates immediately jumped on the mailing as evidence of Mr. Sanders\u2019s misrepresenting his record on gun regulation, an attack that cuts to the core of the authenticity that is the foundation of his political support.In a conference call with reporters, Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, which has endorsed Mrs. Clinton, said that in some ways, the fact that Mr. Sanders was feeling \u00e2\u0080\u009ccompelled to misrepresent his record\u00e2\u0080\u009d was a positive sign that gun regulation was now a winning issue, and one in which it was \u00e2\u0080\u009cno longer politically expedient to pander\u00e2\u0080\u009d on.Mr. Gross went on to excoriate Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cdisgraceful record\u00e2\u0080\u009d in which he five times voted against passage of the Brady Bill and instead supported \u00e2\u0080\u009ctruly evil\u00e2\u0080\u009d legislation to protect gun manufacturers from litigation connected to the inappropriate sale of arms used in crimes.\u00e2\u0080\u009cA lot of real advocates out there find it offensive,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Gross said of Mr. Sanders calling himself a lifelong advocate.Asked on the call about Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own evolution on an issue that she has not always vocally supported, Mr. Gross concluded that Mrs. Clinton sided with gun advocates when it \u00e2\u0080\u009chad really mattered.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Shortly after the conference call, the Sanders campaign sent reporters an Associated Press article reporting that Mrs. Clinton had run little advertising in Iowa about her record on gun control.Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign manager, said in a statement: \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that Secretary Clinton has repeatedly changed her views on gun safety from one election to another.

Asked to compare his own business acumen to Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s, Mr. Trump said, \u201cIt\u2019s different kinds of business, it\u2019s a very different kind of business, but I would say that if he ran, I\u2019d be very happy about it.\u201d Mr. Trump repeatedly declined the chance to criticize Mr. Bloomberg, although he did say, \u201cHe\u2019s the opposite of me in many ways \u00e2\u0080\u0094 opposite on guns, opposite on numerous issues.\u201d But the real-estate developer said Bloomberg Politics, a website and offshoot of Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s media company, \u00e2\u0080\u009cextremely inaccurately and extremely unfairly\u201d covered him.

{"Headline": "Donald Trump Conducts Rare News Conference, and It Turns Testy", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "MARSHALLTOWN, Iowa \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Donald J. Trump on Tuesday night devoured another in the dwindling news cycles before the Iowa caucuses, as he excoriated a reporter for several minutes who was trying to ask him about his previous pro-abortion rights stance at a raucous news conference before a campaign event.Mr. Trump\u2019s news conferences are fairly rare, despite his frequent presence on cable news and network shows, and this one was ostensibly to collect the endorsement of Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Ariz., an anti-immigration hard-liner.Instead, it became a nearly 30-minute, freewheeling event in which Mr. Trump said he \u201cprobably\u201d wouldn\u2019t attend the final Republican presidential debate before the caucuses, on Thursday; indicated that he would talk to members of Congress before deporting people under his immigration plan; and denounced critics who questioned whether he had made promises to his high-profile endorsers. (After the news conference, an aide to Mr. Trump said that the decision had been made and that he was not going to attend the debate.)\u201cWe don\u2019t make deals,\u201d said Mr. Trump, the author of \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d who then said the only deal he wanted to make is for America.He conceded that if he did attend the debate, it could be notched as a flip-flop. And he smirked at a reporter who asked about Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska criticizing Mr. Trump\u2019s past marital infidelity. \u201cI appreciate the question,\u201d he said.But the tensest moments came in an exchange with the NBC reporter Peter Alexander, who repeatedly tried to read Mr. Trump\u2019s quotations from a 1999 interview with Tim Russert in which he described himself as \u201cpro-choice.\u201d That footage is being used in ads by a \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, with whom Mr. Trump is closely competing, and by the Cruz campaign. Mr. Cruz, he said, is a \u201cwreck.\u201dMr. Trump repeatedly cut off Mr. Alexander as he tried to read the quotation from the 1999 interview. \u201cExcuse me, excuse me,\u201d Mr. Trump said, talking over Mr. Alexander.Later, when Mr. Alexander tried to ask again, Mr. Trump demanded to know if the reporter would apologize. Mr. Alexander said that he was sorry the candidate felt he didn\u2019t represent the statement correctly, but that he was trying to read it.\u201cForget you,\u201d Mr. Trump said, cutting him off.It was reminiscent of the news conferences that another pugnacious New Yorker, Rudolph W. Giuliani, held when he was the city\u2019s mayor.That exchange delayed for another day Mr. Trump\u2019s being asked tough questions about his stand on abortion. He is trying to appeal to evangelical voters.Asked what he thought the punishment for a woman who has had an abortion should be, Mr. Trump said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about that right now.\u201d As for whether the so-called morning-after pill is a form of abortion, Mr. Trump said he would give an answer sometime in the future.Later, when another reporter asked why it was a cheap shot for Mr. Sasse to ask about his infidelity when Mr. Trump had raised Bill Clinton\u2019s transgressions as fair game, the candidate replied that in fact it wasn\u2019t a cheap shot.\u201cI\u2019m a religious person,\u201d Mr. Trump then said.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

A group of intrepid German retirees on a tour of Turkey and the Middle East. An Iraqi who had gone to Baghdad seeking refuge from the jihadist violence of his hometown. A Canadian audiologist who had fallen in love with Indonesia.They were among the scores of people slaughtered by Islamic extremists in four countries last week in spasms of bloodshed that left loved ones stunned at the randomness of the killings.\u201cIt will never be understood: \u2018Why you?\u2019 No one can give an answer,\u201d observed Andr\u00e9 Franke, a relative of one victim, Karin Franke-D\u00fctz, 70, a retired teacher who was among the Germans killed by a suicide bomber in Istanbul. Mr. Franke summed up a universal anguish in a Facebook post, saying, \u201cIncomprehensible that we lost such a cordial, wonderful person in such a terrible way.\u201dMaude Carrier, 37, a high school French teacher from Quebec and the mother of two girls, was among those killed while sitting in the cafe, a popular spot in downtown Ouagadougou. Also killed were Ms. Carrier\u2019s father, Yves; his wife, Gladys Chamberland; and the couple\u2019s 19-year-old son, all members of an aid mission that was sprucing up schools in Burkina Faso, a former French colony.Some members of the group, most of them educators, had taken two or more trips to Africa coordinated by two organizations in Quebec.On Facebook, Maude Carrier reveled in the experience, posting a photograph of herself beaming as she held aloft an infant (\u201cI found my baby,\u201d she wrote) and a group shot in front of a blackboard with a message that read, \u201cEducation is true freedom!\u201dMs. Chamberland, her stepmother, sought to play down the threat of terrorism in the region. \u201cYour chances of dying because of terrorism is 1 in 116 million,\u201d she wrote on Facebook, adding a reference to the national lottery in Canada: \u201cYou are 10 times more likely to win the 6/49.\u201dSurvivors in Ouagadougou said the militants who attacked the cafe and a nearby hotel had chosen their victims indiscriminately, though they reportedly fired off extra rounds into the bodies of Westerners.Among the dead were Arie Houweling, 67, a Dutch consultant who advised entrepreneurs in Burkina Faso and Niger; and Michael James Riddering, 45, a missionary from Florida who worked at an orphanage outside the capital.\u201cMy best friend, partner in crime and love of my life,\u201d Mr. Riddering\u2019s wife, Amy, wrote on her Facebook page. \u201cThe best husband ever. An amazing father to his children and a papa to everyone.\u201dThe other victims of the attacks carried passports from France, Libya, Portugal and Switzerland. But many of them, like Victoria Yankovsky, a Ukrainian who ran the Cappuccino Cafe, considered themselves global citizens.\u201cTheir employees adored them, and some even followed them to new places, which is quite uncommon in Africa,\u201d said Katerina Zolotaryova, a friend of Ms. Yankovsky\u2019s, who died alongside her husband and 9-year-old son. \u201cIt is a shock because usually terrorists don\u2019t attack such common, average people, who are not connected to politics or anything sensitive.\u201dThe dead also included at least seven citizens of Burkina Faso; among them were Simplice Armel Kinan\u00e9, a firefighter who worked for an air safety organization, and Ahmed K\u00e9r\u00e9, a local coordinator for an American nonprofit group.Mr. Kinan\u00e9, according to his sister, was attending a poolside reception at the Splendid Hotel when attackers set off an explosion outside the building and then stormed inside. She said her brother had been shot as he tried to put out the flames that had engulfed a hotel guest.\u201cHe was generous and supportive to the point of giving his life in exchange,\u201d said the sister, Yolande Kinan\u00e9. \u201cHe was our protector, our defender.\u201dIan Vardy, a Canadian, went on an eight-day trek in August with Mr. K\u00e9r\u00e9, who worked for buildOn, an American nonprofit organization.\u201cHe was like many Burkina Faso people; selfless, kind, eager to convey joy and love,\u201d Mr. Vardy wrote in an email exchange.\u201cThey believe in the concept that we all need each other, because traditionally for years, they have. These are the richest people, and they have no money.\u201dIn Indonesia, the Islamic State militants who set off explosive devices outside a Starbucks in Jakarta on Thursday appeared to be singling out foreigners. Mr. Amer-Ouali, 70, a Canadian citizen born in Algeria, split his time between Montreal and Jakarta, and operated hearing-aid clinics in both places. His brother was among the 22 people wounded in the attack.\u201cHe was helping deaf people,\u201d Mr. Amer-Ouali\u2019s son Farid said on Canadian television, describing his father as an avid mountain climber who had fallen in love with Indonesia. \u201cHe was looking to reach out to people over there, looking for opportunities to try to give them the care they have here.\u201dIn Istanbul, the suicide bomber who waded into the throngs near the Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sophia on Jan. 12 appeared to have chosen a group of German tourists who had arrived in Turkey a day earlier. The Turkish authorities say the attacker, a Syrian in his late 20s, was an Islamic State operative.Most of the 10 people killed in the explosion he set off were middle-class retirees: One had been a butcher, another a teacher, another a construction manager.The dead included a father and son from Dresden: G\u00fcnther H\u00f6ppner, 75, a retired waiter, and Steffen H\u00f6ppner, 51, who worked at a Volkswagen factory. \u201cAll this is so senseless and impossible to comprehend right now,\u201d Petra H\u00f6ppner, Steffen\u2019s wife, said by telephone.\u201cI\u2019m speechless and devastated. My husband took his dad on that trip because my father-in-law was very much interested in historic sites.\u201dIn a Facebook posting, the daughter of Ms. Franke-D\u00fctz, the retired teacher from Leipzig who was also killed in Istanbul, recalled the anxiety she had felt over her mother\u2019s decision to join a tour that would take her to Turkey as well as Dubai and Abu Dhabi, both in the United Arab Emirates.\u201cI had an exchange of messages with my mother until late at night,\u201d the daughter, Birgit Franke, wrote on Facebook.\u201cFinally, I wrote the sentence, \u2018Why do you pick such destinations?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThen I thought about it, erased it and wrote, \u2018Good luck!\u2019 Those were my last words.\u201dAn article on Jan. 20 about victims of terrorist attacks, including one at a hotel and cafe in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, misidentified the organization that employed Ahmed K\u00e9r\u00e9, who was killed in the Burkina Faso assault.

As Ruch and others have said, this publicity-seeking criminal crew\u00c2\u00a0has flouted\u00c2\u00a0the law and disrupted operations at an important federal facility. There are practical considerations, as well. I have a query in to the Fish and Wildlife Service asking what operations and scientific research are being disrupted by this crime and will provide an update.Every one of us has a constitutional right to protest, to speak our minds. But we don\u2019t have a constitutional right to use force and violence and to threaten force and violence on others. And so it is our hope that the protesters there will stand down peaceably, that there will not be a violent confrontation.I would add one more thing to your list of solutions:We met many times over the course of three years and much to everybody\u2019s surprise emerged with a consensus, collaborative approach that includes major initiatives on both the refuge and surrounding ranch lands. It is a plan that tries to respect both the ecology and the economics of the region. The groups involved have remained actively engaged in implementing the plan. It includes one of the largest wetland restoration efforts ever undertaken.On a landscape rife with tremendous challenges, where consensus and collaboration are being accomplished, we need to double down.This should be a call to action for the community, non-governmental stakeholders, and local, state, and especially federal agencies to invest deeply in the Malheur effort. It is a critically important opportunity, but it is fragile and, as current events amply demonstrate, it needs to succeed.The real tragedy would be if these out-of-state self-declared militias were able to leave the impression that Malheur is a flashpoint for conflict, when in fact it should be seen as an incredible opportunity for collaboration for both the ecology and the economy of the region.My hope is that the legacy of this illegal occupation will be a renewed commitment to that collaboration.By NANCY LANGSTONThe West won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be won by ideologues brandishing guns and seizing government property.Updated, Jan. 7, 9:17 a.m. | I for one am a westerner sick to death of you welfare queens and cheats living off of BLM land, illegally gutting our wilderness and our wildlife.

They cornered one protester and started beating him.Thousands of police officers patrolled the streets of Cairo and public squares, and a crackdown by security forces leading up to Monday\u2019s anniversary saw civil society activists rounded up, art houses closed and the administrators of opposition Facebook pages detained.The efforts seemed unnecessary: Since 2013, tens of thousands of Egyptians have been jailed, including journalists and secular activists; the leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood is in exile or in prison; and many ordinary Egyptians say they are too weary, or fearful, to take to the streets again.Several people said that, after years of wrenching political turmoil, they were grateful for the stability that Mr. Sisi had brought. \u201cWe were sad about the destruction that was taking place,\u201d said Sawsan Hasan, a grandmother who traveled 140 miles from Minya, south of Cairo, to the capital with eight of her family members. \u201cThings are starting to get better.\u201dOther Egyptians in Tahrir Square noted the chaos shaking Arab countries like Syria and neighboring Libya, and railed against perceived Western meddling in Egypt. Several people accused President Obama of secretly supporting the Muslim Brotherhood \u2014 a claim that is frequently aired on Egyptian television.(Western human rights groups, for their part, say the Obama administration is too indulgent of Mr. Sisi, and the United States should use the $1.3 billion in annual aid to Egypt to encourage political reforms.)On the fringes of the Tahrir crowd, a small, quiet group had assembled not to celebrate or protest, but to commemorate the bitter disappointments of the 2011 uprising. \u201cI left my flag at home because the demands of the revolution have not been met,\u201d said a man who could only identify himself as Bakr before the police moved him along.Despite the government\u2019s anxiety, the anniversary on Monday passed largely without serious violence. Local news media reported that two people had been killed by security forces in a raid on an apartment in a Cairo. Across the country, police broke up several small protests, mostly led by the Muslim Brotherhood, and officials said they had defused a bomb in the port city of Alexandria.Five years after the protests that ended his three-decade long rule, Mr. Mubarak remained in his hospital room at the Maadi Military hospital in a Cairo suburb. The legal basis for his stay there is unclear, with him having completed a three-year prison sentence.Political analysts say Mr. Mubarak\u2019s release could embarrass Mr. Sisi, but the president\u2019s most immediate challenges are economic. Egypt\u2019s weak economy is suffering from inflation, high unemployment and a declining tourist sector crippled by attacks from Islamist insurgents.By midafternoon Monday in Tahrir Square, the police had decided that they had enough and, forming a human chain, they gently cleared the square by calling out in Arabic \u201cYalla\u201d \u2014 \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dAmina Ismail contributed reportingAdvertisement"}

Trump returns to Iowa on Tuesday amid a deepening faith-focused feud with Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Mr. Trump said at a town-hall-style event in Concord, N.H., on Monday that he would receive a big endorsement on Tuesday. Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aides declined to say whom it would be from, and said that additional endorsements would follow as he makes his final push in Iowa and New Hampshire. Among other events on Tuesday, Mr. Trump will appear at a summit meeting hosted by groups supporting renewable fuels, which include ethanol, a corn-based substance. He has criticized Mr. Cruz for inconsistent views on supporting renewable fuel standards. Mr. Trump is locked in a battle for conservative voters with Mr. Cruz. They have been wielding the rhetorical blade against each other since the Republican presidential debate last week, when Mr. Cruz arched an eyebrow at Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cNew York values\u00e2\u0080\u009d and suggested that his rival was attacking him only because the polls had tightened.

It seems unlikely that Mr. Trump is going to let up: He rarely does once he has trained his sights on a rival.

What\u2019s In a Gender Pronoun", "Date": "2016-01-30", "News": "Supported byCommand ZWASHINGTON \u2014 What happens when 334 linguists, lexicographers, grammarians and etymologists gather in a stuffy lecture hall on a Friday night to debate the lexical trends of the year?They become the unlikely heroes of the new gender revolution.\u201cFunction words don\u2019t get enough love,\u201d a man argued from the floor. (Function words, I would later learn, are words that have little lexical meaning but serve to connect other words \u2014 or \u201cthe basic building blocks in language,\u201d according to Ben Zimmer, the event\u2019s M.C.)\u201cWe need to accept \u2018they,\u2019 and we need to do it now,\u201d shouted another linguist, hidden behind the crowds.\u201cAs a gender neutral pronoun, \u2018they\u2019 has been useful for a long time,\u201d said Anne Curzan, an English professor at the University of Michigan. ( \u201cThey\u201d can be found in the works of literary greats like Chaucer and Jane Austen.) \u201cBut I think we\u2019ve seen a lot of attention this year to people who are identifying out of the gender binary.\u201dGender binary: That\u2019s the idea that there are two distinct genders, one male and one female, with nothing in between.\u201cI think we, and particularly young people, increasingly view gender not as a given, but as a choice, not as a distinction between male and female, but as a spectrum, regardless of what\u2019s \u2018down there,\u2019\u201d said Julie Mencher, a psychotherapist in Northampton, Mass., who conducts school workshops on how to support transgender students. \u201cMany claim that gender doesn\u2019t even exist.\u201dIt does exist when it comes to language, though. He, she, hers, his, male, female \u2014 there\u2019s not much in between. And so has emerged a new vocabulary, of sorts: an attempt to solve the challenge of talking about someone who identifies as neither male nor female (and, inevitably, the linguistic confusion that comes along with it).These days, on college campuses, stating a gender pronoun has become practically as routine as listing a major. \u201cSo it\u2019s like: \u2018Hi, I\u2019m Evie. My pronouns are she/her/hers. My major is X,\u2019\u201d said Evie Zavidow, a junior at Barnard.Those are just the pronouns, of course.To use them, you need to have at least some knowledge of the identities to which they correspond \u2014 beginning with an understanding of the word \u201cidentity,\u201d along with its sister verb, \u201cidentify\u201d (as in: \u201cI identify as female\u201d or \u201cI identify as mixed-race\u201d).Among the additional words and terms the dictionary was updating for the year ahead: \u201ccode-switching,\u201d or modifying of one\u2019s behavior to adapt to different sociocultural norms; \u201csapiosexual,\u201d for a person who finds intelligence the most sexually attractive feature; and \u201cgender expression,\u201d or an expression of one\u2019s gender identity.\u201cIt\u2019s like the hyper-individuation of identity,\u201d said Micah Fitzerman-Blue, a writer and producer on \u201cTransparent,\u201d who calls himself cisgender (\u201ccis\u201d for short), meaning he identifies with the sex (male) he was assigned at birth (or A.A.B.). \u201cIs there such a thing as too many pronouns? Possibly. But who am I to pick and choose? Language has a way of sorting this stuff out.\u201dDoes it, though?In the second-to-last episode of last season\u2019s \u201cTransparent,\u201d there was a blip of a scene that perhaps crystallized this moment in time: Ali, played by Gaby Hoffmann, stood in front of a bulletin board in the gender studies department of a university campus, waiting to speak with a professor. Tacked to the wall was a flier illustrated with a pair of boxing gloves. \u201cGender Pronoun Showdown!\u201d it declared.It was prescient.And yet the learning curve remains.As for the pronouns: \u201cThey\u201d may or may not correspond with these identities \u2014 which is why it\u2019s in anybody\u2019s best interest to simply ask. But when you do, don\u2019t make the common mistake of calling it a preferred pronoun \u2014 as it is not considered to be \u201cpreferred.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not intuitive at all,\u201d her girlfriend, the lesbian poet Eileen Myles, said in the article.\u201cI think there are a lot of people who want to do the right thing but are struggling to play catch-up with this new gender revolution,\u201d said Ms. Mencher, a former transgender specialist at Smith College, which is one of a handful of historically women\u2019s colleges to begin accepting transgender students.\u201cI begin all my trainings with an invitation for participants to stumble over language, to risk being politically incorrect, to bungle their pronouns \u2014 in the service of learning,\u201d Ms. Mencher said.\u201cWhether it\u2019s the feminist movement of the 1970s or expressions of non-binary gender identities today,\u201d said Mr. Zimmer of the American Dialect Society, \u201csocial changes can help power these changes.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In an interview with MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, said that he had heard from other candidates \u201cproactively\u201d about attending the event that Mr. Trump will hold at Drake University at the same time as the debate. Mr. Trump announced on Tuesday afternoon that he would skip the final debate before the Iowa caucuses, after Fox News officials issued a mocking statement about him following a day of escalating attacks. Mr. Trump had earlier said he would participate only if the moderator Megyn Kelly, with whom he clashed at the first G.O.P. debate last August, was removed. Mr. Lewandowski did not specify who he meant.

{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders and President Obama to Meet in Oval Office Wednesday", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 President Obama will meet in the Oval Office on Wednesday with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, offering presidential face-time just days before voting in the presidential campaign begins next week, White House officials said Tuesday evening.A statement by Mr. Obama\u2019s spokesman said there would be \u201cno formal agenda\u201d for the meeting between the two men. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said that Mr. Obama and Mr. Sanders first discussed a meeting when the Democratic candidate attended the Congressional Holiday Ball at the White House in December.But the White House meeting for Mr. Sanders comes at a critical time, as he seeks to defeat Hillary Clinton, the president\u2019s former secretary of state, in the Iowa caucuses on Monday.Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton have met several times in the last year, most recently during a private luncheon at the White House last month. But administration officials had struggled to say when Mr. Obama last met one-on-one with Mr. Sanders. In an interview with Chuck Todd on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d this month, Denis McDonough, the White House chief of staff, asserted that the president \u201cmeets with all of our senators, including Senator Sanders,\u201d but declined to say specifically when the last meeting had been.\u201cYou know, I haven\u2019t racked them up, Chuck, on how many \u00e2\u0080\u0094 on how many times he\u2019s seen who \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but he has seen Senator Sanders, both with the Senate Democratic Caucus and privately,\u201d Mr. McDonough said.The president has said he remains neutral in the Democratic primary contest, even as he has repeatedly expressed great admiration for Mrs. Clinton, whom he defeated in 2008 and then selected as his top diplomat.In an interview with Politico over the weekend, Mr. Obama again heaped praise on Mrs. Clinton, calling her \u201cmore experienced than any non-vice-president has ever been who aspires to this office.\u201dHe praised Mr. Sanders in the interview, too, saying that the Vermont senator was \u201cjust letting loose\u201d because he entered the race with few expectations about how he would fare against Mrs. Clinton.But some people interpreted the Politico interview as an attempt by Mr. Obama to tilt the scales in favor of Mrs. Clinton, in part because of the language he used to describe her. He called her a \u201cgood, smart, tough person who cares deeply about this country\u201d and said that Mr. Sanders\u2019s success was in part a result of the fact that so few people knew about him before this race.\u201cYou\u2019re always looking at the bright, shiny object that people don\u2019t, haven\u2019t seen before. That\u2019s a disadvantage to her,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cBernie is somebody who \u00e2\u0080\u0094 although I don\u2019t know as well because he wasn\u2019t, obviously, in my administration \u00e2\u0080\u0094 has the virtue of saying exactly what he believes, and great authenticity, great passion, and is fearless. His attitude is, \u2018I got nothing to lose.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u200a\u201dJeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign manager, declined to say what topics Mr. Sanders and President Obama would discuss.\u201cThis is not about the campaign,\u201d Mr. Weaver said. \u201cThis is about the senator talking with the president about important issues facing the country.\u201d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "A Woman on the $10 Bill, and Everyone Has 2 Cents to Put In", "Date": "2016-01-26", "News": "Supported bySeveral million people have responded since Mr. Lew issued an unprecedented invitation to the public last June to help redesign the nation\u2019s cash. His question: Which woman from American history should be chosen as the first on paper currency since Martha Washington briefly graced the $1 silver certificate in the late 19th century?The outpouring of responses about the forthcoming redesign of the $10 bill has surprised administration officials both by its numbers and by the volume of unanticipated complaints, forcing Mr. Lew to miss his self-imposed December deadline for an announcement and leaving unclear when he will decide.\u201cI think it took us all by surprise just how much interest there really was,\u201d Rosie Rios, the treasurer of the United States, said in an interview.Mr. Lew intended to inspire a national conversation about women\u2019s contributions to the nation and to generate ideas for new symbols to reflect democracy on currency \u2014 \u201cto make a statement about who we are and what we stand for,\u201d as he said.What he got besides was something of a tempest that included reflections about the worth of women and about the relative merits of two particular men, Alexander Hamilton, a founding father, and President Andrew Jackson, whose portraits are on the $10 and $20 notes. The comments showed Jackson to be as reviled as Hamilton is revered, reviving an argument that the $20 bill should be redesigned before the $10 noteAll of this simmers as Mr. Lew is preoccupied with more typical matters for a Treasury secretary. In the last week he was in Puerto Rico to deal with its debt crisis, then in Davos, Switzerland, for the annual World Economic Forum.Yet the issue of how the $10 bill looks could well be the one for which he is best remembered.By law, the honoree must be dead. Surveys from advocacy groups and social media postings suggest that the contenders include the abolitionist Harriet Tubman, the suffragist Susan B. Anthony, the civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks and Eleanor Roosevelt, the reformist first lady, who was a member of the first United States delegation to the United Nations.The problem for the critics is not the administration\u2019s idea of choosing a woman \u2014 with the exception of a few respondents, like the man who posted on Twitter that he would demand \u201ctwo fives\u201d if ever handed a $10 note featuring a woman. Rather, the common gripe is that the $20 bill was not chosen instead of the $10 bill for a woman\u2019s portrait.To the bureaucrats, the choice of the 10 was natural and justifiable. For security reasons, the $10 bill was recommended for revision in 2012 by the Advanced Counterfeit Deterrence committee that is led by Ms. Rios and has representatives from the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, the Secret Service and the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.So the $10 note became the vehicle for an administration eager to make a historic statement about women before President Obama leaves office. Despite the complaints, officials say, they cannot switch bills.Yet they might have better anticipated the blowback, critics say.Barbara Ortiz Howard, the founder of Women On 20s, was at Mr. Lew\u2019s announcement last June. \u201cThey were all excited with their plan, and we had some cautions,\u201d she said. \u201cWe thought there might be some issues with it \u2014 like the fact that it\u2019s not the 20.\u201dThe bigger issue, however, turned out to be Hamilton versus Jackson. Many respondents asked: Why displace Hamilton, the first Treasury secretary and the architect of the American financial system, rather than eject Jackson from the $20 bill given his record of violence against Native Americans and opposition to national banking?Treasury\u2019s initial assurance that Hamilton would somehow remain on the $10 bill, presumably as a secondary figure, only provoked more objections. \u201cIf she is worthy of being on a bill, she is worthy of not sharing it,\u201d a woman wrote on The New York Times\u2019s Facebook page.Just last week, Senator James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, a state that is 9 percent Native American, sponsored a resolution calling for Jackson to be replaced by a woman because of Jackson\u2019s \u201cpolicies that forced thousands of American Indians off their ancestral homelands.\u201dA group called the Alexander Hamilton Awareness Society began a social media campaign to #SaveHamilton on the $10 note. Rand Scholet, the group\u2019s founder, said in an interview that while Treasury\u2019s initiative \u201cis very laudable,\u201d the reaction among Hamiltonians is, \u201cHow can a current secretary of Treasury displace or diminish the first secretary of Treasury?\u201dWomen On 20s has proposed a compromise, supported by NOW, to keep Hamilton alongside a woman chosen by Treasury and change the opposite side of the $10 bill, replacing the image of the Treasury building with a vignette of nearly a dozen female historical figures.\u201cThat\u2019s not in lieu of having the prime territory, which is the portrait side,\u201d Ms. Howard said. A woman\u2019s portrait could replace Jackson\u2019s the next time the $20 note is redesigned, she said.Treasury officials continue to promote the $10 redesign, however. Besides relying on social media, emails and letters, Mr. Lew and Ms. Rios have held town hall meetings around the country and round tables with interested groups, including historians. Ms. Rios has mingled among tourists at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing\u2019s \u201cmoney factories\u201d here and in Fort Worth soliciting opinions from scores at a time.\u201cIt\u2019s to their credit that they\u2019ve opened themselves up to all this dialogue,\u201d Ms. Howard said.Bank notes, and the portraits on them, have not changed significantly since 1929. But in the 1990s the government began routinely redesigning each denomination in turn to stay ahead of counterfeiters \u2014 a process of technological research, testing and production that takes years for each note.Mr. Lew will announce his decision \u201cin the near future,\u201d Ms. Rios said, but the new note will not go into circulation until 2020 because of the complexities of producing the anticounterfeiting features. Further complicating the process, as a consequence of a 2008 court order, the $10 bill will also be the first to include a raised tactile feature so that people with visual impairments can readily identify it.A rollout in 2020, not coincidentally, would be just in time for the centennial of the ratification of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote.An article on Wednesday about redesigning the $10 bill and putting a woman\u2019s portrait on the front misstated how Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, came to introduce legislation to put a woman on the $20 bill. She learned about Women on 20s and its advocacy for the portrait change through social media; she was not contacted directly by the group.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Confronts Bernie Sanders as Polls Show Her Lead in Iowa Narrowing", "Date": "2016-01-11", "News": "WATERLOO, Iowa \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Facing new pressure from Senator Bernie Sanders in Iowa, Hillary Clinton confronted him in direct terms on Monday, warning Iowans that if elected president, he would put their health insurance in the hands of Republican governors and raise taxes on the middle class.Sharpening her tone as new polling suggested that Mr. Sanders was closing in on her in the state, Mrs. Clinton assailed Mr. Sanders by name, telling 300 people on a frigid and snowy day here, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time for us to have the kind of spirited debate that you deserve for us to have.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re so much better than the Republicans,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut we do have differences and you deserve to know what those differences are.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMrs. Clinton also looked to repel criticism from Mr. Sanders that she is a patron of the rich, unveiling a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfair share surcharge\u00e2\u0080\u009d that would impose a new tax on people who earn more than $5 million a year. Her campaign estimated that raising the income tax on the wealthy by 4 percentage points would generate $150 billion in revenues over 10 years.On health care, Mrs. Clinton said that she wanted to build upon the Affordable Care Act, while Mr. Sanders wanted to scrap it in favor of a universal health plan that would empower the states \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and potentially Republican governors, who she has said cannot be trusted. This, along with the other progressive policies of Mr. Sanders, who represents Vermont, would require raising taxes on more than just the rich, she argued.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no way, if you do the arithmetic, to pay for what he has proposed without raising taxes on the middle class,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where he and I part ways.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHer remarks came a day after a new poll showed Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lead in Iowa narrowing to three percentage points over Mr. Sanders. Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign is counting on a victory here in the caucuses on Feb. 1 because the next contest is eight days later in New Hampshire, where Mr. Sanders has held a durable lead in polls.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI feel really good about where we are, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not taking anything for granted,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton said. Her comments on Monday echoed the language she used in December 2007 when she told reporters in Cedar Rapids that \u00e2\u0080\u009cnow the fun part starts\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a promise to make clear to Iowans the deficiencies of Barack Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policies. She placed third in the Iowa caucuses, which Mr. Obama won.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re into the last month, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to start drawing the contrasts, because I want every Iowan to have accurate information when they make their decisions,\u201d she said at the time.Mr. Sanders also campaigned in Iowa on Monday, similarly pressing an economic argument in trying to coax voters out to support him on caucus day. Speaking to reporters in Pleasantville, he said that Mrs. Clinton was attacking him because of polls that showed he was gaining support \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and that she was realizing she could lose.\u00e2\u0080\u009cSecretary Clinton and her campaign now know that she is in serious trouble,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd, I think a candidate who was originally thought to be the anointed candidate, to be the inevitable candidate, is now locked in a very difficult race here in Iowa and in New Hampshire. Obviously, in that scenario, what people do is start attacking.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Sanders highlighted how he has called for increasing Social Security benefits, and would pay for it by raising the cap on income that is eligible for taxation to finance the program. That way, the wealthy would pay more into the system.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn 2008, as I recall, President Obama introduced very similar-type legislation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said of his Social Security bill. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat legislation was then opposed by Senator Clinton, who was running against him. I would hope that now in the year 2016, when so many of our seniors and disabled vets are struggling, that Secretary Clinton will join me in demanding that we raise the cap on taxable income, that we expand benefits for our seniors and our disabled vets, and that we extend the life of Social Security for 50 years.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe issue, he added, was \u201crelatively new for Hillary,\u201d but added that she had \u201ccome forward with some really thoughtful approaches.\u201dMrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pointed remarks \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the sparring between the candidates \u00e2\u0080\u0094 suggested that the Democratic presidential debate on Sunday could take a sharper tone than the previous ones, which were largely cordial affairs.Mrs. Clinton said legislation that Bernie Sanders supported in 2005 forbids all lawsuits against gun makers and sellers.But Mrs. Clinton is overstating the breadth of the law. Though its protections are quite expansive, the law specifies six exceptions to the prohibition on civil actions. For example, a victim can sue a dealer who has been convicted of selling a firearm knowing that it would be used to commit a violent crime.Suits are also allowed in matters involving injuries or property damage resulting from manufacturing or design defects, as long as the firearm in question was not used in a criminal act. Another exception allows lawsuits when a gun maker or seller \u00e2\u0080\u009cknowingly violated a state or federal statute applicable to the sale or marketing of the product.\u00e2\u0080\u009d These exceptions are narrow, and they do provide broad protections to the gun industry, as Mrs. Clinton suggests. Whether the exceptions would ultimately prove meaningful was a subject of debate when Congress passed the legislation in 2005. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe aim of this bill is clear: to allow legitimate lawsuits against a manufacturer when the legal principles to do so are present,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, said at the time.Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, took the opposite view: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese exceptions in the bill have been carefully crafted to prevent lawsuits, not to enable appropriate lawsuits to go forward.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Lytton, the law professor, said the law \"pretty much shut down attempts to use the court system in a broad way to try to push for greater industry self-regulation of marketing and distribution of firearms.\"But the exceptions have not put a complete halt to litigation.How courts interpret the exceptions is still unfolding, and lawyers have tried to craft lawsuits that could meet their criteria. As one example, families of some of the victims of the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., are suing Remington Outdoor, the maker of the Bushmaster rifle used in the shooting, among other defendants. The families are arguing that the gun maker knew, or should have known, that selling assault rifles to civilians \u00e2\u0080\u009cposed an unreasonable and egregious risk of physical injury,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that its conduct violated the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act.Remington Outdoor is seeking the suit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dismissal. The 2005 law, it said in court papers last month, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas enacted to protect firearm manufacturers against the very claims plaintiffs make in this case.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Thomas KaplanShe also used her visit to Waterloo to press a recurring theme of recent days, calling Mr. Sanders weak on gun control. She pointed to his vote in 2005, as a member of the House, for a bill limiting the liability of gun makers and sellers. She also embraced President Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent executive actions on guns. The crowd at the Electric Park Ballroom in Waterloo cheered Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arrival and gathered around her to take selfies after she spoke. However, many in the audience said that they remained undecided and that they were hoping that seeing her in person might help them choose.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no dislike for her or anything like that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Floyd Bumper, 32, of Waterloo. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my second choice.\u00e2\u0080\u009dYamiche Alcindor contributed reporting from Pleasantville, Iowa.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "In India, Dispensers of Balm Travel to Death\u2019s Door", "Date": "2016-01-12", "News": "A white van coursed through narrow roads along the monsoon-soaked coastline of Kerala, a state in southwestern India. Inside, Radha Upasarna, a volunteer, and two nurses looked over the roster of patients they would visit, most of whom had cancer or heart disease or were paraplegic.As they bumped along through the area\u2019s villages, the women shared snacks, stopped for roadside chai, and sang film songs in Malayalam, Kerala\u00e2\u0080\u0099s official language. Around midday the van parked outside a whitewashed home where four out of the five members of the family there were chronically or terminally ill. As they did at each home, Upasarna and the nurses quickly got to work: they checked for bedsores, filled prescriptions, delivered kits of lentils and rice, and often just listened to stories.Upasarna, a tiny woman wrapped in a cotton sari, sat at Karathattya\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bedside, holding his hand and assessing his pain. Working with a nonprofit in the Ernakulum district called Apium, she is one of 15,000 volunteers in Kerala who assist a network of physicians and nurses in extending palliative care to tens of thousands of people who are incurably ill, bedridden or nearing the end of their lives. Upasarna said this work was not only a service to her community, but a way to overcome the loneliness she experienced after her husband died last year.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel like work,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just something I want to do.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn Kerala, it has taken a generation to make that conversation, and palliative care, a household norm and a government priority, according to Dr. Anil Paleri, director of the Institute of Palliative Medicine, a medical and training organization in northern Kerala.\u00e2\u0080\u009cSuffering is the common denominator,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut this way, the community has a tool in their hands.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe movement in Kerala gained steam in the 1990s. Inspired by Dr. Lucito Desouza, a cancer surgeon in Mumbai who introduced hospice care to India in 1986, two doctors, M.R. Rajagopal and Suresh Kumar, teamed up with an activist friend, Asoka Kumar, with the goal of spreading knowledge and practices about that kind of care across Kerala, where more than 33 million people live \u00e2\u0080\u0093 nearly half of them in urban areas, and the rest in 1,400 villages.Kerala had an advantage: The state has a long history of community organizing and unionism. (One of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earliest democratically elected Communist governments was in Kerala). It also has the highest literacy rate in India. Paleri, who has worked in the movement for almost a quarter-century, said Kerala\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history made it easier to start at the village level and trickle up to the government.Offering palliative care \u00e2\u0080\u009chad gained momentum as a social movement,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was hard for the government not to notice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d By contrast, the state of Maharashtra, where officials began efforts to spread palliative care 20 years ago, has seen much slower progress, according to Dr. Mary Ann Muckaden, who directs the palliative care program at the Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai.\u00e2\u0080\u009cKerala\u2019s model is now setting national standards,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Kamalakannan Ellangovan, the principal secretary of health for the state government. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will be strengthening these programs, not only through the elected local bodies, but also some of the well-known NGOs like Pallium India.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn the early years, however, an important piece to the policy puzzle had not fallen into place. Morphine, an opioid used to manage pain, has been highly restricted in India since 1985. Most states still require a specially trained doctor to distribute the drug \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a big obstacle to widespread care, given India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shortage of doctors.The difference between states is now stark: Lotika Rajuwal, 34, is struggling with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and a harsh regimen of chemotherapy. But she can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get morphine for the pain because she lives in West Bengal, rather than Kerala. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m in pain, I feel hopeless,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEspecially in the night, the pain is unbearable.\u00e2\u0080\u009dRead previous contributions to this series.As the Apium van made its way along the Ernakulum coast in Kerala, Upasarna and the nurses monitored the morphine doses for patients struggling with paraplegia or chemotherapy treatments. Alikoya Karathattya, who has gone through six rounds of chemotherapy, said morphine allowed him to sleep at night.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not as tense as before,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have hope, so I keep moving forward.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe sad part is that despite growing awareness, we have not made much progress in terms of the number of people actually getting palliative care in the last 10 years,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rajagopal said.As an example for makers of national policy, however, Kerala\u00e2\u0080\u0099s model has been gaining traction. In 2012, the government of India issued a policy paper urging states to develop palliative care programs, according to Dr. Sudhir Gupta, a director at the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare in New Delhi.

To make it a bit easier, you can keep a digital journal or diary with you wherever you go, and many are set up to encourage people to keep typing away day after day.You can tag photos with people\u2019s names or a location, and then browse back through the diary entries to see all the posts associated with that person or place. You can also search entries to locate a keyword.Momento is easy to use and offers plenty of on-screen guidance to help manage its more complicated features (such as backing up diary entries to iCloud). The app can automatically prompt you to write a diary entry, and you can set up several reminders, each with its own prompt, like \u201cTake a daily photo.\u201dYou can share entries with family and friends by iMessage or in an email, or even share online with a bigger audience on Facebook or elsewhere.Writing an entry in Askt is straightforward: It has a large empty page where you can type and embed photographs. To look back through your writing, either swipe through the app\u2019s pages (which are animated to resemble real pages being turned in a paper diary) or tap on the date to choose a specific day in the past. There is no search feature.The bells and whistles in this app are limited to setting a daily reminder, choosing the color scheme and exporting entries to a PDF file. I like this simplicity, which keeps my mind focused on the journal-writing task. Although Amazon offers the app free for Android devices, that version is supported by ads, and some features, like photo embedding, are disabled. Enabling the full set of features requires an in-app purchase.Perhaps the best-known journal-writing app for iOS devices is Day One.

When you have written about your day, you can choose to make the post available as a webpage. \u201cPublishing\u201d journal entries like this may be useful if, for example, you are keeping your family updated while traveling. Of course you can choose to keep your diary entries private and unpublished \u2014 even locked safely out of view behind a passcode if you prefer.Day One has a clean, minimalist interface and is relatively easy to use. However, I found the app\u2019s many features distracting as I tried to get my thoughts about the day out of my head and onto the page.But it has a few quirks, such as allowing only one photo per diary entry. And while the app is free, you have to make a $6 in-app purchase if you want to export your journal.

La palabra imposible para ti no existe\u201d.Y con eso, y algunas palabras de Zidane, la conferencia de prensa termin\u00f3. No hubo espacio para preguntas, pero s\u00ed se permiti\u00f3 a los fot\u00f3grafos que retrataran a la familia de Zidane, su esposa V\u00e9ronique y sus cuatro hijos.El martes, el primer d\u00eda de trabajo de Zidane como t\u00e9cnico, dirigi\u00f3 su primer entrenamiento a puertas abiertas para el p\u00fablico y los cerca de 80.000 socios que, en teor\u00eda, son propietarios del club.La sucesi\u00f3n comenz\u00f3 a cocinarse desde que Ben\u00edtez asumi\u00f3 el cargo en junio como reemplazo de Carlo Ancelotti. Hab\u00eda indicios de problemas en el vestuario, pero los resultados \u2013en particular, la humillante derrota 0-4 frente al Barcelona en el Santiago Bernab\u00e9u en noviembre\u2013 agravaron la inestable situaci\u00f3n de Ben\u00edtez.Perder frente al Barcelona ya es malo de por s\u00ed. Pero la derrota en el Cl\u00e1sico con semejante marcador, frente a un Bar\u00e7a en el que Messi apenas hizo una breve aparici\u00f3n tras una lesi\u00f3n, llev\u00f3 a que la afici\u00f3n sacara los pa\u00f1uelos, el peor mensaje de desaprobaci\u00f3n para los madridistas.P\u00e9rez pidi\u00f3 calma y paciencia. Despu\u00e9s de todo, \u201cRafa\u201d llevaba en el cargo apenas la mitad de la temporada.Pero la derrota 1-0 frente al Villarreal y el empate 2-2 con el Valencia apresuraron su despido, que termin\u00f3 con un arreglo de 10 millones de d\u00f3lares.\u201cTenemos al mejor club del mundo y la mejor afici\u00f3n del mundo\u201d, coment\u00f3 Zidane. \u201cTengo un poco de emoci\u00f3n, m\u00e1s que cuando firm\u00e9 como jugador. Lo que hay que hacer ahora es que este equipo gane un trofeo a final de temporada\u201d.Eso es la m\u00ednima exigencia. El Barcelona gan\u00f3 cinco trofeos en 2015, y el nombramiento de Zidane es, en cierta medida, el equivalente madridista al \u201cmomento Guardiola\u201d: una respuesta a cuando el club catal\u00e1n nombr\u00f3 como entrenador en 2008 a Pep Guardiola, un exjugador.El equipo de Guardiola gan\u00f3 todos los trofeos posibles y lo hizo con un estilo que hasta produce envidia en el Madrid.El Madrid tambi\u00e9n ha convertido a exjugadores en entrenadores en el pasado, como Miguel Mu\u00f1oz, Luis Molowny, Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano y Vicente Del Bosque.Di St\u00e9fano es una referencia para la familia del actual presidente del Real Madrid. El padre de Florentino P\u00e9rez, un miembro vitalicio del cub, sol\u00eda bromear con su hijo sobre que Zidane, la mayor estrella de la era gal\u00e1ctica, jam\u00e1s podr\u00eda seguir los pasos del gran Alfredo.La opini\u00f3n siempre ser\u00e1 objetiva. Zidane, o Zizou, lo hizo bastante bien y coron\u00f3 sus cinco a\u00f1os en el Bernab\u00e9u con uno de los goles m\u00e1s espectaculares en la historia del f\u00fatbol: una volea de zurda durante el triunfo del Real Madrid en la final de Champions de 2002 frente al Bayer Leverkusen.Pero los grandes jugadores no son siempre los mejores entrenadores. Zidane demostr\u00f3 habilidades extraordinarias para el liderazgo en el campo, pero en ocasiones un futbolista que hace jugadas magn\u00edficas por instinto no es la mejor persona para ense\u00f1ar a los mortales las artes del juego.Las habilidades de Zidane en el campo siempre han sido hipn\u00f3ticas, desde el d\u00eda en que fue descubierto en los suburbios de Marsella entre otros ni\u00f1os franceses de ascendencia argelina.Zidane es reconocido, con muy buenas razones, como uno de los mejores atletas musulmanes de todos los tiempos, junto con Mohammed Ali, Kareem Abdul Jabar y la estrella de cricket paquistan\u00ed Imran Khan.Un hombre de familia con una personalidad discreta y suave, Zidane fue la inspiraci\u00f3n de la selecci\u00f3n francesa que gan\u00f3 la Copa del Mundo en 1998, pero se convirti\u00f3 en el villano del campeonato de 2006, cuando en la final fue expulsado tras propinar un cabezazo en el pecho al defensa italiano Marco Materazzi.Una escultura de ese cabezazo, hecha en bronce y expuesta en Par\u00eds y despu\u00e9s en Doha (Qatar), se convirti\u00f3 en un s\u00edmbolo del casi escondido Zidane, un caballero hasta que cay\u00f3 provocado por los insultos. Pod\u00eda soportar patadas y m\u00e1s tarde humillar a su oponente con sus brillantes movimientos y su talento. Pero el insulto de Materazzi consigui\u00f3 sacar la rabia enterrada en la callada dignidad del futbolista.P\u00e9rez nunca ha jugado en el campo, es un empresario de la construcci\u00f3n en Madrid, pero ha sido dos veces presidente del Real Madrid y se ha convertido en un buscador de estrellas para el equipo. Ha elegido tantas como el dinero ha podido comprar y ha contratado a numerosos entrenadores con la esperanza de hallar alguno que pueda sacar el m\u00e1ximo provecho de los talentos que consigue la amplia billetera del Madrid.La supuesta \u201cpol\u00edtica gal\u00e1ctica\u201d de Florentino P\u00e9rez tiene el mismo reto que se ha visto en cualquier equipo o deporte: tiene talentos por doquier, pero necesita un entrenador que consiga consolidar el equipo.Ben\u00edtez tuvo 18 partidos de liga para implantar su filosof\u00eda. Gan\u00f3 11, empat\u00f3 cuatro, perdi\u00f3 tres y se convirti\u00f3 en el und\u00e9cimo entrenador despedido por P\u00e9rez en los \u00faltimos 12 a\u00f1os.La era de Zidane comienza este domingo.

The bride\u2019s hairdresser, Kerry-Lou Brehm, who lives in New Jersey, slept in her Manhattan salon on Friday night so she could make it Saturday morning. And David Gilman, a judicial hearing officer in the Bronx, signed on at the 11th hour to lead the Battery Gardens ceremony.By the time they all walked in, the centerpieces were ready, the wedding canopy was almost up and the cupcake tower \u2014 complete with vanilla, chocolate, carrot cake and red velvet \u2014 had arrived from Long Island.The bridesmaids and groomsmen also soon appeared, albeit in snow boots and heavy jackets, but only half the guests were able to make it.\u201cThe people who didn\u2019t show up were mostly from New Jersey, Long Island and Westchester,\u201d Ms. Schneider said. \u201cThe people who were from farther away were more able to get there because they had flown in Thursday or Friday.\u201d\u201cBut this was our wedding,\u201d said the bride, who stood bare-shouldered in the snow while Ms. Pooviriyakul snapped away. \u201cIt was more intimate than expected, and it made it even more special.\u201dAfter the reception, the bride trekked through the snow in her floor-length wedding dress to get to the after-party down the street.

{"Headline": "Alphabet Close to Overtaking Apple as Most Valuable Company", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsAlphabet could soon become the most valuable company in the world.The Google powerhouse traded on Friday morning with an equity value above $500 billion, less than 10 percent shy of Apple\u2019s value. Investors value the search firm\u2019s earnings from rapidly growing digital advertising more than twice as highly as Apple\u2019s in a saturating smartphone market. Wall Street, however, may be overlooking Alphabet\u2019s risks.Global smartphone sales growth slowed to 10 percent last year, according to the consulting firm IDC. Reports of cutbacks at Apple suppliers suggest tepid demand for its latest phones. Analysts fear that the company may struggle this year to match the 230 million or so iPhones sold in the last fiscal year to September.An oversupplied market could bring price wars, which could hurt margins \u2014 and the iPhone accounts for about 60 percent of Apple\u2019s revenue and a bigger chunk of its profit. As a result, investors expect little growth in the company\u2019s top line this year and are paying only about 10 times estimated 2016 earnings for the stock.The mobile digital advertising market, meanwhile, should almost triple to nearly $200 billion globally by 2019, consultants at eMarketer reckon. Alphabet\u2019s sales are forecast to grow about 15 percent this year. This wind at Alphabet\u2019s back and the possibility that its self-driving cars, robots or medical endeavors will pay off help explain why it commands a price-to-earnings multiple above 20.A subpar earnings report from Apple next week, or a strong one from Alphabet the week after, could bring a new name to the top of the world\u2019s most valuable companies list.Investors are, however, prone to overconfidence in technology trends. Facebook is snagging more and more ad dollars. European antitrust authorities are circling. Moreover, some of Alphabet\u2019s revenue comes courtesy of iPhone users: it cost Google $1 billion in 2014 to keep its search bar on the Apple device, Bloomberg reports based on transcripts of a court case.Alphabet is far more reliant on Internet advertising than Apple is on the iPhone. Ads bring in about 90 percent of the company\u2019s revenue. Any hint of investor skepticism about that market could keep Apple at the top of the list.Advertisement"}

I\u2019ve got to say, I love earnings season. It\u2019s the one time we get a peek at some of the actual numbers that are often hidden in the murk of Silicon Valley puffery. And this week brought some big reversals.I wonder if we\u2019re witnessing what could be a long-term shift in Wall Street\u2019s attitude toward Jeff Bezos\u2019s shopping engine. For two decades, investors have been willing to let Bezos reinvest every penny Amazon makes into building out a bigger and bigger company. But last year, Amazon started to show investors some skimpy profits \u2014 which are, like, the actual point of running a business \u2014 and to everyone\u2019s surprise, people on Wall Street seemed to like the money, and now they seem to keep wanting more.So it will be interesting to watch Amazon\u2019s fortunes over the next year. Will investors continue to punish it for favoring growth over profits? And if they do, will Jeff Bezos care?But you covered the earnings, so I\u2019ll let you take it away.No one was ready for it, as we spent years just building out advertising for larger screens. Entire companies were destroyed. There were ripple effects in adjacent companies that were deeply connected to Facebook. (Go look at Zynga before and after its I.P.O.) It was a total mess.Facebook went heads down and figured out how to create ads that aren\u2019t terrible and conform to a screen the size of a smartphone. And lo and behold, the company did it in an amazingly fast amount of time. In 2012, Facebook\u2019s mobile advertising revenues represented roughly 20 percent of the company\u2019s overall ad revenue. As of last quarter, that number has quadrupled to 80 percent. It\u2019s astounding how fast it was able to do it.That\u2019s why I always try to keep people\u2019s expectations of me incredibly low.

It said that at the time, it notified its customers of suspicious activity on their accounts and forced them to reset passwords, without specifying where the attacks might have come from.\u201cWe weighed several factors in responding to this incident, including the fact that neither Microsoft nor the U.S. government were able to identify the source of the attacks, which did not come from any single country,\u201d Microsoft said in the statement. \u201cWe also considered the potential impact on any subsequent investigation and ongoing measures we were taking to prevent potential future attacks.\u201dIn a blog post describing their warnings, Google declined to say exactly how it knew the attacks were state-sponsored, but said its alerts were the result of detailed analysis and victim reports. Google advised users to take additional precautions, like using stronger passwords and turning on two-step verification, which provides users with secondary codes via text messages or phone calls for accessing their accounts.An earlier version of this article misstated the timing of a Reuters report on Microsoft\u2019s handling of a 2012 hacking incident. It was published Wednesday, not Thursday.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "App Makers Reach Out to the Teenager on Mobile", "Date": "2016-01-01", "News": "Supported byOver the past decade, advertisers have spent untold millions trying to turn Talia Kocar and her peers in the millennial generation into loyal customers. But on a recent afternoon in Santa Monica, Calif., in a kind of consumer torch-passing, Ms. Kocar, 25, watched a focus group of teenagers drink free Snapple and suck Doritos powder off their thumbs while answering questions about their smartphones.Ms. Kocar works on Wishbone, a social networking application full of breezy polls about pop culture, prom dresses and other fixtures of teenage life. Users \u2014 most of them girls \u2014 post side-by-side pictures that compare rappers (Lil Wayne or Tyga?), celebrities (Kim Kardashian or Beyonc\u00e9?) and the like.Like most social media apps, Wishbone users achieve status by amassing friends who vote with a thumb tap. There is a bonus, however, which is that twice a day, Ms. Kocar and her team send a \u201cDaily Dozen\u201d of the best and most popular polls to every Wishbone user. This is somewhat like being named \u201cfunniest\u201d or \u201cmost clever\u201d in a yearbook: Featured polls are guaranteed a lot of votes, and votes, similar to likes on Facebook, are the coin of Wishbone\u2019s realm.Ms. Kocar said her first attempts at market research began with trips to Starbucks stores and nail salons, where she would find Wishbone users and ask them what they did and did not like about the app. She got lots of information, but wanted more. Hence, the focus group.Teenagers being teenagers, the room was full of angst and contradictions. They love Instagram, the photo-sharing app, but are terrified their posts will be ignored or mocked. They feel less pressure on Snapchat, the disappearing-message service, but say Snapchat can be annoying because disappearing messages make it hard to follow a continuing conversation. They do not like advertisements but also do not like to pay for things.At one point a questioner asked the group when they were least likely to be online. \u201cWhen I\u2019m in the shower,\u201d a girl responded.Those numbers have created a growing advertising market and fortunes for apps like Snapchat and Instagram, which is owned by Facebook. This year companies are projected to spend $30 billion on in-app advertising in the United States, roughly double what they spent in 2014, according to eMarketer, a research company.But even though these services all have the same core functions \u2014 find friends, post pictures, send messages \u2014 teenagers juggle them constantly, developing arcane customs for what to post where and ditching one app for another the moment it becomes uncool.That churn leaves an opening for upstarts like Wishbone, which is about a year old and already has about three million monthly users. Since July it has ranked among the top 30 most-downloaded social media apps in Apple\u2019s App Store, according to App Annie, a data and analytics company. But staying there will be tough. Mobile apps are a hit or miss business in which a handful of top players get most of the users and money.Hoping to get their app in that elite few, people like Ms. Kocar pore through data and turn to focus groups for insight on how to get new users to sign up and old users to stay. Their efforts are a window into how teenage lives are documented on mobile screens.\u201cThey have immediate social validation or lack of validation at the touch of a button,\u201d said Michael Jones, chief executive of Science Inc., which owns Wishbone. \u201cSo if you thought that the immediate gratification generation was two generations ago, you haven\u2019t even seen what immediate gratification looks like until you start spending time with, like, a teen on a phone.\u201dOne hot afternoon last summer, Leila Khan and Lucy Nemerov, two eighth graders from Palo Alto, Calif., cruised their local mall, scoring free samples at See\u2019s Candies and dropping into Brandy Melville to look at clothes, but not buy. Lucy is an avid Wishbone user, but the app is just one among several that she and her friends rotate through each day.To manage their identities in and obligations to this world in their pockets, they adhere to rules that have somehow been absorbed and adopted by their peers. For instance, that afternoon, since nothing particularly special happened, Lucy posted a few videos to Snapchat \u2014 including a clip of me interviewing her \u2014 but nothing on Instagram.Why the distinction? Because Instagram is special, Leila explained. On Snapchat, where messages disappear, you can be less selective because there is a lower bar for quality. On Instagram, you have to be careful not to clog your friends\u2019 feeds with a barrage of low-quality pictures that might annoy them.They also regularly delete their Instagram photos so that their profiles never have more than a handful at a time. For comparison, I\u2019m a medium-level Instagram user and have several hundred. They reacted to this information as if it were the smell of warm garbage.\u201cI have zero right now,\u201d Lucy said.\u201cYeah, \u2019cause I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh wait, I look stupid in this one,\u2019 \u201d Leila said.App makers fear this kind of juggling the way TV networks fear DVRs. Each time someone leaves one app for another, there is a chance that user will never come back. And since apps make money only when users are plugged in and absorbing ads, the number of monthly users is less important than how many users they get each day \u2014 and how long they stay.Social media apps and messaging services \u2014 Wishbone included \u2014 tend to get an outsize portion of their ad revenue from a handful of mobile game makers and other app download ads. But Wishbone is making the not-terribly-crazy bet that as people spend more time with their phones and advertisers become comfortable with the medium, more brands and money will follow.For now big advertisers remain focused on the millennial generation, who, at about 18 to 35 years old, are old enough to buy cars, homes and other big-ticket items. But an early wave is starting to think about the next group, said Erna Alfred Liousas, an analyst at Forrester Research, who said the firm had a number of financial services and media companies ask for studies on the under-17 group.As with coffee and newspapers, the key to a successful app is to make it a daily habit. Which is why in early September, Mr. Jones of Science sat in a cinder block room staring at a computer screen full of data. He was with Benoit Vatere, head of Science\u2019s mobile group, and Peter Pham, the company\u2019s chief business officer, discussing the best time to send push notifications alerting Wishbone users to new polls.Push notifications \u2014 those incessant reminders that make your phone light up and ding \u2014 are the infantry of app warfare, cracking the attention span to remind users that someone on the Internet might be talking about them. All summer Wishbone had been sending out alerts four times a day, but the three men were thinking about adding more and, now that students were back in class, trying to recalibrate around the school day.\u201cCan we have a friends feed at noon?\u201d Mr. Jones asked Mr. Vatere. \u201cIt would be great to do \u2018Your friends have updated.\u2019 \u201d\u201cAnd you talk about it while you\u2019re at school,\u201d Mr. Pham added.Every generation has its thing, and the last two have been marked by digital technology. One of the big dividing lines between Generation X and millennials was that millennials grew up with the Internet. A big difference between millennials and the next group \u2014 the postmillennials \u2014 has been smartphones.\u201cThere\u2019s a whole new curriculum being pushed by Gen X parents and one thing it emphasizes above all is emotional intelligence and being very sensitive to the needs of others,\u201d Mr. Howe said.In surveys, his consulting company, LifeCourse Associates, has found that teenagers are extremely anxious about being criticized on social media and are more conscious than their parents of when an app makes them feel bad \u2014 or at least aren\u2019t bashful about saying so.During the recent focus group at Science, one girl said she showed Instagram ideas to at least three people before posting. Another said she deleted any post that did not garner enough likes. \u201cI post and I just delete, because I don\u2019t want to have, like, never mind,\u201d she said, too ashamed to announce the precise number of likes out loud.Wishbone sees those anxieties as an opportunity. The app doesn\u2019t ask users to take pictures in which they look \u201csooo beautiful!!!!,\u201d nor does it require having parents who vacation in Instagram-perfect locales. Users just make funny polls to talk about celebrities, makeup and bands. It is about your tastes, not your identity.Rajada Victor, a 14-year-old ninth grader who lives in Los Angeles, was seated near the girl who was ashamed of her paltry likes. In a follow-up interview, she said she had grown exhausted by the frenzy for online status but was a regular on Wishbone, which she checks all the time: in class, while walking to school, on weekends.\u201cI like the fact that you don\u2019t have to look a certain type of way to post,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t comment rudely or anything \u2014 you\u2019re just comparing stuff.\u201dMr. Vatere can see this in the data: Wishbone users frequently describe themselves by their interests \u2014 they might like Taylor Swift, for instance \u2014 but rarely post personal photos. The app also employs an \u201ceveryone gets a trophy\u201d philosophy by having Ms. Kocar and her editorial team choose many different polls, not just the most popular ones, for the coveted Daily Dozen of posts that all Wishbone users vote on.\u201cYou want to create an environment where it doesn\u2019t feel like only 1 percent of the people win,\u201d said Eric Kuhn, Science\u2019s head of product. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve heard that with other platforms, like as soon as you\u2019re clearly not in that top 1 percent, you don\u2019t want to use the app anymore.\u201dMr. Jones, a 40-year-old Gen Xer, has tracked youth culture since the grunge \u201990s, when he started a magazine called Elixir as a University of Oregon sophomore. This was back when teenagers went to bookstores in search of small-circulation \u201czines.\u201dHe spent the next two decades tracking the migration of media to the web, to social platforms to mobile phones. Elixir became a website and, as Mr. Jones got more interested in the web than publishing, he started a software company called Userplane that was bought by AOL.Later Mr. Jones was the chief executive of MySpace, where his job was to try to blunt the ascendance of a new competitor called Facebook. This did not go well.He founded Science four years ago with Mr. Pham. He calls it a \u201cstart-up studio\u201d that helps entrepreneurs turn their ideas into businesses. Wishbone is part of Science\u2019s mobile group \u2014 which includes several other apps \u2014 but Mr. Jones is so enamored with social media that he decided to run the group and Wishbone himself. The Science offices are just a few blocks from the beach in Santa Monica and have requisite start-up touches like exposed ceilings, copious whiteboards and employees who toil quietly while wearing Beats headphones.Science has raised about $40 million in venture capital, most of it from Hearst Ventures. After the MySpace debacle, Mr. Jones said he initially steered clear of social media and focused on building online commerce businesses such as Dollar Shave Club, a razor subscription service, and DogVacay, a dog-boarding version of Airbnb, the online home-rental service.\u201cComing out of MySpace I was like, ahhh, this is so hard \u2014 social ads is tough,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s just take a pause.\u201dAs social media moved to mobile phones, Mr. Jones figured there would be a chance to get back in. Wishbone came out of a few facts and a hunch. The facts are that people spend several hours a day on their phones, and that teenagers favor apps in which everyone gets to create content and be part of the show.The hunch was that a polling app would do well. Mr. Jones knew from his AOL days that polling was among the most addictive of online features. And since successful mobile apps reward repetitive behavior, he figured polling would translate well to smartphones.If Wishbone were almost anything besides an app, three million users would be a huge success. But apps are a brutal business, where a few gigantic hits like Facebook and YouTube make most of the money. American smartphone owners use about 27 apps per month, but spend about 80 percent of their time in five, according to a recent study by Activate, a consulting firm.Wishbone is a long way from that top tier, which is why employees show up to meetings with laptops full of statistics about what teenagers are doing. And it is why they spend time running focus groups.Right around Thanksgiving, Mr. Jones, Mr. Pham and Mr. Vatere started rethinking their strategy for sending out push notifications. All through the summer and fall they had been limiting the number of daily alerts on the assumption that, like them, Wishbone users would be annoyed if they were interrupted by too many pings and dings. And, as one might expect when three fathers make an assumption about teenage girls, they could not have been more wrong.\u201cWe talked to them and they\u2019d be like, \u2018Why am I not getting notified when people vote on my stuff?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Jones said. \u201cAnd we\u2019d be like, \u2018Well, we wouldn\u2019t want to do that \u2019cause we might send you, like, 50 notifications that you got 50 of your friends to vote on your card.\u2019 They\u2019re like, \u2018But that\u2019s what I want.\u2019 \u201d\u201cIn fact,\u201d Mr. Jones said, \u201cthey would even kind of subtly infer that if they didn\u2019t get at least 50, it was kind of like a bad day.\u201dThe same way Gen X measured its worth in answering machine messages, the mobile-minded teenager sees each like and mention as reassurance of an active social life. And when your phone is the default security blanket for enduring the awkwardness of walking a high school hallway, it feels nice to have a bunch of digital hellos ready with a swipe.So just before Thanksgiving weekend, Wishbone opened the fire hose, sending out notifications for everything \u2014 every vote, every mention, everything that has to do with a user on the app. A week later they found several key metrics, like voting, had almost doubled.Those in the Wishbone focus group said they loved getting notifications but acknowledged getting lost in their phones. One girl said that it had come to the point that the only way she could finish her homework was to put her phone in another room.\u201cSometimes it\u2019s fun \u2019cause it\u2019s like people are thinking about you and are like, \u2018I want to show this to Jada,\u2019 \u201d said Rajada Victor, the ninth grader in Los Angeles, who goes by Jada. But, she also said, she tries not to become caught up in worrying about social media.\u201cI\u2019m focusing on my grades and all that stuff,\u201d she said.And that\u2019s the thing about teenagers: They grow up.Advertisement"}

What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more, he suggested that Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, for all the ballyhooed enthusiasm behind his candidacy, is not an analogue to his own 2008 campaign.It was all but an endorsement, and it seemed to buoy Mrs. Clinton. She appeared in command on the stage, and essentially declined to attack Mr. Sanders, even though the race had grown more rancorous, and though he was deeply critical of her earlier in the evening. He also declared that he would raise taxes to pay for some of his programs, a remark that could be fodder for an attack ad down the road.But Mrs. Clinton did not seem anxious about a potential loss, sticking to her pragmatist pitch while praising Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hopeful final closing ad.

Trump as their candidate could hand the White House to Hillary Clinton.At a town hall meeting in Portsmouth, N.H., Mr. Christie expressed disbelief at Mr. Trump\u2019s comment Saturday that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan and lose no support in the 2016 campaign.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u2019s pretty amazing to say it, isn\u2019t it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Christie asked.Briefly slipping into an impression of Mr. Trump \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u2019re stupid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he deadpanned in a throaty baritone \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Mr. Christie said he empathized with voters who want to \u00e2\u0080\u009cburn Washington down.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut who\u2019s going to rebuild it once it gets burned down?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Christie said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u2019s what you\u2019ve got to think about.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBy nominating the wrong candidate, he continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe could wind up turning over the White House to Hillary Clinton for four more years.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThat prospect, he said, would be \u00e2\u0080\u009clike the eight years we\u2019ve just had, except worse.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHis criticism comes as Mr. Trump has maintained a strong lead in New Hampshire polls. Mr. Trump has led the Republican field here by a wide margin, with his closest competitors bunched up far behind him in the low double digits.Mr. Christie, who left the campaign trail briefly over the weekend to manage the government response to a snowstorm in New Jersey, repeatedly described himself Sunday as a steady executive tested by crisis, including this weekend\u2019s blizzard and Hurricane Sandy in 2012.Mr. Christie initially said he would not return home for the storm, drawing criticism from Democrats in his state, but as the forecast darkened on Friday he flew home to deal with heavy snowfall and flooding.Defending his opposition to funding Planned Parenthood, Mr. Christie criticized some Republicans for having been \u00e2\u0080\u009cextraordinarily divisive\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the issue of abortion. Should he be elected president, Mr. Christie said, he would reach out to Democrats in Congress to try and get big things done.Even Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader and a deeply unpopular figure on the right, would be invited on Air Force One, Mr. Christie pledged.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders Took In $33 Million in Last Quarter", "Date": "2016-01-02", "News": "Senator Bernie Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidential campaign raised more than $33 million in the final three months of 2015, as his wide base of small-amount donors enabled him to come within $4 million of the amount raised by Hillary Clinton, his rival for the Democratic nomination, his campaign said Saturday.Mr. Sanders, a senator from Vermont, has now raised $73 million for his nomination fight, his aides said in a news release.The campaign said more than one million individual donors had made more than 2.5 million contributions, passing President Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s previous record of about 2.2 million for the number of individual donations, which was set at the end of 2011.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis people-powered campaign is revolutionizing American politics,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign manager, said in a news release accompanying the release of the figures.Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spending on the campaign also appears to have shot up. The campaign now has $28.4 million in cash left from the $73 million raised, the release said.Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign has aggressively targeted and courted low-dollar donors, developing a deep network of people it could keep tapping for new contributions.Mrs. Clinton, by contrast, struggled in the second and third quarters of the year to establish a low-dollar donor base, relying primarily on fund-raising events with ticket prices of $2,700 to bring in donations..Two of the Republican candidates, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Ben Carson, have released their fund-raising totals for the quarter. Mr. Cruz raised $20 million, a two-thirds increase from his previous quarter, and Mr. Carson raised $23 million.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Transcript: Preliminary Republican Presidential Debate", "Date": "2016-01-14", "News": "Supported byFollowing is a transcript of the preliminary Republican debate, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.ANNOUNCER: Tonight, the Republican candidates for president are looking to capture their moment. South Carolina has a history of making and breaking campaigns. And this week Charleston is the center of the political universe. Three days from now, the Democrats will debate just a few miles away.Here, in a city older than the country itself, from the Revolutionary War to the Civil War, to the \u201cwar by the shore,\u201d South Carolina prepares once again to take center stage. And the Republican candidates all hope that the spotlight of the Palmetto State would shine upon them.(APPLAUSE)TRISH REGAN, CO-MODERATOR: Good evening, and welcome to the North Charleston Coliseum and Performing Arts Center. Tonight we hear from 10 Republican candidates vying to become the next president of the United States.I\u2019m Trish Regan, along with my co-moderator Sandra Smith.SANDRA SMITH, CO-MODERATOR: This evening FOX Business is bringing you the sixth Republican presidential debate of the 2016 campaign. For the next hour, three of the candidates will be answering the questions voters want answered.REGAN: So let\u2019s introduce them. Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: And former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: This debate will last one hour. Each candidate will have up to 90 seconds to respond to each question, one minute for each follow-up.REGAN: When your time is up, you are going to hear this bell.(BELL RINGS)REGAN: All right. So let\u2019s begin.In Tuesday\u2019s State of the Union Address, the president said that our economy is strong. He cited the significant decline we\u2019ve seen in unemployment rate and the millions of jobs that have been created.What is your assessment of the economy right now? And I would like to hear from all of you on this one, beginning with Ms. Fiorina.CARLY FIORINA (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, thank you. Good evening. If I may begin by saying how honored I am to be standing here with two former Iowa Caucus winners.Governor, Senator.And how honored I am to be talking with all of you. You know, I\u2019m not a political insider. I haven\u2019t spent my lifetime running for office. The truth is I have had and been blessed by a lot of opportunities to do a lot of things in my life.And unlike another woman in this race, I actually love spending time with my husband.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)FIORINA: I\u2019m standing here because I think we have to restore a citizen government in this country. I think we have to end crony capitalism. The crony capitalism that starts with both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.You know, Hillary Clinton sits inside government and rakes in millions, handing out access and favors. And Donald Trump sits outside government and rakes in billions buying people like Hillary Clinton.The state of our economy is not strong. We have record numbers of men out of work. We have record numbers of women living in poverty. We have young people who no longer believe that the American dream applies to them.We have working families whose wages have stagnated for decades, all while the rich get richer, the powerful get more powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected get more connected.Citizens, it\u2019s time to take our country back.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Governor Huckabee, same question to you. Where do you see the country right now?MIKE HUCKABEE (R), FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I wish I saw the country in the same place that the president presented it to be the other night in the State of the Union. He talked about how great the economy was doing. And I guess for the people he hangs out with, it\u2019s probably doing great.But the president should\u2019ve stood in the line at the layaway counter at Walmart just before Christmas. He would have heard a very different story about the economy of America.HUCKABEE: I wish I could introduce him the lady who cleans the building where our campaign headquarters is located in Little Rock. Her name is Kathleen (ph). She works all day at a local hospital cleaning, and then she goes to the building where a bank, and our headquarters, and other offices are she spends another seven hours. She works 15 hours a day.I guarantee you she\u2019s not working 15 hours a day because she loves scrubbing toilets, and sweeping floors. She\u2019s working that many hours because that\u2019s what it takes for her to make it work.And, she\u2019s not alone. There are people all over this country who are working like that. Many of them working two jobs \u2014 and they used to have one job, and that would take care of them. But, because of wage stagnation, which we\u2019ve had for 40 years, because the fact that they\u2019re punished for working harder if they work that many hours. The government gets more of their second shift than they do.And, as a result there are a lot of people who are hurting today. I wish the President knew more of them. He might make a change in the economy and the way he\u2019s managing it.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Thank you Governor Huckabee. Senator Santorum?SANTORUM: Well, all he has to do is listen to the Democratic debate and find out how bad the economy is. All they do is complain about the hollowing out of the middle of America, and how America is struggling so badly, and have to make these radical changes in Washington.But they\u2019ve been in control for the last seven years, and what have we seen? The most important jobs, I believe, in this country are the ones that fill the middle. For the 74% of Americans who don\u2019t have a college degree between the age of 25 and 65 are manufacturing jobs. Your governor, and your legislature, and your team here have done an amazing job of bringing manufacturing jobs back to South Carolina.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)SANTORUM: Right here. Right here in Charleston, right down in the street in Boeing (ph). You\u2019ve done a great job, and what\u2019s happened? You\u2019ve grown this economy, you\u2019ve strengthened the center of your state, the middle. That\u2019s because you know that if you\u2019re really going to create wealth and opportunity, you got to get jobs, and good paying jobs for everybody.And, so what\u2019s happened? Two million jobs, manufacturing jobs, have left this country because of Barack Obama. Regulations, EPA, workplace regulations, things driving people off-shore all because of his number one priority, global climate change.Well, let me tell you this, Mr. President. For every dollar of GDP, China creates five times as much pollution as we do here. You want to \u2014 lower global climate change, bring those jobs back to America and let American workers do that job with less pollution.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Thank you, Senator Santorum. Thank you, candidates.Moving to the world stage. The middle east is on the brink of chaos. Iran continues to provoke the United States, North Korea claims it\u2019s tested a hydrogen bomb, and Afghanistan is in danger of falling back into Taliban hands. Critics of the administration say it\u2019s all due to lack of U.S. leadership.To you, Mrs. Fiorina, how do you see America\u2019s role in the world today?FIORINA: America must lead because when we do not lead, when this exceptional nation does not lead, the world is more dangerous and a more tragic place.Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, they all refuse to lead. Worse, they refuse to respond when this nation is provoked. Hillary Clinton famously asked what difference does it make how four Americans died in Benghazi?Mrs. Clinton, here\u2019s what difference it makes. When you do not stand up and say the truth, that this was a purposeful terrorist attack, when you do not say the United States of America will retaliate for that attack, terrorists assume it\u2019s open season.We have refused to respond to every provocation. The President wouldn\u2019t even mention the fact that Iran had taken two Navy boats and our sailors \u2014 hostage. He didn\u2019t mention the fact that they violated the Geneva convention. He didn\u2019t respond to the fact that Iran launched two ballistic missile just a short time ago, in direct violation of a deal they had just signed. We didn\u2019t respond to the fact that North Korea attacked Sony Pictures.When we refuse to respond over, and over to provocation and bad behavior, we will get more provocation and bad behavior. I know most of our allies personally. I have met many of our adversaries. I know our military and our intelligence capability, and I know this. When we will not stand with our allies, when we will not respond to our adversaries, when we do not lead in the world the world is a dangerous and tragic place. I will be a Commander in Chief who will lead.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Thank you.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Well, since we\u2019ve been talking about the Middle East, Senator Santorum, conflicts between Saudi Arabia and Iran have certainly escalated, amid accusations that Saudi Arabia bombed the Iranian Embassy in Yemen after the Saudi Embassy in Tehran was attacked.As we confront an increasingly unstable Middle East, how will you, as president, navigate this administration\u2019s promises to Iran while standing by our historic allies in the region?RICK SANTORUM (R-PA), FORMER SENATOR, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, the historic promises that we have made to \u2014 to Iran in this agreement need to be torn up on the first day in office of the next president.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: And let me tell you why, because Iran has already torn it up. Iran has not approved the agreement that President Obama has said that they have approved. They have approved a different agreement in their parliament.The fact of the matter is they have violated this agreement. Carly just mentioned some of those violations.They have launched ballistic missiles, tested them, in clear violation.And here\u2019s the pathetic part. The president announced that they were going to impose sanctions. And then President Rouhani went on Twitter and said there would be retaliation.And what did we do?We backed down.Ladies and gentlemen, there are 50 some Citadel cadets in this audience tonight.(APPLAUSE) SANTORUM: I would ask them to stand up if they will. And here\u2019s what I want to tell each and every one of them, as you stand. Here\u2019s what I want to tell them.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: Whether it\u2019s you\u2019re watching that movie this weekend that just came out when we abandoned our men and women in Benghazi, or whether it\u2019s we treat Iran, that gave courtesies to our sailors, as they made them record a hostage video, let me tell you this, if you choose to serve this country, I will have your back. I will not let America be trampled upon anymore by these radical jihadists.REGAN: Thank you, Senator Santorum.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Governor Huckabee, in Afghanistan, the Taliban is strengthening. Attacks are on the rise and thousands more civilians have been wounded or killed. Much of the Taliban surge can be attributed to the withdrawal of U.S. forces there.You have expressed skepticism with the war there, saying you see no end game in sight.What, then, is your solution to the growing conflict there?MIKE HUCKABEE (R-AK), FORMER GOVERNOR, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Let me put that in context. When I went to Afghanistan, I saw a land that looked like the land of the Flintstones. It was desolate. It was barren. It was primitive.And it\u2019s been that way for thousands of years. They want to take the world back to be just like that.We don\u2019t.We need to make a clear goal as to why we want to be anywhere in the Middle East, and I\u2019ll tell you why we want to be and need to be, is to destroy radical Islam and everything that threatens civilization. It\u2019s not just a threat...(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: \u2014 to Israel or to America, it\u2019s a threat to every civilized person on this Earth. And we need to be equipping not only the Kurds in Iraq, we need to be making sure that those who are willing to fight radical Muslims will do it, but we need to never ever spend a drop of American blood unless there is a clearly defined goal and we can\u2019t make sure we win unless we have a military that\u2019s the strongest in the history of mankind.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.We\u2019ve got to rebuild our navy. It\u2019s the smallest navy we\u2019ve had since 1915, when my grandfather got on a destroyer in World War I when he was in the U.S. Navy. We\u2019ve got young men in Air Force B-52s, one in particular, he\u2019s flying a B-52 that his father flew in the \u201980s and his grandfather flew in the \u201950s. Those planes are older than me.We\u2019ve got to have a military that the world is afraid of, use it sparingly, but when we do, the whole world will know that America is on their tail and they will be on their tail on the ground, never ever to rise up again.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Governor Huckabee, if I could just follow-up with that.Do we need to be in Afghanistan?HUCKABEE: Only if there is a concerted effort to destroy the advance of radical Islamists who are against us. As far as what are we going to make it look like. Frankly, I don\u2019t know what we can make it look like. You can\u2019t create for other people a desire for freedom and democracy.And frankly, that is not the role of the United States. The role of the United States military is not to build schools, it is not to build bridges, it is not to go around and pass out food packets.It is to kill and destroy our enemy and make America safe and that is the purpose we should be there if we\u2019re going to be there.REGAN: Thank you Governor Huckabee.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Ms. Fiorina, nearly 600 women say they were attacked in a German city on New Year\u2019s Eve by men of Arab or North African descent and 45 percent of those alleged attacks were sexual assaults. Twenty-two of those 32 men arrested so far are asylum-seekers. Are you worried about similar problems in the United States?FIORINA: Of course I\u2019m worried about similar problems in the United States. We can not allow refugees to enter this country unless we can adequately vet them and we know we can\u2019t. Therefore we should stop allowing refugees into this country.(APPLAUSE)FIORINA: And by the way, we do not need to be lectured about why we\u2019re angry and frustrated and fearful because we\u2019ve had an illegal immigration problem in this country for 25 years.(APPLAUSE)FIORINA: And we have every right to be frustrated about the fact that politicians stand up in election after election after election and promise us to fix the problem and yet, it has never been fixed.I offer leadership that understands that actions speak louder than words, that results count. We must secure our border. We must fix our broken immigration system. We must enforce a pro-American immigration system that serves our interests, not the rest of the world. I understand what it takes to translate goals into results and that is what I will do as president of the United States. Of course, we should be worried, for heavens sakes.This administration has now told us they don\u2019t know who has overstayed a visa. This administration has told us they don\u2019t even bother to check Facebook or Twitter to find out who\u2019s pledging allegiance to jihadis. We can do better than this, citizens. We need to take our country back.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: I want to stay with you on this. The world shares a common enemy right now in the way of ISIS. Russia, the European Union, Saudi Arabia, Iran, China, we all agree ISIS is a threat and it must be stopped.During World War II, the world partnered with Joseph Stalin, who was arguably one of the most formidable \u2014 despicable figures of the 20th century. But they partnered with him to fight the Nazis.Today, everyone seems to agree we need some kind of coalition to fight ISIS. Do you agree with that? And if so, would your coalition include possibly, Russia and Iran?FIORINA: We need to be very clear-eyed now about who are our allies and who are our adversaries. In the fight against ISIS, Saudi Arabia is our ally. Iran is our adversary. And despite Donald trump\u2019s bromance with Vladmir Putin, Vladmir Putin and Russia are our adversary. We can not...(APPLAUSE)FIORINA: We can not outsource leadership in the Middle East to Iran and Russia. We must stand and lead. The Kuwaitis, the Jordanians, the Saudis, Egyptians, Bahrainis (sic), the Emirates, the Kurds. I know virtually all of these nations and their leaders. And they have asked us for very specific kinds of support: bombs, material, arms, intelligence.We are not providing any of it today. I will provide all of it. We have allies who will stand up and help us deny ISIS territory, which is what we must do to defeat them. We must deny them territory. They will help us do this. And yes, we need a coalition.But only in the United States of America can lead such a coalition. I will lead it. But we must be clear-eyed through this fight. Iran is our adversary. Russia is our adversary. We can never outsource our leadership. Only the United States of America can lead to defeat ISIS. I will.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Ms. Fiorina, thank you.SMITH: All right, thank you, candidates. We\u2019re just getting started. Jobs, Homeland Security, gun rights, all those issues are coming up straight ahead. We\u2019re live from North Charleston and the Republican Presidential Debate. We\u2019ll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Welcome back, everyone, to the Republican presidential debate. On to the next round of questions \u2014 Sandra.SMITH: All right, let\u2019s get started. Senator Santorum, to you first. President Obama has urged technology leaders to make it hard for terrorists to use technology to escape from justice. Hillary Clinton says social media companies can help by swiftly shutting down terrorist accounts.The companies say that they\u2019re already working with law enforcement and any proposed legislation would do more harm than good. Should companies like Facebook and Twitter be required by law to more actively \u2014 be more actively engaged in fighting terror?SANTORUM: I would just say that if we were doing a better job within the government, we wouldn\u2019t need the private sector to do the things that we\u2019re asking them to do.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: I\u2019ve had a little experience in this in the private sector myself. And what I found was a government with layers and layers of bureaucracy, of people who had some technical expertise but they had no authority, number one.And one of the things I found out about in the bureaucracy is if a lot of people have authority, nobody has authority, number one. And number two, that if you don\u2019t do anything, you don\u2019t get fired.It\u2019s only when you do something and something goes wrong, you get fired. So they do nothing. And that\u2019s what is happening in our Defense Department right now. We have a capability that they\u2019re trying to develop to play defense.We have a lot of technologists that are very skilled. And they\u2019re trying to figure out how to play defense. But what we don\u2019t have is we don\u2019t have folks who are thinking about offense.We don\u2019t have war-fighters. We have technologists. Technologists are not war-fighters. Technologists are thinking, how do I protect cyber-security, how do I secure, how do I protect?SANTORUM: And we need to have a much more dynamic, how do we \u2014 how do we go after them?How do we respond?And we need leadership that\u2019s willing to make sure that when someone attacks us \u2014 and ladies and gentlemen, they\u2019re attacking us as we speak. They\u2019re attacking us all day every day, not just the government, but they\u2019re attacking private sector companies all day every day.They have to learn that we\u2019re going to pay \u2014 they\u2019re going to pay a price when they do so.And then right now, just like in every other aspect of our national security, people who attack us are not paying a price. We need a leader who will make sure that they know when they mess with America, they\u2019re going to pay a price.SMITH: Senator, would you \u2014 would you require anything of those companies like Facebook and Twitter if you were president?SANTORUM: Look, Facebook and Twitter can teach us things. We can cooperate with them. We can share ideas and information. But this is a \u2014 and this is a very dicey area for the government to go in and require the industry to do its job.It needs to develop that capability. We need to be \u2014 have responsible dialogue, but I don\u2019t think requirements are the order of the day.SMITH: Thank you, Senator.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Ms. Fiorina, the president has just issued an executive order to expand the gun laws and background checks. And none of you on stage agree with this.But recent polls show the majority of Americans are in favor of universal background checks.(BOOS)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not in this room.REGAN: It\u2019s the poll data.(CROSSTALK)FIORINA: And we all believe the polling data all the time, don\u2019t we?REGAN: So tell me...(APPLAUSE)REGAN: \u2014 why, in your view, is the president\u2019s proposal a problem?FIORINA: Oh, it\u2019s a problem for so many reasons.First of all, it is yet another lawless executive order. You see, he doesn\u2019t like the fact that Congress has rejected his ideas twice on a bipartisan basis, so he\u2019s decided he just gets to override them.Sorry, Mr. President, not the way \u201cThe Constitution\u201d works.Secondly...(APPLAUSE)FIORINA: \u2014 secondly, he basically admitted in that speech that he hasn\u2019t been paying much attention to enforcing the laws we have. He said, gee, we need a few more FBI agents. That would have helped, perhaps, stop a tragedy here in South Carolina with Dylann Roof, a guy who clearly never should have been sold a gun.In other words, Mr. President, you\u2019re right, we need to enforce the laws we have. Let\u2019s enforce the laws we have. There are criminals running around with guns who shouldn\u2019t have them. We don\u2019t prosecute any of them. Less than 1 percent.But I want to go back to the technology issue for a moment, if I may, as well, because in this regard, I disagree with Senator Santorum. Look, I come from the technology industry and I can tell you there is one thing that bureaucracies don\u2019t know how to do. They do not know how to innovate.We have come seven generations of technology since 2011. We have bureaucracies that are incapable of bringing in that innovation.So, yes, there are some very specific things that we should ask the private sector to help us with, including making sure we have the latest and greatest in algorithms to search through all these databases so that we find terrorists before they attack us, not after it\u2019s too late.And, finally, when a president who understands technology in the Oval Office. Mrs. Clinton, actually, you cannot wipe a server with a towel.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Ms. Fiorina, you\u2019ve said that was when you were CEO of HP, you actually worked with the government.FIORINA: Yes, and see...REGAN: \u2014 to try and combat some of these terrorist threats.FIORINA: As CEO of Hewlett Packard...REGAN: What did you do?FIORINA: As CEO of Hewlett Packard, I was asked very specifically for some very real help. The help I was asked to provide, this is now public information. So I am not revealing what \u2014 something that was \u2014 was classified.We had a very large shipment of equipment, software and hardware, headed to a retail outlet. And I was called by the head of the NSA, who had an urgent need for that capability, to begin laying out a program to track terrorists.History suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.We turned that truck around on a highway and it was escorted to the headquarters in San Jose.In World War II, our government went to the private sector and said, help us do things that we cannot do.The private sector has capabilities that the government does not have. There are some legal authorities that are required.The Sony attack could have been detected and repelled, had legal authorities been passed in Congress allowing private networks and public networks to work together.Those legal authorities have not yet been passed.Yes, I was asked to help.(RINGS BELL)FIORINA: I know the technology industry. They will help again. But they must be asked by a president who understands what they have.REGAN: Ms. Fiorina, thank you.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: All right, Governor Huckabee, you called President Obama\u2019s executive orders on gun control unconstitutional and completely insane.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: (LAUGHING) Yes, I did.SMITH: You even told gun store owners to ignore the President\u2019s orders.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Yet, innocent people are dying from gun violence in cities like Detroit, Chicago, and Charleston everyday. Is there anything that can be done at the federal level to prevent guns from falling into the hands of criminals?HUCKABEE: Well, why don\u2019t we start by making sure the Justice Department never does an idiotic program like Fast and Furious where the U.S. Government put guns...(CHEERING)HUCKABEE: ...in the hands of Mexican drug lords...(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: ...and end up killing one of our border agents. You know, they want to talk about law abiding citizens, I just find it amazing the President keeps saying the gun show loophole. There is no gun show loophole. I promise you I\u2019ve been to more gun shows than President Obama.SMITH: (LAUGHING)HUCKABEE: And, I\u2019ve bought more weapons at them, and you fill out forms. The President also says things that it\u2019s easier to get a gun now than it is to grow trees. Again, I purchase guns, and I can assure you that it is much more difficult to purchase a firearm than it is to get the ingredients of a salad at the supermarket.What the President keeps pushing are ideas that have never worked. Ideas that would not have stopped San Bernadino, Sandy Hook, Aurora, and at some point you wonder if you keep retrying things that don\u2019t work, maybe we should just see if we could resell all those used lottery tickets that didn\u2019t work real well because that\u2019s the logic of just keep doing the same thing, but something that has failed. Of course, we want to stop gun violence, but the one common thing that has happened in most mass shootings is that they happened in gun- free zones where people who would have been law abiding citizens, who could have stood up and at least tried to stop it and we\u2019re not allowed to under the law.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Thank you, Governor Huckabee.REGAN: Governor Huckabee, an American in San Bernardino murdered 14 people while terrorists with Belgian and French passports murdered 130 people. Were facing a threat within our borders, and from outside the United States. Those European terrorists, they could have come here at any time given that we have a visa waiver program that enables people to travel back and forth. It exists within those countries, and 36 others.In countries around the world, including many in Europe, cannot ensure that their citizens are not jihadists, why are we waiving the visa requirement at all?HUCKABEE: Well, we shouldn\u2019t be and that\u2019s one of the reasons that I think there a lot of voices in our country who are saying it\u2019s time to relook (ph) at the visa program. The European Union is a failure, it\u2019s not allowed for even the economic goals that they were trying to achieve.But, what we\u2019re not seeing is that it\u2019s making Europe less safe, and it\u2019s proven not to be exactly what they all thought it was going to be.Our first and foremost responsibility in this country, and the first responsibility of the President of the United States is protect America, and protect Americans. We have a President who seems to be more interested in protecting the reputation and image of Islam than he is protecting us. And, I want to be very clear...(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: ...that this President.(CHEERING)HUCKABEE: Makes comments like he did the other night, that we have to be so careful because we don\u2019t want to offend Muslims. He needs to read his own FBI crime stats from last year which would show him that of the hate crimes in the country, over 5,500, about 1,100 were religious hate crimes. And, of those, 58% were directed toward Jews. Only 16% directed toward Muslims.Maybe what the President should have talked about the other night is how we ought to be more careful in the anti-semitic comments that are going toward American Jews than toward Muslims because by three times as many...(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: ...they\u2019re being targeted for religious hate crime.REGAN: If you get the visa waiver program, does that shut down international commerce?HUCKABEE: It does not shut down international commerce, but it may slow it down. And, you don\u2019t want to slowdown commerce that is making us safer. It\u2019s worth it. This lady who came and joined with the San Bernardino killer had passed three background checks, and that\u2019s why a lot of Americans didn\u2019t buy it when the President said we\u2019ll bring in Syrian refugees, but don\u2019t worry we\u2019ll check them out.We have a lot of confidence in a president who told us that we could keep our doctor, we could keep our health insurance, and cost us less, and now the latest is if you like your gun you can keep it too, and frankly, we don\u2019t buy it. We don\u2019t believe it. He\u2019s lost his credibility, and his inept...(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: ...inability to work with Congress and pass legislation has led him to do what I never even imagined doing as a governor, and that\u2019s just going and doing it my own way.MOREHUCKABEE: That\u2019s why we elect a president, is to lead, is to be able to shepherd things through. And if I can do it with a 90 percent Democrat legislature in Arkansas, there is no excuse for any president not being able to lead in Washington if he knows what the heck he is doing when he gets there.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Thank you, Governor Huckabee.SMITH: Senator Santorum, many of our military leaders believe America\u2019s critical infrastructure is vulnerable to a terrorist attack. This is the power in our homes, the water we drink, the Internet and phone systems by which we stay connected.If attacked, these essential services that underpin American society could come to a grinding halt. Do you have a specific plan to protect us from this type of attack?SANTORUM: Well, the most devastating attack that could occur is an electromagnetic pulse attack, and that would be an attack that would be triggered by a nuclear explosion in the upper atmosphere of our country.The best way to stop that from happening is to make sure that those who contemplating and actually war-gaming and talking about using it, Iran, doesn\u2019t get a nuclear weapon so they can\u2019t explode that device.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: And the president of the United States has put Iran on a path to a nuclear weapon. And we have done nothing to do anything to harden our grid. There is actually a bill in Congress that would put money forward to try to put redundancy and harden our electric grid so it could actually survive an EMP.An EMP is a devastating explosion that sends a pulse that knocks out all electric, everything, everything that is connected to any kind \u2014 that is wired, that has a circuit board gets fried out. Everything is gone. Cars stop. Planes fall out of the sky.This is a devastating attack. And this president has done nothing, number one, to take the most probable person to \u2014 probable country to launch an attack and stop them, and has done nothing to try to defend us, particularly our electric grid. The bottom line is, I put the original sanctions on the Iranian nuclear program when I was in the United States Senate. I\u2019ve been fighting for 12 years with one thing in mind, that we must stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. And...(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: Because they\u2019re different than every other country. They do not want a nuclear weapon to defend themselves. They want a nuclear weapon to have theological ends to bring about their mahdi so they can control the world. And that is the most serious threat facing this country right now.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Senator Santorum, I want to stay with you on this, moving to jobs and the economy. In his State of the Union Address the other night, President Obama touted his record on jobs, citing more than 14 million new jobs and boasted of nearly 900,000 manufacturing jobs added in the past six years.Do you dispute his track record of creating jobs?SANTORUM: Well, the numbers just don\u2019t add up. I mean, they have not added manufacturing jobs. Manufacturing jobs have been lost in this country, 2 million of them. The bottom line is that this president has done more to take jobs away from the hard-working people who are struggling the most.And that\u2019s folks who are, as I said, the 74 percent of Americans who don\u2019t have a college degree. And they\u2019re out there talking about, well, we\u2019re going to provide free college for everybody. Well, who is going to pay for it? The 74 percent that don\u2019t have a college degree.They\u2019re not \u2014 nobody is focused. Let\u2019s just be honest, nobody is focused on the people who are struggling the most in America today. We talk about immigration. Talk about the president\u2019s immigration plan. He wants to bring in more and more people into this country. Let people who are here illegally stay in this country.Almost all of the people who are here illegally, and most of the people who came here legally over the last 20 years, they\u2019re working in wage-earning jobs. That is why wages have flat-lined.And we have unfortunately two political parties with most of the candidates in this field for some form of amnesty, some form of allowing people to stay here even though they\u2019re here illegally and for increasing levels of legal immigration.I\u2019m someone who believes that we need to be the party that stands for the American worker. And when we say we need to send people back, I mean we send people back.And let me just make one point. I was in Storm Lake, Iowa, the other day, near a Tyson\u2019s plant, 91 percent of the kids that go to the elementary school there are minority kids. And they said, well, what are you going to do with all of these people, their families, they\u2019ve lived here for a long time?I said, I\u2019m going to give them a gift. I\u2019m going to give them a gift of being able to help the country they were born in.Merge adds XXX were born in.SANTORUM: And I\u2019m going to export America, the education they were able to see. They learned English language. They learned about capitalism. They learned about democracy. You want to stop flow of immigrants?Let\u2019s send six million Mexicans, Hondurans, Guatemalans, El Savadorians...(BELL RINGS)... back into their country, so they can start a renaissance in their country so they won\u2019t be coming over here anymore.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Senator Santorum, thank you.SMITH: Governor Huckabee, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Admiral Mike Mullen, has said the greatest threat to our security is our national debt.Our national debt is now on pace to top $19 trillion. Yet, you as well as Ms. Fiorina have laid forward no plan to reform entitlements. How can you say you\u2019re going to pay down our country\u2019s debt without cutting Social Security or Medicare?HUCKABEE: Well, first of all, let\u2019s just remember that Social Security is not the government\u2019s money, it belongs to the people who had it taken out of their checks involuntarily their entire working lives.(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: For the government to say, well it is fault of working people that we have a Social Security problem, no. It is the fault of a government that used those people\u2019s money for something other than protecting those people\u2019s accounts. So let\u2019s not blame them and punish them.(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: But here is a fact, and I sometimes hear Republicans say well, we\u2019re going to have to cut this and extend the age. You know what I think a lot of times when I hear people say, well, let\u2019s make people work to their 70. That sounds great for white-collar people who sat at a desk most of their lives. You ever talk to somebody that stood on concrete floor for the first 40 years of their working life? Do you think they can stand another five years or 10 years, many of them will retired virtually crippled because they worked hard. And we\u2019re going to punish them some more? I don\u2019t think so. Here\u2019s the fact.(APPLAUSE)HUCAKBEE: Four percent economic growth, we fully fund Social Security and Medicare. Our problem is not that Social Security is just too generous to seniors. It isn\u2019t. Our problem is that our politicians have not created the kind of policies that would bring economic growth.And I still support strongly that we get rid of the 77,000 pages of the monstrous tax code...(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: ... pass the fair tax, supercharge this economy with the rocket fuel that happens with the consumption tax and we don\u2019t have to cut Social Security to any senior who has worked their lifetime for it.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Thank you, Governor Huckabee.SMITH: OK. We\u2019re going to continue this conversation. We\u2019re taking a quick break and then coming up, the candidates\u2019 plans for strengthening the middle class. We\u2019re live in North Charleston with the Republican Presidential Debate. We\u2019ll be right back.MORE(APPLAUSE)(COMMERICAL BREAK)REGAN: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate live from North Charleston.We want to jump right back in.Sandra is kicking it off.SMITH: All right, thanks, Trish.Well, let\u2019s get started with Ms. Fiorina.Today, the middle class represents about 50 percent of the U.S. population, down from about 61 percent back in 1971. That\u2019s according to Pew Research. The same research revealed a widening income gap in America. The rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer.What will you do to strengthen a middle class that is no longer the majority?FIORINA: For decades, the professional political class in both parties has been talking about the middle class. For decades, Republicans in particular have been talking about reducing the size and scope of government, spending less money, reducing the complexity.And yet, for 40 years, the government has gotten bigger and more expensive.We now have a 75,000 plus page tax code, although politicians have run for office for decades promising reform. And all the while, middle class incomes have stagnated.You see, when government gets bigger and bigger, more powerful, the rich get richer, the poor get poorer and the middle class gets squeezed.We need to understand who the job creators are in this country, because we need more jobs to grow the middle class and to grow the wages of the middle class.Who creates jobs?Small businesses, new businesses, family-owned businesses. (APPLAUSE)FIORINA: They create two thirds of the new jobs in this country and they employ half the people.I started out typing for a nine person real estate firm. My husband Frank started out driving a tow truck for a family-owned auto body shop. And we are crushing small businesses and destroying the middle class.So here\u2019s my blueprint to take back America. Let us first actually reform the tax code from 73,000 pages down to three. There\u2019s a 20-year-old plan to do exactly that.And then let us begin piece by piece to focus on every single dollar the government spends, so that we will spend less overall and still have enough for our priorities. And that requires the government to budget the way you do at home \u2014 examine every dollar, cut any dollar, move any dollar. The fancy term for that is zero- based budgeting, but I call it common sense.Citizens, we\u2019ve got to take our country back.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Thank you, Ms. Fiorina.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Governor Huckabee, you know it used to be you could graduate from high school and get a pretty good job at the local factory, enough to take care of your family and yourself. Those days seem to be gone. It\u2019s pretty hard to do that nowadays.Businesses are increasingly turning to automation to increase their productivity levels. It\u2019s happening right here, in fact, at the Boeing factory in North Charleston.The president says automation threatens workers\u2019 ability to get higher wages.Do you agree with that?And if so, do you have a solution?HUCKABEE: Let me go back to the reason so many people are having a hard time getting ahead. The tax system punishes them.Think about this. If you work really hard and you start moving up the economic ladder, you get bumped into a different tax bracket. So the government thinks it deserves more of your hard work than you do.And it\u2019s one of the reasons that no matter how many different reforms you have to a tax on people\u2019s productivity, you\u2019re still taxing their work, their savings. You\u2019re taxing their capital gains, inheritance, dividends, you\u2019re taxing everything that produces something.And it\u2019s way I really believe it\u2019s time to do something bold, not something minute. This is no time for a tap of the hammer, a twist of the screwdriver. It\u2019s time for something big. That\u2019s why the fair tax transforms our economy.(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: And we don\u2019t punish workers. It\u2019s the only way we\u2019re going to get middle class people moving ahead again, because the harder they work, the more they keep. No payroll tax deducted from their checks. They get their entire paycheck.(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: And, one of the most important parts, it\u2019s built on the common sense with which we raised our kids, and trained dogs. You reward behavior you want more of. And, you punish behavior you want less of. That\u2019s how I raise kids, it\u2019s how I trained our dogs, and folks, it\u2019s not that difficult.We now punish the behavior we say we want more of by taxing it, and we reward the behavior that we say we want less of, so if you make a good investment, we punish you with a tax. If you make a bad investment you can write that off and the rest of the taxpayers will help subsidize you, and bail you out.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Thank you very much, Governor Huckabee.Senator Santorum, 40% of babies born today are born to single moms. That\u2019s twice as high as reported back in 1980, and it\u2019s 11 times as high as in 1940. Studies show that children are always better off economically, most often \u2014 and emotionally, with two parents in a household. From a policy perspective, should the government be doing anything to encourage family formation?SANTORUM: You know, we\u2019ve had this debate about the economy, and we haven\u2019t talked the one issue now increasingly even the right, and even the are coming to agreement. I\u2019ve run around doing 300 town hall meetings talking about a book written by a liberal Harvard sociologist, not a normal thing for me to be talking about, but I now name Robert Putnam who wrote a book called, \u201cOur Kids\u201d.And, he wrote this book, I think, ostensibly to support the Democratic argument that the middle of America\u2019s hollowing out, and income gap is widening, and rich are getting richer. When he studied all the information as to what was going on, he realized that the biggest reason that we\u2019re seeing the hollowing out of the middle of America is the breakdown of the American family.The reality is that if you\u2019re a single parent \u2014 a child of a single parent, and you grew up in a single parent family neighborhood, you went to that single parent family school, the chance of you ever, ever reaching the top 20% of income earners is 3% in America. At least \u2014 I don\u2019t know about you, but that\u2019s not good enough. And, we have been too politically correct in this country because we don\u2019t want to offend anybody to fight for the lives of our children. (APPLAUSE)You want \u2014 You want to be shocked? You read the first few chapters of Mr. \u2014 Dr. Putnam\u2019 book. He talks about Port Clinton, Ohio and growing up there in the 1950\u2019s, and how poor kids actually survived and did well, even though they were poor and disadvantaged. But, then he goes to the towns today and these kids are failing, and failing miserably. They don\u2019t even have a shot, and we won\u2019t even have the courage to have leadership at the federal level \u2014 not with legislation, but the most powerful tool a president have, the bully pulpit to encourage each and everyone of you, churches and businesses, and educators, and community leaders to let\u2019s have a national campaign to rebuild the American family, and give every child its birthright which is a Mom and a Dad who loves them.That will change this economy.(CHEERING & APPLAUSE)REGAN: Thank you.SMITH: Thank you, Senator.We\u2019re not finished yet. More Republican Presidential Debate in North Charleston after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)SMITH: Welcome back, it\u2019s time for the closing statements. Candidates will each get one minute, starting with Senator Santorum.Thank you very much, I want to thank the people of Charleston, which has become a little bit of a second home to me, because I am very privileged to have two young men who go to the Citadel here and they\u2019re here tonight, my son John and my son Daniel.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: Ladies and gentlemen, America is frustrated and angry and looking for someone who\u2019s a fighter, but I also think they\u2019re looking for someone who\u2019s a winner. Somebody who can go out there and take on the establishment and make a difference. And take on someone who\u2019s going to be the person who\u2019s going to be between a Republican holding the presidency and that\u2019s Hillary Clinton.And there\u2019s one person on this stage, one person in the race who\u2019s done it and done it repeatedly. I\u2019ve taken on Hillary Clinton on the issues you care about. Partial-birth abortion.Go and google Rick Santorum and Hillary Clinton and there you\u2019ll see a five-minute debate. I\u2019ll let you decide who won the debate. I\u2019ll tell you who won, because we passed the bill and I know I\u2019m out of time but I\u2019m going to take some of Rand Paul\u2019s time here for a second.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: If you\u2019re looking for someone who fought Hillary Clinton on Iran\u2019s sanctions, she was one of four who voted \u2014 who\u2019s deciding vote who voted against Iran\u2019s sanctions, so we didn\u2019t get it in place as earlier as we should have.I\u2019ve fought battles against her. In 1994, I ran against the Clinton machine. James Carville and Paul Begala, ran the race against me when I took on the author of Hillary care.And each one of those battles, I won. You want a fighter, you want a winner, I\u2019d appreciate your vote. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Thank you, Senator Santorum. Governor Mike Huckabee.HUCAKBEE: Well, Rick, I\u2019m pretty sure I did also fight the Clinton machine because every election I was ever in in Arkansas, I assure you, they were behind it, helping finance and campaign for every opponent.And I share with you the understanding that it\u2019s going to be a tough battle. But I spent the first half of my adult life in the private and nonprofit sector, raising a family, understanding how tough it is for people to make it.And that first half of my life is what led me to believe that America needs a different kind of leadership, not people who spent their whole life running from one office to the next, and living off the government dime. And I got involved because I got sick of what I saw.I also believe that there\u2019s got to be some leadership that not only addresses the monetary and military issues of this country, but the moral issues of this country. At the end of every political speech, most of us say, God bless America.But how can he do that when we continue to slaughter 4,000 babies a day?(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: And I want to be the president that treats every person, including the unborn, as a person. And protect them under the 5th and 14th amendments of the constitution. I close with this word from a gentleman in East Texas named Butel Lucre (ph). He\u2019s 100 years old and I met him down in East Texas.HUCKABEE: And he said this to me. \u201cI sure wish, Mike, we had the days when The Ten Commandments were in all of our capitals and in every school, and we prayed again.You know, he may be 100 years old, but I believe some of those old ideas to get this country back where we unapologetically get on our knees before we get on our feet might be the best solutions we\u2019ve ever sought as a country.(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: And I ask for your support and your vote.Thank you.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Thank you, Governor.REGAN: Carly Fiorina?FIORINA: My husband Frank, that I mentioned, I love spending time with. He\u2019s down there. He was real excited the other day because in New Hampshire, he was introduced as my eye candy.(LAUGHTER)FIORINA: You know, everybody out there watching knows this. You cannot wait to see the debate between me and Hillary Clinton. You would pay to see that fight.(APPLAUSE)FIORINA: And that\u2019s because you know I will win. And that\u2019s important. We\u2019ve got to start by beating Hillary Clinton.All of my life, I have been told to sit down and be quiet. Settle. Settle. Don\u2019t challenge the system.That\u2019s what the American people are being told now and we have been told that for way too long \u2014 sit down and be quiet about our God, about our guns, about the abortion industry, settle for illegal immigration that\u2019s been a problem for decades, as so many of our problems have festered for decades. Accept a system of government and politics that no longer works for us.I will not sit down and be quiet. And neither will you.So I ask you to stand with me, fight with me, vote for me, citizens. It is time to take our future back, time to take our politics back. It is time to take our government back. Citizens, it is time. We must take our country back.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Thank you to all the candidates.(CROSSTALK)REGAN: That does it, everyone for the first debate right here in North Charleston.In just about two hours from now, at 9:00 p.m. Eastern seven more candidates are going to be taking to this stage.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama to Attend Event at Israeli Embassy Honoring Americans", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Take President Obama, add the Oscar-winning director Steven Spielberg and some stories of Holocaust heroism made for the silver screen, and throw in Ambassador Ron Dermer, who has had a somewhat tumultuous relationship with the White House over the Iran nuclear deal.It\u2019s a recipe for a drama-filled evening at the Israeli Embassy in Washington on Wednesday night.Mr. Obama is to make an unusual appearance there to honor Americans who risked their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust, his latest move to show solidarity with Israel after a historic rupture over the Iran accord. He will speak at a reception honoring two American and two Polish citizens posthumously with the Righteous Among the Nations Award for non-Jews who rescued Jews during World War II. Mr. Spielberg will be on hand to introduce the president. It will be a rare public appearance by Mr. Obama alongside Mr. Dermer, who figured prominently last year in the feud between the president and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the Iran nuclear agreement, helping to orchestrate an invitation for Mr. Netanyahu to address Congress to denounce the deal as it was being negotiated. Administration officials complained at the time that the ambassador was playing politics before Israeli elections.This time, Mr. Dermer collaborated with President Reuven Rivlin of Israel to orchestrate Mr. Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s invitation to speak at the event, timed to coincide with International Holocaust Remembrance Day and the 71st anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp.The president will honor the first American service member to be named Righteous Among the Nations.

{"Headline": "Ted Cruz\u2019s Negative Ads Go After Marco Rubio, Rather Than Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Mr. Cruz intends to direct his firepower at his Senate colleague after days of seeing Mr. Rubio inch up both in public polling and his own private surveys, according to two advisers to Mr. Cruz who spoke on the condition of anonymity.  After leading in the polls in Iowa for much of the last month, Mr. Cruz has slipped into second behind Mr. Trump in most public surveys.The change of direction is an abrupt shift, reflecting how volatile the race in Iowa remains: Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign only began airing negative spots against Mr. Trump this week and just put their first attack ad up against Mr. Rubio on Thursday on Iowa television. In this advertisement, Mr. Cruz shifts his attention from Donald J.

But his campaign is increasingly concerned about Mr. Rubio creeping up to 20 percent in the caucuses and finishing close to the two dominant candidates here.

{"Headline": "Obama Shifts Online Strategy on ISIS", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration on Friday announced an overhaul of its efforts to respond to online propaganda from the Islamic State after months of acknowledgments that it had largely failed in its attempts to counter extremist recruitment and exhortations to violence on social media.The administration has emphasized that it needs the assistance of some of the nation\u2019s biggest technology companies, and a group of top White House and national security officials flew to California on Friday to plead their case with executives. In a reflection of just how urgent the White House considers the efforts, the discussions involved officials like Denis R. McDonough, the White House chief of staff; Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch; James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence; James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director; and Lisa Monaco, the president\u2019s counterterrorism adviser. They met with Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, as well as top executives from Facebook, Twitter and Google. \u201cGiven the way the technology works these days, there surely are ways that we can disrupt paths to radicalization, to identify recruitment patterns and to provide metrics that allow us to measure the success of our counter-radicalization efforts,\u201d Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said before the meeting began in California.A task force will be created in the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department to coordinate the government\u2019s new effort. The State Department announced the creation of a center to respond to disinformation from extremist groups by highlighting their misdeeds and creating positive images of the West. It hopes to cultivate a global network of governments and nongovernmental organizations to help the effort. After the terrorist attack last year that killed 130 people in Paris, President Obama delivered a series of speeches seeking to reassure the country while demanding rapid changes within the administration to improve responses to jihadist propaganda. But the State Department has largely foundered in its efforts to fashion the kind of war room that would effectively counter the propaganda flowing out of the Islamic State, which is widely seen as adept at using social media to recruit and inspire followers.For help with these challenges, the administration turned on Friday to Silicon Valley. \u201cI do have a lot of confidence that those companies that are run by patriotic Americans are not interested in seeing their tools or their technology used by terrorists to harm innocent Americans,\u201d Mr. Earnest said.Those executives, however, are in charge of global corporations whose revenues are increasingly derived from people outside the United States. The executives have long pushed back on demands by governments to censor posts, provide access to user accounts, or hand over the keys to encryption technologies. If the companies begin to work with the government to monitor and remove posts or create antiterrorism counternarratives, they might have a harder time resisting similar requests from foreign governments.\u201cIt\u2019s a slippery slope with free speech where if you start making exceptions, where do you stop and where do you draw the line?\u201d said Emma Llanso, a director at the Center for Democracy in Technology, a think tank. She said the consequence could be an erosion of trust by consumers. That erosion of trust began in the wake of revelations from Edward J. Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor, who showed previous coordination among some technology companies with American surveillance efforts. Executives are eager to avoid a repeat.There is also the technological challenge of sifting through vast amounts of user-generated content in different languages on a growing number of platforms.Law enforcement officials for years have expressed frustration that technology companies are increasingly creating products like smartphones with encryption technologies that make it difficult, if not impossible, for the government to monitor conversations. But the discussion on Friday, while touching on encryption issues, was expected to focus largely on how social media companies could more effectively police their platforms. Some former top administration officials now work at prominent technology firms, including Jay Carney, a former White House press secretary, who is now a senior vice president at Amazon. Megan Smith, the administration\u2019s chief technology officer, who worked at Google, and Alexander Macgillivray, the administration\u2019s deputy chief technology officer, who worked at Twitter, both attended the meeting on Friday in California.\u201cThis meeting is the latest in the administration\u2019s continuing dialogue with technology providers and others to ensure we are bringing our best private and public sector thinking to combating terrorism,\u201d said Melanie R. Newman, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hundreds Vanishing in Egypt as Crackdown Widens, Activists Say", "Date": "2016-01-26", "News": "Supported byCAIRO \u2014 After the security forces raided the home of Islam Khalil, a 26-year-old salesman, last summer, he seemed to vanish without a trace.When Mr. Khalil finally emerged, four months later, at a police station in the port city of Alexandria, Egypt, he looked dirty and emaciated, according to his brother Nour, and reported that interrogators had suspended him from his arms and his legs, and administered electric shocks to his genitals.\u201cHe didn\u2019t look like the Islam I know,\u201d Nour Khalil recalled in a recent interview.Mr. Khalil is one of hundreds of Egyptians who have recently been subjected to what human rights groups call \u201cenforced disappearance,\u201d a harsh tactic that has become increasingly prevalent in Egypt as the government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi widens its crackdown on opponents, real or imagined.Instead of being held in the formal legal system \u2014 where tens of thousands of people have been detained under Mr. Sisi \u2014 people like Mr. Khalil have disappeared into a network of secretive detention centers, run by the security forces, where they are held incommunicado, without charge or access to a lawyer, for weeks and sometimes months, according to the rights groups.There, interrogators use the detainee\u2019s isolation and lack of legal protections to interrogate them harshly. Some have been forced to open their Facebook pages, and other social media sites, to identify friends and relatives. Many say they have been tortured.Nasser Amin, a lawyer with the state-funded National Council on Human Rights, said the situation was far more stark now than during the nearly three-decade rule of President Hosni Mubarak, when human rights activists generally could locate detainees within 24 hours and visit them within 15 days.\u201cThis is an unprecedented catastrophe for human rights and freedoms in Egypt,\u201d he said.The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms, an advocacy group based in Cairo, said it had documented 340 cases of enforced disappearances, 11 of them involving minors, from August to November. Last summer, the United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances said it had referred the cases of 66 people to Mr. Sisi\u2019s government for urgent action.The disappeared include members of the Muslim Brotherhood but also civil society activists, journalists and members of the public who unwittingly become caught in the state security dragnet. \u201cThe goal seems to be to terrorize society, to show that anyone who dares criticize the government will face a similar fate,\u201d said Mohamed Elmissiry, a researcher with Amnesty International.Public disquiet over disappearances has steadily grown, even though Egyptians have become somewhat inured to daily reports of new detentions. Television channels that are normally supportive of Mr. Sisi have aired shows that highlight the plight of people seeking news of missing relatives, and urged the authorities to respond sympathetically to their pleas for help. Newspapers have started to cover the issue.\u201cIt is a crime that cannot be forgiven,\u201d Amr Adib, a popular chat show host, said during a broadcast in December.Rights activists said the numbers started to surge after Maj. Gen. Magdi Abdel-Ghaffar, a veteran of the state security services, became interior minister in March. The minister\u2019s office did not respond to a request for an interview.But after months of flatly denying that anyone had disappeared in Egypt, the ministry in early January said it was investigating the cases of 101 missing people. Last week, officials raised that tally to 130.Lawyers and rights groups are skeptical that the ministry inquiry will go far: The government has already absolved itself in many of the cases under review, claiming that the detainees had been legally arrested, had joined militant groups or had fled Egypt illegally. Still, some activists saw the fact that the ministry had responded at all as a measure of growing concern about the impunity enjoyed by the security forces under Mr. Sisi. Although many Egyptians view their leader as a source of stability, particularly at a time of violent turmoil in other Arab countries, well-publicized accounts of police brutality, including extrajudicial killings, caused a stir late last year.Public attention was galvanized last month by the plight of Esraa el Taweel, a disabled young photographer who vanished for two weeks before eventually surfacing in a courthouse. Pictures of Ms. Taweel\u2019s tearful court appearances struck a chord, and she was released from jail in December, although she could still face charges.Ms. El Taweel said that she was not physically mistreated during her time in custody but that she \u201cheard men screaming and crying from torture.\u201dShe said that security officials pressured her to read from a prepared script, before a camera, admitting to membership of the Muslim Brotherhood, and threatened to detain her sisters if she did not cooperate. \u201cI told them, \u2018Have pity, they are still young, I\u2019ll tell you what you want,\u2019\u00a0\u201d she said.Other young people whose situations garnered less attention have received harsh treatment.Mazen Muhammad, 15, disappeared for five days after a raid on his family home in Cairo in September. When he surfaced he told relatives that, in an effort to force him to confess to being a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, officials had raped him with a wooden stick and administered electric shock to his genitals.Mazen is now awaiting trial on charges of belonging to the Muslim Brotherhood. \u201cHe does not know what belonging to a group even means,\u201d said his mother, Omina Marouf. \u201cHe is only a child.\u201dMost estimates of the disappearances do not include similar cases from Northern Sinai, where the military is fighting a branch of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, and which is out of bounds for rights monitors. Rights groups believe that many suspected of being militants are held at Al-Azouly military prison in Ismailia, a secretive site that the groups say is a center of some of the most egregious abuses.Some activists fear they could fall prey to the phenomenon they are documenting. On Jan. 10, for example, the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms said that plainclothes security agents had tried to abduct one of its board members, Ahmed Abdullah, even though he faces no criminal charges.Last July security officials picked up Attef Farrag, a businessman and a Muslim Brotherhood supporter, and his son Yehia, who relatives say was not politically active, from their home in Cairo. \u201cI thought they were going to kill us all,\u201d said his wife, wiping away tears as she described the raid.After months of silence, the two men reappeared in early January, when they contacted their family from Tora prison just outside Cairo. They now face charges of belonging to the Islamic State, their lawyer said. Attef Farrag told the lawyer he had been tortured.\u201cThere is no justice,\u201d said Mariam, Mr. Farrag\u2019s 17-year-old daughter. \u201cWe only expect to see them in our dreams.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Trump over his Canadian birth, delivered his most forceful response yet on Tuesday, knocking Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cNew York values,\u00e2\u0080\u009d questioning his knowledge of foreign affairs and suggesting that the billionaire developer was taking his cues from Democrats.It was a stark reversal for Mr. Cruz, who has consistently declined to engage with Mr. Trump while scolding reporters who ask about him for attempting to drive a wedge between Republicans.On Tuesday, with the birthplace questions festering, Mr. Cruz did not hesitate to shift course \u2014 even as he insisted, somewhat incongruously, that he would not reciprocate with attacks on Mr. Trump.Speaking to reporters in New Hampshire, Mr. Cruz noted that Mr. Trump had relied upon the analysis of Laurence H. Tribe, a Harvard law professor who has said that Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s argument for being eligible to run for president is far from settled law.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is more than a little strange to see Donald relying on, as authoritative, a liberal, left-wing judicial-activist Harvard law professor who is a huge Hillary supporter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz said of Mr. Tribe, who was once his professor at Harvard. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt starts to make you think, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Gosh, why are Hillary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strongest supporters backing Donald Trump?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Cruz went on to say that in recent elections, Democrats had succeeded in getting \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe nominee they wanted to run against in the general election.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt seems the Hillary folks are very eager to support Donald Trump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand the attacks that are being tossed my direction.\u00e2\u0080\u009dLater, in a radio interview on The Howie Carr Show, Mr. Cruz was asked about Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign playing \u00e2\u0080\u009cBorn in the U.S.A.\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Bruce Springsteen at a recent event.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, look, he may shift in his new rallies to playing \u00e2\u0080\u0098New York, New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099 because you know, Donald comes from New York and he embodies New York values,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Donald,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cseems to be a little bit rattled.\u00e2\u0080\u009dNoting Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent comments about Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shifting allegiances through the years, Mr. Cruz said that Mrs. Clinton \u00e2\u0080\u009cwould know well how to identify Democrats.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAnd in another radio interview, with the conservative host Hugh Hewitt, Mr. Cruz took direct aim at Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knowledge of foreign affairs. He alluded to Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seeming unfamiliarity in the last debate with the nuclear triad \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s three ways of firing nuclear weapons \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and questioned his sources for foreign policy information.\u00e2\u0080\u009cDoes a potential commander-in-chief know what the nuclear triad is \u00e2\u0080\u0094 much less is he or she prepared and able to strengthen it and keep this country safe?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz asked on Mr. Hewitt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s show.He added that a commander-in-chief must understand how to defeat our enemies \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot just based on what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s said on Sunday shows on TV, but actually understanding the nature of the threat and what is required to defeat it.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAfter largely sparing Mr. Cruz from attacks for months, Mr. Trump has in recent days sought to introduce doubts about his eligibility to run for president. Mr. Cruz has said the matter is not a concern, citing the examples of past presidential candidates like George Romney who were born outside the United States.\u00e2\u0080\u009cUnder longstanding federal law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz said last week before the final stop of a six-day bus tour in Iowa.But Mr. Trump has seized on the issue, wondering aloud whether Democrats would tie Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidential bid up in litigation.Mr. Trump raised questions about whether Ted Cruz was eligible to be president because he was born in Canada. Mr. Trump, in interviews this week, suggested that Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s birthplace could invite legal challenges.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a problem for him, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a problem obviously for the Republicans,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said on MSNBC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cMorning Joe.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe Constitution, in Article II, requires the president to be a \u00e2\u0080\u009cnatural born citizen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But the Constitution does not define that term, which is why Mr. Cruz, and other presidential candidates before him, have faced questions about their eligibility.To understand the term \u00e2\u0080\u009cnatural born citizen\u00e2\u0080\u009d as written by the framers of the Constitution, they pointed to British common law and legislative action by the First Congress. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBoth confirm that the original meaning of the phrase \u00e2\u0080\u0098natural born Citizen\u00e2\u0080\u0099 includes persons born abroad who are citizens from birth based on the citizenship of a parent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they wrote. In Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case, they concluded that \u00e2\u0080\u009cdespite the happenstance of a birth across the border, there is no question that Senator Cruz has been a citizen from birth and is thus a \u00e2\u0080\u0098natural born Citizen\u00e2\u0080\u0099 within the meaning of the Constitution.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Thomas KaplanMr. Trump has also taken shots at Mr. Cruz on other fronts. He questioned Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opposition to subsidies supported by the ethanol industry, a potential vulnerability in Iowa. And he has referred ominously to Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s faith, saying that \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot a lot of evangelicals come out of Cuba.\u00e2\u0080\u009dResponding to the second claim on Tuesday, Mr. Cruz repeated an invitation for Mr. Trump to attend church with him.\u00e2\u0080\u009cAny time someone is attacking your faith, that starts to suggest they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting really nervous,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz said.On Tuesday evening, at an event in Londonderry, N.H., Mr. Cruz was more playful, delivering a faux State of the Union speech (essentially his stump speech spoken in the future tense, as if read in 2018). He joked that he was \u201cparticularly pleased that my good friend Donald Trump will be building a hotel\u201d in what was once the Internal Revenue Service building. Mr. Cruz has called for the agency to be abolished.\u201cI\u2019m also pleased to tell you that Donald last week finished building the wall,\u201d Mr. Cruz said, referencing a wall along the southern border in a 2018 Cruz administration.An audience member asked who paid for it. Mr. Cruz had a quip ready. \u201cDonald did,\u201d he said.And when the event ended, the Cruz campaign treated supporters to a Springsteen song of its own choosing: \u201cBorn to Run.\u201d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Ask Well: Eye Redness", "Date": "2016-01-20", "News": "Reader Question \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 469 votesIt all depends on \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe cause, the age of the patient and what the patient has been doing and is willing to do about it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Ivan R. Schwab, a professor of ophthalmology at the University of California, Davis, School of Medicine and a spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology.Red eyes can be caused by a variety of factors, including dirty contact lenses, cigarette smoke, allergies, infections, dry eye, inflammation and glaucoma. Some of these problems are minor and readily treatable; others are medical emergencies. A sudden redness, especially accompanied by sharp pain, suggests the need for immediate medical care, said Dr. Schwab. He recommends against over-the-counter eye drops designed to relieve redness. These will constrict the blood vessels and reduce redness temporarily, but the blood vessels will dilate after the effect of the drops wears off. If used chronically, these drops may cause more of a \u00e2\u0080\u009crebound\u00e2\u0080\u009d redness because of the constant constricting and dilating of the vessels.Artificial tears, which simply lubricate the eye, are a better treatment for redness caused by irritants like pollution, cigarette smoke or nearby fires, he said.People who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t adequately clean their contacts may get away with it for a while, Dr. Schwab said, but as you age, it could lead to chronic redness and irritation. Redness may also indicate that a contact lens doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fit properly; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to replace it with one that fits, since an ill-fitting lens may damage the eye, he said. Symptoms may also be a clue to the cause of eye redness. Itchy eyes may indicate an allergic response, tearing could be a sign of dry eye, and yellowish discharge may indicate an infection, said Jeffrey Walline, an optometrist and associate dean for research at Ohio State University. The cause will determine whether chronically red eyes can be successfully treated, he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA comprehensive eye exam would be the main thing to do, to root out the cause.\u00e2\u0080\u009dRelated:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "Ta-Nehisi Coates Criticizes Bernie Sanders Over His Opposition to Reparations", "Date": "2016-01-20", "News": "Last week in Iowa, a host at a minority-focused Brown and Black Forum asked Mr. Sanders if he would be in favor of \u00e2\u0080\u009creparations for slavery.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFirst of all, its likelihood of getting through Congress is nil. Second of all, I think it would be very divisive.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Coates wrote that Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opposition to reparations because it was not likely to get through Congress didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make sense because many of the policies the senator is proposing \u2014 such as tuition-free public colleges, single-payer Medicare for all, and a $1-trillion jobs and infrastructure bill \u2014 was also not likely to be passed.\u00e2\u0080\u009cSanders says the chance of getting reparations through Congress is \u2018nil,\u2019 a correct observation which could just as well apply to much of the Vermont senator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own platform,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Coates wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf this is the candidate of the radical left \u00e2\u0080\u0094 then expect white supremacy in America to endure well beyond our lifetimes and lifetimes of our children. Reparations is not one possible tool against white supremacy. It is the indispensable tool against white supremacy. One cannot propose to plunder a people, incur a moral and monetary debt, propose to never pay it back, and then claim to be seriously engaging in the fight against white supremacy.\u201dWhile Mr. Sanders, in the same response in Iowa, said the answer, instead of reparations, was creating jobs, making public colleges free and directing more resources to poor communities, Mr. Coates wrote that this view addresses \u00e2\u0080\u009cblack people not so much as a class specifically injured by white supremacy, but rather, as a group which magically suffers from disproportionate poverty.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Coates wrote that Mr. Sanders \u00e2\u0080\u009cshould be directly confronted and asked why his political imagination is so active against plutocracy, but so limited against white supremacy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cRaising the minimum wage doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really address the fact that black men without criminal records have about the same shot at low-wage work as white men with them; nor can making college free address the wage gap between black and white graduates,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Coates wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHousing discrimination, historical and present, may well be the fulcrum of white supremacy. Affirmative action is one of the most disputed issues of the day. Neither are addressed in the \u2018racial justice\u2019 section of Sanders platform.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Coates wrote that he had hoped to talk directly with Mr. Sanders before publishing and that he had reached out to Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign over the last three days but did not receive a response.Reached by phone Tuesday afternoon, Symone Sanders, Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s national press secretary, held off commenting on the article but said that Mr. Sanders was always open to having conversations.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Was He Gay, Bisexual or Bowie? Yes", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported byAnd it became quickly apparent online that to one diverse group that came of age during his ascendance, Mr. Bowie, 69, was not just a pop idol but a lifeline.In the days since his death, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender fans have shared how the rocker influenced their lives and helped bring queer culture into the mainstream in the 1960s and 1970s. In essays, interviews, on Twitter and on Facebook, they told how his rise gave them strength.Many saw a kindred spirit in Mr. Bowie\u2019s various characters and gender-bending style, beginning with his first androgynous persona, Ziggy Stardust, in 1972. Not only had he made a glittery, alien-looking creature look cool, he had helped pioneer a sexy (and marketable) form of otherness that mainstream artists have tried to replicate in the decades since.The edginess of Mr. Bowie\u2019s style earned him fast stardom and the freedom to play with gender and sexuality. He retired the Ziggy character, but continued to play with his image in a way that forced his viewers to rethink ideas of gender.\u201cAt the beginning of the show, he appeared as a kind of Marlene Dietrich, but with a white captain\u2019s jacket and a cap,\u201d Mr. Gaultier wrote. \u201cIt was obvious that it was not Bowie playing a captain, but Bowie playing Marlene Dietrich playing a man.\u201dAlthough Mr. Bowie freely experimented with fluidity in music, gender and fashion, he was frequently asked to categorize his sexuality with a label.The preoccupation with the was-he-or-wasn\u2019t-he part of Mr. Bowie\u2019s sexuality often overshadows his more nuanced contributions to queer culture through imagery and style. Still, he was not really an activist.Instead, the musician \u201cprovided a soundtrack and visuals which reshaped our world.\u201d In other words, he was not a campaigner for gay rights, but Mr. Bowie\u2019s art complemented a larger fight for acceptance and civil rights.\u201cHe may have bucked or played coy with identity labels \u2014 presaging our modern situation quite well,\u201d Mr. Lowder continued, \u201cbut, especially at the beginning of his career, he was recognizably \u2018gay.\u2019 Culturally speaking, I think it\u2019s a label he deserves.\u201dAdvertisement"}

El gobierno sostuvo que los estudiantes fueron asesinados e incinerados por miembros de un c\u00e1rtel de la droga. Pero en septiembre de este a\u00f1o, un informe preliminar elaborado por un grupo de expertos de la Comisi\u00f3n Interamericana de Derechos Humanos a partir de im\u00e1genes de sat\u00e9lite, afirm\u00f3 que era poco probable que los cuerpos hayan sido incinerados.Y el hecho de que el gobierno haya negado la petici\u00f3n recurrente para que investigadores internacionales entrevisten a los militares en el lugar de la desaparici\u00f3n no ha servido m\u00e1s que para alimentar el escepticismo de la ciudadan\u00eda.A\u00fan no es demasiado tarde para que el gobierno reconozca que su investigaci\u00f3n ha fracasado y les de a los investigadores internacionales acceso a los funcionarios gubernamentales implicados.

Trump, boycotting the Fox News debate but not one of the network\u2019s hosts, insisted to Bill O\u2019Reilly on Wednesday night that he wasn\u2019t \u201cwalking away\u201d from a tough situation even as Mr. O\u2019Reilly said he thought Mr. Trump had erred in skipping the final face-off before the Iowa caucuses and pleaded with him to change his mind. Mr. Trump, in an interview on Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show that had been scheduled last week, repeatedly said he was forced to bypass the debate because of a \u201cchildish\u201d statement by the network, mocking him as unserious in his approach to the presidency as he demanded it remove Megyn Kelly as a debate host. \u201cI\u2019m trying to convince you that your tack is wrong, because it\u2019s better for the folks to see you in the debate format,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Reilly said. He pointed to Newt Gingrich using negative questions during the debate in South Carolina in 2012 to great effect as he pummeled the moderator John King of CNN in the Republican primary campaign. Mr. Gingrich later won the primary in the state. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, that\u2019s the way to go here,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Reilly said. \u201cThis has to do with the stupidity of Fox and what they did,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Mr. O\u2019Reilly at one moment pointed to his cheek and urged Mr. Trump to follow biblical teachings to turn the other one. Mr. Trump said he prefers the biblical dictum about \u201can eye for an eye.\u201d Mr. O\u2019Reilly defended Ms. Kelly, saying that her questions in the first debate were within bounds. \u201cI disagree,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Mr. O\u2019Reilly appeared to alternately prove the point that Mr. Trump dictates what the news media around him does and make the point that the candidate\u2019s decision to boycott the debate is not without risks; voters, he pointed out, are just beginning to tune in, and they may wonder about a candidate who calls off participation based on questions. \u201cIf you\u2019re elected president, you\u2019re gonna get a lot more than that,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Reilly said. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Mr. Trump\u2019s main rival in the Iowa caucuses, has happily shared that sentiment over the last two days. \u201cWhat does it say when Donald tells the men and women of Iowa, \u2018My time is more important than your time?\u2019\u200a\u201d Mr. Cruz told attendees at an event in West Des Moines. \u201cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve spent seven years with a narcissistic, self-involved president in Washington,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cSo if Donald finds Megyn so terribly frightening, I yesterday suggested an alternative. He and I are the leading candidates in this state right now.\u201d He added: \u201cIf gentle Donald cannot handle Kelly, how about, for a moderator instead, Mark Levin? Or if he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like Mark Levin, how about Sean Hannity? Or if he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like Sean Hannity, how about Rush Limbaugh?\u201dLater on Wednesday night, a group of \u201csuper PACS\u201d supporting Mr. Cruz released a statement saying that they would donate $1.5 million to veterans groups if Mr. Trump agreed to Mr. Cruz\u2019s one-on-one debate offer.As the interview on Fox News wound down, Mr. O\u2019Reilly said that he had bought Mr. Trump many milkshakes in the past, using that as collateral to ask the candidate to rethink his stand.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

While Mr. Trump is elsewhere in Iowa on Saturday, his son, Donald J. Trump Jr., will take part in Gov. Terry Branstad\u2019s Annual Deer Hunt in the southern part of the state. Mr. Trump described hunting as \u201crelaxing.\u201d \u201cBeing from my family and New York, in a city like that, I think the fact that I was in a tree stand or a duck blind on many mornings probably kept me out of a lot of other trouble I would have gotten into growing up, and I love the lifestyle,\u201d said Mr. Trump, calling hunting \u201can important tradition, a very American position.\u201d Donald J.

{"Headline": "Vietnam Faces Last-Minute Maneuvering for Communist Party Leadership", "Date": "2016-01-18", "News": "Supported by\u201cYou could see his face just freeze,\u201d Mr. Michalak, now the senior vice president of the U.S.-Asean Business Council, recalled with a chuckle. Mr. Michalak quickly told Mr. Dung that he wanted to toast his health and make a friendly suggestion: The caterers should serve American beef at the next such diplomatic event.\u201cHe just cracked up, and we started drinking vodka,\u201d Mr. Michalak said. \u201cAnd ever since then, at every one of these dinners, he always would make sure to have a shot of vodka with me.\u201dOn Wednesday, Vietnam\u2019s ruling Communist Party is to convene its national congress, which meets every five years to select the country\u2019s top leaders. And Mr. Dung, a charismatic prime minister who favors closer ties with the United States, is battling to succeed Nguyen Phu Trong, a conservative apparatchik looking to stay on in the party\u2019s top job of general secretary, according to several analysts, diplomats and business leaders.The outcome of these congresses is usually settled months in advance, but a protracted spat between factions loyal to Mr. Dung and Mr. Trong has resulted in last-minute maneuvering. Whoever comes out on top could determine the future of Vietnam\u2019s carefully calibrated strategic balance between China, its ideological ally and main trading partner, and the United States, which the party elite increasingly considers an important counterweight against growing Chinese influence in the region.\u201cIf the conservative faction emerges the winner at this party congress, the U.S. may find that it would need to do even more trust-building with Hanoi\u201d than it has done lately, said Phuong Nguyen, an associate fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\u201cTrade and investment ties are expected to still forge ahead if the TPP is ratified,\u201d she said, but she predicted that it would be more difficult for Washington to expand military ties with Vietnam if Mr. Trong\u2019s faction prevailed.At 66, Mr. Dung is five years younger than Mr. Trong. But according to a longstanding rule, the age limit for a member of the Politburo to start a new term is 65. The leadership can grant an exception, however, and Mr. Dung has been angling for one so he can succeed Mr. Trong as the party\u2019s general secretary, several Vietnamese political observers have said in recent months.That prospect, once considered almost inevitable, has come to seem less likely in recent days as Mr. Trong and his supporters have sought to force Mr. Dung into retirement, analysts said. The apparent turnaround has caused concern among Vietnam\u2019s urban intellectuals, many of whom view Mr. Dung as the best hope for further integration into the global economy and curbing Chinese influence in the region.\u201cDung doesn\u2019t have many allies in the Politburo, and it\u2019s very hard for him to change the status quo, so we are worrying,\u201d said a Vietnamese academic at a state-affiliated institution, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive political matter.While Mr. Trong\u2019s supporters are said to have the upper hand in the elite, 16-member Politburo, they are worried that Mr. Dung, an unusually dynamic prime minister, has undercut the party leadership by strengthening government institutions and building a vast patronage network among provincial party bosses and in the 175-member Central Committee.One chain of events that has been discussed in recent days is that the party\u2019s top four leaders, including Mr. Dung and Mr. Trong, will retire and cede power to a younger crop of Politburo members, apparently in a victory for Mr. Trong\u2019s camp. Some analysts said Mr. Trong may even remain in his post for another year or two to keep a lid on tensions inside the party elite.It is not entirely clear how the leadership shuffle will affect Vietnam\u2019s warming relationship with the United States, or its efforts to assert its economic independence and sovereignty over parts of the South China Sea without angering China.In May 2014, the Chinese oil rig episode set off street protests in some cities that were initially tolerated \u2014 some said encouraged \u2014 by the government, and then riots at industrial parks in central and southern provinces. Mr. Dung, unlike other party leaders, responded to the Chinese move with denunciations of Beijing\u2019s territorial ambitions that appealed to Vietnamese patriotism.Relations between the Communist neighbors have since recovered somewhat, and Mr. Dung shook hands with President Xi Jinping of China when he visited Hanoi in November. But many Vietnamese object to China\u2019s island-building projects in disputed waters, viewing them as reminders of Chinese imperial conquests of Vietnam. They also resent China\u2019s economic influence here, in the form of growing trade, tourism and infrastructure projects.Mr. Dung\u2019s economic record has been marred by scandals at state-owned enterprises and a bout of debilitating inflation. Yet he is still widely seen as the party\u2019s strongest proponent of opening the Vietnamese economy to more foreign investment and competition, and of Vietnam\u2019s membership in the TPP.\u201cUntil now, none of our leaders did much to internationalize Vietnam, but Dung is different \u2014 he stands out,\u201d said Nguyen Viet Ha, who runs a chemical-trading company in Hanoi. \u201cBefore, we depended on China a bit more, and now we\u2019re a bit more independent and have access to Western technology.\u201dBui Kien Thanh, an American-educated businessman who has advised Mr. Dung and other prime ministers on economic policy, acknowledged that such policies had left Mr. Dung open to criticism. \u201cA lot of people say Nguyen Tan Dung is an American ally and so on, but that is only talk,\u201d he said. \u201cNguyen Tan Dung sees very well that economic opening cannot go without good relations with the U.S.\u201dOther analysts and business leaders said relations with the United States would remain on an upward swing even if Mr. Dung were forced to retire. Mr. Trong\u2019s visit to the White House in July \u2014 the first by a Vietnamese Communist Party boss \u2014 was a clear sign of a growing consensus across party factions that better relations with the United States is in Vietnam\u2019s national interest, they said.Mr. Michalak, the former American ambassador, said Vietnam\u2019s relationship with China had \u201cdropped down a few degrees\u201d since the oil rig dispute. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to change anytime soon no matter what government gets in\u201d at the congress, he added.The United States, meanwhile, eased a longstanding ban on the sale of lethal arms to the country in October 2014, saying there have been incremental improvements in Vietnam\u2019s human rights record.But human rights activists have pushed back against that narrative, and many said they expect no improvement in civil liberties as a result of the leadership transition.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Supreme Court and a Life Barely Lived", "Date": "2016-01-07", "News": "Supported byIT wasn\u2019t surprising that a man named Joshua Braam, who died in November in Muskego, Wis., at the age of 36, didn\u2019t make the engaging \u201clives they lived\u201d lists that appeared at year\u2019s end. The life he lived was constricted in the extreme. A series of savage beatings by his father, who had obtained custody after a divorce and whose history of abuse had been reported to the local child welfare authorities to no avail, left Joshua comatose and permanently brain damaged at the age of 4. At 12, he was adopted by Richard and Ginger Braam, who cared for him for the rest of his life.His biological mother, acting on his behalf, sued the Winnebago County, Wis., Department of Social Services for depriving Joshua of the \u201cliberty\u201d protected by the due process clause of the 14th Amendment. The Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of that claim, in a 1989 opinion written by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, provoked Justice Harry A. Blackmun to exclaim in dissent: \u201cPoor Joshua!\u201dChief Justice Rehnquist\u2019s opinion for the 6-3 majority took the narrowest possible view of the facts in holding that the county agency, despite its employees\u2019 absolute knowledge of the threat that Randy DeShaney posed to his son\u2019s welfare, breached no constitutional duty to Joshua. More than a year before the final beating, the boy was hospitalized with suspicious injuries, but a \u201cchild protection team\u201d assigned to look into the situation quickly returned him to his father. Other emergency room visits followed. County social workers visited the home 20 times, taking notes but no action on occasions when the father said the boy was too sick to see them.Chief Justice Rehnquist couldn\u2019t get past the fact that the actual injuries were inflicted not by government agents but by a private person. (The father was prosecuted, convicted and served a brief prison sentence.) \u201cNothing in the language of the Due Process Clause,\u201d the chief justice wrote, \u201crequires the state to protect the life, liberty, and property of its citizens against invasion by private actors.\u201d The opinion continued: \u201cThe Clause is phrased as a limitation on the state\u2019s power to act, not as a guarantee of certain minimal levels of safety and security.\u201dIt was true, the chief justice acknowledged, that the court\u2019s precedents imposed a degree of government accountability for the welfare of people held in custody, in prison or other government-run institutions. But these precedents offered \u201cno help,\u201d he said; Joshua was at home, not in government custody, at the time of his injuries. \u201cThat the state once took temporary custody of Joshua does not alter the analysis,\u201d Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote, \u201cfor when it returned him to his father\u2019s custody, it placed him in no worse position than that in which he would have been had it not acted at all; the state does not become the permanent guarantor of an individual\u2019s safety by having once offered him shelter.\u201dAs Justice William J. Brennan Jr. pointed out in a dissenting opinion that Justices Blackmun and Thurgood Marshall joined, it was the state that \u201cestablished a child-welfare system specifically designed to help children like Joshua.\u201d When the sole agency assigned by Wisconsin law to protect children failed to do its job, Justice Brennan wrote, the state \u201ceffectively confined Joshua DeShaney within the walls of Randy DeShaney\u2019s violent home.\u201d He added: \u201cToday\u2019s opinion construes the Due Process Clause to permit a state to displace private sources of protection, and then, at the critical moment, to shrug its shoulders and turn away from the harm that it has promised to try to prevent.\u201dSo Joshua DeShaney Braam leaves a haunting legacy. The court receives regular requests to revisit or modify the decision, and turns the cases down without comment. For several years after the decision, I kept track of each new appeal that invited the justices to change course, but eventually, I abandoned the project. I can\u2019t imagine the Roberts court revisiting the case.I\u2019d like to end this first column of the new year on a more uplifting note. Along with millions of others, I recently received the annual form letter from the Social Security Administration that contained the usual information about anticipated benefits and adjustments. Skimming through the letter, I stopped on page seven at the following paragraph:That was it. That was the government speaking: no shouting from the rooftops, no jargon, no red tape. Just three simple English sentences emerging from the bowels of the bureaucracy to render what was nearly unthinkable not so long ago into ordinary American life.In its very simplicity, the paragraph was a fitting coda to a year in which the court added a remarkable chapter to the continuing story of human freedom and dignity. Happy new year.Advertisement"}

Chris Christie, using town halls in this state and in Iowa to unfurl a long list of the New Jersey governor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deviations from conservative orthodoxy.But speaking to reporters on Thursday, Mr. Rubio gladly seized on an opportunity to take aim at Jeb Bush, an indication of just how muddled the so-called establishment lane of candidates has become in New Hampshire leading to its Feb. 9 primary.\u00e2\u0080\u009cOn the issue of Common Core, while we were off and many conservatives around the country were fighting against the Obama agenda, Jeb was nowhere to be found,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Rubio, pointing to the national education standards, which have been criticized by the right, to explain how he differed from Mr. Bush. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn fact, he spent most of his time traveling the country trying to push Common Core onto our local school districts and across the country. And in some instances even criticized the conservative movement on some of these things.\u00e2\u0080\u009dTo nominate Mr. Bush, Mr. Rubio argued, would only continue a Republican pattern of elevating candidates who have run before or are well-known.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just keep electing the next person in line, we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just keep electing the people that raise the most money or have the most endorsements,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Rubio, 44, continued, reviving a generational argument that he had played down somewhat, as Mr. Christie, 53, appeared to pose a greater threat to him than Mr. Bush, 62. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur party needs to turn the page and move forward.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAsked if he thought Mr. Bush was committed to overturning President Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policies, Mr. Rubio only said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can tell you, I will.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Rubio, who is aiming to outpoll the other establishment-aligned candidates in Iowa and New Hampshire, is struggling with the same challenge others from his wing of the party are facing: how to discern his stiffest competition in this state.His comments came a day after a CNN-WMUR poll of New Hampshire Republican primary voters indicated that Mr. Bush was receiving 10 percent of the vote \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the same share as Mr. Rubio. Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio took 6 percent in the survey, the same as Mr. Christie, though Mr. Kasich has fared better in other recent New Hampshire polls.The CNN-WMUR poll showed Donald J.

{"Headline": "Chris Christie Says Hillary Clinton Would Cut Marco Rubio\u2019s \u2018Heart Out\u2019", "Date": "2016-01-07", "News": "Mr. Rubio is deft at delivering speeches. But nobody in the Republican presidential field, with the exception of Donald J. Trump, is as skilled as Mr. Christie at belittling his rivals.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t my first rodeo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Christie, a former federal prosecutor. Referring to Mr. Rubio, he added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis guy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been spoon-fed every victory he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ever had in his life.\u00e2\u0080\u009dOn Thursday in Nashua, N.H., Mr. Rubio laughed off Mr. Christie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s barbs and underscored his argument that Mr. Christie was a fake conservative who would extend the Obama administration, not undo its work. But the back-and-forth was opportunity-rich for Mr. Christie.It gave him a chance to grab the spotlight after months of being eclipsed by Mr. Trump as the bluntest-speaking candidate in the race. It gave him a chance to showcase his talents as a political performer. And it gave him a chance to demonstrate that Mr. Rubio, 44, a first-term senator from Florida, might not be as battle-ready as his supporters believe, or as tough as his muscular new campaign ads might suggest.Increasingly, as he did in mocking Mr. Rubio, Mr. Christie has been arguing to voters that he is electable in November \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and that, by implication, his rivals are not.Mr. Bush, who the polls show is also inching up in New Hampshire, is also engaging in increasingly aggressive combat. A piece of mail from the super PAC supporting him, Right to Rise USA, arrived in homes in New Hampshire on Thursday: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs Chris Christie a fiscal conservative? Not exactly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it warns, alongside a litany of red-letter warnings about Mr. Christie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic stewardship of New Jersey. The group is also running television advertisements attacking Mr. Rubio in several states.Mr. Christie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tarring of Mr. Rubio \u00e2\u0080\u0094 whom he accused of starting the fight \u00e2\u0080\u0094 came as his television ads preach Republican unity for the sake of defeating Mrs. Clinton.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s amazing about the Christie campaign is that what he says on the campaign stump totally contradicts what he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been saying in his paid television advertising, which shows he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a strategy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Scott Reed, a longtime Republican strategist who is the top political adviser to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.For Mr. Rubio, the exchange was the second he has had lately with a rival who hit back harder.Moreover, while Mr. Rubio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign worked to discredit Mr. Cruz for his votes against military spending and domestic surveillance, Mr. Christie was gaining steam in New Hampshire.He began taunting Mr. Rubio for what he said was shirking his Senate duties. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDude, show up to work and vote,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the governor said late last month. He also suggested Mr. Rubio was uninterested in campaigning, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never here.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Rubio did not hit back hard at Mr. Christie until Thursday, when he delivered a detailed attack on Mr. Christie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record.\u00e2\u0080\u009cChris has a very liberal record for a Republican,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Rubio told reporters in Nashua. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI mean, he supported Common Core. He ran for office as a supporter of gun control. He personally gave a contribution to Planned Parenthood. So I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really want to have a conversation about the issues, because the truth is our next president has to be someone who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to overturn all the damage Barack Obama has done to America, not continue it.\u00e2\u0080\u009dYet the sniping Mr. Rubio is now engaged in is somewhat at odds with his professed image as an Obama-esque Republican: upbeat, optimistic and above the fray. Mr. Rubio also has noticeably darkened his tone on the campaign trail. Once the candidate who dismissively criticized Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cMake America Great Again\u00e2\u0080\u009d slogan by telling audiences, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerica is great,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Rubio has been lamenting the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trajectory more and more in recent days.\u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerica is a great nation in decline,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said on Thursday at a house party in Bedford, N.H.Voters seemed confused by that message.Debbie Urbanik, 48, of Dunbarton, N.H., said she was surprised by how hard a line Mr. Rubio took on Mr. Obama. She said she voted for the president, but could see herself voting for a Republican this year. She was not sure yet whether that might be Mr. Rubio.\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo listen to somebody stand up there saying, \u00e2\u0080\u0098This is all Barack Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fault,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is not a good message,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I had heard him stand up there and say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Listen, our economy is broken and it started with this, and it evolved through this, and I want to fix it this way,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I would have gotten excited.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was hoping I would walk out of here like, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Yeah,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Urbanik added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel as great as I wanted to.

{"Headline": "David Bowie\u2019s Fashion Legacy", "Date": "2016-01-12", "News": "Supported byUnbuttonedIn a very essential way, Mr. Bowie helped make fashion writ large \u2014 fashion the system, fashion the pop culture force \u2014 the ever-mutating megalith we know today. It\u2019s why his effect is felt not just in men\u2019s wear but in women\u2019s wear, too; not just in ready-to-wear, but in couture; from high to low and back again.Dries Van Noten, who reworked recordings from \u201cHeroes\u201d as a soundtrack for his fall 2011 women\u2019s wear show and the same season gave his men\u2019s models Ziggy Stardust hairdos, put it like this: \u201cHe opened the great big gates to our future and sparked in us that creativity that proves vital even to this day.\u201dWhen it comes to image and legacy and the annals of sartorial history, we tend to romanticize people of \u201cstyle\u201d: those men and women whose single-minded adherence to a specific look transcends the vagaries of popular dress to become an instantly recognizable signature, a part of their biography for evermore. We celebrate their unique point of view, their ability to define their own wardrobe, and hold them up as role models. We give less attention to \u201cfashion\u201d \u2014 except in the sense of fashion victim. It\u2019s considered too mutable, too ephemeral, to leave a lasting impression in the sands of time.Mr. Bowie was the answer to all that, the argument for having a different conversation. Because he was not about style (at least in the classic sense). He was about fashion.22 PhotosHe was about the power of the changing look: the in-today-out-tomorrow, blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it opportunity to redefine the character that you are playing \u2014 on stage, in life, no matter \u2014 through what you wear. He embodied the conviction that there was value in constant reinvention, and his life and success was proof positive of his belief, not just for fans, but for the creative community that cared about clothes. Though performers and designers had flirted with transformation before, he codified the idea and made it a working principle.The result meant, as the designer Rosetta Getty pointed out, that despite the avalanche of social media appreciations on Monday, almost none of the pictures posted to Instagram and Facebook were the same.Each of those looks had its own force and fallout: from the mod of 1966 to the space-age metallics of \u201cSpace Oddity\u201d in 1969; the spike-haired, cosmetically enhanced, body-flaunting avant-garde ambiguity of Ziggy Stardust; the disruptive decadence of Aladdin Sane and Halloween Jack; the knife-edge monochromatic suiting of the Thin White Duke; the pleated, pastel tailoring of the Serious Moonlight tour; the Alexander McQueen shredded Union Jack historicism of \u201cEarthling\u201d (1997), and so on and on.But on a macro level, it was the theory and strategy behind the swings and roundabouts that were his most lasting contributions to the evolving narrative of dress. As he wrote in his 1980 song called (what else?) \u201cFashion\u201d:\u201cListen to me \u2014 don\u2019t listen to me/Talk to me \u2014 don\u2019t talk to me/Dance with me \u2014 don\u2019t dance with me.\u201dMr. Bowie may have paved the way for such masters of musical reinvention as Madonna and Lady Gaga, for rock idols who swap collaborators and identities from tour to tour, but he also paved the way for designers like Marc Jacobs and Miuccia Prada, who are known for the about-face of their aesthetics from one season to the next: one moment all pastel 1960s jolie madame A-line and cropped trousers; six months later deliberately frumpy collages of fabrics and functions; six months after that adrift in vintage opulence. It\u2019s not that the clothes themselves look like David Bowie\u2019s. It\u2019s the idea behind their seemingly counterintuitive progression that does.The lesson of his wardrobe was this: As soon as they recognize you, switch it up. Does that sound familiar? It\u2019s the fashion refrain of today, celebrated and decried in equal measure but defining of the sector. Skirts are short \u2014 they are long. Jeans are pegged \u2014 they are flared. The \u201950s are in \u2014 the \u201980s are in.It was as if, having gotten an industry majority to zigzag to his tune (metaphorically, and, occasionally, literally), he had moved on to another thing entirely.We shouldn\u2019t have expected anything less.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Afghan Officials, Voicing Security Fears on Facebook, Are Fired for Their Trouble", "Date": "2016-01-23", "News": "Supported byIn another sense, successful social media activism can look a lot like insubordination: The government fired Mr. Rasoolyar for his trouble.In an order dismissing the two officials, Mr. Sediqqi cited the security council as saying that \u201cusing social media for expressing disapproval of any government decisions or policies can in no way be tolerated,\u201d and that violations of the policy would result in \u201cserious action.\u201dOf course, government and corporate officials everywhere are grappling with the challenges of social media. In the Afghan government\u2019s case, though, officials struggling to address war and an economic crisis seem to have decided that they cannot bear being second-guessed.Mr. Ahmadi was fired after he went online with his concerns about a reported influx of Qaeda fighters to his province, and the kidnapping and beheading of travelers by fighters from the upstart local Islamic State affiliate.Mr. Ahmadi said the fact that the objections originated with the National Security Council, which is headed by Mr. Ghani, indicated a political decision at the highest levels of the state.\u201cI believe the order to sack me came from the president himself,\u201d he said.The officials\u2019 firings were \u201ca plain violation of freedom of speech and undermining the media law,\u201d said Asif Ashna, a political activist who previously served as a deputy spokesman for the Afghan chief executive, Abdullah Abdullah, and who has since become a prominent critic of Mr. Ghani\u2019s government. \u201cIf it is not stopped here, I am afraid the restrictions on speech will increase,\u201d he said.Sayed Fazlullah Wahidi, a political analyst who formerly served as governor of both Kunar and Herat Provinces, said the decision to fire the two officials \u201cwas absolutely wrong.\u201dHe said that Mr. Rasoolyar\u2019s Facebook post was widely credited with having persuaded the government to take action in Helmand, and that the deputy governors had done the right thing. \u201cThe officials were acting within their official prerogative to share information with the media,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are assigned by law to disclose confirmed information.\u201dLike others who saw something larger at work, Mr. Wahidi suggested that politics of another order might have played a role, as government officials \u201ctry to find excuses to fire those people who didn\u2019t work for them during the presidential election campaigns, to replace them with their own people who worked in their campaign teams.\u201d\u201cThis is a trick they use to get rid of those they dislike,\u201d he added.Sayed Zafar Hashemi, a spokesman for the government, rejected the idea that Mr. Rasoolyar\u2019s post on Facebook had a significant effect on the military\u2019s response in Helmand, noting that Mr. Ghani had begun monitoring the fighting long before.\u201cThe decision was never because they posted on Facebook, but rather because they broke a disciplinary rule that jeopardizes morale of the Afghan security forces,\u201d Mr. Hashemi said in an email. In video teleconferences and other meetings, he said, \u201cthey did not raise those \u2018concerns\u2019 while communicating with the president and leadership of the government.\u201d\u201cThe president and his government fully respect and believe in freedom of speech, and we strive to protect it as an invaluable achievement of the Afghan people,\u201d he said.Afghan officials\u2019 use of social media has, at times, invited intense public ridicule. After a devastating landslide in Badakhshan Province two years ago, for instance, senior government officials sent to monitor aid delivery wore big smiles as they posed for photos that ended up on Facebook.In any case, it is tempting for officials who think they are being ignored to reach out in any way they can.The situation in Kunduz remains critical, Mr. Danishi said, with the Taliban biding their time and hoping to put captured weapons to use in recapturing the provincial capital.\u201cIf I don\u2019t show concern now to keep my position, when the Taliban enter the city I will lose it anyway,\u201d he said.Mr. Rasoolyar, the former Helmand deputy governor, remains unrepentant.\u201cWhat I did was my duty, in order to save the lives of our soldiers on the battlefield and to protect Helmand,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI had no choice if I was to get the government\u2019s attention, and I achieved that goal.\u201dRod Nordland and Mujib Mashal contributed reporting from Kabul, and Taimoor Shah from Kandahar.Advertisement"}

Trump, the leading Republican candidate who has taunted the Clintons recently over Mr. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history of extramarital affairs, but then he answered another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s query about whether his own past was fair game to discuss in the race.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Republicans have to decide who they want to nominate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton replied. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always  attempts to take the election away from people, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just going to give it to them.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Clinton didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just keep his well-known temper in check: He even stopped shaking hands and signing autographs after 15 minutes on the rope line, a place he has been known to spend an hour. It was one of several signs that, at least for this first trip, that Mr. Clinton was willing to play the role of supporting actor opposite his wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s starring role.If Mr. Clinton had a theme, it was portraying Mrs. Clinton (and himself) as high-minded advocates of \u00e2\u0080\u009cinclusive\u00e2\u0080\u009d policies \u2014 an adjective that he repeated several times \u2014  rather than exclusionary proposals like Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call for temporarily banning Muslims for entering the United States.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fit anymore,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton said about the current political climate. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFirst of all, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a happy grandfather. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not mad at anybody.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDescribing the ideas and work ethic of immigrants as potential \u201cmeal tickets\u00e2\u0080\u009d for the American economy, Mr. Clinton told some wandering anecdotes about Muslims and others who had stood up for Christians and defended their families. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to run away from the place we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been \u2014 the place that welcomes all people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said in his most direct implicit shot at Mr. Trump.Mr. Clinton was discursive as he moved back and forth from talking about his own presidency and the work of his foundation, which he mentioned a few times, to Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s candidacy and ideas. At one point he indicated that he was wrapping up the speech, but then began a lengthy description of Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s years of work in Arkansas and elsewhere to improve education for children and opportunities for low-income people and women.\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been elected to anything,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe was just a change maker.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAnd he had a warning for the audience of several hundred people at Nashua Community College, urging them not to take lightly the controversial policy ideas and harsh political language from some of presidential candidates.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re telling you what they believe \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to take them seriously,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlmost everybody goes into the White House with the best of intentions.  Whether they succeed or not depends upon whether their instincts, their experience, their knowledge, and their psychological make up fits the times,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not believe in my lifetime anybody has run for the job who is better qualified by experience, knowledge and temperament\u00e2\u0080\u009d than Mrs. Clinton.Several voters said after the speech that they were struck by Mr. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relatively muted style, but added that they were impressed that he kept much of the focus on his wife and did not upstage her in any unwelcome ways.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was low-key in a down-to-earth way, which I think is the right thing to do, because the limelight should be on Hillary,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Gail DuFresne, 59, a nurse from Rindge, N.H.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "A Beloved Bronx Teacher Retires After a Conflict With His Principal", "Date": "2016-01-24", "News": "Supported bySide StreetNow he is at the center of drama: Last month he clashed with Brendan Lyons, the school\u2019s principal, who disapproved of his distributing H.I.V./AIDS education fliers that listed nonsexual ways of \u201cMaking Love Without Doin\u2019 It\u201d (including advice to \u201cread a book together\u201d). This month, he said the principal eliminated his early-morning civic leadership class, which engaged students in activities such as feeding the homeless, saying it was not part of the Common Core curriculum. Mr. Porton was already skeptical of that curriculum, saying it shortchanged students by focusing on chapters of novels and nonfiction essays rather than entire works of literature.So, next month Mr. Porton \u2014 a 67-year-old educator whom students praised as a lifesaver and life-changer \u2014 is walking away from teaching. He handed in his retirement papers on Friday. \u201cMy career has always been based on the emotional and social well-being of the child,\u201d he said, inside an office whose walls were decorated with awards, proclamations and photos of him alongside several school chancellors; Michael R. Bloomberg, the mayor at the time; and the rapper DMC. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t know where teaching is headed. I just know I can\u2019t anymore. I find it torture. I\u2019d rather separate myself from the classroom doing something that is distasteful and try to spend my days doing things that are important.\u201dIn December, on World AIDS Day, Mr. Porton handed out his flier, as he had for almost 25 years. Mr. Lyons sent him an email saying the flier was \u201cinappropriate,\u201d and asked that he collect those already distributed. Though Mr. Lyons said he would discuss the matter later with him, Mr. Porton said that conversation never took place.H.I.V. and AIDS may have faded from the public mind, but they remain a danger in places like the South Bronx, especially among young blacks and Latinos. Mr. Porton said the school has failed to meet Department of Education mandates to educate students about the diseases, making his work all the more necessary.Mr. Lyons, who would not say if the school met the mandates, never explained his objections to Mr. Porton. At the start of this semester, Mr. Porton said, the principal eliminated the 40-student leadership class because he said it was not part of the standard curriculum, even though the class met before the formal start of the school day. Because of that, combined with Mr. Porton\u2019s disappointment over the standardized test frenzy that rules in many schools, he chose to leave.\u201cSchool is not pleasant, the way it was when I started,\u201d he said. \u201cThey pay lip service to the social and emotional well-being of the child. My generation of teachers had a mind-set about how to teach a child. Today, many young teachers see teaching as a way to kill time on the way to something else.\u201d\u201cHow can anyone think what he does is inappropriate?\u201d said Janelle Roundtree, a former peer educator who graduated from Monroe in 1995 and went on to Howard University. \u201cHe changed Monroe. He was in the forefront of so many things. The school is losing out on this one.\u201d\u201cTom has been the consistent heart of that building since I was at Monroe in the \u201970s,\u201d said Mr. Gonzalez, who still wonders how the teacher managed to get tickets to Broadway shows. \u201cHe was always looking for the heart and soul of the individual. I would never have had the confidence to do what I do without him. He changed my life forever.\u201dAnd now, Mr. Porton will change his own life.\u201cIt was bittersweet,\u201d he said after filing for retirement. \u201cI\u2019m sort of resigned to making the change. But there\u2019s still a part of me that feels I\u2019ll have to figure out where I\u2019m going to go each day. Hopefully, somebody\u2019s going to ask for my expertise somewhere. Let\u2019s put it this way: I\u2019m looking for a job.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oxford University Will Keep Statue of Cecil Rhodes", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Supported byNow, after a vigorous debate, Oriel College, one of 38 largely self-governing colleges at Oxford, has decided it will keep the monument to its famous, if divisive, former student.\u201cFollowing careful consideration,\u201d the statement continued, \u201cthe college\u2019s Governing Body has decided that the statue should remain in place, and that the college will seek to provide a clear historical context to explain why it is there.\u201dThe dispute was characterized on one side as an exercise in political correctness and a desire to erase history, and on the other as a test of the university\u2019s willingness to acknowledge the sensitivities and values of minority students.Rhodes died in 1902, and his educational legacy includes a prestigious scholarship that bears his name. About 8,000 Rhodes scholars \u2014 including a former Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, who said removing the statue would be an act of \u201cmoral vanity,\u201d and former President Bill Clinton \u2014 have studied at Oxford thanks to the program set up with money left by Rhodes.Around the world, student activists are demanding that building and statutes commemorating historically figures whose legacies are now seen as morally dubious.The college now fears that a proposed gift of 100 million pounds, or $143 million, \u201cto be left in the will of one donor \u2014 is now in jeopardy,\u201d the newspaper reported.The group behind the campaign to remove monuments to Rhodes reacted angrily to the college\u2019s announcement, describing it as \u201coutrageous, dishonest and cynical.\u201d\u201cThis is not over,\u201d the group, Rhodes Must Fall in Oxford, said on its Facebook page. \u201cWe will be redoubling our efforts and meeting over the weekend to discuss our next actions,\u201d it said, adding that \u201cthe struggle continues!\u201d\u201cThe significance of taking down the statue is simple,\u201d he added. \u201cCecil Rhodes is the Hitler of southern Africa. Would anyone countenance a statue to Hitler?\u201dBut R. W. Johnson, an author who is an emeritus fellow of Magdalen College at Oxford, compared the campaign to remove the monument to what Al Qaeda and the Islamic State \u201care doing in places like Mali when destroying statues.\u201dBorn in 1853, Rhodes attended Oriel College in the 1870s before founding the De Beers diamond empire in South Africa, where he rose to be prime minister of what was then the Cape Colony, from 1890 to 1896.Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, was named after Rhodes, but he was also known for beginning racial segregation in southern Africa and for his belief in the superiority of the Anglo-Saxon race.\u201cWhat\u2019s positive about this whole Rhodes Must Fall movement is that it\u2019s drawing attention to our history,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to confront our history. We can\u2019t pretend it didn\u2019t happen, and I think if this encourages students to go to the Bodleian and look at the archives of the Rhodes period, there are some fabulous archives there both about colonialism and about the contemporary anti-Rhodes movement when he was alive.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Egypt\u2019s President Turns to Religion to Bolster His Authority", "Date": "2016-01-09", "News": "Supported byWhen Egyptian voters elected a new Parliament in December, a preacher on state TV urged its members to \u201cobey those in authority, specifically the highest authority,\u201d and referred indirectly to Mr. Sisi as \u201cGod\u2019s shadow on earth.\u201dIn the latest decree, the Ministry of Religious Endowments on Monday instructed preachers that any call to protest on Jan. 25, the fifth anniversary of the revolution that toppled President Hosni Mubarak, would lead to \u201csabotage, murder and destruction,\u201d and constituted a \u201cfull crime.\u201dSuch tactics are not novel: Arab leaders have tried for decades to use Islam to boost their legitimacy. Mr. Sisi, the former head of the armed forces, has also presented himself as a reformer, calling publicly for a \u201creligious revolution\u201d to help combat extremism. But rather than spurring discussion about Islam, his approach \u2014 shutting unregistered mosques and banning unauthorized preachers while drawing the religious establishment into an uneasy embrace \u2014 has had the effect of constricting the debate here.Those tensions came to the fore recently when a television host who appeared to take up Mr. Sisi\u2019s call for change was assailed by Al Azhar, the 1,000-year-old bastion of Sunni Muslim scholarship in Cairo and Mr. Sisi\u2019s designated vehicle for religious change.Islam Behery, a popular satellite TV host known for challenging Islamic orthodoxy, has urged Muslims to think critically about some of the sayings attributed to the Prophet Muhammad that jihadists have used to justify violence. \u201cWe must confront those books, and break the taboo,\u201d said Mr. Behery, a 37-year-old law graduate, in an interview early last month.\u201cIt is inconceivable that the thinking that we hold most sacred should cause the entire Islamic world to be a source of anxiety, danger, killing and destruction for the rest of the world,\u201d Mr. Sisi warned.But Mr. Behery\u2019s ideas offended the scholars at Al Azhar, who accused him of \u201cviolating the foundations of Islam\u201d and, with others, brought a slew of court cases against him. One of those cases resulted in a criminal prosecution, and on Dec. 28 Mr. Behery began serving a one-year sentence.The prosecution appeared to signal the limits of Mr. Sisi\u2019s approach to modernizing Islam. Al Azhar, which is state-funded, has hewed closely to Egypt\u2019s rulers for the past six decades, yet at the same time jealously defended its position as Egypt\u2019s premier authority on Islam.Some clerics appeared to take Mr. Sisi\u2019s speech last year as an attack on the integrity of Al Azhar itself, said Nathan J. Brown, a professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University who specializes in the Middle East.\u201cFor people within Al Azhar, there was something remarkable and distasteful about a president and a general lecturing them about religion,\u201d he said. \u201cYou saw some pushback, in the form of a proxy struggle. Then there was the episode with Islam Behery.\u201dStill, the relationship between the different arms of the Egyptian state is notoriously hard to read, and some experts see the court prosecution as an example of Al Azhar flexing its institutional muscle. In public, Al Azhar has always been loudly supportive of Mr. Sisi.Shortly after the takeover, the grand imam of Al Azhar, Sheikh Ahmed al-Tayeb, sat by the general\u2019s side at his inaugural news conference.Weeks later, Sheikh Ali Gomaa, a senior Al Azhar cleric, justified violence against Muslim Brotherhood supporters, whom he described as \u201cputrid people\u201d and \u201criffraff.\u201d\u201cThe angels are supporting you from heaven,\u201d Sheikh Gomaa told police and military leaders.Yet at the same time, Al Azhar has quietly sought to preserve its room for maneuver \u2014 much as the courts and the security services have done \u2014 particularly in matters of Islamic theology.\u201cI don\u2019t see him as a dictator,\u201d said Ashraf El-Sherif, a lecturer in political science at the American University in Cairo, referring to Mr. Sisi. \u201cHe\u2019s the representative of an alliance of dictatorial state institutions.\u201dThe public blessings of the religious establishment may give Mr. Sisi, himself an observant Muslim, a certain legitimacy in the eyes of many Egyptians. But there are also signs that his approach may irk younger Egyptians who remember the period after the 2011 uprising when state control of religious discourse ended for a time.Last month Sheikh Tayeb paid a rare visit to Cairo University, where he answered questions from disgruntled students about a contentious move \u2014 the university authorities had just demolished one mosque on campus, and closed several smaller ones, in the name of \u201cfragmenting the foundations of radicalism.\u201d Now, the university students pray in one central mosque.The grand imam\u2019s answers did not satisfy everyone.\u201cIt\u2019s just another way of exerting control,\u201d Amira Abd el Sayed, 20, said recently during her lunchtime break. \u201cAlready there is no democracy, and now they are telling us where to pray. The government is pressuring the youth, and it\u2019s going to blow up in their faces.\u201dThe campus, once a hotbed of dissent, is a microcosm of Egyptian society. Some students were reluctant to speak publicly, citing fear of government informers; others trenchantly supported the crackdown. \u201cIt\u2019s important to control the discussion of religion,\u201d said Adam Mustafa, a law student. \u201cThe media has made this into an issue, not the students.\u201dOthers were not afraid to dismiss Al Azhar\u2019s authority. Sheikh Tayeb was \u201cnot even a proper sheikh,\u201d or religious scholar, said Amira Mohamed, one of a group of students in hijab sipping coffee on a lawn. \u201cIn reality, the fatwa came from the president. Everyone knows that.\u201dThe government says tough measures are required to fend off the threat of violent extremism. In Sinai, the military is battling a local branch of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, that claims to have downed the Russian plane in October. On the ideological front, officials monitor extremist publications in a host of languages, including Chinese and Urdu, and track fatwas issued by radical preachers.For others, the talk of regulating Islam is thinly veiled political repression. \u201cThere are no more outlets for discussion,\u201d said Ali Kandil, a schoolteacher in a wealthy Cairo suburb who was ousted from his position as a prayer leader because he had spoken publicly against \u201ctyrants.\u201d \u201cIf anyone talks, he is killed or arrested,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he\u2019s not arrested, he flees the country. And if he flees, he is branded as a traitor.\u201dAnalysts warn of the perils of the growing polarization in Egypt: While the Muslim Brotherhood maintains its official policy of eschewing violence, some members have defended attacks in Cairo last year as necessary \u201cretribution\u201d against the government.A recent official Friday Prayer sermon offered a clue to Mr. Sisi\u2019s next cause of worry: the potential for unrest on Jan. 25.Pointing to the \u201cruin and chaos\u201d that political upheaval wrought in neighboring Arab countries, the 3,100-word official sermon warned against any \u201cdestructive\u201d public protests in Egypt.\u201cTo avoid evil and please God,\u201d it said, \u201ca person shall obey the rulers.\u201dAmina Ismail contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Global Tensions Threaten to Upstage World Economic Forum in Davos", "Date": "2016-01-18", "News": "Supported byTensions reminiscent of the Cold War keep flaring with Russia and in the Middle East \u2014 not to mention over the Korean Peninsula. Europe is struggling to cope with a refugee crisis that risks fracturing the European Union, even as the bloc tries to counter a rising security threat from the Islamic State. Britain may vote this year on whether to leave the European Union altogether. And China\u2019s growth slowdown could prompt the second global financial crisis within a decade.Given those strains, the official Davos theme this time \u2014 \u201cMastering the Fourth Industrial Revolution\u201d \u2014 may sound oddly out of tune, and the various panels on the topic could prove to be little more than sideshows.Klaus Schwab, the World Economic Forum\u2019s founder and one of the best-connected men on the planet, is nonetheless using the forum\u2019s website to urge the cadre of bankers, politicians, tech executives and trend makers to ponder \u201cthe fusion of technologies across the physical, digital and biological worlds, which is creating entirely new capabilities and dramatic impacts on political, social and economic systems.\u201dThe big-thought themes of Davos often billow above current events. Last year, the topic was \u201cThe New Global Context,\u201d a reference to shifting political, economic and social forces in the world. The year before focused on the \u201cReshaping of the World.\u201d If such banners are somewhat elusive, so, too, is the gathering\u2019s ability to map solutions to more immediate problems.But then, problem-solving is not really the point. More than anything, Davos, at about 5,120 feet, is about high-altitude networking.The forum is where hedge fund managers, central bankers, chief executives, social-media magnates, heads of state, self-help gurus, artists, celebrities, fashion models and even archbishops engage in the equivalent of intellectual or corporate speed dating. If all goes well, they may pry open a possible business deal, pad out a contact list or maybe receive enlightenment about affairs outside their professional expertise.Many deal makers retreat to hotel suites for much of the conference, forsaking the official program in favor of a whirl of meetings, emerging only to attend private parties in exclusive chalets on the Davos slopes or invitation-only power dinners.This year\u2019s tech luminaries are to include Jack Ma, the head of China\u2019s online retail giant Alibaba; John T. Chambers, the chief of Cisco Systems, the Internet hardware maker; Eric E. Schmidt, executive chairman of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company; and Sheryl K. Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook.And then there are the captains of the financial industry, including Jamie Dimon, the head of JPMorgan Chase; Gary D. Cohn, Goldman Sachs\u2019s chief operating officer; and top executives from most of the world\u2019s major banks.Also on hand will be a host of regulators who oversee the big banks, including Jacob J. Lew, the United States Treasury secretary, as well as an influential coterie of central bankers who determine monetary policy, including Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank.Foremost among their concerns this year may be whether problems in China, whose rapidly slowing economy has rattled stock and commodity markets around the world, could cause a relapse into global financial instability just as Europe and the United States are recovering from the last crisis. No clear remedies are likely to emerge from Davos, though, because top leaders from China, as in years past, will not be present.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France are conspicuously avoiding the gathering this year, judging it more effective to grapple with pressing problems back home.And then there is the controversy surrounding North Korea. Last fall, the conference organizers took the unusual step of inviting a delegation from Pyongyang. But shortly after North Korea trumpeted a nuclear bomb test on Jan. 5, the Davos organizers disinvited the delegates \u2014 prompting North Korean officials to declare the snub \u201cseriously unjust.\u201dAnd yet, in the honeycomb of private side rooms inside the old nuclear bunker where the main conference takes place, or on the leather couches of the nearby five-star Belvedere Hotel, a favorite place for private dinners and parties, there are always opportunities for key players to make progress on thorny subjects.This year, for instance, Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, is expected to meet on the sidelines with Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece, who defied the fund and Europe\u2019s political elite for many months last year over the terms of a multibillion-euro bailout, risking his country\u2019s exit from the eurozone. More recently, Mr. Tsipras, having turned from a defender of the poor to a mainstream leader eager to save Greece from further financial turmoil, is expected to try to persuade Ms. Lagarde to send more of the fund\u2019s money to Athens.And even if no big policy breakthroughs are achieved, at least there will be star power.

{"Headline": "2 Lives Collide in Fatal Night at a Harlem Shelter", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Supported byDeven Black was 62, and his life was falling apart. In a few short years, he had gone from respected, award-winning teacher to unemployed felon, losing his marriage and his home, moving into his car for a time and slipping into a depression that went largely untreated. He had nowhere to go.Anthony White was only 21, and he had a plan. He was desperate to get his own apartment, but his low-paying job at J. C. Penney left him unable to pay any rent. He had his dreams, to be a famous rapper, and his own mental-health problems. All he had to do was qualify for low-income housing. And he knew just how to do that.The paths of Mr. Black and Mr. White \u2014 one on the way down, the other seemingly on the way up \u2014 collided at the Boulevard Homeless Shelter in Harlem on Monday, through the lottery that is New York City\u2019s shelter system.\u201cI send my condolences to the Black family, I really do,\u201d said LaSandra White, Mr. White\u2019s sister, while expressing doubts that her brother had committed the crime. \u201cBut this is a problem in the system. How did this happen? How did a weapon even get inside? This is supposed to be a mental health shelter. The system is failing our community. It\u2019s failing people with mental illnesses.\u201dOn Friday, in response to the killing, the city said that it would heighten security at 27 shelters for people with mental health issues. Officers from the Department of Homeless Services, which oversees the shelter system, arrived at the Boulevard shelter, on Lexington Avenue and 124th Street, late Friday afternoon. Residents said the officers searched the five-story building for contraband.The killing of Mr. Black underscored the problems plaguing the shelter system, which now houses about 58,000 people, a record, and must take in anyone who asks. Yet many homeless people fear the shelters, because of drug use, theft and violence.Shelters that serve mentally ill people are seen as especially dangerous. They can function as de facto mental hospitals, largely because actual hospitals rarely have enough psychiatric beds to meet the demand. But these shelters are poorly equipped to handle people with severe mental illness.But Mr. White, last seen fleeing the shelter when a security officer opened the door to the room he shared with Mr. Black, was not enrolled in NYC Safe. He had never been considered violent. Typically, a person accused of such a vicious crime would have a thick criminal record, said a police official who was not authorized to speak about Mr. White. The official described Mr. White\u2019s record \u2014 one misdemeanor arrest \u2014 as nearly insignificant.The Boulevard is run by the Bowery Residents\u2019 Committee, a longtime homeless-services provider. The building was ill designed to be a shelter \u2014 it has rooms jutting off corridors, rather than large dormitory-type spaces \u2014 but it had been one for decades, run by one nonprofit or another.At most, six men lived in a room. Some rooms held only two men, an arrangement that sometimes led to a kind of aggression that residents called \u201ctwo-man-room syndrome.\u201d There were security guards, and a metal detector, but residents said some men sneaked in knives in their shoes.There had been violence at the Boulevard in the past. In 2013, a 50-year-old resident was stabbed to death by a roommate during a fight, according to the police.Of the two men, Mr. White arrived first, in mid-December.He had moved between family and foster care, landing with his mother by high school. He attended the Academy of Urban Planning, a relatively small public high school in Bushwick, Brooklyn. He was short \u2014 about 5-foot-3 \u2014 and wore headphones like life support. He was always listening to rap artists like Drake and Jay Z, and always working on his own music. If he was known for anything in school, it was for getting along with everyone, but he never said much, according to his sister.His family was evicted from their apartment after problems with the city\u2019s rent subsidy program, said Sametha White, Mr. White\u2019s mother, ending up at a homeless shelter in the Bronx. In 2013, his senior year, Mr. White dropped out.That same year, he was taken to Brooklyn Hospital after the police got a call about an emotionally disturbed person. Mr. White was not being violent, but he was thought to be acting strangely, according to the police official.In 2014, while living with his father, Mr. White was hospitalized. The family did not talk about it much. There was no diagnosis mentioned, just a before and after.\u201cMy dad called and said, \u2018There\u2019s something wrong, he\u2019s not acting the same,\u2019\u201d his sister said. \u201cThey kept releasing him. And he would explode sometimes.\u201dShe added: \u201cMy dad would calm him down or he\u2019d go back to the hospital and they would release him.\u201dHe got a job at J. C. Penney, his mother said. He wanted to be an adult, she said. He wanted his own place. So he went to the shelter system last year. If he kept his job, and he stayed at the shelter for a while, he could qualify for a low-income housing program. It was a first step. On Dec. 15, he was referred to the Boulevard.Mr. White spent Christmas with his family. He seemed happy, handing out gifts to nieces and nephews. But the next day, back at the shelter, he acted out, disturbing other residents, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. He was sent to Metropolitan Hospital Center. Told to take his medication and to attend support groups, he said he would. That same night, he was sent back to the shelter.City officials, citing privacy laws, declined to discuss details of Mr. White\u2019s treatment.Other residents said Mr. White was increasingly volatile, at one point flailing his arms and throwing away dollar bills. He complained to one of his brothers that someone had stolen his iPod. His mother said she talked to him on the phone, and he said he was fine and that he was taking his medication.But he had become so convinced that people were robbing him that shelter employees gave him a replacement lock for his locker last week, said Leonard McCaffrey, another resident. He warned men who bothered him that he would \u201cgive them a 150,\u201d Mr. McCaffrey said, meaning 150 stitches across the face.\u201cHe would fly off the handle,\u201d Mr. McCaffrey said.On Sunday, after another outburst, Mr. White was again sent to Metropolitan. This time he was kept overnight. On Monday, he was sent back to the Boulevard.This time, he had a new roommate.Mr. Black had always charted an unconventional path, trying on new identities as they suited him. He dropped out of high school and college. In his 20s, he worked as a radio reporter on Cape Cod. Then he returned to New York, working as the general manager of the North Star Pub near the Fulton Fish Market. He motivated people wherever he went.\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Deven, chances are I would\u2019ve never gotten into my career,\u201d said Steven Brown, who constantly called into Mr. Black\u2019s radio show as a teenager and is now a reporter with radio station WBUR in Boston.Eventually, Mr. Black earned his college degree and ended up at the Castle Hill Middle School in the Bronx. There, after a stint in the classroom teaching special education, he became a librarian.In a 2013 interview with The School Library Journal, he detailed his efforts to improve the library, bringing in computers and updating the collection. Jonas Black, his son, remembered helping his father discard dated books with titles like \u201cThe Lives of the Orientals.\u201dHe was a family man who posted an old photo showing him with his mother as his Facebook picture.But he began to deteriorate, acting more erratic, friends and relatives said. He had long struggled with mental illness but had never received an official diagnosis, beyond depression, Jonas Black said. He became distant from family and friends. He briefly checked himself into a hospital. He made poor choices with money, falling prey to online scammers. Was it dementia? Bipolar illness? No one could say.\u201cHe was never properly diagnosed,\u201d said Emily Feiner, a clinical social worker and friends of Mr. Black\u2019s and his wife\u2019s for 25 years.\u201cHe was compulsive and had almost delusional thought patterns that influenced his choices,\u201d she added. \u201cHe placed himself at great risk.\u201dAn investigation by the city\u2019s Education Department found in 2014 that Mr. Black had behaved in a manner that made a student feel uncomfortable. He was suspended for two months, according to a city official with knowledge of his record. No other information was available.About July of that year, Mr. Black and a woman he had met online began depositing fraudulent checks at New York banks, federal prosecutors later said. He would then wait several days before withdrawing tens of thousands of dollars in cash.In November, he pleaded guilty in federal court to bank fraud. He was eventually ordered to repay $146,000 to the banks. He was also required to participate in outpatient mental health treatment and to continue taking prescription medications.Ms. Feiner said there was no follow-through to make sure he got the medications he was prescribed. \u201cThen he was homeless and had no way to get it,\u201d she said.Jonas Black said his father spent some time living in his car. At some point last year, he landed in the shelter system. On Monday, he was sent to the Boulevard.Two men, total strangers, one room. Mr. Black was so polite that when another resident, Ronald Venticinque, told him that his nickname was \u201cBananas,\u201d Mr. Black called him, \u201cMr. Bananas.\u201d Mr. Venticinque told the newcomer to be careful: Mr. Black had left his battered suitcase full of clothes and a large, full canvas bag unattended on a cafeteria table.Mr. White continued to rage: the thefts, the damage he would do. He waved his hands in the other men\u2019s faces and they gave him wide berth.Mr. Black, of course, could not. Mr. McCaffrey heard Mr. White shouting Wednesday night in the room one floor below his. Minutes later he heard a staff member shout, \u201cOh my God!\u201dAn article on Saturday about the killing of Deven Black, 62, in a Harlem shelter misidentified the two people shown in a picture that Mr. Black had posted on Facebook. It was Mr. Black and his mother, not his wife and son. The article also misspelled, in some editions, the name of the store that employed Anthony White, the man accused of killing Mr. Black. It is J.C. Penney, not J.C. Penney\u2019s.Jason Grant and Nate Schweber contributed reporting, and Susan C. Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}

Uber is perhaps the seminal harbinger of that change; take one well-entrenched industry (taxi and livery service) with a corner on the market and no need for innovation. Add one start-up with a clever, convenient approach and a willingness to flout laws. Pour millions of dollars on idea. Repeat.So while things like food delivery or on-demand office cleaning or whatever are certainly not as world-changing and attractive as robot monkey butlers, it is pretty much par for what Silicon Valley stands for: the destruction of the old in the name of efficiency and expediency.And that, my basic friend, is what is interesting to me: those being marginalized while the death and rebirth of new industries are widely celebrated by a handful of people in a small enclave of California. (I also like the technologies themselves, some of the time, at least.)But I am curious as to what would not bore you right now. What sort of start-ups are you looking for? What more do you want than on-demand booze and cookies?What I do think is pretty basic right now is the start-up financing scene. A year ago, the market looked crazy. Venture capitalists were funding anything that moved, and unicorns were everywhere. Then, in the fall, a gloom fell over the market, and it seemed we were headed for some kind of bust.That is to say, there will certainly be spectacular flameouts to come. And they will not be lit, as it were. Ugh, why did I say that?Advertisement"}

His father was an electrical engineer, and his mother ran a nursing home. After working briefly as an advertising copywriter in Adelaide, Mr. Stigwood moved to London.In the early 1960s he started a talent agency for actors and made a deal with EMI, unusual at the time, as an independent record producer. In 1966 he became the manager of Cream, the rock supergroup that included Mr. Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker, and was briefly associated with the Beatles. Brian Epstein, the Beatles\u2019 manager, had merged his company with Mr. Stigwood\u2019s, but after Mr. Epstein died in 1967 the group started its own company, Apple Corps, and Mr. Stigwood formed the Robert Stigwood Organization and its affiliated label, RSO. He also signed the Bee Gees, who had been child stars in Australia, shortly after their arrival in London in 1967, and promoted young pop stars like David Bowie and Rod Stewart.Mr. Stigwood\u2019s theater ventures began in the late 1960s when he brought risqu\u00e9 Broadway hits like \u201cHair\u201d and \u201cOh! Calcutta\u201d to London. He continued to work in theater, producing Mr. Lloyd Webber and Mr. Rice\u2019s \u201cEvita\u201d in London in 1978.To maximize income from the shows, Mr. Stigwood cracked down on unlicensed performances of \u201cJesus Christ Superstar\u201d in the United States, including high school productions.In 1980, Mr. Stigwood suffered another setback when the Bee Gees sued him for $200 million, saying that he had swindled them out of royalties. Mr. Stigwood countersued for defamation and breach of contract, and the two parties settled out of court and publicly reconciled.RSO continued to release records into the early 1980s, including the soundtracks to \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back\u201d and \u201cFame,\u201d but was eventually absorbed into the major PolyGram, now part of the Universal Music Group. In 1996, Mr. Stigwood was a producer of Alan Parker\u2019s film version of \u201cEvita.\u201d In his later years the British news media frequently ranked him as one of the wealthiest people in Britain.Information on survivors was not immediately available.Advertisement"}

He was raised by a single mother who had a drug addiction and whose parenting style swung between neglect and antagonism.\u201cIt was up and down, sad, angry, screaming,\u201d Mr. Diaz said.As a teenager, he skipped classes regularly. Some days, he rode the subway for eight hours, from Coney Island, Brooklyn, to Queens, performing for money. He eventually dropped out of high school and took a break from dancing for about a year.Last year, hostility between Mr. Diaz and his mother reached a boiling point.

{"Headline": "How Larry Page\u2019s Obsessions Became Google\u2019s Business", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "Supported byThree years ago, Charles Chase, an engineer who manages Lockheed Martin\u2019s nuclear fusion program, was sitting on a white leather couch at Google\u2019s Solve for X conference when a man he had never met knelt down to talk to him.They spent 20 minutes discussing how much time, money and technology separated humanity from a sustainable fusion reaction \u2014 that is, how to produce clean energy by mimicking the sun\u2019s power \u2014 before Mr. Chase thought to ask the man his name.\u201cHe didn\u2019t have any sort of pretension like he shouldn\u2019t be talking to me or \u2018Don\u2019t you know who you\u2019re talking to?\u2019\u201d Mr. Chase said. \u201cWe just talked.\u201dLarry Page is not a typical chief executive, and in many of the most visible ways, he is not a C.E.O. at all. Corporate leaders tend to spend a good deal of time talking at investor conferences or introducing new products on auditorium stages. Mr. Page, who is 42, has not been on an earnings call since 2013, and the best way to find him at Google I/O \u2014 an annual gathering where the company unveils new products \u2014 is to ignore the main stage and follow the scrum of fans and autograph seekers who mob him in the moments he steps outside closed doors.But just because he has faded from public view does not mean he is a recluse. He is a regular at robotics conferences and intellectual gatherings like TED. Scientists say he is a good bet to attend Google\u2019s various academic gatherings, like Solve for X and Sci Foo Camp, where he can be found having casual conversations about technology or giving advice to entrepreneurs.Mr. Page is hardly the first Silicon Valley chief with a case of intellectual wanderlust, but unlike most of his peers, he has invested far beyond his company\u2019s core business and in many ways has made it a reflection of his personal fascinations.He intends to push even further with Alphabet, a holding company that separates Google\u2019s various cash-rich advertising businesses from the list of speculative projects like self-driving cars that capture the imagination but do not make much money. Alphabet companies and investments span disciplines from biotechnology to energy generation to space travel to artificial intelligence to urban planning.Investors will get a good look at the scope of those ambitions on Feb. 1, when the company, in its fourth-quarter earnings report, will disclose for the first time the costs and income of the collection of projects outside of Google\u2019s core business.As chief executive of Alphabet, Mr. Page is tasked with figuring how to spin Google\u2019s billions in advertising profits into new companies and industries. When he announced the reorganization last summer, he said that he and Sergey Brin, Google\u2019s other founder, would do this by finding new people and technologies to invest in, while at the same time slimming down Google \u2014 now called Google Inc., a subsidiary of Alphabet \u2014 so their leaders would have more autonomy.\u201cIn general, our model is to have a strong C.E.O. who runs each business, with Sergey and me in service to them as needed,\u201d Mr. Page wrote in a letter to investors. He said that he and Mr. Brin would be responsible for picking those chief executives, monitoring their progress and determining their pay.Google\u2019s day-to-day management was left to Sundar Pichai, the company\u2019s new chief executive. His job will not be about preventing cancer or launching rocket ships, but to keep Google\u2019s advertising machine humming, to keep innovating in emerging areas like machine learning and virtual reality \u2014 all while steering the company through a thicket of regulatory troubles that could drag on for years.Mr. Page\u2019s new role is part talent scout and part technology visionary. He still has to find the chief executives of many of the other Alphabet businesses.And he has said on several occasions that he spends a good deal of time researching new technologies, focusing on what kind of financial or logistic hurdles stand in the way of them being invented or carried out.His presence at technology events, while just a sliver of his time, is indicative of a giant idea-scouting mission that has in some sense been going on for years but is now Mr. Page\u2019s main job.In the investor letter, he put it this way: \u201cSergey and I are seriously in the business of starting new things.\u201dMr. Page has always had a wide range of interests. As an undergraduate at the University of Michigan, he worked on solar cars, music synthesizers and once proposed that the school build a tram through campus. He arrived at Stanford\u2019s computer science doctorate program in 1995, and had a list of initial research ideas, including self-driving cars and using the web\u2019s many hyperlinks to improve Internet search. His thesis adviser, Terry Winograd, steered him toward search.\u201cEven before he came to Stanford he was interested in cool technical things that could be done,\u201d Mr. Winograd said. \u201cWhat makes something interesting for him is a big technical challenge. It\u2019s not so much where it\u2019s headed but what the ride is like.\u201dInside Google, Mr. Page is known for asking a lot of questions about how people do their jobs and challenging their assumptions about why things are as they are. In an interview at the Fortune Global Forum last year, Mr. Page said he enjoyed talking to people who ran the company\u2019s data centers.\u201cI ask them, like, \u2018How does the transformer work?\u2019 \u2018How does the power come in?\u2019 \u2018What do we pay for that?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m thinking about it kind of both as an entrepreneur and as a business person. And I\u2019m thinking \u2018What are those opportunities?\u2019\u201dAnother question he likes to ask: \u201cWhy can\u2019t this be bigger?\u201dMr. Page declined multiple requests for comment, and many of the people who spoke about him requested anonymity because they were not supposed to talk about internal company matters.Many former Google employees who have worked directly with Mr. Page said his managerial modus operandi was to take new technologies or product ideas and generalize them to as many areas as possible. Why can\u2019t Google Now, Google\u2019s predictive search tool, be used to predict everything about a person\u2019s life? Why create a portal to shop for insurance when you can create a portal to shop for every product in the world?But corporate success means corporate sprawl, and recently Google has seen a number of engineers and others leave for younger rivals like Facebook and start-ups like Uber. Mr. Page has made personal appeals to some of them, and, at least in a few recent cases, has said he is worried that the company has become a difficult place for entrepreneurs, according to people who have met with him.Part of Mr. Page\u2019s pitch included emphasizing how dedicated he was to \u201cmoonshots\u201d like interplanetary travel, or offering employees time and money to pursue new projects of their own. By breaking Google into Alphabet, Mr. Page is hoping to make it a more welcoming home for employees to build new businesses, as well as for potential acquisition targets.It will also rid his office of the kind of dull-but-necessary annoyances of running a major corporation. Several recently departed Google staff members said that as chief executive of Google, Mr. Page had found himself in the middle of various turf wars, like how to integrate Google Plus, the company\u2019s struggling social media effort, with other products like YouTube, or where to put Google Now, which resided in the Android team but was moved to the search group.Such disputes are a big reason Mr. Page had been shedding managerial duties and delegating the bulk of his product oversight to Mr. Pichai, these people said. In a 2014 memo to the company announcing Mr. Pichai\u2019s promotion to product chief, Mr. Page said the move would allow him to \u201cfocus on the bigger picture\u201d at Google and have more time to get the company\u2019s next generation of big bets off the ground.People who have worked with Mr. Page say that he tries to guard his calendar, avoiding back-to-back meetings and leaving time to read, research and see new technologies that interest him.Given that he is worth in the neighborhood of $40 billion and created the world\u2019s most famous website, Mr. Page has the tendency to attract a crowd when he attends technology events. At last year\u2019s Darpa Robotics Challenge, he was trailed closely by a handler who at times acted as a buffer between Mr. Page and would-be cellphone photographers. That commotion could annoy anyone, but it is particularly troubling for Mr. Page, who, because of damaged vocal cords, speaks just above a whisper and sometimes uses a microphone in small meetings.At home in Palo Alto, Mr. Page tries to have the most normal life possible, driving his children to school or taking his family to local street fairs, according to people who know him or have seen him at such events.And at Google, even events that are decidedly not normal aspire to a kind of casualness. Take the Camp, an exclusive and secretive event that Google holds at a resort in Sicily and where invitees have included Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla Motors and SpaceX, Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, and Tory Burch, the fashion designer.One attendee, who asked to remain anonymous because guests were not supposed to discuss the gathering, recalls being surprised by how much time Mr. Page spent with his children.In public remarks, Mr. Page has said how important his father, Carl V. Page, a computer science professor at Michigan State University who died in 1996, was to his choice of career.\u201cMy dad was really interested in technology,\u201d Mr. Page said at Google I/O in 2013, the last time he took the stage at the event. \u201cHe actually drove me and my family all the way across the country to go to a robotics conference. And then we got there and he thought it was so important that his young son go to the conference, one of the few times I\u2019ve seen him really argue with someone to get in someone underage successfully into the conference, and that was me.\u201dPeople who work with Mr. Page or have spoken with him at conferences say he tries his best to blend in, and, for the most part, the smaller groups of handpicked attendees at Google\u2019s academic and science gatherings, tend to treat him like a peer.The scope of his curiosity was apparent at Sci Foo Camp, an annual invitation-only conference that is sponsored by Google, O\u2019Reilly Media and Digital Science.The largely unstructured \u201cunconference\u201d begins when each of its attendees \u2014 an eclectic batch of astronomers, psychologists, physicists and others \u2014 write something that interests them on a small card and then paste it to a communal wall. Those notes become the basis for breakout talks on topics like scientific ethics or artificial intelligence.The last conference was held during a weekend in June on Google\u2019s Mountain View, Calif., campus, and Mr. Page was there for most of it. He did not host or give a speech, but mingled and went to talks, just like everyone else. That impressed investors and computer scientists who did not expect to see so much of him, but researchers who had come from outside Silicon Valley barely noticed.\u201cI have a vague memory that some founder type person was walking through the crowd,\u201d said Josh Peek, an assistant astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore.Another benefit of these gatherings for the reserved Mr. Page is that they are mostly closed to the news media.When Mr. Page does talk in public, he tends to focus on optimistic pronouncements about the future and Google\u2019s desire to help humanity. Asked about current issues, like how mobile apps are challenging the web or how ad blockers are affecting Google\u2019s business, he tends to dismiss it with something like, \u201cPeople have been talking about that for a long time.\u201dLately, he has talked more about his belief that for-profit companies can be a force for social good and change. During a 2014 interview with Charlie Rose, Mr. Page said that instead of a nonprofit or philanthropic organization, he would rather leave his money to an entrepreneur like Mr. Musk.Of course, for every statement Mr. Page makes about Alphabet\u2019s technocorporate benevolence, you can find many competitors and privacy advocates holding their noses in disgust. Technology companies like Yelp have accused the company of acting like a brutal monopolist that is using the dominance of its search engine to steer consumers toward Google services, even if that means giving the customers inferior information.It is hard to imagine how even the most ambitious person could hope to revolutionize so many industries. And Mr. Page, no matter how smart, cannot possibly be an expert in every area Alphabet wants to touch.His method is not overly technical. Instead, he tends to focus on how to make a sizable business out of whatever problem this or that technology might solve. Leslie Dewan, a nuclear engineer who founded a company that is trying to generate cheap electricity from nuclear waste, also had a brief conversation with Mr. Page at the Solve For X conference.She said he questioned her on things like modular manufacturing and how to find the right employees.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a nuclear background, but he knew the right questions to ask,\u201d said Dr. Dewan, chief executive of Transatomic Power. \u201c\u2018Have you thought about approaching the manufacturing in this way?\u2019 \u2018Have you thought about the vertical integration of the company in this way?\u2019 \u2018Have you thought about training the work force this way?\u2019 They weren\u2019t nuclear physics questions, but they were extremely thoughtful ways to think about how we could structure the business.\u201dDr. Dewan said Mr. Page even gave her an idea for a new market opportunity that she had not thought of. Asked to be more specific, she refused. The idea was too good to share.Doris Burke contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "This Land Is Your Land. Or Is It?", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "There are lots of cases where legal ownership and just ownership come apart. You know full well that slave ownership was once legal, but you probably don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it was just. And if the law changed tomorrow to outlaw smartphones, you probably don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think that your entitlement to your phone would vanish. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099d think the government had made a mistake and that it would be O.K. to resist. So what explains why some property is your private property?An idea common among conservatives \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and surely an assumption of the protesters in Oregon \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is that the past fully explains private property. For example, perhaps you paid for your phone or were given it as a gift. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why you are entitled to it. So in general we might say that if you paid for something or were given something, then you are entitled to it.But is that true? Suppose I steal your car and sell it to my friend Dugald. Is Dugald entitled to the car because he paid for it? You probably want to say \u00e2\u0080\u009cno.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Buying something doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give you entitlement unless the seller was entitled to the thing first. So a transfer of property from one person to another is rendered illegitimate if the seller got the property through unjust means.An anthology of essays from The Times\u2019s philosophy series, published by Liveright.But now think back to your smartphone. What are the chances that the money you used to buy your phone can be traced backward through your employer, your employer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s customers, and so on back through history without passing through the hands of a serious injustice? Slim to none. The same can be said for the seller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side of the transaction. Chances are excellent that your phone arrived in your hand only after the exploitation of workers, abuse of the environment, theft, fraud, human trafficking, or any number of deal-breaking injustices.And, as the situation in Oregon makes clear, deciphering the boundaries of private property for real estate is even more troubled. Eastern Oregon was once populated by the Northern Paiute tribe. Like the history of your smartphone, the shift of property from the Paiutes to the white settlers is surely marred with various injustices. And if injustices render a transfer of private property illegitimate, then the protesters in Oregon have little to complain about.Read previous contributions to this series.But does allocating rights to resources in this way make sense? Locke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historical theory of initial ownership seems to raise more questions than it answers. What does it mean to say that someone \u00e2\u0080\u009cmixes his labor\u00e2\u0080\u009d with something? When I find an unowned field and fence it in, did I mix my labor with it? That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how most of the land in the West was carved up. And do I just get rights to the surface pasture or the mineral rights deep within the ground, too? Or suppose I find a beach and build a house on it. Did I mix my labor with the land? How much of it? Just what is under the house? And why is it that mixing my labor is a way of gaining property instead of simply losing my labor?Consider Locke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second requirement on initial acquisition, namely that the appropriator leave enough and \u00e2\u0080\u009cas good\u00e2\u0080\u009d of that resource for others who want it. The intuitive idea is something like this: You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take something out of the commons for your own private use unless you leave everyone else the same opportunity to appropriate a similar amount and quality of the resources for their own private use. This is a sensible requirement but difficult to meet. Which others should count? When British settlers first landed on North American shores, did they leave enough for everyone else in Europe?So despite its appeal to conservatives, the idea that history alone explains private property is hard to make good on. On this theory, the mere fact that we were given things or paid for things won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t determine whether we are entitled to those things. At worst the historical theory implies that no one is entitled to any private property. And if our property isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t legitimately private, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to see how it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unjust for the government or anyone else to take it from us.This is not to say that liberal views of private property don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t face their own share of challenges. They do. But we should be honest about the intellectual bankruptcy of a prominent explanation for private property. We need a theory of private property that makes sense if we are to make any progress on answering fundamental political questions about the disparity of wealth, taxation and the government control of land.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 It takes more than a gun to make property private.More From Fixes \u00bbMore From Private Lives \u00bbMore From Couch \u00bbMore From The Stone \u00bbMore From Moviegoers \u00bbMore From The End \u00bbMore From Draft \u00bbMore From Anxiety \u00bbMore From Menagerie \u00bbMore From Disunion \u00bbMore From Bedside \u00bbMore From The Conversation \u00bbMore From The Great Divide \u00bbMore From Errol Morris \u00bbFollowAdvertisement"}

Jack Fowler, the publisher of National Review, wrote on its website late Thursday that the publication had already received payback from the Republican Party for attacking the man who has been center stage at all the debates. \u201cTonight, a top official with the R.N.C. called me to say that National Review was being disinvited,\u201d Mr. Fowler wrote.  \u201cThe reason: Our \u2018Against Trump\u2019 editorial and symposium.

Grassley, Iowa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s senior senator and a member of Congress for over 40 years.Mr. Grassley did not come to the event to offer an endorsement for Mr. Trump. But by merely appearing behind a podium with a \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrump\u00e2\u0080\u009d sign on it and saying that he wanted to \u00e2\u0080\u009cmake America great again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s signature phrase, the pillar of Iowa Republican politics sent a powerful message to potential caucus-goers just over a week before the Feb 1 vote.Recognizing the energy Mr. Trump has tapped, Mr. Grassley began his remarks by saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m happy to be here with such an enthusiastic group and this candidate. And I want Mr. Trump to know I appreciate his support for me and most importantly for Iowa being first in the nation and our all-important Iowa caucuses.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Trump, who has been leading the Republican presidential candidates in national polls, was not on stage to hear the praise. He was still en route from an earlier rally in northwest Iowa. But a few hundred Iowans in attendance and battery of cameras in the back of the auditorium were there for his appearance.About a half-hour after Mr. Grassley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remarks, Mr. Trump took the stage here at Central College and immediately called for the senator to come back out. When Mr. Grassley did, Mr. Trump showered him with praise.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a great guy, this is a great guy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Trump as photographers snapped pictures of the unlikely pairing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s respected by everybody.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Grassley smiled, offered a wave to the crowd and left the stage without making any further comments.Mr. Grassley, who was elected to the Senate when Ronald Reagan won the presidency in 1980, rarely intervenes in the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s caucuses. But his presence here \u2014 just days after another mainstay of Iowa politics, six-term Gov. Terry E. Branstad, called for Senator Ted Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defeat in the caucuses \u00e2\u0080\u0093 underscores how much establishment-aligned Republicans have come to terms with the prospect of Mr. Trump winning Iowa.Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz are locked in a close race here entering the final week before the caucuses. Mr. Grassley and Mr. Branstad may not want Mr. Trump to ultimately be their nominee, but their comments suggest they would prefer him over Mr. Cruz.Mr. Branstad\u00e2\u0080\u0099s critique of Mr. Cruz was ostensibly over the Texas senator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opposition to federal mandates for the use corn-based ethanol, a major issue for Iowa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agriculture and renewable fuel industry.Mr. Grassley offered no criticism of Mr. Cruz. In fact, he did not mention Mr. Cruz at all. But that Mr. Grassley would appear at a Trump rally on the same afternoon that Mr. Cruz was in Mr. Grassley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hometown, New Hartford, Iowa, spoke for itself.While Mr. Cruz had made his name in Washington by being an irritant to many senior Republican senators, he has sought to develop a relationship with Mr. Grassley, co-sponsoring with him a 2013 bill on guns.Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aides, though, suggested Mr. Grassley\u2019s appearance here did not represent a slight: The Iowa senator is to appear at a town hall with Mr. Cruz on Friday. And as images of Mr. Grassley standing at the \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrump\u00e2\u0080\u009d podium ricocheted across Twitter, an aide to Senator Marco Rubio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign emailed to say: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSenator Grassley will be attending Marco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rally in Iowa next Saturday and introducing him to caucus-goers.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Grassley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interest in the presidential candidates is not entirely related to his interest in shaping his party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nominating process. He is up for re-election this fall and surely knows he will need the sort of anti-establishment voters backing Mr. Trump.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Facebook Moves to Ban Private Gun Sales on Its Site and Instagram", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Supported byFacebook already prohibits people from offering marijuana, pharmaceuticals and illegal drugs for sale, and the company said on Friday that it was updating its policy to include guns. The ban applies to private, person-to-person sales of guns. Licensed gun dealers and gun clubs can still maintain Facebook pages and post on Instagram.Although Facebook was not directly involved in gun sales, it has served as a forum for gun sales to be negotiated, without people having to undergo background checks. The social network, with 1.6 billion monthly visitors, had become one of the world\u2019s largest marketplaces for guns and was increasingly evolving into an e-commerce site where it could facilitate transactions of goods.Facebook said it would rely on its vast network of users to report any violations of the new rules, and would remove any post that violated the policy. Beyond that, the company said it could ban users or severely limit the ways they post on Facebook, depending on the type and severity of past violations. If the company believed someone\u2019s life was in danger, Facebook would work with law enforcement on the situation.Facebook will also rely on user reports of private gun sales that occur between members via Facebook Messenger, the company\u2019s private messaging service. Facebook does not scan the content of those messages.\u201cOver the last two years, more and more people have been using Facebook to discover products and to buy and sell things to one another,\u201d Monika Bickert, Facebook\u2019s head of product policy, said in a statement. \u201cWe are continuing to develop, test and launch new products to make this experience even better for people and are updating our regulated goods policies to reflect this evolution.\u201dNew York\u2019s attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, who has pressed for restrictions on illegal gun sales on Facebook and other sites, praised the company\u2019s move.\u201cToday\u2019s announcement is another positive step toward our shared goal of stopping illegal online gun sales once and for all,\u201d he said in a statement on Friday.Facebook plays host to scores of online groups that cater to gun enthusiasts, with members posting pictures and details about an individual gun, or a gun they might be looking to buy. Many of the groups are private, meaning that Facebook users may need to be approved by an administrator before they can see or write posts.Unlike professional gun sellers, hobbyists who sell or trade a few guns a year are not typically required to be licensed by the federal government. Some, like Scott Schmoke of Florida, say that Facebook helps them sell just a handful of weapons a year. Mr. Schmoke said in an interview this month that he always insisted on meeting potential buyers face-to-face, to feel them out.\u201cI go to a secure location, and I say, \u2018Can I see your driver\u2019s license? Do you have a concealed-weapons permit?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Schmoke said. If he gets a bad feeling, he does not sell, he said.But as an unlicensed seller, Mr. Schmoke is under no obligation to perform any kind of background check. Federal authorities have expressed worries that the Internet has fueled the sale of guns to felons and others who might normally be blocked from buying firearms.Facebook\u2019s progression toward on-site payments underscored the need to update the company\u2019s content policy, a Facebook spokeswoman said.The company has also been pushed by gun safety groups including Everytown for Gun Safety, an umbrella group that united the efforts of two separate organizations of mayors and mothers to promote gun safety. Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, one of those two advocacy groups, said she met with senior Facebook officials repeatedly over the last two years.Everytown for Gun Safety presented Facebook with research connecting unlicensed gun sales on the site to gun violence. For example, Ms. Watts said, in December 2014, an Ohio man, Brian Harleman, shot and wounded his ex-girlfriend and killed her 10-year-old daughter before killing himself. Although prohibited from buying firearms because of a felony conviction, he was able to buy the weapon in an unlicensed sale on Facebook.\u201cWe were saying, \u2018Please stop the unfettered access to guns on Facebook,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms. Watts, a mother of five in Colorado, said in an interview.Because of Facebook\u2019s tremendous influence, she said, its decision to ban person-to-person sales of guns will have ripple effects on gun policy nationwide.\u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is sending such an incredibly strong, sentinel signal to the world that America is working in the right direction on guns,\u201d she said. \u201cFor them to take a stand and do the right thing gives cover to other businesses to do the right thing.\u201dRachel Abrams contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Who\u2019d Steal Lincoln\u2019s Hand? Art Theft Baffles Illinois Museum", "Date": "2016-01-03", "News": "Supported byThe crime had no witnesses. There are no suspects. The police are not even certain when the hand disappeared.About all anyone knows is that a plaster sculpture of the 16th president\u2019s hand, proudly displayed for years at the Kankakee County Museum, has been missing from its shelf since at least Dec. 11.Any art theft would be jarring in Kankakee, a working-class city about an hour\u2019s drive south of Chicago, but because of its connection to Lincoln, the loss of this sculpture has touched a nerve here.More than 150 years since the former Illinois legislator ascended to the presidency, Lincoln remains ubiquitous in this state. His face is on the license plates. Illinois calls itself the \u201cLand of Lincoln.\u201d And along the interstate near the Kankakee exit, a giant statue of Honest Abe greets passing motorists from the parking lot of an equipment rental company.\u201cLincoln is a local treasure for us,\u201d said Chief Larry Regnier of the Kankakee police, whose department is investigating the theft. So far, Chief Regnier said, promising leads have been hard to come by.\u201cWe are blessed to have such a fine museum with an impressive inventory,\u201d the editorial said, \u201cbut the collection is not complete without Lincoln\u2019s hands.\u201dThe hand was the work of George Grey Barnard, a sculptor who spent part of his boyhood in Kankakee around the time that Lincoln was assassinated, and whose admiration of Lincoln was a recurring theme in his art. The sculpture was displayed along with other renderings of Lincoln in a wing of the county historical museum built specifically to showcase Mr. Barnard\u2019s work.Connie Licon, the museum\u2019s executive director, said the hand sculpture had been on display since at least 1991. This was the first art theft she said she could remember in more than 20 years at the museum.\u201cWe were devastated. It just brought us all to the floor,\u201d said Ms. Licon, who was alerted to the theft by a custodian who noticed the vacant spot on the shelf. \u201cWe\u2019re a small museum, and we just don\u2019t acquire pieces like this.\u201dThe police report estimated its worth at $5,000, but described the artwork as \u201cinvaluable.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s almost no way to put a value on something like that because there\u2019s no market,\u201d said Jack Klasey, a longtime museum volunteer and local historian.The theft occurred at the beginning of the museum\u2019s busiest month. In December, groups of schoolchildren and others streamed through the museum \u2014 past the Barnard sculptures, tributes to local sports heroes and artifacts honoring three Kankakee County natives who served as Illinois governor \u2014 to admire Christmas trees decorated by civic groups.\u201cI saw it in the newspaper and just thought, \u2018Who would go into that small museum and walk out with that hand?\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Trisha Campbell, who stopped by with her co-workers days after the theft was discovered to browse the Gallery of Trees at the museum.In addition to being outraged, museum visitors were perplexed. \u201cI think it\u2019s kind of crazy,\u201d said Kelly Lambert, a college student whose aunt works at the museum. \u201cWhy would someone want to walk off with a fake Abraham Lincoln hand?\u201dSince the theft, Ms. Licon said curators had removed other small Barnard pieces from the display, fearing that they might also disappear. \u201cNow we\u2019re paranoid,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re wondering: Is this person going to come back?\u201dThere is a precedent for stealing Lincoln memorabilia, said James Cornelius, a curator at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield, Ill. In recent decades, Dr. Cornelius said, manuscripts and books with ties to Lincoln have been reported stolen. And more dramatically, in the 1870s, a band of criminals failed in an attempt to steal Lincoln\u2019s body from his tomb in Springfield.Many in Kankakee said they assumed that the hand thief lived in the city, and that the crime was more of an impulse than a well-planned heist.Ms. Licon said she hoped the hand resurfaced soon.\u201cWhat makes people think what\u2019s someone else\u2019s belongs to them?\u201d she asked. \u201cJust return it in a quiet way. Just put it in a bag and leave it somewhere.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The couch maintained its allure, and it turns out a lot of days consist completely of going to work, going home and falling asleep.But creating a roughly six-minute video, assembled from about 365 snippets, did prove to be a vivid way of preserving moments that surely would have been forgotten. I often found myself forgoing quick-hit posts to Snapchat, Instagram and Facebook in favor of the delayed gratification of one big video, a year in the making.Mr. Kuriyama said the app, which has attracted more than 900,000 users since launching in 2013, has made him more mindful of the most meaningful thing to happen to him on a given day, even the mundane ones. Writing a daily diary seemed cumbersome to him, but a short video each day felt possible.\u201cI can\u2019t not have enough time to record a moment of video per day, and make that kind of a visual trigger to remember that day by,\u201d Mr. Kuriyama said.The videos he selected weren\u2019t necessarily of the most memorable second in each day. If he missed that second, or if he was too busy living it to get his phone out to record it, he might take a video that would remind him of that moment, like the wall just outside the spot where he had a meaningful conversation with a loved one. To others, it would be just a wall, but to him there is a memory attached.Reminding myself to look for a video every day was not easy, and I often failed. When a day felt empty, I would create a miniature time capsule of New York, pointing my lens toward a taxi or a tall building. I often made it through a memorable night and realized I had neglected to take a video. But being too present in an experience never felt like that bad a fate.\u201cI\u2019m a believer that in order to have self-improvement, you need self-reflection as well,\u201d Mr. Kuriyama said.If we self-reflected based on Instagram, we might be feeling a little too good about ourselves.Advertisement"}

It was very special.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMs. Itkonen, now 47, was first drawn to Greenland when she met a group of Greenlandic artists and musicians who were visiting Turku, Finland, where she was a graduate student in photography. Curious about their culture, she did research in the local library and decided to do her final project in Greenland.She was mystified after reading their creation story of the Mother of the Sea, in which a maiden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fingers are cut off, falling to the bottom of the ocean to become the creatures that sustain the Inuit: whales, walruses, seals and narwhals (which this writer actually thought were mythical creatures; my mistake.)Ms. Itkonen has visited Greenland 11 times since 1995 and spent the first seven years making portraits and documentary photographs of the Inughuit communities in Thule, home to the northernmost settlements in the world. Although huge, its existing four villages are home to merely 800 people.She was immediately embraced by the Inughuit, and says it was easier for her, being a young woman. They offered her places to stay in their homes and took her along on hunting and fishing expeditions, traveling by \u00e2\u0080\u009cdogsled, motorboat, sailboat, small plane, helicopter, cruise ship, cargo ship and oil tanker.\u00e2\u0080\u009d (They even taught her how to kill little auks, a local species of bird.)When she first visited Thule, she was a vegetarian \u00e2\u0080\u0093 until savoring the local delicacies she was offered, like raw whale skin, polar bear and musk ox. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey were very tasty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cso I started to eat meat again in Finland.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn 2005, she shifted her attention to the landscape in Uummannaq and Ilulissat, communities in western Greenland with the shrinking icebergs. It was the beauty of the place, rather than environmental concerns, that caught her attention. As such, she used a panoramic camera, so as not to make inappropriate crops to the hypnotic horizon.\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can see 50 kilometers away in each direction,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Itkonen said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt felt like, this is it. There is nothing else. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very relaxing. You can look at the same view for all the days and weeks. The landscape changes all the time because of the floating icebergs. Sometimes the sea is full of icebergs, and the next day they are gone.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThese days, it is hard for her to discuss her experiences in Greenland without acknowledging the changes wrought by global warming.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the beginning, nobody talked about climate change there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was 10 years ago when I was in Qaanaaq. I heard local people talk about warming temperatures. It was one hunter who told me that earlier, the sea was covered by ice for nine months, and it was two meters thick. But now there is only sea ice for a few months and only 30 centimeters, or even thinner.\u00e2\u0080\u009dPeople tell her stories of hunters and dogsled teams that have fallen to their deaths through the thin ice. She has heard that the sea ice will be gone by 2040, if the planet warms at its current rate, most likely forcing the communities to relocate.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe people are moving from one place to another,\u201d she said. \u201cThey can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stay in the settlements where the hunting has been the way to earn their living. They have to find new jobs and move out from the area.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMs. Itkonen views Greenland as her life\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work, and she is glad to have documented these landscapes and settlements before they vanish. She plans to return to Thule, where she photographed people years ago, to see how their lives have changed. (\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow everyone is on Facebook,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.) Some subjects have died, children have grown, and she anticipates rekindling long-dormant relationships.She is also interested in photographing the changing landscape over time, revisiting icebergs to see for herself what they look like, watching the remnants drift past across the sea.Although she was not drawn to Greenland as an environmental warrior, the issue of climate change now dominates her thoughts. As a Westerner, she recognizes her own complicity, and mourns the losses that are to come.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know the word.

{"Headline": "Reducing Unnecessary C-Section Births", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "You are about to give birth. Pregnancy has gone smoothly. The birth seems as if it will, too. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one baby, in the right position, full term, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never had a cesarean section \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in other words, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re at low risk for complications.What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likely to be the biggest influence on whether you will have a C-section?Some hospitals consider very big babies to be automatic C-sections. Some don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. A pattern on a fetal heart rate monitor might prompt a C-section in one hospital, and a \u00e2\u0080\u009cwatch and wait\u00e2\u0080\u009d at another. Doctors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 choices matter, of course, but a hospital can set rules that limit those choices.\u00e2\u0080\u009cOne view is,\u00e2\u0080\u0098Gosh, this patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just not progressing,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d said David Lagrew, an obstetrician who is the chief integration and accountability officer for MemorialCare Health System in Southern California. \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u2019She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to have a C-section in a couple of hours anyway, so let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s get it over with. The patient won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t suffer more, and I can go home and I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get replaced by someone else.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Or, you can say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wait another hour or two.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009dC-sections save lives \u00e2\u0080\u0094 when needed. But the enormous variation in rates, with very little variation in outcomes, shows that a great many of them aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessary. In the last 15 years, the rate of C-section has gone up by 50 percent in the United States. According to Jeffrey Ecker, chairman of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists\u00e2\u0080\u0099 committee on obstetric practice, that rise \u00e2\u0080\u009chas not been paralleled by any important fall in rates of things like cerebral palsy\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in other words, outcomes that C-sections are often performed to prevent.C-sections themselves pose some risks to babies, and can create serious complications for mothers, such as hemorrhage, infection and post-partum depression. Having a first baby by C-section leaves a woman with a 90 percent chance that subsequent births will be by C-section as well. And with each C-section, the risk of serious complications rises. In hospitals that use fee-for-service billing, however, the bulk of an obstetrician\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pay comes from performing the actual delivery, so doctors want to do their own. This leads to a reluctance to wait.The vast majority of hospitals are still fee-for-service. Are there measures these hospitals can take to lower their C-section rates?The pilot program was prompted by three developments:\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe U.S. suddenly got into crazy range \u00e2\u0080\u0094 high 30s to 50 percent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Lagrew. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve begun to see the complications in subsequent pregnancies \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the placental complications and near-death or death caused from surgery done two to three years prior.\u00c2\u00a0 That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the \u00e2\u0080\u0098aha!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 moment now driving the impetus to lower it back down.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAlso, there are post-operative costs: readmissions, home care and the high likelihood that subsequent births will also be by C-section, plus the costs and lost work time of having to recover from major surgery.Kim Mikes, operations director of the Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Health Institute at Hoag, said that from conversations with the Pacific Business Group on Health, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe knew they were starting to look at an organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rates, and we knew it was going to be a determinant of who would be contracted with and who wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Benefits managers from local corporations also started raising concerns with different hospitals. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe started talking about how we could try to raise awareness of these issues and get those numbers down,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mikes said, adding that the hospital told physicians: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is not a matter of convenience. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to end up impacting us financially, and the health of our patients.\u00e2\u0080\u009dRead previous contributions to this series.And here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how the hospitals lowered their C-section rates:\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn academic circles there is consensus at a population level that C-section rates are too high,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ecker. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut many of those same doctors would say: \u00e2\u0080\u0098The way I practice is right and good.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Translating \u00e2\u0080\u0098The rate is too high\u00e2\u0080\u0099 into which patients are not to get a C-section delivery is much more difficult.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMain said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cPhysicians in private practice don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want anybody telling them what to do. Hospital administrations can say: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Let doctors be doctors. Whatever they do is their business.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 We see that in a lot of small and medium hospitals.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut the data was persuasive.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn other hospitals, physicians don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have access to data on their C-section rate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Brynn Rubinstein, senior manager of Pacific Business Group on Health\u2019s Transform Maternity Care project. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll remember their last ten, but they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really have actual data in hand and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not being compared to other physicians in their hospital. Having access to this to drill down is really powerful. It gave physicians an idea of where they really stood outside the norm, which was hugely important for clinician buy-in.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAt first, doctors saw only their own data. Hoag then released the data to all doctors, and suddenly everyone knew how everyone was doing. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when C-section rates took a big drop. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo one likes to be the outlier,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Main.Now hospitals are slicing the data thinner \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for example, to look at how often individual doctors induced labor in patients whose cervix was insufficiently dilated, a step that often leads to C-section. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re about to get a new bump downward,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lagrew.At Hoag, doctors used to be able to easily schedule C-sections, no approval needed. The hospital made it more cumbersome. Now they must indicate whether the reason is medical or elective, and the request must be approved by a division chief and a laborist \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an in-hospital doctor who handles deliveries.The hospital also requires patients in the low-risk category to read a brochure about C-section titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cUnderstanding the Risks.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMemorialCare now discourages inducing labor until the cervix has reached a point where labor is likely to be short and successful. The hospital created uniform terminology for fetal heart rate patterns, and standards for how to respond.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe worry is still there, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mitigated if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m following a standard protocol and using best practice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lagrew.Mikes, who is a nurse herself, said of her colleagues: \u00e2\u0080\u009cA lot has to do with support they provide, how confident they help patients feel about their ability to deliver, how active they keep patients in the early stages.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hoag began giving bonuses and merit raises to nurses who were supportive and active with patients \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe ones not hanging around the desk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as she put it.Doctors don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t monitor labor. Nurses and hospitalists do. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen the nurse is on phone to the doctor, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important how they present it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mikes said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt can be: \u00e2\u0080\u0098She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not moving that fast,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 or \u00e2\u0080\u0098She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not moving as fast as I had hoped but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m trying this and this.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009dMemorialCare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Saddleback hospital amplified the role of hospitalists. They watch labor and do deliveries \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with the delivery fee still going to the absent doctor, which allows the doctor to go home without doing a preemptive C-section.Each hospital negotiated with one or two of its insurers to pay a uniform rate for childbirth, vaginal or not. The negotiations took a long time, and the new payment schemes didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t kick in until months after the hospitals dropped their C-section rates. And since only a few insurers were involved, only 10 percent to 20 percent of births were covered. Nevertheless, the payment reform may have been very influential, because people knew it was coming \u00e2\u0080\u0094 indeed, this small step is likely a glimpse of the future \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and it was a constant topic in hospital meetings.The California HealthCare Foundation now plans to help at least 60 hospitals \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a quarter of all those in the state \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to start the program this year. It has also provided funding for the Maternal Quality Care Collaborative to create a toolkit; once a hospital has used data to pinpoint the drivers of a high C-section rate, the toolkit will suggest attack strategies.The foundation plans to work with large employers to bring their concerns about unnecessary C-sections to the hospitals they use. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEven if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not on board, you have to start paying attention,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Stephanie Teleki, senior program officer for high-value care at the foundation.Spreading the program may be much more difficult than it was to pilot. Hoag and MemorialCare signed on precisely because their leaders are dedicated to bringing down C-section rates; Lagrew, for instance, has been working on the problem since the 1980s. That commitment is a key to reducing unnecessary C-sections and to maintaining that reduction. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo sustain the change you have to bake it into the system,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lagrew. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo physicians don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go back to, \u00e2\u0080\u0098It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the holiday weekend and I want to go home.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009dMore From Fixes \u00bbMore From Private Lives \u00bbMore From Couch \u00bbMore From The Stone \u00bbMore From Moviegoers \u00bbMore From The End \u00bbMore From Draft \u00bbMore From Anxiety \u00bbMore From Menagerie \u00bbMore From Disunion \u00bbMore From Bedside \u00bbMore From The Conversation \u00bbMore From The Great Divide \u00bbMore From Errol Morris \u00bbFollowAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Invitation Into the Shadowy World of Match Fixing", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Supported byEssayMELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 I was walking to my neighborhood Starbucks in Washington one morning last year when I received a Facebook message request from \u201cBen Rotenberg.\u201d\u201cHello mr Ben,\u201d the sender began, \u201care you interesting information about fixed match? I be write in Russian.\u201dI was certainly interested in learning more about this figure who had created a Facebook account in (almost) my name for the sole purpose of contacting me, so we switched to Russian.That match, my new Facebook friend said, was \u201conly a drop in the ocean.\u201d\u201cI hope you realize how deep the rabbit hole is,\u201d he added. \u201cI personally suffered from these people. And they have a sense of impunity. It must stop.\u201dNot confident in the secrecy of Facebook, even with this puppet account, he moved our conversation to Viber, a messaging app popular in Eastern Europe that never stores communications on a server.On the second day of our correspondence, he directed me to find the live score display of a first-round match at an ATP Challenger event, which was midway through the first set.\u201cYou cannot talk to anyone about this,\u201d he said.He then named the player who he declared would have his serve broken in the second service game of the second set. As that set began, he said he had further learned that the score of the set would be 6-0.Sure enough, one, two, three games quickly fell. Knowing that the ATP streams many Challenger matches live online, I scrambled to find the correct page to watch the rest for myself.When I tuned in, it seemed I had found what I was promised. While some of the player\u2019s shots appeared ordinary, many were missed wildly wide and long, and others dumped droopily into the net. There was a double fault on match point, and the set ended with a score of 6-0 after just 19 minutes.(The player who I was told would throw the match was not a good actor. Several tennis gamblers noted on Twitter what they considered a blatant dumping of the match, with one creating a GIF of a serve that had landed near the baseline.)In Melbourne last week, with reports of match fixing stealing the show, I tracked down the player who won that match last year. I asked him what he remembered about it \u2014 specifically the speedy second set.\u201cHe dropped his level, for sure,\u201d he said, adding that he had not suspected anything unusual at the time. \u201cI cannot say anything; I did not start to play amazing shots.\u201dAfter that match, my new pen pal had written to me: \u201cWhat do you think? I was not joking. Are you interested in getting into the hole?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m impressed,\u201d I replied.Having proved his credentials, my source grew more effusive, telling me more about the channels by which games, sets and matches are bought and sold.There was an international network of players and fixers, he said, with many of the fixers \u2014 himself included \u2014 having played tennis on some professional level. The connections these players already had in locker rooms around the circuit made them ideally suited for recruiting when they shifted from the playing side to the paying side of the equation. Communications, like ours, were conducted over Viber or other similar untraceable apps; phone numbers were often changed as well.He named three former players who led the fixing rings in which he spun: one from Russia, one from Central Europe and one from Central Asia. I had heard of only one, but all three had profile pages on the ATP website showing rankings that never touched the top 150.He reeled off several matches that he said included fixed sets.Many were at the bottom-tier Futures level, where prize money of $10,000 is divided among all players, and first-round losers in singles get a check for only $98. Some, though, were on the main ATP and WTA Tours (one allegedly planned 6-0 set, at a WTA tournament in China, had taken place two months earlier).He also claimed to know the rough prices of various fixes on the menu, which I couldn\u2019t independently corroborate. Buying a service break at a Futures event cost $300 to $500, he said. A set was $1,000 to $2,000, and a match was $2,000 to $3,000.It was more expensive to fix an outcome on the next tier, the Challenger level, with sets and matches running in the $10,000-to-$15,000 range, he said.On the ATP and WTA Tours, a single set could cost $25,000. A match was in the neighborhood of $100,000.\u201cIt is an interesting spectacle,\u201d he said of buying a result. \u201cYou feel like a prophet.\u201dSeveral times he tried to contact me while I was asleep to tell me about a fixed live match at the Futures level. I had never heard of any of the players he was mentioning, even enough to know, by seeing their surnames, if it was a men\u2019s or women\u2019s tournament.Though his information continued to seem accurate, much of it ultimately felt meaningless. There are about 120,000 professional tennis matches in a year; though thousands of dollars can flow through the betting markets of any of them with the expansion of live score data and then live betting, the ones at the lowest levels, from which the majority of his information sprang, meant little to the level of elite tennis that I cover.Promising more information about matches at Grand Slams and the ATP and WTA Tours, he suggested I chip in some money so we could buy knowledge of the upper floors of the operations. After I repeatedly made it clear that I would not cross that line, he went silent in mid-December, and he has not logged on to the Viber or Facebook accounts he has used since.Masha Goncharova contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "#Match4Lara: Mixed-Race Marrow Search That\u2019s Going Viral", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Lara Casalotti, a 24-year-old global migration master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s student in Britain, had a pain in her lower back. At first it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem like much, but then when she was in Thailand researching migrant worker conditions, it grew worse and required hospitalization. On Dec. 14, the young human rights activist learned her pain wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t from a pulled muscle: She was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, a blood cancer that would require a stem cell transplant by April to save her life.For many people, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not so hard. Patients can find a registered donor with comparable tissue DNA by searching national and international registries within their racial group. By far the most registered race, white patients have a 97 percent chance of finding a tissue match. Yet only about 75 percent of black, Asian or ethnic minority people who need a stem cell transplant will find a perfect match.But then Lara and her friends and family sprang into action.Please RT! A Eurasian donor is desperately needed to save this young woman\u2019s life. Do your thing, Twitter! https://t.co/oP24CINiOf\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was certainly surreal to hear David Cameron say my name in Parliament,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lara said by phone, laughing.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is something that will take them no time at all, and can make a life changing difference,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gillespie said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe know that there are giving, loving, caring people in Hollywood, and it only takes one tweet to make a major difference in saving a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life.\u00e2\u0080\u009dOutside of Hollywood, Gillespie has been shocked by the global success of Lara\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story. In just over three weeks, Anthony Nolan had 12,000 new registrations from the Match4Lara campaign, a 400 percent increase compared to last year. \u201cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even more unprecedented has been the proportion of black, Asian or mixed race people; normally this is around 14 percent for us, but during Match4Lara it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been at about 50 percent throughout,\u201d said Emily Rosselli of Anthony Nolan.Gillespie found herself exchanging information over Facebook with a woman in Nepal.\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a home or food because of the earthquake and here she is, asking me how she can help Lara.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAs the populations of blended people continue to grow, so too will the need for donors of these genetically complex tissue types. Donor registry must close gaps in donor options not only for leukemia patients, but also other blood diseases like sickle cell anemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Lara\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story has brought an increasingly blended world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention to the imbalance of donors and lifesaving options for people from mixed backgrounds.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe fact that Lara is mixed race speaks to a very specific community,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gillespie explains of Lara\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worldwide appeal. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe mixed race community says, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m the only community that can help her.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009dLara\u00e2\u0080\u0099s view of the world mirrors her diverse heritage.

On Wednesday, for instance, Mr. Kasich, a former Budget Committee chairman, celebrated his endorsement by former Representative Chuck Douglas of New Hampshire, a Republican who served one term in the House more than 25 years ago.\u201cI had the honor of serving in Congress with John and can personally attest that he is a man of ideas, integrity and enthusiasm,\u201d Mr. Douglas, who left the House in 1991, said in a statement.Mr. Kasich has surrounded himself with former Hill allies such as Trent Lott, the former Republican leader who left in 2007. And he has heralded backing from former Senators Al D\u2019Amato of New York (defeated in 1998) and Ben Nighthorse Campbell, the Colorado Democrat turned Republican who left in 2005.

Mr. Bouda, then 22, was soon swept up by the local police and spent the next three days in jail in Tizi Ouzou, Algeria.Yet it was in jail that his passion for photographing his people, the Berbers (or Amazighs), was sparked.

All told, the group has raised almost $51 million in the 2016 election cycle.In addition to the money raised, donors have committed to providing at least $42 million in additional contributions, officials said. Those pledges would allow the group to exceed its total fund-raising for the 2012 cycle, when Priorities was formed to help President Obama win re-election. As of Friday, the group had almost $45 million in cash on hand.\u201cWe have raised significantly more resources than at this point in 2012, built a team of our Party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strongest leaders and activists, and are developing cutting-edge strategies to reach Democratic and undecided voters in every battleground state,\u201d Guy Cecil, the group\u2019s co-chairman, said in a memorandum obtained by The New York Times.While full details of Priorities\u2019 fund-raising will not be available until the super PAC files its official fund-raising reports with the Federal Election Commission this weekend, Mr. Cecil\u2019s memorandum said the group had raised money from several labor unions that are backing Mrs. Clinton, including the American Federation of Teachers and the Laborers\u2019 International Union of North America.A person with knowledge of the group\u2019s fund-raising said the organization had also secured large donations or commitments from a number of wealthy individuals, including James Simons, a New York hedge fund founder, and Danny Abraham, a Florida entrepreneur.While Mrs. Clinton remains locked in the polls with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in Iowa and New Hampshire, Priorities has so far banked most of its money for an expected general election campaign.

It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s street culture.\u00e2\u0080\u009dPantsula, a dance that is more like a way of life, captivated Chris Saunders, who set out to document a subculture with roots in jazz and hip-hop.The performances of pantsula, like many art forms rooted in street culture, are typically responses to cultural and political issues in the communities. When a state of emergency was declared in South Africa in the mid-1980s, pantsula allowed male dancers to bond over their shared experiences under apartheid.It took Mr. Saunders several months to get beyond the scene\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fringes and earn the trust of pantsula crews, who were apprehensive that they would be misrepresented by a white South African. He showed up to the same townships day after day, often never pulling out his camera. By the time the dancers were comfortable with him, he had understood the pulse and rhythms of the dances. With each beat, he paced and timed his shots.In 2012, he met Daniela Goeller, a German writer based in Paris, who had received a fellowship to conduct research on pantsula. Ms. Goeller was also drawn to the dance, but said she was mostly concerned with creating an archive of the current dancers to show its greater, collective significance in South African culture.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe history of pantsula is poorly documented and its importance as a youth-culture and an identification for young people is largely overshadowed by the dance as an art form alone \u00e2\u0080\u0094 two reasons to protect this particular cultural heritage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Goeller wrote in an email. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe social aspect is important.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is no coherent documentation about this dance form, its history, where it comes from,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Goeller said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is really an opportunity to gather this information so this culture can be recognized.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSicelo Xaba has been a pantsula dancer since he was 13 and is a co-author of the pantsula book and one of the founding members of Impilo Mapantsula. Growing up in a small township in west Johannesburg, Mr. Xaba, 38, remembers being exposed to musical and dance influences from around the world. His mother and father loved to dance around their small home to South African jazz artists, as well as James Brown, Michael Jackson and Miles Davis, who were played on vinyl.He joined the pantsula group Red for Danger when he was 16 and has been with it ever since.He has also become a spokesman and advocate for pantsula, even going to France for a cultural exchange program to teach the dance to younger performers.But with each victory, Mr. Xaba says he is only reminded of how far the pantsula dance troupes still have to go in gaining it credibility as an accepted dance form. He would like to see a bigger international market so that dancers can make a living by touring. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMichael Flatley does work as art, though it is dancing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Xaba said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I think is pantsula. If you are on that level, the whole world is going to pay attention.

As human beings, we have evolved to put virtually everything we see, hear and experience into neat boxes, carefully labeled and stored away. Places, tastes and people that deviate make us squirm and, like toddlers, we try to cram those square blocks into round holes.The project, a collaborative portrait project of Ms. Turner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s queer community in New Orleans, began with a realization that what she was seeing in history books and on gallery walls didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t reflect the people and lives she knew. Even where queer histories were told, they were usually by and about gay men. Where were the women in the photos? And where were the images they made?With \u00e2\u0080\u009cTuff Enuff\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 whose name comes from the knuckle tattoos of her best friend and platonic life partner, Meredith \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Ms. Turner is trying to fill in some of those gaps. Her subjects are her closest friends, she explained in her artist statement: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThose whose struggles and triumphs I witness and who usher me through all of mine. They are my friends, roommates, coworkers, lovers and ex-lovers.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe image-making process is intensely collaborative, beginning with hours of conversation about pose, props and presentation that sometimes stretch out across weeks or months. For Ms. Turner, there is no other way to work. The people, and her relationship to them, are at the heart of the project, and their ideas about how they want to be represented drive the work. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNone of these could exist without the people in them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said of her images.One image began as an elaborate idea with a pony and costumes, but the process didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel right. In the end, it became a simple photo of the woman, topless (unplanned), holding her child. Another series of images of a woman boxing took place on Ms. Turner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kitchen table, with elements nailed to the wall to get the scene right. Courtney Webster, the boxer, wanted to present an image of a queer woman of color as powerful, and drew her inspiration from images of Muhammad Ali.\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou really settle into it and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the reasons why I love tintypes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Turner said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople, they ground themselves and you really feel that weight of, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m here.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u200a\u00e2\u0080\u009d What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more, the process is most sensitive to ultraviolet light, and the resulting image is backward. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very transformative,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt helps be more of this portrait of how someone is feeling and sitting than articulating every pore on their skin.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe printing is also part of the process. Ms. Turner is a master printer and enlarges her photographs to two- by three-foot prints, which makes a soft image even softer, intentionally. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEven though they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very specific portraits, that makes them a little more universal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.The resulting photographs have an elusive, out-of-time quality. They range from striking, timeless portraits whose subjects demand the attention of the viewer, to ethereal images made on a beach, where the silvery shimmer of the sea blends seamlessly into the sky and hazy figures dot the foreground. Regardless of pose or style of the subject, the people in the photographs seem untethered and unbowed, and the series is flecked through with wildness and triumph.Taken as a whole, the body of work is art as activism rewriting history, but also simply exalting people as they are. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m trying to celebrate exactly as we are right now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Turner said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am trying to celebrate with a lot of love and admiration exactly where people are right now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

Trump all week on the campaign trail and in television commercials here, is now broadening his attacks to include Senator Marco Rubio, an unmistakable acknowledgment that Mr. Rubio is gaining support in the closing days before the Monday caucuses.Mr. Cruz incorporated a critique of Mr. Rubio into his closing stump speech at a rally in West Des Moines on Wednesday night, arguing that his colleague had effectively given up the fight against same-sex marriage after the Supreme Court ruling last year legalized those unions.\u00e2\u0080\u009cSeveral of the leading Republican candidates, including both Donald Trump and Marco Rubio, said publicly this decision is settled, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the law of the land, we should accept it, surrender and move on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Cruz, drawing boos. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThose are word for word the talking points of Barack Obama. There is something profoundly wrong when Republican presidential candidates are reading Barack Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talking points on marriage.\u00e2\u0080\u009dJust as striking, Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign quietly began running an ad in Iowa Thursday targeting Mr. Rubio over his support of \u00e2\u0080\u009camnesty\u00e2\u0080\u009d for undocumented immigrants.Showing images of Mr. Rubio standing with the so-called Gang of Eight senators who wrote the 2013 immigration overhaul, the spot features a clip from Rush Limbaugh explaining that the Florida senator was a part of that group while Mr. Cruz was not.The ad, which Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign did not release to the media, also flashes a message on screen: \u00e2\u0080\u009cRubio betrayed our trust.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Cruz has not been reluctant to criticize Mr. Rubio when faced with questions from voters and reporters. But until now he has not used his carefully crafted stump speech to attack his colleague by name. And while a group supporting Mr. Cruz has run ads criticizing Mr. Rubio, the Cruz campaign has not until now.Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pivot toward Mr. Rubio underscores the degree to which the Texas senator, after leading here for over a month, is effectively fighting a two-front war in Iowa. He is furiously attempting to portray the ascendant Mr. Trump as an inauthentic conservative while also scrambling to tamp down an emerging threat from Mr. Rubio.After hovering in single digits for months in Iowa, Mr. Rubio has moved into the teens in many surveys here. And the same public polls indicate that Mr. Trump now has overtaken Mr. Cruz in Iowa, but there are substantial questions over how close the race is because of questions over how many Republicans will participate in the caucuses.Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lead is significantly higher under polling models that project a turnout above 150,000, but the race narrows when turnout is projected closer to 130,000. About 121,500 Iowa Republicans cast votes in the 2012 Iowa caucuses, a number most in the state expect to be exceeded on Monday.Nick Corasaniti contributed reporting.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just saying. I think Drake is an outstanding entertainer. But Kendrick, his lyrics \u2014 his last album was outstanding.

It was passed under special budget rules that prevented Senate Democrats from using a filibuster to block, as they have in the past. But Republicans seizing the majority in the Senate will allow them to finally push the measure through to Mr. Obama.The victory, while symbolic, will be short-lived. Mr. Obama will certainly veto a measure that repeals his signature domestic policy achievement. House Republicans will try to override the veto but cannot reach the necessary threshold without Democratic support.But Republicans view forcing the president to reject the measure as meeting their promise to do whatever they can to overturn the legislation.

Ronald Reagan is a hero of his. And Donald J. Trump, he says, is no Ronald Reagan.As Mr. Trump has faced growing scrutiny for supporting some liberal causes over the years, he has said that Mr. Reagan, too, experienced a political evolution in his time.Mr. Cruz on Monday offered a point-by-point rebuttal, sharpening an increasingly aggressive set of attacks aimed at what he says are the real estate mogul\u2019s shape-shifting views.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will note that Ronald Reagan spent decades as a principled conservative,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz told reporters before a town-hall-style event here. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRonald Reagan did not spend the first 60 years of his life supporting Democratic politicians.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Cruz proceeded to offer a few names of people Mr. Trump had donated to \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including Andrew Cuomo, Hillary Clinton, Anthony Weiner and Rahm Emanuel.

Trump was set to hold a rally on Thursday night, more than 100 protesters gathered across the street, hoisting signs reading \u201cBern, Trump, Bern\u201d and chanting that Mr. Trump should stay away. More demonstrators clustered nearly, holding candles in silent vigil.In response, those at the head of the line to see Mr. Trump \u2014 many of whom had been standing in the cold all day to ensure that they get a seat in the oversubscribed auditorium at the Flynn Center for the Performing Arts \u2014 chanted, \u201cBuild a wall,\u201d referring to an early campaign line of Mr. Trump, and \u201cU.S.A.! U.S.A.!\u201dIt was a clash of words and signs not wholly unanticipated here in a liberal enclave that is fiercely loyal to Senator Bernie Sanders, the Democratic presidential candidate who was the mayor here before going on to Congress.Indeed, Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to hold a campaign rally in Burlington was met by many residents with bewilderment, and some made a special effort to show their support for Mr. Sanders on Thursday.

{"Headline": "Off-Season Weddings Can Be Quirky Good Fun, or a Disaster", "Date": "2016-01-14", "News": "Supported byField NotesIt is very likely that you\u2019ve seen this invitation before: the nuptials in Florida in August or the bridal procession in Maine in January. And though there was always a Crazy Pete in your life who wanted to bomb down the ski slope after saying \u201cI do\u201d atop an icy Vermont peak in February, Crazy Pete seems to have become far more the norm than the outlier.There are reasons why certain venues \u2014 particularly popular destinations in the Caribbean, Central America or north of the border \u2014 are cheaper to book off-season. Poor weather ranks chief among the downsides. And not everyone is pleased to get that invitation to travel to an out-of-the-way spot on a less-than-ideal date.Although \u201cit\u2019s prudent to consider costs,\u201d Ms. Gottsman said, she also advises that you be mindful of your guests and not choose a supremely inconvenient location or season. \u201cYou have to be understanding if even your close friends or family decline,\u201d she said. Off-season weddings also require more planning, she advised. You\u2019ll need \u201ca Plan A, Plan B and Plan C,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it is truly horrific weather, you have to be prepared \u2014 and not just for the ceremony. What about activities that guests can do? Get in touch with a local planner. A lot of times during off-season, there are less things open.\u201dJane Peterson, a registered nurse in San Diego, and her husband attended a wedding in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, during last year\u2019s hurricane season. The weather was hit or miss, Ms. Peterson said. When a thunderstorm moved in, \u201cit happened so fast,\u201d and she was too afraid to go in the water at the beachside location because \u201cthe waves were really huge,\u201d she said. And while it stormed outside, there also wasn\u2019t much to do at a big resort in the Caribbean in the off-season, she noted.The larger issue for the Petersons, who have two young kids at home, was one that many married couples invited to destination weddings face. Traveling to a wedding requires planning, finding child care and some significant costs. \u201cThe bride and groom can maybe stay after a destination wedding for their honeymoon, but for us, we have limited time and money,\u201d she said.I had to attend a wedding for a childhood friend during the rainy season in Nosara, Costa Rica. The precipitation could have flooded Noah\u2019s ark. The sheets of rain downed trees, flooded routes and kept about half the wedding\u2019s already short guest list from arriving on time.One woman was stranded in San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica, because no local driver was deluded enough to brave the conditions. A couple tried to traverse the roads in their rented S.U.V. but ended up stuck in mud, where they spent the night with their feet up to avoid the water pooling on their floor mats. Somehow, my husband and I were one of the few to make it to the destination, only to find the bride and groom in tall rain boots and headlamps walking up and down a flooded dirt road to see if any of their guests had actually been nuts enough to drive in.But the situation doesn\u2019t have to reach biblical proportions for an off-season wedding to become an issue.There\u2019s the dreaded wedding-over-the-holidays invitation. For Kaila Deutsch, a fashion merchandiser in Manhattan, it wasn\u2019t the weather that dampened her spirits; it was the New Year\u2019s Eve timing.She and her boyfriend had planned to spend Christmas to New Year\u2019s in Mexico, but instead found themselves braving freezing weather and major flooding in the St. Louis area for a wedding. \u201cThe band didn\u2019t start playing until 10 p.m., which I have a hunch is because the bride and groom wanted to make it last to the midnight countdown,\u201d she said. \u201cBut by then it was too late because we were in a weird stage of drinking.\u201d She added that \u201cthe party never really got off the ground; the vibe was not like your usual New Year\u2019s Eve at all.\u201dBut off-season weddings that offer guests unusual settings and circumstances can also be magical.Amy Glickman, a communications consultant in Los Angeles, married her husband in New York in February 2009 at the IAC building. \u201cIt was 20 degrees out, and I had sorority sisters flying in from Scottsdale and L.A.,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were absolutely completely grumpy about it. I got a stream of emails on \u2018What do I wear? What do I do?\u2019 It was like hysteria.\u201dEven so, Ms. Glickman said the black-tie wedding was particularly special because of the environment. The IAC building, which is across the street from the Hudson River, was a unique location \u201cas they had just opened it, and Feb. 7 was the day that we could get,\u201d Ms. Glickman said. She also brought in the wedding designer David Stark, who transformed the space. \u201cIt was freezing outside, but inside was warm and inviting,\u201d she said. \u201cThe contrast was what made it beautiful. Everyone had a wonderful time.\u201dRebecca Gardner, an event planner based in Savannah, Ga., and New York, advises couples not to forget about the basics when the wedding is still in its blueprint stages. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s a party,\u201d she said, \u201cand off-season or not, this is the secret sauce: booze, plenty of it; beautiful lighting, because if you have gorgeous candlelight, no one is going to see the sweat stains on the groom\u2019s tuxedo because the wedding is in an inconvenient place in August; and good music.\u201dOnce your guests arrive, the bride and groom need to truly play the proper hosts. \u201cIf you\u2019re asking guests to take off work and travel far and wide, you need to include them in activities more than you normally would,\u201d Ms. Gottsman said. \u201cFor example, all guests should be invited to the rehearsal dinner instead of just family and the wedding party.\u201dKeep in mind, also, that if the couple are having fun, it\u2019s likely to be infectious. \u201cIf you have a grumpy, disappointed bride, it\u2019ll be Eeyore\u2019s cloud on the whole event,\u201d Ms. Gardner said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never seen a wedding go bad if the bride is out there enjoying herself on the dance floor.\u201dBesides, there\u2019s another possible upside to an off-season wedding: It certainly makes for a memorable story. When we were in Nosara, the skies cleared right before the wedding ceremony, which made for a stunning tableau. And to this day, my husband can endlessly brag about how he handled the treacherous road conditions like a domesticated Bear Grylls.Wedding Gift Cash Grab. What\u2019s Too Little?

{"Headline": "In Taiwan, Survivor Mentality Stymies Tech Innovation", "Date": "2016-01-14", "News": "Supported byTAIPEI, Taiwan \u2014 With its offices sporting wood flooring, a roof painted bright orange and conference rooms named after target markets in Southeast Asia, AppWorks, one of Taiwan\u2019s few start-up accelerators, has the look and feel of the American counterparts it\u2019s modeled on.But its founder, Jamie Lin, 37, does not sound much like the optimistic entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley. Instead, he is glum about the future for Taiwan\u2019s tech industry.\u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re riding on the Titanic, and you know it\u2019s going to hit an iceberg, and you\u2019re trying to turn the rudder, but you know it\u2019s not turning fast enough,\u201d he said in a recent interview.Five years ago, Taiwan\u2019s tech industry was riding high. The device maker HTC had surpassed Apple to become the largest smartphone vendor in the United States, while the computer company Acer had leapfrogged Dell to become the world\u2019s second-largest personal computer maker. Such successes helped lift Taiwan\u2019s economy, building on the country\u2019s longtime work on computer chips and moving the island nation into its next phase as a tech power.As voters went to the polls and elected a new president over the weekend, a rare point of agreement between Taiwan\u2019s fractious political parties was that the tech industry needs help. Just days before the election four years ago, major Taiwan tech figures took to television to argue that the policies of the incumbent president, Ma Ying-jeou, to improve relations with China would lift the industry.Taiwan\u2019s tech problem, as Mr. Lin sees it, is the result of a culture and government that have failed to generate the talent and flexibility to move beyond the manufacturing prowess that made the island a tech hub in the 1980s and \u201990s and forward to the software and Internet industries driving Silicon Valley\u2019s current boom. The dilemma became apparent to him in 2009 when he saw a commercial for Apple\u2019s iPhone.\u201cThe commercial said whatever you want to do, there\u2019s an app for that,\u201d Mr. Lin said. \u201cImmediately, I realized that\u2019s the end of Taiwan. We\u2019re so good at making cheap computers and phones, but we\u2019re so bad at making an app for anything.\u201dThat has solidified a \u201csurvival mentality\u201d unsuited to innovation, with tech executives unwilling to spend on the marketing and design that could set their firms apart from competitors, said Willy Shih, a professor at Harvard Business School who studies Taiwan\u2019s tech companies.One example of that philosophy was on display recently at Silicon Power, which produces branded portable hard drives and USB drives. When the company, based in the affluent riverside neighborhood of Neihu in Taipei, received a flood of orders before Christmas last year, it sent employees responsible for marketing, design and sales \u2014 all key to building a brand \u2014 to the factory floor, according to one employee, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak about the policy.Yvonne Chang, a Silicon Power spokeswoman, said the move was meant to improve communication between office workers and the factory, not to cut costs. An internal email announcing the plan, however, called for an \u201cemergency mobilization\u201d of employees to help on the manufacturing \u201cfront lines.\u201dSome of Taiwan\u2019s larger tech companies have suffered from a similar philosophy. HTC did not put enough emphasis on branding, Mr. Shih said, adding that Acer failed to adequately transfer to mobile devices as the personal computer market sagged. Many of the Taiwanese companies are now beholden to bigger branded companies, mostly in the United States, for computers, servers and smartphones.Acer and HTC did not respond to requests for comment. Nick Wu, the chief financial officer of Asustek, said the company anticipated the shifts in the industry and was working to expand into robotics, as well as computing devices for the home and car.\u201cTransition is not something that can be completed overnight,\u201d Mr. Wu said. \u201cIt takes strategic planning and solid execution, especially when our industry is undergoing a massive paradigm shift.\u201dTaiwan\u2019s entrepreneurial scene, meanwhile, is growing but remains small. Many of those trying to start new companies said they had often run into the conservative mind-set that shunts younger people into risk-averse positions at established companies. Entrepreneurs also have to grapple with a maze of regulations that have restricted online payment platforms and limited tech start-ups\u2019 ability to list in Taiwan.Mr. Lin of AppWorks recalled a moment last year when he and four others in the tech industry met with 30 legislators to work on a law to regulate online payments like PayPal. Of the legislators in the room, only a few had ever used any form of online payment platform.\u201cIf none of them has used it, what rights do they have to criticize it or say it\u2019s not useful?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou have to at least do your homework.\u201dThe institute is also spearheading an initiative to link Taiwanese companies and offer their services to hardware start-ups in places like Silicon Valley that are in need of quick prototyping and manufacturing, with the aim of bringing in new business from the United States. And the organization has created a research group to work on regulatory problems.Co-founded in 2011 by Horace Luke, a former HTC executive, Gogoro has raised $180 million and produces scooters powered by replaceable batteries stored at stations around Taipei.

{"Headline": "A German\u2019s Video Likens Mao to Hitler, and China Wants Him Punished", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "Supported bySinosphereBEIJING \u2014 When Christoph Rehage, a German writer and online satirist on Chinese affairs, joked on Weibo in July that the Communist hero Lei Feng and the female warrior Mulan could have a great baby together, reaction from some quarters was swift.Mr. Rehage said he received death threats from Chinese who viewed his comments as a slur against cultural heroes. Sina shut his Weibo account, which he said had about 100,000 followers.\u201cIt was a very tasteless joke that I made,\u201d Mr. Rehage conceded by telephone from Germany, where he has returned after studying Chinese and cinematography in Beijing.But when Mr. Rehage called Mao Zedong \u201cChina\u2019s Hitler\u201d in a YouTube video in December, he said, reaction became \u201cridiculous.\u201dThe party\u2019s own verdict in 1981 that Mao, under whose political campaigns millions died, did more good than harm, was \u201cobjective,\u201d meaning correct, Mr. Zhu said.So Mr. Rehage broke the law with his statement, Mr. Zhu and an unnamed lawyer were quoted as saying, citing China\u2019s \u201cInternet sovereignty.\u201dMr. Rehage said he found the experiences bizarre.\u201cWhen I was attacked on Weibo, it gave me sleepless nights,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so direct, and they flood you with it.\u201dThe following questions were compiled from the English-language version of the tests that are administered during \u201cAn Introduction to Mao Zedong Thought,\u201d an online course offered by edX. Test your knowledge of the chairman\u2019s philosophy by taking the quiz.\u201cThey\u201d include anonymous online commenters known as 50-centers, who are paid to uphold the government line and drown out voices of dissent. Others who do it for no pay are known as volunteer 50-centers.\u201cPeople even called me, and that was really upsetting, because I don\u2019t give out my number,\u201d Mr. Rehage said. They uttered expletives, he said, and \u201cmade this guttural sound \u2014 guurrrgggg.\u201dBut the response to his comparison of Mao and Hitler provoked a more brittle reaction from Mr. Rehage.\u201cA lot of the points they made are just really ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cI was bewildered by the fact that they would first shut me out of their Internet\u201d \u2014 YouTube is blocked in the Chinese mainland \u2014 \u201cand then say, \u2018What you say on the Internet is illegal! Our law governs what you said there,\u2019 \u201d in Germany.\u201cThey always say people aren\u2019t allowed to interfere in their internal affairs, but this is interfering in internal German affairs,\u201d he said.\u201cI invited China Youth Net, the three experts, the neo-Maoists and the volunteer 50-centers,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cObviously, I can\u2019t pay for their tickets.\u201dMr. Rehage called that irresponsible of Mr. Wang, because \u201ctens of millions of Chinese\u201d died under Mao\u2019s policies and Mr. Wang was \u201can influential guy.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s an actor everyone knows,\u201d Mr. Rehage said. Many of China\u2019s neo-Maoists and neo-authoritarians have said similar things, he said, but \u201cthey don\u2019t have the power that Wang Baoqiang has.\u201dAs evidence of Mao\u2019s failings, Mr. Rehage pointed to campaigns that left millions of Chinese dead, including the Great Leap Forward, which prompted a famine that may have killed more than 30 million.\u201cHitler was crazier,\u201d he said. \u201cAny historical comparison is always going to be flawed. It\u2019s going to be generalized, to make a point.\u201d But neither leader, he argued, could have cared less about his people.In an interview, Mr. Zhu, the communications law professor, restated his accusations and insisted that those living outside China\u2019s borders could be bound to Chinese law for their online speech. Mr. Rehage, he said, had violated the so-called Seven Bottom Lines.These are Internet speech rules laid out by the director of the Cyberspace Administration of China, Lu Wei, in 2013, Mr. Zhu said. They require Internet users to respect China\u2019s laws, state interests, socialist values, moral standards, social order, people\u2019s rights and the truth.\u201cIf he compares Mao Zedong to Hitler, putting aside legal issues, I think he has violated the \u2018social order\u2019 or \u2018moral standards\u2019 of the Seven Bottom Lines,\u201d Mr. Zhu said.He said that if Mr. Rehage made the video in Germany and posted it on YouTube and Facebook, also blocked in China, what would determine whether he violated Chinese law was his ultimate goal.\u201cWe have to look at his intention,\u201d Mr. Zhu said. \u201cIf he meant the video just to be a commentary on something, without its being disseminated in China, then it has nothing to do with Chinese law. But if he made the video in order to have it disseminated on websites in China, or to have other people repost it in China, then he comes under Chinese law.\u201d\u201cPresident Xi has said that, although the Internet is virtual, there is sovereignty,\u201d Mr. Zhu said. \u201cInternet sovereignty means that you can do things within your network as long as you don\u2019t harm me. But if you enter our network, you must obey Chinese law.\u201d\u201cIn China, the 100 renminbi notes carry Mao\u2019s portrait,\u201d Mr. Zhu said. \u201cThere is a big portrait of Mao in Tiananmen. We have Mao Zedong Thought in textbooks from primary school on. He embodies the fundamental concepts or moral values of a considerable number of Chinese people.\u201d Following Mr. Rehage\u2019s logic, Mr. Zhu said, \u201cthe money we use everyday carries a portrait of Hitler. How do you think our people would feel?\u201dMr. Rehage, who said that he usually visited China several times a year and that he was writing \u201can entertainment book about China,\u201d said that he had no immediate plans to apply for a Chinese visa, and that he would first wait for the situation to calm down.\u201cI\u2019m not very concerned about the whole legal thing or them refusing a visa, or them grabbing me for a forced confession on TV,\u201d he said.But he said he worried about the safety of any foreigners in China who might look like him. \u201cI am a little concerned by the people who have been calling for my murder,\u201d he said.Vanessa Piao contributed research.Advertisement"}

But tell me your take on the decision \u2014 and on what the popularity of WhatsApp means in general \u2014 while I pretend to listen.The new plan seems much smarter, and it\u2019s riding the crest of a larger trend: People love messaging so much that they may be willing to do a whole bunch of things from inside their messaging apps \u2014 buy stuff, book stuff, talk to customer service people and just generally engage in that great American pastime we call commercial activity. The benefit to WhatsApp (and Facebook\u2019s other messaging app, Messenger) is obvious; the company takes a cut of transactions and potentially makes billions.It\u2019s also good for developers. App stores are overstuffed, and getting people to download your app and use it requires a lot of marketing dollars and some luck. So if you want people to use your shopping or delivery or ride service, make it compatible with messaging \u2014 there\u2019s less competition there, and it doesn\u2019t require that users download new apps.Do you agree? Are chat-based services the next big thing?Here\u2019s the thing: The lowest common denominator across the world, as far as communication goes, is messaging apps. They offer low-cost data transmission. They require only basic writing, which nearly everyone does daily. Texting, particularly among millennials, is more popular than talking on the phone. I know I often would rather text someone than take a call.We already see this in other services, albeit in nascent forms. You know by now that Twitter is the social network of choice for directing obscenities at airlines when a flight is delayed. And Facebook Messenger is dabbling in the \u201cchat for business\u201d concept as well.Anyway, I am on board with the notion that chat and text will be the interface of the future. Or at least the predominant one for some time ahead.Here\u2019s a question I have: At what point do Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp end up on a collision course? Aren\u2019t they essentially doing the same thing for the company?But a future of many chat apps will be a terrible inconvenience for me \u2014 there\u2019ll be so many places to block you!Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Publisher Puzzles Staff With His Role in Las Vegas", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byWhen a relatively obscure newspaper publisher showed up in photographs last month addressing the staff of The Las Vegas Review-Journal, his appearance baffled journalists \u2014 in Connecticut.Reporters and editors at The Bristol Press and The New Britain Herald, small publications serving towns just outside of Hartford, knew their editor and publisher, Michael E. Schroeder, as a loud and sometimes ornery leader who was friendly with advertisers. How he ended up in a newsroom nearly 3,000 miles away was anybody\u2019s guess.\u201cWhen this whole thing broke, it came as a total surprise to me,\u201d said Jack Kramer, a top editor at the Connecticut papers from 2012 to 2013. \u201cI honestly had no idea how Mike Schroeder ended up in Las Vegas.\u201dMr. Schroeder\u2019s brief turn in the media spotlight was not flattering. When he was introduced to the Las Vegas newsroom on Dec. 10, the day of the sale, his lack of transparency \u2014 he refused to reveal the identity of the buyers \u2014 sent journalists across the country scrambling to figure out who he was. For several days, Mr. Schroeder\u2019s was the only name attached to the shell company that the billionaire casino magnate Sheldon Adelson used to purchase The Review-Journal for $140 million.Mostly remaining silent, he became an outlet for the frustration of Review-Journal staff members unsettled by their new circumstances, and a mystery man for journalists trying to unravel the story of how the paper was sold. Making matters worse was an article that appeared in two of Mr. Schroeder\u2019s papers that was critical of a judge overseeing a lawsuit against Mr. Adelson \u2014 spawning conspiracy theories about collusion between Mr. Schroeder and the new owners.But by Monday night, the game was over: The Review-Journal reported that Mr. Schroeder was no longer the manager of the paper or the shell company. When asked why Mr. Schroeder had been removed, a spokesman for Mr. Adelson, Mark Fabiani, pointed to a Dec. 23 article in The Las Vegas Sun in which he said Mr. Schroeder was brought on as an adviser during the purchase and would have no management role. \u201cIn any event, we don\u2019t have anything to add today,\u201d Mr. Fabiani wrote in an email on Tuesday.On Wednesday, Jason Taylor, the publisher of The Review-Journal, announced that Glenn Cook, a senior editorial writer at the newspaper, would assume the role of interim editor while management searched for a successor to Michael Hengel, who resigned as top editor at the end of December.Mr. Schroeder bought the Bristol and New Britain newspapers, along with three weekly publications, in 2009. In interviews with more than half a dozen current and former employees, a picture emerges of a media veteran who was opinionated and often confrontational, who sometimes meddled with news articles to please advertisers, and whose journalistic ethics were questioned at times.He also had a lighter side, said some who viewed him as passionate rather than belligerent. He held parties for his staff and liked the New Britain Rock Cats, a local minor league baseball team. He was a tough leader, they said, but what publisher of local newspapers wasn\u2019t at a time of decreasing circulation and dwindling advertising dollars?\u201cHe came in as a savior, so to speak,\u201d said William Sarno, the editor of The Bristol Press when it was sold, who retired in 2013. \u201cThe least I could say was he bought me personally four more years.\u201dBut some former editors said they saw themselves as buffers between Mr. Schroeder and reporters in the newsroom. Current and former staff members described Mr. Schroeder as someone who humiliated employees to the point of tears and who fixated on small details like the use of commas. Some people said he would get upset when reporters were not at their desks during the workday, even if they were out reporting for an article.\u201cHe is like a caricature of every bad boss you\u2019ve ever heard of or worked for,\u201d said Eileen McNamara, who left as managing editor of The Bristol Press in September. \u201cHe undermines his managers; he\u2019s a bully; he screams at people.\u201dSeveral former employees said Mr. Schroeder demanded favorable coverage for important advertisers. Jackie Majerus, a former reporter at The Bristol Press, said she resigned in 2011 after she was prevented from running an unfavorable article about a local hospital that was a big advertiser. Mr. Sarno, the former editor, said he remembered Mr. Schroeder trying to influence positive coverage about a proposed busway.Reached by phone on Wednesday, Mr. Schroeder declined to comment for this article.One current employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, said that many in the newsroom hoped the attention on their boss would blow over. Mr. Schroeder had the \u201cright instincts a lot of the time,\u201d the person said.One big misstep occurred shortly before The Review-Journal sale closed.The Review-Journal subsequently reported that Mr. Schroeder\u2019s middle name was Edward, and his mother\u2019s maiden name was Clarkin.On Tuesday, Mr. Schroeder published a note to readers in his papers about the business courts article, apologizing for its lapses. \u201cThe level of reporting in this story did not meet our standards. Pieces of the article were taken from related Internet sites and were not credited,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs editor and publisher, I take full responsibility for the assignment, publication and editing of the story and for these failures.\u201dHe did not, however, say he had written the article under a pseudonym, as some have theorized. About the mysterious byline, he wrote: \u201cIt was a combination of writing and reporting from multiple sources, with anonymity promised, in this case inappropriately. That\u2019s why a pseudonym \u2014 \u2018Edward Clarkin,\u2019 which had been used before \u2014 was used in this instance.\u201d\u201cI personally apologize to you, our readers, for the concern caused by this story,\u201d he added.Advertisement"}

Investigators are looking into whether Mr. Bazemore was also the attacker in a Jan. 1 assault in the Bronx, in which a 28-year-old woman was cut across her left cheek as she walked home from the train.Mr. Bazemore was arrested as recently as last week and charged with assault after a woman was punched in the face on the evening of Dec. 30 on Sixth Avenue, between 11th and 12th Streets, according to a criminal complaint. (The complaint gives his first name as Karl, instead of Kari.) He has 32 prior arrests, dating to 1997, the police said.In the latest attack, a 24-year-old woman, Amanda Morris, was walking near the corner of 23rd Street and Seventh Avenue just before 6 a.m. on Wednesday when, according to the police, Mr. Bazemore came up beside her and suddenly cut her across the left side of her face.\u201cI did have a bad feeling about this man as soon as I saw him,\u201d Ms. Morris later wrote in a Facebook post. \u201cHis walk was irregular and he appeared under the influence by his body language and stance.\u201dShe added: \u201cEven in a safer neighborhood such as Chelsea you should always stay alert and aware of your surroundings. Had I crossed the street this could have been avoided; never feel that you have to stay in an uncomfortable situation out of politeness/fear/etc.\u201dThe attacker fled, and Ms. Morris went into a nearby store to get help. She was treated at Bellevue Hospital Center and released.Alain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Financial Talk Turns Personal", "Date": "2016-01-11", "News": "Supported bySketch GuyRecently, my family needed a new vehicle. I\u2019ve always wanted a truck, and I knew we would get tons of use out of it. Could I have found a cheaper vehicle? Sure. But I knew we could afford the truck, so after lots of careful thought, we decided to buy it.Anytime I make a major purchase, I end up feeling insecure about it, and this was no exception. Not long after buying the truck, I ran into a friend I hadn\u2019t seen in a while. When he saw the new truck, he said: \u201cWow, Carl! Things must be going really well for you at work!\u201dFor some reason, this comment really bothered me. This one little statement completely hijacked my mood and sent me down an emotional roller coaster.Perhaps you have been through this before. Maybe you are going on the trip of a lifetime, which by definition would mean you may never be able to do it again. Your family has been working and saving for this trip for a very long time. Could you spend the money somewhere else? Perhaps pay down your mortgage or save for retirement? Yeah, of course you could. But this is one of those experiences you know your family will remember forever.I know, because I\u2019ve experienced it. I\u2019ve also recently heard similar stories from a number of friends. And my sense is that this problem will only become worse as our reliance upon digital communication increases. We\u2019ve all learned that when we communicate via text, comment on Facebook or \u201clike\u201d something on Instagram, it lacks the emotional context that we get from face-to-face communication. It makes it even easier to misinterpret something somebody says. So more and more, we are left wondering what to do with the things that people say to us that have something to do with our choices about money.So back up and dissect this. The first thing to remember is that other people have absolutely no idea what they are talking about. This is a lesson I keep repeating to myself: People don\u2019t know your financial situation. They are making assumptions based on some outward appearance.Using the trip as an example, they may assume you are putting the whole thing on a credit card. But the reality could be something completely different. Maybe a rich aunt just gave you $10,000 specifically for you to use on a family vacation. Or perhaps you are using three years\u2019 worth of accumulated frequent-flier miles.The second thing to remember is that it\u2019s all about them. Often what people say about you, particularly when it comes to money, is more a reflection of their own mental states than an accurate commentary about you or how you live. If they are insecure about their own situations, often that will be reflected in what they say. I don\u2019t mention this to give you ammunition to judge them; I say it to remind you that it\u2019s not about you. It\u2019s about them. Just let it go.The last thing to remember is to give people the benefit of the doubt. What if anytime people say something that hijacks our emotions, we simply remind ourselves that they did not mean it that way? We know they did not really mean it that way, because they can\u2019t mean it that way. In order to mean it that way, they would have to know what they were talking about. To know what they were talking about, they would have to be us.The reality is that these comments have no bearing on the soundness of our own financial decisions. You wouldn\u2019t decide to invest in a stock based on what somebody from one of the financial pornography networks is yelling at you, right? So why would you allow uninformed comments from friends and strangers to affect the way you spend your money? My suggestion is that you don\u2019t.Advertisement"}

But it\u2019s a state-owned property, and it is our responsibility to repair state-owned properties.\u201dThe 7,446-square-foot home on the Fort Morgan peninsula, a few hours southwest of here, is an embarrassment by virtually every account. It was most likely the only governor\u2019s residence in the country with a rusted gate and boarded-up windows.\u201cThe so-called governor\u2019s mansion at the beach is a textbook example of poor stewardship of public resources,\u201d said the state auditor, Jim Zeigler. \u201cThe Alabama government is bad about taking money for one purpose and diverting it to somebody\u2019s pet project.\u201dThe governor\u2019s mansion on the coast has an uneven history that began in the 1960s, when George C. Wallace was governor and developers donated land to the state as part of a strategy to lure potential investors to the coast. The deed stipulated that the land could be \u201cused solely for the construction and maintenance of a residence for the governors of the state of Alabama.\u201dE. Lamar Little, a developer, said, \u201cWe wanted to attract some interest throughout the state of Alabama at the time, and we thought the best thing to do was to get some of the political people to start coming down.\u201dBut governors scarcely traveled to the home. Wallace, for instance, skipped the dedication and, according to newspaper accounts in the state archives, was at most an infrequent visitor.In 1997, Hurricane Danny so devastated the site that it could not be used without expensive repairs that would have been electorally risky. (Mr. Bentley is Alabama\u2019s fourth governor since the hurricane.)\u201cThe needs have been met along the coast,\u201d said Mr. Bentley. He said he wanted to use the refurbished property for economic development, events for foster children and official entertaining.That assessment has drawn some scorn in coastal communities. \u201cObviously, there are other things out there that are arguably more important, more pressing that could use that amount of money,\u201d said Mayor Jeff Collier of Dauphin Island. \u201cWe still have unmet needs, and, unfortunately, after it\u2019s all said and done, we\u2019ll probably still have those.\u201dBP, which last year announced a separate $2 billion settlement with Alabama, declined to comment on a decision that many observers said only a second-term governor could make.\u201cIt would have been a campaign issue, and that\u2019s an issue people can understand, too,\u201d said Steve Flowers, a political columnist and former legislator. \u201cThat dog would hunt in a campaign, more than a tax increase, in my opinion. Sometimes, tax increases don\u2019t affect people, but if they think you\u2019re trying to feather your own nest, they don\u2019t know about that.\u201dMr. Flowers supports the plan. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the windfall of money,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the property. Why not fix it up?\u201dState officials, citing security concerns, have been reluctant to disclose details of the renovation. Many of the plans were contained in a handsome portfolio that architects presented to Mr. Bentley, who said he wanted the project completed in time for a Memorial Day event for veterans.But the governor forcefully denied Mr. Zeigler\u2019s assertion on Facebook that he sought upgrades to the property only after a divorce in which he lost two beach houses.\u201cWe\u2019ve been working on this for a long time. All right?\u201d Mr. Bentley said with a trace of anger as he gestured toward the plans, which were dated Aug. 27. Mr. Bentley\u2019s wife, Dianne, filed for divorce on Aug. 28; the couple had been separated since January, according to a court document. (The governor\u2019s office disputed the separation date, which was included in Dianne Bentley\u2019s divorce complaint, and said Monday that the couple lived together until late August.)But even as Mr. Zeigler insisted that the renovation was wasteful, he said his hostility toward a benefit of the governorship had not been universally welcomed: His wife backed Mr. Bentley\u2019s plan.\u201cIn case, by the grace of God, I were to run for governor and be elected, we would not have to fix it up ourselves and take the heat for that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would use it.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Myanmar\u2019s Peace Prize Winner and Crimes Against Humanity", "Date": "2016-01-09", "News": "Supported byYet Aung San Suu Kyi seems to plan to continue this Myanmar version of apartheid. She is now a politician, and oppressing a minority like the Rohingya is popular with mostly Buddhist voters.What all this means in practical terms is that Muhammad Karim is dead at 14.Muhammad lived in a giant concentration camp with tens of thousands of Rohingya. The government has taken away citizenship and statehood from the Rohingya over the years, and they are deprived of free movement. Muhammad wanted to sneak away by boat, paying human traffickers to join a tide of desperate Rohingya boat people seeking passage to Malaysia. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t let him, because it was too dangerous,\u201d said his mother, Sara Hatu.Then Muhammad suffered a scratch on his heel. Nobody thought much about it, but soon he had trouble opening his jaw.He apparently had caught tetanus. Like most of the children in the concentration camp, he wasn\u2019t able to get vaccinations, including a simple tetanus shot.After he got sick, the local medical assistants and the on-and-off clinic couldn\u2019t help him. Finally his mother got special permission for him to leave the camp to be hospitalized, but by then it was too late. \u201cAfter two days, he came back as a corpse,\u201d his mother said.A hundred feet from his hut, another family is also mourning. Bildar Begum, a 20-year-old woman, contracted hepatitis A, according to neighbors. Hepatitis A is normally not life-threatening, but she, too, couldn\u2019t get the medical help she needed, and so she died late last year, leaving a 2-year-old son, Hirol.\u201cIf she was not Rohingya, she would surely still be alive, I can say that 100 percent,\u201d said Enus Monir, a community leader.And now Hirol is starving: At 28 months, he weighs just 19 pounds. On the World Health Organization weight-to-age sheets, he is off the charts. The minimum on the charts is the third percentile, and Hirol is far below that.Some of the families in the camp have substantial savings in the banks in Sittwe a few miles away. But because they have been locked up since 2012, they can\u2019t access their own bank accounts to feed their families.The global response has been pathetic. Partly that\u2019s because Myanmar makes it difficult for aid groups and journalists to see the Rohingya, so that they are largely invisible.The United Nations has been dysfunctional in Myanmar. Another internal U.N. document shared with me (both provided by a critic of U.N. passivity on the issue) warns that U.N. staff members in Myanmar are feuding with one another and it raises \u201cthe question of possible complicity of the U.N. in potential crimes against humanity.\u201dYet aid groups have been barred from many areas, and the systematic destruction of the Rohingya remains one of the 21st century\u2019s most neglected human rights catastrophes.Aung San Suu Kyi avoids even saying \u201cRohingya.\u201d The United States Embassy in Myanmar likewise seems to sidestep the word in its official statements, a cringeworthy capitulation.\u201cThe Obama administration definitely could be doing a lot more,\u201d said Matthew Smith of Fortify Rights, a human rights group focused on Myanmar. That includes backing an international investigation and pushing Myanmar publicly and privately to take steps to restore citizenship and free movement to the Rohingya, as well as assuring that aid groups are allowed to help them. Other politicians have also been mostly quiet; the issue has barely surfaced at all on the U.S. presidential campaign trail.An enormous amount has gone right in Myanmar in recent years, especially the rise of democracy. But that same rise of democracy has also empowered racist and xenophobic demagoguery, making the problems of the Rohingya harder to solve. In the recent Myanmar elections, Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s party refused to nominate a single Muslim candidate.Aung San Suu Kyi is regarded by many Burmese as too conciliatory toward the Rohingya, because she remains silent rather than denouncing them at every turn. But for those of us who have deeply admired her for years, her willingness to sacrifice principle for political expedience is wrenching to watch.Defenders of Myanmar and of Aung San Suu Kyi note that the country has many problems; they see the Rohingya as one misfortune in a nation with a vast swath of misfortunes. The priorities, as they see them, are economic development, democracy and an end to the country\u2019s many local conflicts, and they protest that it\u2019s myopic to focus on the problems of one ethnic group in a nation so full of challenges.Yet to me, there is something particularly horrifying about a government deliberately targeting an ethnic group for destruction, locking its members in concentration camps and denying them livelihood, education and health care. When kids are dying in concentration camps, after being confined there because of their ethnicity, that\u2019s not just one more problem of global poverty. It\u2019s a crime against humanity, and addressing it is the responsibility of all humanity.Advertisement"}

With so much money sloshing around, and more and more of the superwealthy pushing into areas beyond their expertise, it is likely we will see more headlines about the failure of some of these fanciful investments and philanthropic experiments.Just over the weekend, the Russian billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov completed a major shake-up of the Brooklyn Nets, a team he bought five years ago that has struggled both on and off the court. It lost a reported $144 million last season.Of course, there have been success stories. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, bought The Washington Post, which so far has had success under his stewardship and he appears to be a long-term investor in the business.Dov Seidman, the founder of LRN, a firm that advises companies on their cultures and how they can translate them into better performance, said that earning gobs of money could often give billionaires a false sense of omniscience.\u201cSometimes if you create wealth and value quickly in one domain with one set of skills, however gifted and talented you are, it can give you the sense that you can apply it to any domain,\u201d Mr. Seidman said.That\u2019s not to take away from some of the most successful philanthropists, like Bill Gates, a co-founder of Microsoft who has spent years devoting himself to learning everything about polio and malaria, for example, and working toward eradicating them. (Though, in truth, he has spent a lot of money on projects that didn\u2019t work along the way.)Still, as more billionaires are minted amid a ferocious debate about inequality, and the superwealthy continue to buy up trophy assets and seek to sway public policy, it has created a backlash and some are questioning whether they are amassing too much influence.\u201cThe megarich increasingly use their foundations and their celebrity as philanthropists to mold public policy to an extent not possible for other citizens,\u201d Joanne Barkan, who has long been a critic of big philanthropy, wrote in The Guardian.That could turn out to be true for new money coming out of Silicon Valley, which has created a generation of young, idealistic entrepreneurs who want to get involved in transforming businesses and institutions at early ages. There are about 40 men and women under the age of 40 who are worth at least a half-billion dollars, according to Forbes.\u201cA lot of young people aren\u2019t waiting their turn to lead,\u201d Mr. Seidman said, suggesting that successful executives used to wait until retirement to try their hand at new projects. He added: \u201cTheir intent is going to get revealed. Are you deeply committed? How will you act when the path isn\u2019t linear?\u201dAnd praying for a wealthy benefactor to save a business is also a flawed business model. John Henry, the billionaire owner of the Boston Red Sox, bought The Boston Globe in 2013 from The New York Times Company. He has invested in The Globe, though it continues to struggle in the challenging newspaper business. Last year, another round of layoffs hit the newsroom. Of course, Mr. Henry can afford to take a risk on a declining business that requires a turnaround.For Mr. Hughes and The New Republic, that may be what happened. He seemed well intentioned. He talked about reviving the publication and restoring its glory, and yes, even making it profitable. He sought to remake the magazine for a digital age.

{"Headline": "Campaign Aides Defend Bernie Sanders\u2019s Record on Gun Votes", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "As Senator Bernie Sanders soars in polls and faces criticism from Hillary Clinton over his record on gun control, his aides are finding themselves explaining his voting record over the years on the issue.The focus on Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record highlights not only how the gun control debate has raged since Bill Clinton was in the White House, but the issue\u2019s newfound intensity amid a string of mass shootings since President Obama became president.Among the votes taken by Mr. Sanders, an independent from Vermont who was a congressman before becoming a senator, was a 2001 stand against a move by Democrats to preserve records of instant background checks on gun purchases for as much as 90 days. The administration of George W. Bush, through Attorney General John Ashcroft, wanted to reduce that to 24 hours.The 90-day requirement was part of the 1994 Brady Bill, which required federal background checks and was brought up initially by Representative Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York. It ultimately passed and was signed into law by Mr. Clinton.Mr. Ashcroft had opposed the longer background-check retention period while he was in office. The National Rifle Association had sued the Clinton administration, seeking to have the background checks destroyed almost immediately. That suit was dismissed, and a higher court ruled that the Federal Bureau of Investigations needed time to review the records.Mr. Schumer, who by 2001 was a senator, co-sponsored legislation that would have prevented the use of federal funds to destroy background checks. Hillary Clinton, who was then the other senator from New York, co-sponsored an additional bill by Mr. Schumer on the issue. In the House, Mr. Sanders, who represents a state with a vibrant hunting culture, voted against a version of the measure.Asked about his vote, Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign manager and longtime aide, Jeff Weaver, said that it was in keeping with the senator\u2019s belief about limited government.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe has always supported background checks, but at the same time has never supported bringing any kind of federal registry of gun purchases or gun ownership,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Weaver said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaintaining records for 90 days seemed to be moving too far in that direction\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Weaver faulted Mrs. Clinton for having supported a federal registry while she was a senator but saying during her 2008 presidential campaign that what worked in her state wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily work in other states. She made the remarks as she faced a tough primary against Senator Barack Obama, who called her record on the issue at the time \u00e2\u0080\u009cerratic.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn this campaign, Mrs. Clinton has seized on guns as a major issue. Mr. Obama, through executive action, has moved to limit gun purchases after bipartisan efforts at gun control stalled in Congress. And she has used the gun issue to try to differentiate herself with voters from Mr. Sanders.Mr. Weaver said that Mr. Sanders was \u00e2\u0080\u009cconcerned about government having information on people,\u201d adding that the senator had been concerned \u201cfor a long time about privacy in government.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe called Mr. Sanders a \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery practical legislator.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe senator is known for calling for a \u00e2\u0080\u009crevolution\u00e2\u0080\u009d within government involving issues such as income inequality. But on the issue of guns, his language has been different.Mr. Weaver described Mr. Sanders as being concerned with addressing \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe root causes of violence in this country\u00e2\u0080\u009d including the \u00e2\u0080\u009cstructural issues of poverty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think he has always looked to solve the root causes of the bad behavior that people are doing with guns,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Weaver said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think that has been more of his focus.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Unions Lean Democratic, but Donald Trump Gets Members\u2019 Attention", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Supported byBut the union\u2019s president, Mary Kay Henry, acknowledged that Mr. Trump holds appeal even for some of her members. \u201cThere is deep economic anxiety among our members and the people we\u2019re trying to organize that I believe Donald Trump\u2019s message is tapping into,\u201d Ms. Henry said.In expressing her concern, Ms. Henry reflected a different form of anxiety that is weighing on some union leaders and Democratic operatives: their fear that Mr. Trump, if not effectively countered, may draw an unusually large number of union voters in a possible general election matchup. This could, in turn, bolster Republicans in swing states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, all of which President Obama won twice.The source of the attraction to Mr. Trump, say union members and leaders, is manifold: the candidate\u2019s unapologetically populist positions on certain economic issues, particularly trade; a frustration with the impotence of conventional politicians; and above all, a sense that he rejects the norms of Washington discourse.\u201cThey feel he\u2019s the one guy who\u2019s saying what\u2019s on people\u2019s minds,\u201d Thomas Hanify, the president of the Indiana state firefighters union, said of his rank and file.Mr. Hanify said that Mr. Trump has so far dominated the \u201cfirehouse chatter\u201d in his state. While he allowed that his members tilt Republican, he estimated that most followed the lead of the union\u2019s international leadership and supported Mr. Obama in 2008 and 2012.Ms. Henry and other labor leaders remain confident that they can keep their members in the fold by making a case that the Republicans\u2019 economic agenda, including Mr. Trump\u2019s, runs counter to the interests of working people. But they also see Mr. Trump as posing particular risks.The potential pairing of Mr. Trump and union members could be helped along by a sense that Mr. Trump, unlike more conventional Republicans, has historically enjoyed a cordial relationship with labor on many of his real estate projects.\u201cHe has put his fair share into hiring union people,\u201d said Richard Sabato, the president of a building and construction trades council in northern New Jersey. \u201cHe\u2019s done that in Manhattan, in New Jersey.\u201dMr. Sabato said that his members, who lean Republican but in many cases voted for Mr. Obama, would \u201cmarch behind\u201d Mr. Trump on the issue of illegal immigration.He has also fulminated against plans by the company that owns Nabisco to shift some production to Mexico \u2014 \u201cI love Oreos,\u201d he said, \u201cI will never eat them again\u201d \u2014 and vowed to impose a punishing tariff on imports of Ford cars unless the company canceled a $2.5 billion investment in plants in that country.\u201cWe like that he does not support TPP, that he has taken the position that there should be trade tariffs for a company that moves jobs overseas,\u201d said Ryan Leenders, 30, a member of the International Association of Machinists in Washington State. Mr. Leenders, who estimated that one-quarter to one-third of his factory\u2019s union workers were Trump supporters, said he voted for Mr. Obama in 2008 and wrote in Ron Paul in 2012.Reflecting the anti-establishment mood that has engulfed parts of the labor movement, Mr. Leenders said he believed that more than half of his union\u2019s workers support Senator Bernie Sanders, while very few support Mrs. Clinton, despite the fact that the machinists union endorsed her last summer. (A machinists spokesman said that, \u201cAt this point, any estimates of support for a candidate are more a passing snapshot of popularity.\u201d)John Bulgaro, the president of Teamsters Local 294 in Albany, said that Mr. Trump had generated excitement among his members, but that \u201ca lot of people like Bernie Sanders.\u201d He cautioned that they would need to hear more about Mr. Trump\u2019s position on labor rights.To be sure, polling of union voters shows that Mrs. Clinton remains broadly popular and would carry most Sanders supporters in a matchup against Mr. Trump. But the same polling suggests that Mr. Trump could perform unusually well among these voters for a Republican nominee.Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal, particularly among white working-class men, longtime labor officials and political operatives point out that Mr. Trump\u2019s popularity before a single primary vote has been cast is a vastly different proposition than whether he would be able to retain that support in the fall.\u201cIn every election around this time there are stories suggesting that union members will defect \u2014 \u2018Oh, white union men won\u2019t vote for Obama,\u2019\u201d Steve Rosenthal, a former political director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and progressive political organizer, wrote in an email response to questions.In the end, Mr. Rosenthal said, union voters almost always end up voting overwhelmingly Democratic in presidential elections. White male union members favored Mr. Obama in 2008, and John Kerry in 2004, by roughly 20 percentage points, according to polling commissioned by the A.F.L.-C.I.O., even as white men over all favored the Republican candidate by a large margin.Mr. Rosenthal said that unions have proved adept at building support among their members for Democratic nominees who generally embrace their economic agenda and at undermining support for Republicans.\u201cJust delivering a little bit of new information, we could see that his brand takes a hit,\u201d Mr. Morrison said, referring to reports that Mr. Trump may have used undocumented workers on some of his development projects.Other experts cautioned that even if Mr. Trump were to retain substantial support among white male union members without college degrees, that would not necessarily yield him an electoral advantage in November if he became the Republican nominee.The voters whom labor unions must typically work the hardest to turn out, like younger voters and Latinos, \u201care groups that will be highly motivated\u201d against Mr. Trump, said Guy Molyneux, a pollster who has surveyed union voters extensively over the years. Mr. Molyneux also said that many of the union voters attracted by Mr. Trump were among the 30 percent of union voters who already vote reliably Republican.Still, unlike most other Republicans, whose appeal to union voters rarely extends beyond cultural issues like gun rights, Mr. Trump\u2019s economic pronouncements have a greater potential to scramble the standard political calculus.\u201cI do think that Trump is a threat,\u201d said Mike Lux, a progressive activist who is a former labor official and veteran of President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration. \u201cIf the Democratic nominee is Hillary, and she\u2019s mushy at all on the trade issue, Trump will take that issue and drive it and drive it and drive it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Of Ted Cruz\u2019s Birth Status, Senator Claire McCaskill Says, \u2018I Think It\u2019s a Question\u2019", "Date": "2016-01-12", "News": "When Senator John McCain of Arizona, the 2008 Republican nominee for president, faced questions about meeting the constitutional qualifications because of his birth in the Panama Canal Zone, one Democratic colleague rushed to end any doubt.The Democrat, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, introduced legislation to declare that any child born abroad to citizens serving in the United States military would meet the constitutional requirement as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cnatural born\u00e2\u0080\u009d citizen.But now that Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, faces similar questions about his birth in Canada, Ms. McCaskill is not exactly extending a helping hand. Mr. Cruz was born in Calgary, Alberta, where his father, a native of Cuba, was working in the oil industry. Mr. Cruz became an American citizen by birth thanks to his mother, a United States citizen who had been born in Delaware. And many legal experts say that clears him to hold the nation\u2019s highest office. Ms. McCaskill, however, said that she saw a difference between Mr. McCain\u2019s case, in which his father was a naval officer stationed in the Panama Canal Zone, and that of Mr. Cruz. In an interview at the Capitol, Ms. McCaskill cited doubts recently raised in The Guardian by Laurence Tribe, the renowned Harvard law professor. In pressing doubts about Mr. Cruz\u2019s qualifications, Donald J. Trump, a rival for the Republican nomination, has cited Mr. Tribe\u2019s constitutional expertise. \u201cI think it\u2019s a question,\u201d Ms. McCaskill said of Mr. Cruz\u2019s eligibility. \u201cWhen Laurence Tribe says it\u2019s a question, it\u2019s a question.\u201d She said the McCain family\u2019s military service is what prompted her quick proposal of legislation in 2008. \u201cMy interest in that was my father was military, and I was raised really near a military base, and the notion that someone who was born in another country because his parents were serving in the military \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it was offensive to me that they couldn\u2019t be president of the United States,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I was so motivated.\u201d \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Iran Opens for Business", "Date": "2016-01-18", "News": "Supported bySome people cannot stand good news. It troubles their fixed view of the world. These would include Senator Marco Rubio, the Republican presidential candidate, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who were cast into a huff by the confirmed reversal of Iran\u2019s nuclear program and its release of several Americans, including Jason Rezaian of The Washington Post.Try a smile, guys. Toughness is no more than empty aggression when it will not admit to misjudgment. Diplomacy delivers.Rezaian is coming home after a year and a half of groundless imprisonment. An American pastor and a former Marine will be reunited with their families. Iran had more than 19,000 first-generation centrifuges installed; that number is now 6,104. Its advanced centrifuges have been slashed from over 1,000 to zero. Its low-enriched uranium stockpile has been cut to 660 pounds from over 19,000.The plutonium route to a bomb has been cut off. Iran is subject to what President Obama called \u201cthe most comprehensive, intrusive inspection regime ever negotiated to monitor a nuclear program.\u201d The country\u2019s \u201cbreak-out\u201d time \u2014 the period needed to rush for a bomb \u2014 has been extended to a year from two to three months.The trauma-induced Iranian-American psychosis, ongoing since the birth of the Islamic Republic in 1979, has been overcome. Two tireless diplomats, Secretary of State John Kerry and the University of Denver-educated Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, speak when needed. American sailors who strayed into Iranian waters are released within 24 hours. A financial dispute outstanding since 1981 is resolved. The world\u2019s 18th-largest economy is about to rejoin the world at a time when the sinking global economy sure could use a jolt. The nuclear deal, even in these early days, is not hermetic. It opens doors.To all of which Rubio responds that Obama has put \u201ca price on the head of every American abroad\u201d when he should have used \u201ccrippling sanctions\u201d (oh, please, not that crippled phrase again). Netanyahu actually claims that if it were not for Israel \u201cleading the way\u201d on sanctions, \u201cIran would have had a nuclear weapon long ago.\u201d Iran, he baritones, \u201chas not relinquished its ambition to obtain nuclear weapons.\u201dThat may be \u2014 or not. We can all go guessing in the Iranian bazaar. Nothing comes cheaper than an Iran pontificator.What is clear is that Iran is much further from a nuclear weapon because of the courageous diplomacy of Obama and Kerry and Zarif and the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, who all confronted hostile constituencies at home to get the deal done.For Iran, the arrival of \u201cimplementation day\u201d means the lifting of all nuclear-related sanctions and access to about $100 billion in frozen assets. A big nation is open for business again, back in the global financial system and world oil market.Netanyahu, Rubio and their ilk believe Iran will use the windfall to do its worst. That cannot be discounted. The United States and Iran remain hostile on most fronts, from Syria to Israel. Revolutionary Guard hard-liners have not drunk the Kool-Aid at the Rouhani-Zarif school of diplomacy. Obama\u2019s imposition of mild new sanctions for banned missile tests was a reminder of differences.But if the developments of recent days demonstrate one thing, it is that Iran, 37 years from its revolution, is delicately poised between hard-liners and reformers, neither of whom can dictate the country\u2019s course, each of whom need the other for now. Imminent parliamentary elections may indicate which camp is ascendant. Whatever happens, it is hard to argue that greater contact with the world will be bad for the large, modernizing, highly educated younger generation. Iran is a pro-American country with a tired anti-American refrain. It has a successful diaspora community ready to help revive the country \u2014 if allowed to do so.The breakthrough with Iran is Obama\u2019s greatest foreign policy achievement, one that may have a transformative effect on the region. The next decade will show to what degree. That potential is what has American allies from Saudi Arabia to Israel so perturbed. They preferred the status quo.Of course it could all unravel. Predicting Doomsday is easy. But with hard work, I believe the chances are greater that American-Iranian diplomatic relations will be restored within five years.The Economist had a good summary of why Iran\u2019s reintegration is so important and consequential. It noted that \u201cthe prospects in a post-deal Iran are vast.\u201d The country is not \u201can oil-soaked rentier state,\u201d like some of its neighbors, but a \u201cregional power with an industrial economy\u201d \u2014 if a grossly mismanaged one. Its population of 80 million is well-educated, its oil and gas reserves enormous. The country\u2019s pent-up need for foreign investment may amount to $1 trillion. Iran, it concluded, is \u201cpreparing for takeoff.\u201dTry saying the word Iran without saying the word \u201cnuclear.\u201d It\u2019s time. In fact, it\u2019s past time, even if good news is too much for some.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "When the Water Turned Brown ", "Date": "2016-01-23", "News": "Supported byFLINT, Mich. \u2014 Standing at a microphone in September holding up a baby bottle, Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, a local pediatrician, said she was deeply worried about the water. The number of Flint children with elevated levels of lead in their blood had risen alarmingly since the city changed its water supply the previous year, her analysis showed.Dr. Hanna-Attisha said she went home that night feeling shaky and sick, her heart racing. \u201cWhen a state with a team of 50 epidemiologists tells you you\u2019re wrong,\u201d she said, \u201chow can you not second-guess yourself?\u201dAlready this month, federal and state investigations have been announced, National Guard troops were distributing thousands of bottles of water and filters, and Mr. Snyder was calling for millions in state dollars to fix a situation he acknowledged was a \u201ccatastrophe.\u201dYet interviews, documents and emails show that as every major decision was made over more than a year, officials at all levels of government acted in ways that contributed to the public health emergency and allowed it to persist for months. The government continued on its harmful course even after lead levels were found to be rising, and after pointed, detailed warnings came from a federal water expert, a Virginia Tech researcher and others.For more than a year after an emergency manager \u2014 appointed by Mr. Snyder to oversee the city \u2014 approved a switch from the Detroit system to water from the Flint River to save money, workers assigned to manage the city\u2019s water system failed to lower lead risks with a simple solution: adding chemicals to prevent old pipes from corroding and leaching metals like lead. Disagreements and miscommunication between state and local officials about what federal law requires of so-called corrosion control measures further delayed fixing the problem, the documents show.\u201cThis could have been nipped in the bud before last summer,\u201d said Daniel Giammar, an environmental engineer at Washington University in St. Louis.The testing of homes in Flint for lead, too, was insufficient and flawed, some experts say. Officials failed to focus on the many homes with lead service lines that were most likely to be tainted, instead looking at wider problems that would have muted the calls of alarm.The city authorities also urged, and state regulators allowed, methods of sampling that experts say had been shown to underestimate lead levels. Residents were advised, for example, to run their water before taking samples, a move that tends to flush out concentrations of lead particles that might have accumulated.And through it all, officials persisted in playing down and dismissing the concerns of Flint residents \u2014 one referred to concerned residents groups as \u201canti-everything\u201d \u2014 and authoritatively vouching for the water\u2019s purity, even as they themselves were debating whether it was pure.Three months before Dr. Hanna-Attisha voiced her fears and findings, a regulations manager for the federal Environmental Protection Agency had sent a detailed interim report to the state and federal authorities that included unambiguous warnings like this: \u201cRecent drinking water sample results indicate the presence of high lead results in the drinking water, which is to be expected in a public water system that is not providing corrosion control treatment.\u201dIt is unclear how many people have had elevated lead levels in their blood over the last year and a half. The state has identified 233 since April 2014, but Dr. Hanna-Attisha said its numbers likely \u201cgrossly underestimate\u201d exposure, partly because testing was generally limited to 1- and 2-year-olds until recently. Lead remains traceable in the blood for only about a month after exposure.Dave Murray, a spokesman for Mr. Snyder, issued a statement on Friday calling the crisis \u201ca failure of government \u2014 at the local, state and federal levels.\u201d He added that the governor was \u201ccommitted to fixing the problem and addressing the immediate and long-term needs of the people of Flint.\u201dDr. Hanna-Attisha also cited the wholesale failure of government. \u201cThey had the information,\u201d she said. \u201cThey just weren\u2019t looking closely or believing it.\u201dRepeated AssurancesCosts had become a central concern in a city that has lost thousands of auto industry jobs. Fiscal troubles were so significant that the state sent an emergency manager \u2014 with ultimate decision-making power \u2014 to oversee a recovery. Until the new pipeline to Lake Huron was constructed, the city would take its water from the Flint River, which it had used as a backup.Then came the odd colors from the tap \u2014 greens and browns \u2014 and the offensive smells and tastes. Soon there were reports of rashes and clumps of hair falling out. Parts from a General Motors engine plant here were corroding, so the company stopped using Flint\u2019s water.Tammy Loren, a mother of four who rents a home, was having a hard time believing the answers she got about why her sons\u2019 skin had itchy rashes. At various times over the last year and a half, she said, their doctors diagnosed scabies, ringworm and other fungal infections, but prescribed medicines never worked. The family even had the home treated by an exterminator, thinking the problem might be fleas.\u201cThe water was brown, and it had a disgusting smell,\u201d said Ms. Loren, whose sons are now 14, 12, 11 and 10. \u201cIt was like dirt coming out.\u201dFor months, Ms. Loren said, she conducted her own research on the Internet and asked plaintive questions on community Facebook pages. Her family started drinking bottled water when it could, but Ms. Loren, who receives federal disability payments for her back and other problems and relies on food stamps, said it was not that often.\u201cThere was times when we couldn\u2019t afford it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just kept drinking out of the tap.\u201dAt points, the city\u2019s water tested positive for E. coli bacteria, which can cause intestinal illness, and residents were advised to boil their water. City officials pumped extra chlorine into the system to address the bacteria issue, which led to elevated levels of total trihalomethanes, or TTHMs, chemical compounds that may cause health problems after long-term exposure.A state briefing in February last year acknowledged the TTHM level was \u201cnot \u2018nothing\u2019 \u201d but also not an imminent \u201cthreat to public health.\u201dBut officials\u2019 efforts to soothe residents about other contaminants seemed to overshadow the growing signs of trouble about lead.\u201cWater from Detroit is no safer than water from Flint,\u201d Mr. Ambrose said.Corrosion Control FailureBehind the scenes, though, officials seemed far less sure.By the end of February, Miguel Del Toral, the E.P.A. regulations manager who had learned of high lead content in one Flint resident\u2019s water, was raising a fundamental question with his state and federal colleagues: What was Flint using to treat the river water to avoid corrosion?\u201cThey are required to have O.C.C.T. in place which is why I was asking what they were using,\u201d he wrote in an email on Feb. 27, using the initials for \u201coptimal corrosion control treatment.\u201dSurely, the assumption was, the city was adding a chemical to the water to coat its aging pipes and prevent corrosion, since controlling corrosion is required by a federal rule governing lead and copper. The water that Flint had drawn for years via Detroit from Lake Huron had been treated with orthophosphate, a common anti-corrosion additive. And Flint River water is naturally even harder and more corrosive, experts say, than the water the city was buying from Detroit.An official from Michigan\u2019s Department of Environmental Quality answered Mr. Del Toral\u2019s inquiry the same day: Flint has \u201can optimized corrosion control program.\u201d But less than two months later, the state said it had been wrong. There actually was no treatment in place in Flint to stop corrosion, a timeline of events provided by the state now shows.The authorities themselves did not agree on what the federal rules meant. Some state officials believed that testing needed to be done over a year before a new plan could be put in place to block corrosion, documents suggest, while other officials thought the treatment with chemicals needed to start the moment Flint began receiving water from the river.\u201cWe made a mistake,\u201d Mr. Wyant, then the state\u2019s environmental quality director, said in October. Corrosion controls, he said, \u201cshould have been required from the beginning.\u201dThe lead issues should have been anticipated long before the city switched water supplies, experts said. \u201cI think that\u2019s pretty obvious, in going from having a corrosion inhibitor to not having one, you might have expected to have increased corrosion,\u201d said Professor Giammar.By June, Mr. Del Toral wrote in a memo to state and federal colleagues that Flint had essentially stopped providing treatment used to mitigate lead and copper levels in drinking water, which he called a \u201cmajor concern from a public health standpoint.\u201dE.P.A. officials contend that they pressed Michigan regulators to take more decisive action after Mr. Del Toral\u2019s report, but for months federal officials did little to inform the public of those findings or take decisive action. It was not until Thursday that the federal agency issued an emergency order and assumed oversight of lead testing in Flint.Flaws in TestingAll along, Flint\u2019s water was being tested for lead.There was so much lead found in water at the home of LeeAnne Walters that officials shut her water off in April and temporarily installed a garden hose to carry water from a neighbor\u2019s house. Still, state officials noted that the city\u2019s levels remained within federal and state standards.But the water tests themselves were flawed, experts say.The city also appeared to be unsure which houses had lead service lines connecting them to its water distribution system, the report said. Federal law requires cities testing for lead in drinking water to focus on homes with the highest risk for contamination, but the report found no evidence Flint had done so.Dr. Hanna-Attisha said that after she shared her methodology with the state, it replicated her findings. Mr. Snyder then announced that the state would provide filters and test tap water.Marc Edwards, the Virginia Tech professor who helped identify and expose Flint\u2019s lead problem, said the state \u201chad no sense of urgency at all, nor did E.P.A.\u201dMs. Loren, the mother of four, said her sons\u2019 skin remained irritated, and she is worrying obsessively about their lead levels, particularly that of her 11-year-old, who has learning disabilities.\u201cMy trust in everybody is completely gone, out the door,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been lied to so much, and these aren\u2019t little white lies. These lies are affecting our kids for the rest of their lives, and it breaks my heart.\u201dAbby Goodnough reported from Flint, and Monica Davey and Mitch Smith from Chicago.Advertisement"}

On Friday, after the suspect was killed, the Israeli minister of public security, Gilad Erdan, issued a statement praising the police and security forces for tracking down Mr. Melhem, whom he referred to as \u201cthe vile terrorist.\u201d Mr. Erdan did not elaborate.The police and Israel\u2019s Shin Bet domestic security agency had conducted an intense manhunt of the Tel Aviv area for Mr. Melhem. The authorities said on Friday that he was located after Shin Bet received information about where he was hiding.Israel Radio reported that Mr. Melhem was found at a compound of several buildings and greenhouses owned by some of his relatives.The police said that Mr. Melhem spotted special police forces approaching the building in which he was hiding, and that he tried to escape. He then opened fire on the security forces with the same weapon with which he is suspected of having carried out the attack the week before, and was fatally shot, the police said.Mr. Melhem\u2019s father, Muhammad Melhem, is suspected of being an accomplice to his son\u2019s crime and of interfering in the investigation and he was being detained by the Israeli authorities. The father, who volunteered with the Israeli police in the past, had publicly appealed for his son to turn himself in. He said that he had alerted the Israeli authorities and tried to help once it became clear from security camera footage shown on television that his son was the gunman in Tel Aviv.Several other family members were also detained for questioning during the week.Advertisement"}

Bloomberg himself: Few Iowa voters like him as he weighs a third party White House run.A poll of likely caucusgoers conducted for Bloomberg Politics and The Des Moines Register and released on Saturday night found just 17 percent of Democrats and 9 percent of Republicans had a \u201cfavorable\u201d view of Mr. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York.Among likely Republican caucus-goers in Iowa, half had an unfavorable view of Mr. Bloomberg; 26 percent of the Democrats had an unfavorable view of him.By comparison, 50 percent of the Republicans polled had a favorable view of another Manhattan billionaire, Donald J. Trump, whose candidacy has offended and baffled Mr. Bloomberg. And 46 percent of the Democrats had a favorable view of Martin O\u2019Malley, who is faring poorly in polls, nearly three times the proportion viewing Mr. Bloomberg favorably.The poll was conducted by Selzer & Co., and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.The polling related to Mr. Bloomberg \u2014 which to its credit made a point of asking about Mr. Bloomberg, the owner of Bloomberg News \u2014 was contained in a news release handed out to reporters.

{"Headline": "Fund Managers Win With Tech Stalwarts and Burly Brand Names", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byBets on the biggest purveyors of technology \u2014 companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft \u2014 powered three of the top-performing funds of the fourth quarter.Mr. Baker, who has managed the fund since 2009, said he believed that the best companies combined top technology with burly brand names and large scale. Take Alphabet, he said. \u201cNot only does it have a great brand, but every day it does seven to eight times as many searches as all of its competitors combined. So every day its search accuracy is improving that much faster than competitors\u2019.\u201dAs befits a growth investor, Mr. Baker is a technophile. He will riff at length about the technological themes that undergird his picks, like the omnipresence of cloud computing, the maturation of solar power and the promise of artificial intelligence. Skeptics complain the information age isn\u2019t yielding benefits comparable to the industrial revolution, but that is humbug, he says.\u201cThe steam engine, to take advantage of that, you needed to dig canals and put in railroads. The peak change was 75 to 100 years after the invention.\u201d As far as the microchip goes, he said, \u201cAll of the infrastructure is in place, and we\u2019re entering the period of peak economic and social change.\u201dEven video game makers are benefiting, he said. Consider Activision Blizzard, another top holding and the producer of Call of Duty and Guitar Hero. A decade ago, its market comprised a few million game consoles and personal computers, Mr. Baker said. \u201cNow you have a billion smartphones, all of which you can play a video game on.\u201d And Activision Blizzard is trying to broaden its share of the mobile market with its pending acquisition of King Digital Entertainment, maker of the game Candy Crush.Mr. Baker\u2019s fund, with an expense ratio of 0.83 percent, returned 13.34 percent for the quarter, compared with 7.04 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.\u201cBrands hold their value, and a global brand isn\u2019t dependent on one geography,\u201d she said. Est\u00e9e Lauder, Starbucks and Nike were all among her fund\u2019s recent stakes. \u201cTheir markets are growing because they address the whole world,\u201d she said.Sturdy brands also drew her to Constellation Brands, which owns the United States rights to popular Mexican beers like Corona, Modelo and Pacifico, as well as a groaning cellar of wines. \u201cIn good times and bad, people still drink wine and beer,\u201d she said.Ms. Starke took over her fund about a year and a half ago. It then held more than 80 stocks. She set about paring that number, with an aim of keeping the portfolio at 30 to 50 holdings. \u201cIn large-cap growth, it\u2019s hard to outperform with a big portfolio,\u201d she said. \u201cA concentrated portfolio is the way to do it.\u201d With too many holdings, a fund can end up looking too much like the broader market and merely matching its return.She also plowed a greater portion of the fund\u2019s money into her top picks. Previously, the top 10 holdings accounted for about 14 percent of the portfolio, she said. Now they are more than 40 percent.The fund\u2019s biggest sector weightings are information technology, health care and consumer discretionary. Those tend to produce the best earnings growth, she said. \u201cI\u2019m looking for healthy earnings growth and healthy sales growth,\u201d she said.Ms. Starke\u2019s fund, with an expense ratio of 1.12, returned 9.92 percent in the fourth quarter.Like Mr. Baker\u2019s fund, it lately held shares of Microsoft. Mr. Kleinschmidt said the fund had owned the stock for about a decade, even as the company was seen as falling behind competitors like Apple and Google. But Microsoft kept putting up strong numbers, he said.\u201cForget the name,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I just gave you their market share, their cash flow, their return on equity, if I showed you all of that, would you be interested? Yes. Most people would be.\u201dFacebook, an overlap with both Mr. Baker\u2019s and Ms. Starke\u2019s top holdings, is a more recent purchase. Mr. Kleinschmidt said he was attracted to the social network\u2019s enormous customer base, about 600 million people when the company went public in 2012. Tocqueville bought shares in the months after Facebook\u2019s initial public offering, when the stock sagged. \u201cI reasoned a smart management team would be able to figure out how to make money on 600 million users,\u201d Mr. Kleinschmidt said. Facebook says its network has grown and estimates more than a billion people use its service daily.Mr. Kleinschmidt has patience. As he has with Microsoft, he will stick with a stock for years. His fund\u2019s annual turnover ratio is 15 percent. In contrast, the average actively managed stock fund tracked by Morningstar turns over about two-thirds of its portfolio annually.\u201cOne of the hardest things to do in this business \u2014 and yet one of the best things \u2014 can be to sit on your hands and not let the market\u2019s noise convince you that you have to do something,\u201d he said.Mr. Kleinschmidt cautioned that his turnover might increase in coming months. As a contrarian, he said he often finds buying opportunities when the market sags, as it has lately. \u201cThe essence of a contrarian thinker is to lean against the wind. You do that by looking into situations where the prevailing feeling is, \u2018Oh, my God.\u2019\u201dMr. Kleinschmidt\u2019s fund, with an expense ratio of 1.25 percent, returned 10.97 percent in the fourth quarter.Advertisement"}

Chris Christie of New Jersey, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Donald J. Trump.Mr. Volpert said he was concerned about the way in which the money he was giving to the super PAC was being spent, according to the person who witnessed the exchange. Mr. Murphy responded that the group had run many positive ads about Mr. Bush, and that now the race had reached the point that required contrasts. The exchange lasted a few minutes, and no one else raised concerns among the group, according to the attendee.In an email, a spokesman for Mr. Volpert, Jeffrey Taufield, said Saturday he would not comment \u201con the off-the-record meeting with Mike Murphy.\u201d He added that Mr. Volpert \u201cbelieves that Jeb is the best candidate for president and continues to support him strongly.\u201dA spokesman for the super PAC, Right to Rise USA, did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.Super PACs, which can accept unlimited donations, are not permitted to coordinate with candidates\u00e2\u0080\u0099 own campaign staff.

{"Headline": "Ben Carson Proposes Flat Tax, With Benefits Flowing to the Wealthy", "Date": "2016-01-04", "News": "Ben Carson has proposed tearing up the tax code and replacing it with a flat tax that would represent a substantial cut for the richest Americans and one that could potentially deepen the deficit.The proposal is centered on a 14.9 percent tax for people in all income brackets and for companies, while eliminating deductions for mortgage interest, charitable giving and local taxes. Mr. Carson also would do away with taxing capital gains or interest income. Low-income people and families, defined by having incomes below 150 percent of the federal poverty level, would have to make a smaller, unspecified payment.The changes would mark sharp reductions from the top personal tax rate of 39.6 percent and the corporate tax rate of 35 percent.\u201cOur current system reduces incentives for entrepreneurial ventures and investment, and at the same time inhibits the growth of a vibrant economy,\u201d Mr. Carson said.Although Mr. Carson predicts that his plan would increase the economic growth rate to 4 percent and create 5 million new jobs in the next decade, the proposal left several questions unanswered.Roberton Williams, an analyst at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, said that the prospect of eliminating popular provisions like the earned income tax credit, tax credits for children and deductions for mortgage interest could have unintended consequences for the economy. While the flat tax is intended to make the tax code simpler and fairer, such a system could be most beneficial to the wealthiest Americans.\u201cThat\u2019s a huge tax cut for the rich,\u201d said Mr. Williams, who also expressed concern about what Mr. Carson\u2019s plan would mean for the budget. \u201cI can\u2019t help but think this is a huge revenue loser.\u201d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

It was too late to move the event to a larger space by the time it was clear that thousands could be left shivering outside while the Republican presidential candidate spoke inside.The Trump campaign flooded the market with additional tickets when it became evident that supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the Democratic presidential candidate, were gobbling up tickets in protest.Deputy Chief Bruce Bovat, of the Burlington Police Department, said that people would be turned away from the theater, which usually hosts performing arts events, once its capacity was reached.

{"Headline": "After Preparing for the Snowstorm, Prepare to Shovel", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "Supported byFor one, the weekend allows millions of residents to not worry about a snowy or slippery commute. For another, they can enjoy their city blanketed in snow without the nagging concern that one must do what must be done.We are talking about shoveling.It is expected to snow all day Saturday and into the evening, and if the snowfall ends that night, New Yorkers and their landlords will most likely have until 11 a.m. on Sunday to clear snow from their properties.In New York, blizzard conditions are expected to hit early Saturday and bring 18 to 24 inches of snow, according to forecasts that were updated Friday night.Sanitation Department inspectors have fined and will fine for unshoveled sidewalks and stoops.Shovelers should also keep in mind that they are not allowed to toss snow into the street or on fire hydrants, although the amount of snow that builds around parked cars during every storm suggests that this rule is often flouted.While the guidelines are quite clear, thousands of people appear to risk a fine rather than break their backs each time there is a storm.In 2013, the city imposed $581,510 in fines ranging from $100 to $350, along with late fees.But it seems that residents who ignore the snow also ignore the fines. Some $500,000 in fines remained unpaid.\u201cDon\u2019t panic,\u201d the department advised in a posting on Facebook. \u201cIt\u2019s just frozen rain.

{"Headline": "A Day of Policy, Dropped Guards and Rancor", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "In a campaign that has been overshadowed and altered by Donald J. Trump, the debate has focused heavily on immigration and on a general disgust with Washington. But Tuesday was a rare day that was thick with policy substance and increased tensions among candidates.Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont laid out a plan for overhauling Wall Street. Hillary Clinton outlined one to improve access to treatment for and prevention of autism. Jeb Bush talked openly about drugs, his daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s struggles with addiction and how he would combat the scourge as president. Mr. Trump also talked about the drug epidemic in New Hampshire, a topic that most of the candidates have focused on in recent weeks.But it was also a day of rancor, as Mr. Trump arched an eyebrow about Senator Ted Cruz of Texas\u00e2\u0080\u0099s birthplace, Canada, and what that could mean for the viability of his candidacy. (Mr. Cruz, whose mother was a United States citizen, laughed off the criticism.) Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey punched back hard at Senator Marco Rubio of Florida for coating the race in \u00e2\u0080\u009cslime\u00e2\u0080\u009d as an outside group supporting Mr. Rubio aired attack ads against Mr. Christie.The dominant issue among Republicans in New Hampshire, however, was President Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call for executive actions on guns, after previous efforts failed in Congress. Several Republicans criticized Mr. Obama, although Mr. Christie, whose record in New Jersey is coming under scrutiny and who has said that Mr. Obama was acting like a child for moving on the issue on his own, was mum for the day.So the stage is set for the days leading up to the debates next week. With supporters of both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders saying the race in Iowa is closer than people think, the debate looms large. As for the Republicans, who will convene in Charleston, S.C., there is no longer much incentive to play nice. \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

He asks me what the maximum I am prepared to pay is. I say $15,000. It is actually $20,000.\u00a0Your father suffers from severe dementia and is in a nursing home. When it is time for you to leave he becomes extremely agitated and often has to be restrained. On the occasions when you have said you would be back tomorrow he was quite peaceful about your leaving. You tell him now every time you leave that you will be back tomorrow knowing that in a very short time after you leave he will have forgotten what you said.\u00a0In an effort to enforce rules against racial discrimination \u00e2\u0080\u009ctesters\u00e2\u0080\u009d were sent out to rent a house. First, an African-American couple claiming to be married with two children and an income that was sufficient to pay the rent would try to rent a house. If they were told that the house was not available, a white tester couple with the same family and economic profile would be sent. If they were offered the rental there would be persuasive evidence of racial discrimination.\u00a0In order to test whether arthroscopic surgery improved the conditions of patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 knees a study was done in which half the patients were told the procedure was being done but it was not. Little cuts were made in the knees, the doctors talked as if it were being done, sounds were produced as if the operation were being done. The patients were under light anesthesia. It turned out that the same percentage of patients reported pain relief and increased mobility in the real and sham operations. The patients were informed in advance that they either would receive a real or a sham operation.\u00a0We heap exaggerated praise on our children all the time about their earliest attempts to sing or dance or paint or write poems.

Believing that if she says (politely) it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s none of their business she will not get the job, she lies and says she does not intend to have a family.\u00a0In November of 1962, during the Cuban Missile crisis, President Kennedy gave a conference. When asked whether he had discussed any matters other than Cuban missiles with the Soviets he absolutely denied it. In fact, he had promised that the United States would remove missiles from Turkey.\u00a0A woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s husband drowned in a car accident when the car plunged off a bridge into a body of water. It was clear from the physical evidence that he desperately tried to get out of the car and died a dreadful death. At the hospital where his body was brought his wife asked the physician in attendance what kind of death her husband suffered. He replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe died immediately from the impact of the crash. He did not suffer.\u00e2\u0080\u009dI had a chance to read through a selection of the comments that went along with your answers and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to reply to some of them here, and in some cases, question those answers. In cases where I quote responses, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve edited slightly for clarity and continuity.Some of the disagreements arose from the stated definition of a lie I used. A lie is saying\u00c2\u00a0something that one believes to be false with the intention of getting someone else to believe it is true. Some people challenged the definition; others accepted it but claimed that, according to it, some of my lies were not lies.Here is an example:I would urge that none of these cases constitute lying in the philosophically relevant sense. In ordinary discourse we might indeed refer to any or all of these actions as \u00e2\u0080\u009clying.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The original definition is too broad: if I \u00e2\u0080\u009clie\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the morally unacceptable sense I do not merely intend that the other believes something false, but I do so primarily to serve my own purposes, not his.I would not claim that my definition is the only legitimate way of defining a lie. One objection\u00c2\u00a0is that it cannot encompass \u00e2\u0080\u009cbaldfaced lies\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0like the child with his hand caught in the cookie jar who insists he is not taking a cookie. But I do think that on methodological grounds we should not build into our definition the judgment that lies are wrong. In the reader\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed definition it is built into the definition of an unacceptable lie that it serves the liar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s purposes not the hearers. Since the well-known theoretical lie to the Nazi at the front door does not serve his nefarious interest this makes the lie unacceptable by the reader\u2019s definition. That sort of moral judgment that should not be settled by a definition.Here one reader accepted my definition, but claimed that my lies do not fall under it:Many of your examples are actually not lies by your own definition. [Many of your scenarios] are situations where the person being told the mistruth is not expected to believe in the long run, but only temporarily. If we intend that the misdirection be only temporary and be done for justifiable reasons, most people wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t consider it a lie.I regard this as a very important point about the justification of lies but one that should not be built into the definition of a lie. Yes, the lie told to the wife about where she was going (to her surprise party) will be revealed as a lie very shortly, and that may be an important part of its justification. But why say it is not a lie at all?Now to the substantive disagreements. Let me start with the scenario where a woman lies at a job interview about planning to have a family, since I was fairly confident about it and was much less so after reading the responses. Here are two that made me think:One wrote:I was a bit conflicted on how to answer this, being a woman who has been asked this very question when I was in my 20s, I could easily side with either answer and would not consider it a lie of terrible consequence \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but I think that it bodes well for us to deal with difficult situations in truthful ways, facing discomfort, so that we build on forging a stronger, more secure voice. I now say answer \u00e2\u0080\u009cyes\u00e2\u0080\u009d then query the heck out of the questioner. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow will this affect my chances of securing the position?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow many other women have you hired that have answered yes?\u00e2\u0080\u009d etc.And another wrote:In responding to the questions as she did, the woman is tacitly accepting an institutional structure that is unfair to women. She may get the job in the specific instance, but other women applying for similar positions might still have such inappropriate questions asked to them. If, instead, the woman responded that it was none of the department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business, and was denied the position on what appears to be discriminatory grounds, she can bring a discrimination lawsuit.I do not think this is a case where the woman is obliged to lie. At most it is permissible for her to lie and permissible for her to tell the truth. To argue that it is not permissible to lie means that she must put more general considerations, such as challenging unjust situations, ahead of her own legitimate career ambitions. But I do appreciate the first reader\u00e2\u0080\u0099s views about building a voice, and character, to deal with difficult and uncomfortable situations.The lie which dealt with the decision of a doctor to tell a woman that her husband died painfully \u00e2\u0080\u0094 was the one that received the most dissenting votes. It was close to a 50/50 split. I was pretty ambivalent as well about this one.Another reader wrote: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe wife would be unlikely to find out the true circumstances of her husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death, but we cannot be certain and I am unsure I have the right to decide whether she should have the information.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAnother person wrote: The doctor lies out of a paternalistic instinct to protect, denying the woman agency and dignity.\u00e2\u0080\u009dA third person: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot know whether in such a situation the woman would prefer the truth or the lie: I cannot make that decision for her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Others spoke of damaging the trust between doctors and patients.What is interesting here is that people can have quite different bases for thinking the lie impermissible. The first person is worried about the trust issue even though it is unlikely this lie would be found out. But she adds to her argument that she may not have the right to determine whether the woman should know the truth or not. The second person appeals to a Kantian theme of respecting the agency and dignity of any rational agent. The third person raises what for me is the crucial issue: Is the woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s request a genuine appeal for the truth or does she really want to be told what would cause her the least suffering going forward? This then leads to the further question of whether, if she wants to be lied to, we ought to act in accordance with her wishes or not. My own view is that the case is difficult because of our uncertainty about what the woman is really asking. If we were certain she wanted the truth, and that she would not be haunted for years by re-enactments in her mind of the death, we ought not to lie. But if it were certain she wanted her own hopes for an instant death to be confirmed, it is permissible to do so.The scenario concerning what to tell a child about his parents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 death is a case in which some people disagreed because of their views of what is likely to happen to the child in the future. One reader said that telling the weakened child that his parents were alive was \u00e2\u0080\u009ca devastating lie that can do a lot of psychological damage later, even though it may help in the short term.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Another wrote, \u00e2\u0080\u009ctelling him the truth at this juncture does nothing for him. There is no harm to him from having this knowledge delayed, and there may be great benefit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A middle ground (withholding information) was suggested by another, who said that lying to the child \u00e2\u0080\u009cgives conflicting information which will confuse his recovery further down the road. It would be more appropriate to delay giving any information, rather than providing false information.\u00e2\u0080\u009dNote that the readers disagree among themselves about whether the consequences for the child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s welfare would be promoted or hindered by being lied to. My own view is heavily influenced by what I believe about the consequences of the lie. But, in my case, there is a further issue.An anthology of essays from The Times\u2019s philosophy series, published by Liveright.One of the major reasons for opposing lying is that it is an interference with the autonomy or agency of the person being lied to. In the case of a young child \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and here there may be disagreements about where to draw the line in terms of age \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the child is either not autonomous at all or has relatively little autonomy. Therefore, I am much more willing to consider the issue in terms of the good or bad consequences of lying.Some readers suggested alternative things that the child could be told. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talk about it when you are feeling stronger.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I agree that if that would satisfy the child until he was stronger it would be better than lying.The general point here is that two people who seem to have a moral disagreement about the morality of lying may be instead having an empirical disagreement about what the consequences are of a particular lie.Many readers reasoned in terms of general frameworks for thinking about the morality of lying.\u2022 [The lie about the job interview] brings up the concept of lying for self-benefit, and the idea that perhaps being truly moral for its own sake is a pointless endeavor. I believe the actual value of being moral needs to be investigated.\u2022  I would hold that these lies increase happiness and diminish suffering, so are warranted.\u2022 As for the lie told by President Kennedy, it seems to me perfectly clear that an official acting in that capacity is duty-bound to his post.\u2022 The woman who lies in the job interview lies for her own sake out of a belief that her employer will be unable or unwilling to act morally, implicitly denying the employer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to make a moral choice. She treats the employer as a means to employment only, rather than as a fellow human being.\u2022 For me truth seeking/making isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so much about right or wrong but what works for being a satisfied, competent and substantially rich human being.\u2022 What we tell other humans in the course of our lives ought to be the truth, even when it is painful, because they deserve to live in a real world where they know as much as possible.\u2022 The debate is really about how an action is described in the first place \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a determination that depends crucially on an assessment of the actor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s motivationWe find here almost every position that has ever been put forward by philosophers to explain what is wrong with lies, when they are wrong. The first comment suggests a strategy that has not been examined sufficiently \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the idea that one way of justifying a lie is to accept that it cannot be morally justified but that we sometimes are permitted to ignore morality in the pursuit of certain valuable ends that are fundamental to our life.My own view is that there is no one factor that makes all wrongful lies wrong. Some lies are wrong because they have bad consequences; some lies are wrong because they betray trust; some are wrong because they are the outcome of vicious traits such as cowardice or selfishness; some are wrong because they deny the autonomy of rational agents. This makes the development of ethical theories more complicated than one would wish. But as Einstein (quoting the physicist Ludwig Boltzmann), once observed, if you are out to describe the truth, leave elegance to the tailor.Gerald Dworkin is distinguished professor of philosophy, emeritus at University of California, Davis.More From Fixes \u00bbMore From Private Lives \u00bbMore From Couch \u00bbMore From The Stone \u00bbMore From Moviegoers \u00bbMore From The End \u00bbMore From Draft \u00bbMore From Anxiety \u00bbMore From Menagerie \u00bbMore From Disunion \u00bbMore From Bedside \u00bbMore From The Conversation \u00bbMore From The Great Divide \u00bbMore From Errol Morris \u00bbFollowAdvertisement"}

All slashed by men wielding knives or razors.At least nine other men and women have been similarly attacked in recent months in a rash of slashings that has put many New Yorkers on edge.Crime \u2014 even in this gentler New York City \u2014 is a part of life.But a crime with no discernible motive besides rage and no particular pattern beside absolute randomness causes a particular kind of dread in a city where strangers often find themselves side by side in subway cars or on crowded sidewalks.\u201cIt is alarming to people,\u201d Joseph Fox, the chief of the New York Police Department\u2019s Transit Bureau, said of the slashings. \u201cEveryone sees themselves in that place.\u201dHe acknowledged a recent uptick in these types of crimes, but noted that over all the subway was exceedingly safe. With nearly six million people traveling underground, fewer than seven crimes are reported on an average day.When it comes to slashings on the subway, Chief Fox said, in about half of the cases there was some sort of dispute between the assailant and the victim before the attack.But as was the case with the 71-year-old woman assaulted on Monday, there have been episodes in which there was \u201cabsolutely no prior contact,\u201d he said.\u201cThose are particularly horrible,\u201d he continued.In the case on Monday, a suspect has been arrested.Chief Fox said that in the wake of the recent attacks, the police were studying the trends and shifting officers.The police do not categorize random slashings as a distinct crime, so it is impossible to know if the recent influx of reports of attacks represents a drastic increase in the number.But just on Tuesday night there were two more seemingly random and separate assaults within an hour of each other.Natalie Lewis, 29, and her sister were waiting for a train at the Atlantic Avenue-Barclays Center station in Brooklyn around 9:30 p.m. when, according to the police, she was bumped by a man.They argued and later, as the train was pulling into the Eastern Parkway station, the man pulled an object \u2014 two feet long \u2014 from his bag and used it to attack Ms. Lewis.\u201cI will chop you up on this train,\u201d he reportedly shouted.At around the same time as that attack, a 32-year-old man was slashed in the face while he waited for a southbound No. 6 train at 116th Street and Lexington Avenue in Harlem.At a Metropolitan Transportation Authority board meeting on Wednesday morning, Fernando Ferrer, the board\u2019s vice chairman, said the authority was working with the police to respond to the attacks.\u201cThey are redoubling their efforts on city subways,\u201d Mr. Ferrer said of the police.Police Commissioner William J. Bratton played down the idea that there was a copycat phenomenon at work. \u201cEach one seems to have its own motivation when we make the arrest and we get into what was behind it,\u201d Mr. Bratton said.He also noted that \u201csome of the individuals we\u2019re dealing with are emotionally disturbed, or off their meds.\u201dDespite the chilling nature of the attacks, Mr. Bratton did not seem particularly worried. \u201cWe always will have crime in the city,\u201d he said, repeating a common refrain of his.His chief of detectives, Robert K. Boyce, described the recent string of attacks \u201cas a little unusual for us.\u201dLast week, Anthony Christopher Smith, 30, was slashed on an East Village street in the middle of the afternoon.\u201cI had my earbuds on,\u201d Mr. Smith recalled in an interview with WCBS-TV after receiving more than 150 stitches. \u201cI was playing on my phone and walking ahead. And someone \u2014 probably from behind \u2014 just shoved me against the wall, and cursed, and you know, I kind of fall to the ground.\u201dThe man sliced him up and down his face and neck. When he was done, the attacker did not even run, Mr. Smith said. He just walked away.Francis Salud, 28, was arrested last week and charged in the attack.Mr. Salud had been arrested in a knife attack in October, the police said, when he cut another man after an argument over a cigarette in the garden area at the back of Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan.Mr. Smith\u2019s shock at being set upon was matched only by his feeling of helplessness. Other recent victims echoed that sentiment.Amanda Morris, 24, was cut by a stranger this month as she went to her job at Whole Foods in Chelsea. She posted photographs of her injuries on Facebook.\u201cToday was a difficult day that I never thought I would have to go through,\u201d Ms. Morris wrote. \u201cI was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time and put in an unfortunate situation, but I would like to do what I can now to raise awareness.\u201dAfter the attack, Ms. Morris tried to think about what she could have done differently.\u201cI want everyone to know that I did have a bad feeling about this man as soon as I saw him,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHis walk was irregular and he appeared under the influence by his body language and stance. Always, always trust your gut instincts. Even in a safer neighborhood such as Chelsea you should always stay alert and aware of your surroundings.\u201dAcross the city, people said they were aware of the reports of slashings and responded with a mix of resignation and wariness.Lynn Marrapodi, 70, an artist, entered the Astor Place subway station in the East Village on Wednesday morning and stood with her back against the wall. It was a strategic maneuver.\u201cI have everything right in front of me, and I never did that before,\u201d Ms. Marrapodi said, \u201cbut after the last two incidents, I have been more cautious than ever. If they haven\u2019t hit this station yet, they will. I see people standing on the edge of the platform like I used to, looking at their phones. I think they\u2019re crazy.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the day that Carmen Rivera was slashed on the subway. It was Monday, not Tuesday.Reporting was contributed by Emma G. Fitzsimmons, Joseph Goldstein, Benjamin Mueller and Nate Schweber.Advertisement"}

According to the network, 10.2 million people watched Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley debate in Charleston, S.C., two weeks before the Iowa caucuses. That was an increase from the two previous Democratic debates, which drew 8 million and 8.5 million viewers, respectively. The debate hosted by CNN in October remains the most watched of the cycle for Democrats, garnering more than 15 million viewers. The Democratic candidates have two more debates left. Party leaders have been criticized for not holding more debates and for scheduling them on weekends, when fewer people are likely to watch. Despite the increased viewership on Sunday night, the Democrats have failed to draw as much attention to their debates as the Republicans. Their crowded field, capped by the surprising success of Donald J. Trump, has brought record ratings (the first G.O.P. debate in August on Fox News, for example, drew 24 million viewers.)

In the European Union, an individual\u2019s right to privacy is viewed on par with other fundamental rights like freedom of expression.\u201cIf a few companies control the data you need to cut costs, then you give them the power to drive others out of the market,\u201d Ms. Vestager said at the DLD conference, a gathering of digital executives and policy makers.She said that \u201cit\u2019s hard to know\u201d how much data is given up when using an online messaging service. \u201cBut it\u2019s a business transaction, not a free giveaway,\u201d she continued. \u201cAs consumers, we need to be treated fairly.\u201dMs. Vestager\u2019s warning shot in the often-rancorous privacy debate comes ahead of a Jan. 31 deadline for Europe and the United States to reach a new data-sharing agreement.\u201cIf someone like Google or Facebook has all of the data, then that\u2019s not good,\u201d Mr. Samwer said here on Sunday.But for Ms. Vestager, a 47-year-old Danish politician who has garnered both fans and detractors for her ambitious competition activities, adding data protection to her portfolio could prove difficult.On Sunday, Ms. Vestager denied claims that Europe was unfairly targeting American tech companies, although some executives in the United States have claimed that European officials are trying to bolster local technology companies at the expense of their large American rivals.Ms. Vestager added that she was not against further consolidation within the industry, despite European antitrust officials\u2019 balking at a number of recent proposed takeovers in the region\u2019s telecommunications sector that they said would reduce competition at the consumer level. Future mergers, she said, should not reduce consumer choice and worsen market competition.\u201cYou can\u2019t just go out there and buy yourself a monopoly,\u201d Ms. Vestager said.Advertisement"}

The questioner had not mentioned Mr. Trump.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would note,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz said, using the three words that often precede a new Cruz line of attack, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere are many people that are observing this race nationally is coming more and more down to a two-man race between me and Donald Trump.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho?\u00e2\u0080\u009d a man shouted.\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re clearly not a reporter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz responded, to laughs.Mr. Cruz then expanded on a recent trope, telling voters not to \u00e2\u0080\u009cget burned again\u00e2\u0080\u009d by a candidate who cannot be trusted to carry out campaign pledges.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to suggest: Ignore what all of us say,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t listen to me.

{"Headline": "Japan and 'Inherited Guilt'", "Date": "2016-01-11", "News": "Supported byLettersUnfortunately, a rather antithetical attitude is found in Japan, despite the fact that the Japanese government issued what was characterized as a \u201creal apology\u201d for the country\u2019s war crimes during the World War II era.In August, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe showed a starkly different attitude to the German principle of \u201cinherited guilt\u201d when he stated in a speech, \u201cWe must not let our children, grandchildren, and even further generations to come, who have nothing to do with that war, be predestined to apologize.\u201d Moreover, Mr. Abe\u2019s wife, Akie Abe, uploaded pictures of the Yasukuni shrine onto her Facebook page the day the apology was issued, announcing that she had visited the shrine, which honors Japanese war criminals.

Such insincerity in diplomacy, as underscored by the \u201capology,\u201d justifies the country\u2019s diminishing soft power and only increases foreign antipathy toward Japan.Nagyon Kim, SeoulAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jersey Shore Town Deems a Seaside Pavilion a Monumental Mistake", "Date": "2016-01-12", "News": "Supported byHIGHLANDS, N.J. \u2014 The story of how an angular, concrete pavilion that weighs more than a fully loaded Boeing 767 jet wound up on a patch of beach here is complex enough. Getting rid of it may be even more complicated.The ostensible reason for the abrupt change of heart was the discovery in December that the pavilion required a permit from the State of New Jersey that was never obtained. That issue aside, the structure has stirred up animosity among Highlands residents, some of whom have called it \u201cShorehenge\u201d or \u201cthe beast on the beach.\u201dSome critics have vented their feelings in online forums, including a Facebook page, occasionally masking their identities. One wrote that the construction of the shelter was \u201ca self-serving promo by a large international organization who was able to dupe a small town that was too flattered with receiving a \u2018gift\u2019 to ask the right questions.\u201dTimothy Hill, the borough administrator, said some of the vitriol was directed at him for his role in arranging the construction. Asked to identify the most vocal critics, Mr. Hill shrugged and described the pavilion\u2019s opponents as \u201cclandestine.\u201dBut Rich Wikander, a 70-year-old retired printer, was not sniping from the shadows. On a recent weeknight, he stood on the front deck of his house, which had been lifted 10 feet off the ground to guard against future flooding, and uncorked his opinion.\u201cI think it\u2019s ugly and it blocks my view,\u201d Mr. Wikander said as he glowered at the structure, which obscured part of the northeastern horizon and, in the distance, the New York City skyline. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like it was ever meant for a beach.\u201dThe pavilion looks more like the antechamber of a modern art gallery than the simple, metal gazebo it replaced. More important to Mr. Wikander, he could see over the gazebo, even when his living room was at ground level. Some of his neighbors on Snug Harbor Avenue, he said, had lost even more of their view of the beach and the waterfront.\u201cIf you spent thousands of dollars for this view,\u201d he said, alluding to the large windows he had installed, \u201cwould you be happy?\u201dJust off-center of the panorama from Mr. Wikander\u2019s deck, the pavilion stands behind the borough\u2019s Robert D. Wilson Memorial Community Center. The Borough Council has been meeting in the center because the damage inflicted by Hurricane Sandy on the municipal building has not yet been repaired.The pavilion was designed by Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects, a husband-and-wife firm in Manhattan that has designed museums and other prominent buildings, including the home of the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia.Covering 1,100 square feet, the pavilion appears substantial, with thick, smooth walls and an even thicker roof panel, or canopy, that allows the elements to pour in through three large oculi. The canopy alone weighs 173 tons.Those characteristics were in the plan drawn up by the pavilion\u2019s out-of-the-blue patron: the Tilt-Up Concrete Association of Mount Vernon, Iowa. The group, known as the Tilt-Up, promotes a method of construction that involves casting walls at a building site, then lifting them into place.In advance of the association\u2019s annual convention, which was held in New Jersey last year, leaders of the Tilt-Up decided to pay tribute to the survivors of Hurricane Sandy. They pitched their idea to officials of Highlands, a town still buzzing with workers raising and repairing houses damaged by the storm.The council, without having seen images of what the pavilion would look like, voted last January to accept the offer, and council members and Mr. Hill negotiated details of its location and size. The builders applied for and received permits from the town, and, Mr. Hill said, \u201cthere was discussion as to whether a permit was needed or not\u201d from the State Environmental Protection Department because of the site\u2019s proximity to the shore.In the end, the group decided no state permit was required. But after construction began last fall, the department received at least one inquiry about whether the project did in fact need a coastal permit, said Larry Hajna, a spokesman for the Environmental Protection Department.In November, a representative from the department\u2019s Bureau of Coastal and Land Use Compliance and Enforcement inspected the finished pavilion and determined that its \u201cconstruction by members of the Tilt-Up Concrete Association\u201d was a \u201cpotential violation,\u201d according to a Dec. 4 letter sent to Mr. Hill that warned him of the determination and invited him to \u201ctake corrective actions and to engage in discussions with the department.\u201dMr. Hajna emphasized that the department had not penalized Highlands and that it was possible for the borough to seek a permit for the pavilion retroactively.\u201cWe\u2019re leaving it up to the town as to whether they want to remove the structure or apply for the permit,\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t taken any enforcement actions.\u201dHighlands officials did not waste much time deciding on a response. At a meeting on Jan. 1, the council decided to direct its lawyers at the firm Cleary, Giacobbe, Alfieri, Jacobs to demand that the Tilt-Up association take down the pavilion.In a bluntly worded Jan. 4 letter to Mitch Bloomquist, the executive director of the association, a lawyer with the firm, Bruce W. Padula, wrote, \u201cIt is unacceptable that an entity such as yours would construct a structure without obtaining the appropriate permits.\u201d Mr. Padula then outlined the borough\u2019s demands that \u201cTilt-Up immediately and unconditionally remove the structure\u201d and \u201creimburse, defend and indemnify\u201d Highlands for all of its costs and any damages related to the construction.Mr. Bloomquist said on Friday that he and his colleagues had been \u201cvery surprised by the letter we received.\u201d He said the association, \u201ca nonprofit trade organization,\u201d had donated permanent structures to other communities and had never been asked to dismantle one. He declined to say how the group would respond to Mr. Padula\u2019s letter.From his deck across the street from the pavilion, Mr. Wikander said he could not imagine how it could be hauled away, nodding toward the steep hill a truck would have to climb to reach the highway.He joked that some of his neighbors had suggested digging a hole on the beach and tipping the pavilion into it. But they probably would need a permit for that.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Challenging Uber, Lyft Bets on a Road Wide Enough for Two", "Date": "2016-01-09", "News": "Supported byThe word \u201cmonopoly\u201d has a distinctly nefarious ring to it, conjuring up images of thuggish industrialists in smoky rooms, scheming to undermine their rivals.Yet in Silicon Valley, it\u2019s not at all uncommon for one company to dominate a particular field. Google is the runaway leader in online search. Facebook is the largest social network in the world by a wide margin. Amazon is far and away the biggest e-commerce site.But while market dominance is hard to break, that doesn\u2019t stop upstarts from trying. In the case of Uber, it is Lyft that is doing its best to keep up.\u201cWe\u2019re gaining share in the United States,\u201d said John Zimmer, Lyft\u2019s president and co-founder. \u201cThat\u2019s not what happens when one player has a complete monopoly.\u201d\u201cThe mere possession of monopoly power, and the concomitant charging of monopoly prices, is not only not unlawful; it is an important element of the free-market system,\u201d Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in that opinion. \u201cThe opportunity to charge monopoly prices \u2014 at least for a short period \u2014 is what attracts \u2018business acumen\u2019 in the first place; it induces risk-taking that produces innovation and economic growth.\u201dIn the book \u201cZero to One,\u201d which he wrote with Blake Masters, the investor and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel offers tips on how to create monopolies, arguing that once achieved, they lead to more innovation.\u201cMonopolies drive progress because the promise of years or even decades of monopoly profits provides a powerful incentive to innovate,\u201d he writes. \u201cThen monopolies can keep innovating because profits enable them to make the long-term plans and to finance the ambitious research projects that firms locked in competition can\u2019t dream of.\u201dAnd regulators have not been cracking down on Silicon Valley. Given how many big technology companies loom large in their respective markets, there have been relatively few big antitrust actions brought against tech giants.\u201cThis is different from the old monopolies of the industrial age,\u201d Robert Reich, the former labor secretary, said of technology companies.Unlike United States Steel or Standard Oil, two of corporate history\u2019s biggest brutes, today\u2019s tech monopolies are rarely the exclusive provider of an essential commodity. Instead, many achieve their initial dominance by distinguishing themselves in a crowded marketplace, then rapidly taking market share thanks to the power of network effects \u2014 that is, the more people use a service, the more valuable that service becomes to other people, who join in and make the service all the more popular.Network effects helped Google, Facebook and Amazon run away from their competitors, and are helping Uber today. Google wasn\u2019t the first search engine, Facebook wasn\u2019t the first social network, and Amazon wasn\u2019t the first to sell goods online. There are still many other sites for search, social and e-commerce. But despite an array of options, users keep coming back to the market leaders.Some argue, however, that the regulatory framework needs to adjust for a new kind of market dominance.Along with network effects, another hallmark of today\u2019s tech monopolies is that, perhaps fearing obsolescence, they diversify. While Microsoft still makes its Windows and Office software, it also owns Skype and has a big video gaming business. Google is now a subsidiary of Alphabet, a new parent company that is also home to a health care company, a self-driving-cars division and a venture capital firm. Amazon is expanding its cloud computing and streaming-media businesses. And Facebook has diversified into messaging with WhatsApp, photos with Instagram, and virtual reality with Oculus Rift.This, too, creates challenges for regulators. When mergers and acquisitions are part of the natural life cycle of start-ups and venture capital, it isn\u2019t easy to block deals that might hypothetically reduce competition down the road. As a result, regulators have blessed many acquisitions that, to critics, appear to be deeply anticompetitive.Gary Reback, a lawyer who helped prompt a landmark antitrust investigation into Microsoft and is now pursuing Google in Europe, makes the case that Google bought its way to dominance in online advertising through the acquisition of DoubleClick, bought its leadership in mobile by purchasing Android and bought its strong mapping franchise in the deal for Waze. Similarly, Facebook bought two of its nearest rivals, WhatsApp and Instagram. If any of those deals had been blocked, Mr. Reback argues, behemoths like Google and Facebook might today be facing more concerted competition.\u201cOnce one of these companies gets a monopoly, it\u2019s easy to spread the monopoly to adjacent markets by acquisition,\u201d Mr. Reback said. \u201cYou would think antitrust enforcers would know this by now.\u201dWhile monopolies in the tech industry are perhaps easier than ever to achieve, industry experts contend they are also more vulnerable than ever before. The advent of the smartphone and widespread access to broadband Internet connectivity have democratized access to creative new technologies.\u201cSun Microsystems. EMC. Cisco. All these were considered the dominant market players in their category at the time,\u201d said Rich Wong, a venture capitalist at Accel Partners. \u201cThen the vast majority of them got whacked by this thing called the cloud.\u201dAnd of course, billions of people browse the web without Google, use other social networking apps besides Facebook, and shop on websites besides Amazon. Though no upstarts have replaced them yet, none are immune to disruption.As for Uber, if it\u2019s not a monopoly already, it is the giant in the ride-hailing market, at least in the United States. One rival, Sidecar, shut down last month, and Lyft is its last meaningful competitor on a national scale. (Uber faces a tougher road abroad, where it is tangling with regulators in Europe, recently withdrew from Frankfurt and is fighting against entrenched rivals in China and other international markets.)As the underdog, Lyft is trying to put more drivers on the road and acquire new users. Like Uber, the company is private, and neither shares much information about performance. But Mr. Zimmer said the company was quickly increasing market share in the United States. He also sees the on-demand ride business as different from search or social media and more like telecommunications companies, where several big competitors can compete on service.\u201cJust like AT&T and Verizon need three bars of coverage,\u201d he said, \u201cwe get down to two to three minutes of wait time for a vehicle to arrive. Once it gets to that point, there\u2019s no difference in behavior between services. That\u2019s when you compete on experience.\u201dStill, Lyft will be hard pressed to unseat Uber.\u201cThe network effects hold competition at stiff arm\u2019s length,\u201d said Steve Cheney, an entrepreneur and co-founder of Estimote, a micro-location platform for mobile developers.Or perhaps the ride-hailing market is big enough for both Uber and Lyft. Monopolies don\u2019t necessarily mean there is no competition whatsoever. While a company like Uber may take a huge lead in market share, others, like Lyft, may still have room to profit and even prosper. Even Google has not managed to squash every other search engine.\u201cMicrosoft has a decent search business. A lot of Yahoo\u2019s profits still come from searches on Yahoo properties,\u201d said Roelof Botha, a partner at Sequoia Capital, which has investments in WhatsApp and Airbnb. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a \u2018winner takes most\u2019 than a \u2018winner takes all\u2019 phenomenon.\u201dShould that be the case in the ride-hailing industry, Uber and Lyft may become something truly competitive by Silicon Valley standards: a duopoly.Advertisement"}

They are not deposit-taking institutions, where consumer savings are insured by the government.They also lack the legal and regulatory apparatus that traditional banks have built over many decades. Already, some of the new services are facing regulatory scrutiny. In November, Apple, Google, Amazon, PayPal and Intuit formed a Washington-based advocacy group, Financial Innovation Now, to promote policies to \u201cfoster greater innovation in financial services.\u201dStill, some banking habits are changing across the population. In 2010, 40 percent of Americans with bank accounts visited a physical branch once a week, while only 9 percent made a mobile transaction weekly, according to survey research by Javelin Strategy and Research. By 2014, the percentage reporting weekly visits to bank branches fell to 28 percent, while the weekly mobile banking share tripled, to 27 percent.Vanessa Montes de Oca, 20, lives in Covina, Calif., and she combines being a college student with part-time work at a nearby Sam\u2019s Club. She has an account at Chase Bank, but uses it only to receive her direct-deposit paychecks and to make debit payments. She has no credit cards, viewing them a path to overspending and financial peril.So Ms. Montes de Oca chose a new credit card alternative, Affirm, to make purchases at an online clothing retailer, UNIF. In the last year, she has made five purchases, ranging up to $460. She pays Affirm in installments over three to 12 months.She used the Affirm smartphone app without qualms. It seemed, she said, a \u201csolid service\u201d \u2014 smooth and fast, with the payment amounts and terms clearly stated. That screen in her hand, she added, is where she pays bills, communicates and seeks answers. \u201cMost of the business of my life is on my phone,\u201d said Ms. Montes de Oca, who is also a Venmo user.The migration to mobile computing may well work to the advantage of the digital-only entrants as people of all ages become more comfortable using a smartphone as the remote control for their finances.Wealth management services, for example, skew toward an older demographic. At SigFig, a San Francisco start-up that offers an online investment advisory service, the average user is 47 years old. Still, the share of SigFig users tapping in from mobile devices has increased steadily, to 50 percent.\u201cPeople have such a daily relationship with their smartphones now, almost no matter what their age,\u201d said Mike Sha, chief executive of SigFig.Venmo is riding a surge of popularity, mostly among millennials. The volume of payments through Venmo, a unit of PayPal, more than tripled in the most recently reported quarter, to $2.1 billion.Venmo, according to William Ready, senior vice president for products and engineering at PayPal, is beginning to cross generations, as younger adults persuade their parents to use the smartphone app for sending money and splitting payments.Yet the cross-generational embrace seems to be going slowly. Mr. Craine, the tech support worker, urged his parents, who are in their mid-50s, to use Venmo. But they are not yet converts.\u201cI tried,\u201d Mr. Craine recalled, \u201cbut they are reluctant to deal with money that way on a smartphone.\u201dMadeleine Fleming, 25, an online product manager who lives in Brooklyn, ran into the same obstacle when she tried to persuade her mother, who is in her late 50s. \u201cShe\u2019s a lot less tied to her phone than I am,\u201d Ms. Fleming said.Ms. Fleming frequently sends small, monetary gifts to friends and relatives with get-well or cheer-up messages. For example, she says, a cousin who is a teacher in New Orleans had a tough week recently. Ms. Fleming sent her $10 via Venmo, with a note of encouragement that urged her to buy herself a drink.\u201cIt\u2019s a small thinking-of-you gesture,\u201d Ms. Fleming said. \u201cI think it\u2019s the next level of thoughtfulness.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They singled out Charles Chamberlain, the executive director for D.F.A., saying that anyone who \u201cpurports to be a progressive on this issue would conclude precisely the opposite.\u201d The Brady Campaign and Ms. Giffords have endorsed Mrs. Clinton, who has made gun control, an area where she has been to the left of Mr. Sanders, a central issue of her candidacy. The issue has taken on new urgency amid a string of mass shootings across the country. The letter went on to say that there have been \u201ctwo monumentally important votes in Congress on gun safety, and Senator Sanders was wrong on both of them.\u201d One was in support of the so-called Brady Bill, which established the federal background checks system, and the other was a 2005 bill that gave gun manufacturers legal immunity. Last weekend, before the final Democratic primary debate before the Iowa caucuses, Mr. Sanders changed his position on that issue. \u201cThese were the decisions that have really mattered,\u201d they wrote. The letter from the three groups to Democracy for America argued that those ratings are based on a number of factors, not solely votes related directly to guns.  \u201cWe trust that with this new understanding of the gun safety record of Senator Sanders, coming from people who have fought for the progressive position in this debate, your organization will retract its mistaken characterization,\u201d the officials with the groups wrote.

{"Headline": "Yahoo\u2019s Brain Drain Shows a Loss of Faith Inside the Company", "Date": "2016-01-10", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Marissa Mayer, the glamorous, geeky Google executive hired to turn around Yahoo in 2012, used to inspire hope in Yahoo\u2019s work force just by visiting the cafeteria for ice cream and mingling.Now, morale has sunk so low that some employees refer to Ms. Mayer, Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, as \u201cEvita\u201d \u2014 an allusion to Eva Peron, the former first lady of Argentina whose outsize ego and climb to power and wealth were chronicled in the musical of that name.Ms. Mayer is about to make herself even less popular with Yahoo\u2019s nearly 11,000 employees. Faced with the failure of her efforts to reignite growth at the 22-year-old Silicon Valley company, she is now turning to the opposite strategy: cutting. As some investors press Yahoo to fire her, Ms. Mayer is crafting a last-ditch plan to streamline the company \u2014 including significant layoffs \u2014 that is expected to be announced before month\u2019s end.While many Yahoo workers are keeping their heads down, just doing their jobs, others have lost faith in Ms. Mayer\u2019s leadership, according to conversations with more than 15 current and former employees from all levels of the company, most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because of continuing ties to Yahoo and its strict policy against leaks.More than a third of the company\u2019s work force has left in the last year, say people familiar with the data. Worried about the brain drain, Ms. Mayer has been approving hefty retention packages \u2014 in some cases, millions of dollars \u2014 to persuade people to reject job offers from other companies. But those bonuses have had the side effect of creating resentment among other Yahoo employees who have stayed loyal and not sought jobs elsewhere.Only 34 percent of employees believe that Yahoo\u2019s prospects are improving, according to surveys conducted by Glassdoor, a firm that collects data on jobs and employers. That compares with 61 percent who are optimistic at Twitter, another troubled tech company, and 77 percent who see a bright future at Google, Ms. Mayer\u2019s former employer.\u201cBasically, it shows employees losing faith in Marissa Mayer and Yahoo,\u201d said Scott Dobroski, a spokesman for Glassdoor who analyzed the data.Yahoo declined to comment on employee morale but said that turnover is normal at Silicon Valley companies. While thousands of people have left, many others have been hired, offsetting some of the losses. \u201cWe\u2019re still hiring, and our application numbers are strong,\u201d Yahoo said in a statement.One Yahoo employee who was interviewed said she was praying to be laid off so she could collect a severance payment and move on with her life. Others said they were actively looking for their next jobs \u2014 a task made more difficult because of the taint of failure that potential employers sometimes associate with anyone at the struggling company.\u201cBrands are important out here for employers,\u201d said Nick Parham, a career coach in San Francisco who has had several Yahoo clients. \u201cThey are going to look harder at people from Facebook and Salesforce, companies that have winning strategies.\u201dEmployees\u2019 faith in Ms. Mayer began crumbling in earnest in August 2014, when Yahoo embarked on a series of stealth layoffs, current and former insiders said. For months, managers called in a handful of employees each week and fired them. No one knew who would be next, and the constant fear paralyzed the company, according to people who watched the process.Last March, Ms. Mayer told the staff at an all-hands meeting that the bloodletting was finally over. Shortly thereafter, she changed her mind and demanded more cuts. All told, about 1,100 people lost their jobs in the layoffs.Contributing to the employees\u2019 disenchantment were Ms. Mayer\u2019s protracted deliberations over a corporate reorganization last year that led to the departure of several key lieutenants and broke up the much-ballyhooed mobile team, prompting many mobile engineers to seek other jobs.As Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Ms. Mayer acquired more than 20 companies, but ultimately struggled to turn around the web pioneer.For all of Yahoo\u2019s problems, many of its employees still have a deep affection for the company, whose products were the gateway to the Internet for a generation of web users and still remain popular, with more than 1 billion monthly visitors.\u201cWe all want to make as much impact as we can and leverage Yahoo\u2019s existing strengths,\u201d said Austin Shoemaker, who now manages Yahoo\u2019s instant-messaging efforts after his start-up, Cooliris, was acquired by Yahoo in 2014.The company has long struggled to overcome two big challenges: the industrywide drop in display advertising that has traditionally been its primary revenue source and the distraction inherent in trying to excel at many different things, from news and fantasy sports to web searches and email.Jeff Bonforte, Yahoo\u2019s senior vice president for communications products, said that Ms. Mayer had always told people that it would take three to five years for the company\u2019s turnaround efforts to show results.\u201cIt would be nice to give Yahoo one thing to magically save the company overnight,\u201d Mr. Bonforte said in an interview last month, adding that the idea was unrealistic. Ms. Mayer has invested in technology, he said, \u201cto give Yahoo a chance to be incredibly integral to this next phase of where the Internet is going.\u201dHe said that Ms. Mayer was the best boss he had ever had, but acknowledged some truth in the common criticism that she was tightfisted with praise and sometimes displayed a harshness that could be demoralizing.\u201cMarissa is the type of boss that makes you feel like you\u2019re disappointing her at all times, so I always feel like I\u2019m on the verge of being fired,\u201d said Mr. Bonforte, who is widely respected for both his talent and his irreverence. \u201cIt\u2019s never, \u2018Way to go, Jeff!\u2019\u00a0\u201dThe latest loss was Prashant Fuloria, whose company, Flurry, was sold to Yahoo in 2014. Ms. Mayer put him in charge of Yahoo\u2019s critical advertising technology last January, but he quit in December to work on start-up ideas. Ms. Mayer has put on a brave face despite all the turmoil.Just before the party, Ms. Mayer and the company\u2019s other directors decided to stop pursuing the original Alibaba spinoff plan and instead slim down and spin off Yahoo\u2019s core business.Now, everyone is waiting for details of that plan, which Ms. Mayer has promised to outline by the time the company reports its fourth-quarter financial results this month.Mr. Bonforte said those outside forces were beyond his control.\u201cThat\u2019s the problem with a turnaround,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world gets to decide, \u2018Time\u2019s up.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With \u2018Ride Along 2\u2019 and Other Films, Will Packer Blurs the Niche Lines", "Date": "2016-01-14", "News": "Supported byMIAMI \u2014 Twenty years ago, freshly graduated from college, Will Packer loaded 350 newspapers into his Honda Civic every day at dawn and drove around Atlanta, tossing them onto lawns and driveways. In the afternoons, he sold subscriptions door to door.\u201cI was broke, eating ramen noodles, trying to make ends meet,\u201d Mr. Packer, 41, recalled a few days ago over tea at the Mandarin Oriental hotel here. \u201cI made enough to eat.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m having a good run, I\u2019ll tell you that,\u201d said the dapper Mr. Packer, whose attire was set off by a dark blue vest and wildly colorful striped socks. \u201cI don\u2019t take it for granted, and I certainly don\u2019t underestimate it, because it\u2019s incredible.\u201dGrowing up in St. Petersburg, Fla., Mr. Packer never came close to imagining such a future. \u201cIt seemed too far away,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seemed like something for guys who I didn\u2019t know, and who didn\u2019t look like me, and who I would never meet.\u201dHe stumbled into filmmaking while studying electrical engineering at Florida A&M University in Tallahassee. A fellow student, Rob Hardy, needed a hand shooting a movie on campus, and Mr. Packer pitched in. \u201cI was helping him figure out how to pay for this thing, how to cast it locally and ultimately how to get it out,\u201d he recalled. \u201cLater, I learned that\u2019s what a producer does! I thought, this is my widget. A guy like me can do this.\u201dThe film was \u201cChocolate City,\u201d a 1994 low-budget effort about a black college student \u2014 played by Mr. Packer \u2014 that turned \u201ca little profit\u201d from the distribution deal he brokered with Blockbuster, the video store chain.After earning his degree \u2014 magna cum laude, he is proud to point out \u2014 Mr. Packer turned down offers from two engineering companies. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t me,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to be an entrepreneur.\u201dStill, Mr. Packer had to spend many months slogging through paper routes in Atlanta \u2014 where he lives today \u2014 before he and Mr. Hardy could make another movie, a \u201csuper low-budget, indie, erotic thriller\u201d called \u201cTrois\u201d that required what he called a \u201ccrash course in niche marketing.\u201d Made for $250,000, the film grossed $1.3 million and, although the reviews were tepid, it got the attention the two men needed to kick off their movie careers.Though he didn\u2019t know anyone in Hollywood, Mr. Packer said: \u201cMy parents had always told me, \u2018You can do anything,\u2019 and I embraced it. If you tell kids they can fly, they\u2019ll be jumping from buildings and soaring.\u201dAs his influence and box-office clout have increased over the years, Mr. Packer appears to have been fully embraced by the film industry\u2019s power structure in a way that African-American auteurs like John Singleton and Spike Lee have perhaps not. More crucially, he was determined to expand the appeal of his films beyond what might have been considered the typical crowd for such fare.\u201cYou make sure that you have a core audience that says, \u2018That\u2019s for me,\u2019 but you want to make something that doesn\u2019t exclude other audiences outside your core,\u201d Mr. Packer said. \u201cThese days, because there is such a cross-pollination of demographics and cultures and ethnicities, because of social media and the way we interact now, niches are becoming less and less well-defined. The majority of my films have been fronted by African-American actors and actresses, but that is now no longer the signifier that it once was, that that\u2019s only for people who look like that. The lines are a lot more blurred these days in terms of what a demo is.\u201dDonna Langley, the chairwoman of Universal Pictures, where Mr. Packer has a multifilm deal, said in an interview that Mr. Packer\u2019s expansive view of his potential audience is a big part of his success. \u201cHe\u2019s not interested in making films that are exclusionary,\u201d she said. \u201cHis pace, his demeanor and his objective is all about inclusion, and I think that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing his movies actually cross over.\u201dAt the same time, she noted, Mr. Packer has reinvigorated the kind of comedy that focuses on black characters.\u201cHe rediscovered a dying genre and forced it back into the mainstream,\u201d Ms. Langley said. \u201cWhat Will has done is really captured this market. It\u2019s been there for a long time, but I think the studios had kind of moved away from the African-American audience in making films that were specifically catered to them. I think Will looked at Hollywood and saw a void, and he stepped in and he filled it in a very significant way. Of course, he\u2019s not the only person making these types of films, but he has become one of the most prolific in a very short period of time.\u201dSix of Mr. Packer\u2019s most recent pictures have both pushed and benefited from the fame of Mr. Hart, whose manic energy and rat-tat-tat delivery have elevated him to the top ranks of comedy\u2019s bankable stars. \u201cHe\u2019s tapped into what pop culture feeds on,\u201d Mr. Packer said. \u201cKevin\u2019s personality lends itself very well to that kind of round-the-clock, 24/7, Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook scrutiny.\u201dMr. Hart, 36, had worked in stand-up, on television and in films for years before Mr. Packer cast him in one of his movies, an act that propelled the comedian to an altogether different level of fame.\u201cHe gave me a shot on \u2018Think Like a Man,\u2019 and we hit it out the park,\u201d Mr. Hart said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve never looked back. It takes a special person to see the talent in a person that you feel deserves an opportunity, and that\u2019s exactly what Will did. He saw something in me before other people did. He saw me on a different scale.\u201dMr. Hart said he had \u201cnever valued an opinion more\u201d than that of Mr. Packer.\u201cThe way he handles connections, people are seeing the true talent that this guy has,\u201d Mr. Hart said. \u201cHe\u2019s the definition of an entrepreneur who is driven enough to start a vision and finish it.\u201dMr. Hart said he was planning to work on at least three more projects with Mr. Packer, including probably a third \u201cRide Along\u201d outing. \u201cIf it\u2019s not broke,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think you try to fix it.\u201dMr. Packer \u2014 a father of four, one of them studying at Harvard \u2014 gives motivational speeches, especially to children who remind him of whence he came.\u201cThis younger generation, when they see someone like me, they know that it\u2019s attainable,\u201d he said. \u201cThe boy who never leaves his room doesn\u2019t know what the sunset looks like, but once he sees it he can never get enough.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The many students in attendance on Monday chuckled, as the standard reference to that chapter of Scripture is \u00e2\u0080\u009cSecond Corinthians.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But Mr. Trump was undeterred.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the whole ballgame. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, quoting the Bible. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd here there is liberty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He was met with still chuckling applause. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs our friendship has grown, so has my admiration for Mr. Trump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Falwell said in his introduction, noting that the speech should not be interpreted as an endorsement.But then he continued to praise the candidate for nearly 10 minutes, calling him a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbreath of fresh air,\u00e2\u0080\u009d pointing to his philanthropic efforts, his blunt speaking style and his success as a businessman, in particular his independence from major wealthy donors.The candidate stuck mostly to his stump speech, occasionally making passing references to Christianity, noting that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Bible is the best\u00e2\u0080\u009d and promising that under a President Trump, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to see \u2018Merry Christmas\u2019 in department stores.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Trump said he had a \u00e2\u0080\u009crecord crowd,\u00e2\u0080\u009d adding, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re dedicating the record to the late, great Martin Luther King.\u201d Officials at the university were unable to confirm that the crowd size was the largest attendance in school history. At convocation, where Mr. Trump spoke, it is compulsory for students who live on campus to attend, with one or two exceptions. So the more than 10,000 people who came out for Mr. Trump is a fairly standard audience for the weekly events.Despite the long introduction from Jerry Falwell Jr., Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reception by students was occasionally muted. He received applause and laughter from the crowd but rarely the booming cheers that have been a hallmark of his other campaign rallies so far.The students, ever respectful and expressing excitement for the opportunity to see Mr. Trump in person, seemed to have mixed feelings about the candidate.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have a guy that lives next to me on my hall and he printed out 5,000 pamphlets and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been passing them out all over campus, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re campaign kind of things for why we shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t vote for Trump but why we should respect him as a person and a successful businessman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Anthony Brausch, 19, a freshman, who is unsure if he could vote for Mr. Trump.Others didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like his combative style. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard on certain minorities and religious groups when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not really necessary,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Caleb Grow, 24, a graduate student at Liberty.But Mr. Trump had plenty of support as well. Five students with homemade \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrump\u00e2\u0080\u009d shirts were posing for pictures before the event, saying that they were on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrump Train.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And there were a few scattered red \u00e2\u0080\u009cMake America Great Again\u00e2\u0080\u009d hats among the students in attendance.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think as a Christian, coming to a Christian university, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be able to represent himself for believers to vote for him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Henry Lough, 19, a freshman who was proudly sporting a Trump 2016 shirt he bought in recent months.Mr. Trump last spoke at the school in 2012, and he stayed in touch with Mr. Falwell.To students who might be concerned  that Mr. Trump is not the most religious in the current crop of presidential candidates, Mr. Falwell also had a message from his father.\u00e2\u0080\u009cDad explained when he walked into the voting booth, he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t electing a Sunday school teacher or a pastor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, adding, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was electing the president of the United States.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Foursquare Raises $45 Million, Cutting Its Valuation Nearly in Half", "Date": "2016-01-14", "News": "Supported byOn Thursday, Foursquare said it had raised $45 million in a new round of venture funding, as it tries to bolster its location data-based advertising and developer businesses. The financing pegs Foursquare\u2019s valuation at roughly half of the approximately $650 million that it was valued at in its last round in 2013, according to three people with knowledge of the deal\u2019s terms, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Foursquare, which is based in New York, is likely to be joined by other start-ups this year in doing what is known in investing circles as \u201cdown rounds,\u201d in which companies that once raised money at soaring valuations are forced to accept funding at lower values. While tech start-ups boomed in recent years \u2014 with many easily attracting investors and big sums \u2014 that environment has now turned on fears that many of these young companies got ahead of themselves.\u201cThe short of it is, expect more down rounds,\u201d said Anand Sanwal, chief executive of CB Insights. \u201cYou might be able to raise, but not at the valuation you might have gotten even just a year ago.\u201d\u201cEveryone thought we were going to be the company that toppled Facebook, which is crazy talk,\u201d Mr. Crowley, 39, said in an interview. Still, he added, \u201cwe\u2019re building a really amazing, very scalable business around the many successful products we\u2019ve built that people love.\u201d\u201cTo raise $45 million in this environment, and on very employee-friendly terms, is a testament to the real business we have,\u201d said Jeff Glueck, Foursquare\u2019s chief operating officer, who is being promoted to chief executive. Steven Rosenblatt, the chief revenue officer, will also shift roles to become president.The executive moves reflect Foursquare\u2019s future direction, said Mr. Crowley, who added that his new role would be more advisory. \u201cI know what my strengths are \u2014 building, prototyping and making things from scratch,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe it\u2019s important for Foursquare to be run by executives who have previous experience scaling companies.\u201dAt its birth, Foursquare made a splash as a pioneer of using the global positioning technology found in Apple\u2019s iPhone. The app let people \u201ccheck in\u201d to venues and businesses, a type of social game that quickly rose in popularity among tech elites and young audiences.As of early 2012, Foursquare said it had 1.5 billion check-ins and 15 million users. The company began making money by selling location-based ads to local businesses; a sandwich shop, for instance, could send a coupon in the form of a smartphone notification to a Foursquare user walking by its restaurant, all using the GPS technology running in the background of the app.But the location check-in quickly became a standard feature among other apps like Instagram and Facebook, and users became less interested in the gamelike aspect of Foursquare. The start-up shifted direction to focus on \u201cdiscovery,\u201d and split itself into two apps: Swarm, an app for check-ins, and Foursquare, which recommends users to nearby restaurants and venues based on their location and preferences.That vision, which has had stop-and-start degrees of success, has also changed over time. Today, Foursquare\u2019s business is primarily selling data and insights about consumer trends to developers. Foursquare said it planned to spend its new capital on bolstering that business, which accounts for a majority of its revenue. The company says it now has 50 million monthly active users and has had 7.8 billion check-ins.Even with the new capital, down rounds can be brutal on start-ups for several reasons. In addition to any shifts in the public perception of a company\u2019s fortunes, employees who had joined at the higher value may find the equity they own isn\u2019t worth as much as it once was. Investors who bought in at the higher value also will see the worth of their stakes decline.\u201cIn a down round, there are a few folks who can suffer,\u201d said Mr. Sanwal of CB Insights.Foursquare\u2019s new financing was led by the venture capital firm Union Square Ventures, which was an existing investor in the company. Other previous investors including Andreessen Horowitz and DFJ Growth, as well as a new participant, Morgan Stanley, are also involved in the new funding.\u201cLocation is one of the linchpins for creating compelling experiences on mobile,\u201d said Albert Wenger, managing partner at Union Square Ventures.The funding will buy Foursquare some time to prove that its new vision can become a reality. The company said it planned to hire 30 more employees across sales, engineering and other divisions to meet what it expects to be great demand for the location platform.\u201cGood things happen to companies who are performing really well,\u201d Mr. Crowley said. \u201cIf we continue performing how we have been, we\u2019ll find that we have a lot of options down the line.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Trump was alternately admired and criticized by political observers on Twitter, some of whom accused him of seeming cowardly (he refused to debate because he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like one of the moderators, Megyn Kelly, with whom he has been feuding since the first debate last August). But others argued that the maneuver, which is hardly out of character for Mr. Trump, would not hurt him, at least in Iowa. It might, however, raise eyebrows in New Hampshire, where voters are looking at a wide variety of candidates and where Mr. Trump has held a large lead. Boycotting Fox News is not the same as boycotting other networks, but Mr. Trump blotted out all coverage of his rivals for another news cycle.

{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Top Digital-Privacy Watchdog Zeros In on U.S. Tech Giants", "Date": "2016-01-24", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 The latest standoff between Europe and American tech companies runs through a quiet street just north of the Louvre Museum, past chic cafes and part of the French national library, to the ornate office of Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin.One thing is clear, she says: The practices of American businesses, and tech companies in particular, are squarely in her sights.\u201cAmerican companies do not have an immediate right to collect data on our citizens,\u201d Ms. Falque-Pierrotin, 56, a blunt-speaking career civil servant, said recently in an interview, her voice increasingly animated. \u201cIf they are on our soil, then they need to live with the consequences.\u201dShortly after, the national regulators, led by Ms. Falque-Pierrotin, demanded that the European Commission and the Commerce Department reach a new deal by Feb. 1. Negotiators have been talking almost daily since October \u2014 including discussions in Brussels and Davos, Switzerland, in recent days. Still, they remain at loggerheads over how American intelligence agencies monitor Europeans\u2019 digital profiles, according to several officials, who would speak only on the condition of anonymity.Failure to find a compromise, company executives and officials warn, could disrupt billions of dollars of trade between two of the world\u2019s largest economies. Nearly all major multinational companies, including manufacturers like General Electric and drug makers like Pfizer, routinely move customer and employee data between regions.The biggest impact, though, will be felt by United States technology giants like Facebook and Google, which depend on reams of personal data from people\u2019s social media posts, search queries and online purchases to fuel digital advertising businesses. Those efforts often lead to tensions in Europe, where privacy is considered as sacrosanct as freedom of speech.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Deal or no deal, Ms. Falque-Pierrotin is in a position to play a major role. If negotiators agree to a new pact, she and Europe\u2019s other privacy watchdogs will help decide whether the new agreement meets the region\u2019s tough standards. If no deal is reached, she could impose further restrictions on how data is transferred across the Atlantic when European regulators gather on Feb. 2.After receiving degrees from some of France\u2019s top business and civil service schools, Ms. Falque-Pierrotin has spent three decades leapfrogging among government agencies and state-sponsored nonprofits. In the late 1990s, though, she began focusing more on privacy and the digital economy. She joined France\u2019s data-protection authority in 2004 and quickly rose within its ranks.In person, Ms. Falque-Pierrotin comes across as soft-spoken and formal. But her advocates and targets alike say she can be tenacious, though fair-minded. In recent years, she has gained a reputation for taking on some of the world\u2019s largest tech companies, including Google.Even with the confrontation with Google, French privacy experts say Ms. Falque-Pierrotin has regularly contacted local and international companies. She has often taken a less combative approach than other national watchdogs, they say, particularly those in Germany, where officials have often been quick to blame American companies for flouting local rules.Ahmed Baladi, a lawyer at Allen & Overy who represented Google in a previous French data-protection case, said Ms. Falque-Pierrotin aggressively led her agency, known as the Commission Nationale de l\u2019Informatique et des Libert\u00e9s, or CNIL. \u201cBut her strategy also has focused on communication, not just enforcement,\u201d he added.That nuanced approach may prove handy as last-minute discussions about a new trans-Atlantic data-transfer agreement flounder.National authorities may start legal proceedings \u2014 and potentially issue fines \u2014 against companies they think run afoul of Europe\u2019s tough data-protection rules if a new deal is not reached.Ms. Falque-Pierrotin, for instance, has already received complaints against several unnamed companies, though she is waiting until February before deciding whether to begin investigations into how certain companies move data from France to the United States.Vera Jourova, Europe\u2019s justice commissioner in charge of the European negotiating team, still thinks a new data-sharing agreement can be reached, but warns that \u201ca deal will only be made if there\u2019s an equitable approach in the United States\u201d to safeguard Europeans\u2019 privacy rights.Bruce Andrews, the deputy secretary of the Commerce Department, dismissed Europe\u2019s concerns, saying that the United States had already offered the European Commission a number of guarantees on how its citizens\u2019 data would be treated.\u201cWe\u2019ve agreed to make major changes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe U.S. takes individuals\u2019 privacy very seriously.\u201dIn December, Ms. Falque-Pierrotin sent letters to several American agencies, including the Commerce Department and the Federal Trade Commission, asking for meetings to discuss the current impasse. She received only a short response. Not responding fully to Ms. Falque-Pierrotin\u2019s entreaties may prove costly. Already, the French regulator and other European agencies have sent letters to international companies reminding them that the current mechanisms for transferring data are on shaky legal ground.A number of digital-rights advocates, including Mr. Schrems, are also preparing new privacy cases if a data-transfer deal is not reached by Feb. 1.That will most likely cause more problems for American tech giants, pushing Ms. Falque-Pierrotin and her European counterparts to consider new investigations \u2014 and, eventually, fines. But her position on protecting personal data continues to appear unwavering.\u201cDoes the U.S. provide sufficient privacy guarantees?\u201d she said. \u201cUntil now, the answer is no.\u201dAdvertisement"}

for having supported legislation that shields gun makers and dealers from liability lawsuits.Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign manager hit back by accusing Mrs. Clinton of flip-flopping on the subject by favoring expanded gun control measures as a Senate candidate in 2000, then positioning herself alongside gun owners in opposition to Mr. Obama during their 2008 primary, before arriving at her present position favoring strict new measures.The back-and-forth between the two leading Democrats vying to succeed Mr. Obama came after the White House stopped conspicuously short of affirming that the president would campaign for Mr. Sanders if he became the Democratic nominee.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf Democratic voters across the country confirm that he is the Democratic nominee, then I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m confident that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to spend some time here learning about his record and learning about what is on his agenda to make that decision,\u00e2\u0080\u009d

Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mixed record on gun control has been one of his major vulnerabilities in the Democratic primary, especially as Hillary Clinton has embraced the issue of gun violence as one of the animating causes of her campaign.Among other issues, Mr. Obama lamented that Congress had \u00e2\u0080\u009cguaranteed that manufacturers enjoy virtual immunity from lawsuits, which means that they can sell lethal products and rarely face consequences.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Earnest said that the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mention of the immunity issue in his Op-Ed \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas not any sort of secret or subtle signal to demonstrate a preference in the presidential primary.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut the issue has provided a clear distinction between Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton in the

lobby,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo this is a significant difference, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important that, you know, maybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time for Senator Sanders to stand up and say, \u2018I got this one wrong.\u2019\u00c2\u00a0 But he hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, asserted earlier Friday that there was \u00e2\u0080\u009cabout zero daylight\u00e2\u0080\u009d between the senator\u2019s position and the president\u2019s on gun control.In a statement issued Friday night, Mr. Weaver portrayed Mrs. Clinton as having trimmed her sails on gun control for political expediency.\u00e2\u0080\u009cToday she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attacking Bernie on guns,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEight years ago she attacked Barack Obama on guns.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe Sanders campaign said that as a Senate candidate in New York in 2000, Mrs. Clinton favored licensing all gun buyers and establishing a registry of all handgun sales, but that, running for president in 2008, she said she no longer believed such \u00e2\u0080\u009cblanket rules\u00e2\u0080\u009d made sense at the federal level.Also in 2008, the campaign noted, Mrs. Clinton accused Mr. Obama of being \u00e2\u0080\u009celitist and out of touch\u00e2\u0080\u009d for making \u00e2\u0080\u009cdemeaning remarks\u00e2\u0080\u009d about gun owners \u00e2\u0080\u0093 prompting Mr. Obama to suggest she was acting like Annie Oakley \u00e2\u0080\u009cpackin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 a six-shooter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs is the case with so many issues on which she has flip-flopped, voters have to ask themselves which Hillary Clinton is asking for their vote,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Weaver said.Mr. Sanders has repeatedly faced questions about his record on guns, and, specifically, his vote on the immunity legislation.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf somebody has a gun and it falls into the hands of a murderer and that murderer kills somebody with the gun, do you hold the gun manufacturer responsible?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said on CNN in July. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot any more than you would hold a hammer company responsible if somebody beats somebody over the head with a hammer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf a small gun shop owner in the state of Vermont sells a product, a gun, legally to somebody else who then goes out and does something crazy, do I think that that small gun shop owner should be held liable for legally selling the product?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by

{"Headline": "A Look at Questions That Could Shape the 2016 Race", "Date": "2016-01-04", "News": "In politics, there are the \u201cknown unknowns,\u201d looming questions that seem to have no answers. There are several such questions in the sprawling and chaotic race leading up to the 2016 presidential election. Some matter more than others, but all will have an effect on how long the contest lasts.Here is what to watch for:Does Donald J. Trump have a \u201cground game\u201d? Toward the end of the campaign in 2012, the Mitt Romney campaign said its ground game could rival President Obama\u2019s vaunted turnout machine, claims that exasperated Mr. Obama\u2019s aides. \u201cWe\u2019ll know who\u2019s bluffing and who isn\u2019t in two weeks,\u201d David Axelrod, the top adviser to Mr. Obama\u2019s campaign, said at the time.Will there be a national security incident before the Iowa caucuses? It\u2019s a morbid question, but also an inevitable one in the political climate following\u00c2\u00a0the terrorist attacks\u00c2\u00a0in Paris in November and in San Bernardino, Calif., shortly thereafter.Mr. Trump had seemed to be sagging in polls in the days before the Paris attacks. His candidacy drew a fresh bounce afterward, as voters looked not toward a serious-minded policy hound but toward someone who seemed able to project strength. Other candidates, such as Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, seemed to use the moment to project strength as well. And still others, like Ben Carson, have struggled to show they are adept at foreign affairs.Voters already have terrorism as a top concern, according to several polls. And a fresh act of terror just before the voting begins could have a\u00c2\u00a0direct\u00c2\u00a0impact on the election.Can Senator Ted Cruz of Texas stay aloft for four weeks? But Mr. Cruz could also have room to grow, particularly after a campaign shake-up by Mr. Carson last week signaled a deep level of discord internally and raised questions about whether he can regain his previous standing. What\u2019s more, Mr. Cruz has spent months developing a robust\u00c2\u00a0campaign organization, and his profile fits well with evangelical voters and those angry with Washington.The question remains as to whether Mr. Rubio can catch a late wave, especially in Iowa. It is also unclear whether any of the lower-polling candidates whose voters might go to Mr. Cruz, such as Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky or Rick Santorum, will stay in till the end, or, if they don\u2019t, whether they will try to stop Mr. Cruz by supporting another candidate.Who will emerge as the establishment favorite in New Hampshire, and when?It\u2019s an open question whether any of the candidates competing for establishment voter support in New Hampshire will emerge as the person to compete against Mr. Cruz or Mr. Trump.Right now, Mr. Rubio is fending off Mr. Christie, Jeb Bush and Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, all of whom hope to be that candidate. Mr. Rubio has openly positioned himself as the candidate who is fine with coming in second or third in the state, with his eye more focused on South Carolina. The other three have made clear they need to do well in New Hampshire to continue.If Mr. Cruz takes off strong in Iowa or if Mr. Trump wins the state, the ripple effect in New Hampshire is likely to be strong. But if Mr. Cruz wins Iowa, that does not necessarily translate into a collapse of Mr. Trump\u2019s support \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0on the contrary, New Hampshire has a habit of doing the opposite of what Iowa did. The eight days between the Iowa caucuses, on Feb. 1, and when the polls close in New Hampshire, on Feb. 9, will be long ones.Can Mr. Rubio and Mr. Christie survive an onslaught of negative ads? Mr. Christie\u2019s comeback story\u00c2\u00a0from\u00c2\u00a0a brutal year after\u00c2\u00a0the \u201cBridgegate\u201d scandal has been the focus of recent news coverage. So has Mr. Rubio\u2019s story as the candidate\u00c2\u00a0who has been described for weeks as on the brink of a surge.The two men are ripe targets for negative ads, and both are almost certain to face them in the coming weeks. Mr. Rubio has been criticized by Mr. Bush for his\u00c2\u00a0attendance record in the Senate, and by Mr. Cruz, who has tethered him to Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, with\u00c2\u00a0their work on an immigration reform bill in 2013.Mr. Christie, meanwhile, is certain to face attacks \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0on the stump and potentially in \u201csuper PAC\u201d ads \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0over\u00c2\u00a0his fiscal stewardship of New Jersey, which, among other difficulties, has had\u00c2\u00a0a record nine credit downgrades during his tenure. Mr. Trump has already taken a hard jab at Mr. Christie over that record, as well as his embrace of Mr. Obama just after Hurricane Sandy in 2012.Will Mr. Trump ever take a hard swing at Mr. Cruz? Mr. Trump has relished attacking his competitors, frequently talking on the stump over the last six months about taking out his rivals. Yet Mr. Cruz has repeatedly gotten a pass.But even as Mr. Cruz has threatened to eclipse him in Iowa, Mr. Trump has kept his sights most heavily trained on Mr. Bush. Mr. Bush is polling at about 3 percent nationally and is hard to see as a direct threat to Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump\u2019s seeming act of kindness toward Mr. Cruz has prompted any number of theories about what\u2019s at play.Will Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont find a win elsewhere if he loses Iowa? Mr. Sanders is adept at fund-raising from his broad base of followers, and he has proved to be a much stronger challenger to Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary than some of her allies once expected. But polls show Mrs. Clinton leading in Iowa. And while Mr. Sanders is leading in New Hampshire, the risk for him is that a win there would be characterized as a neighbor-state phenomenon.The terrain beyond Iowa and New Hampshire is harder for Mr. Sanders, as it involves states with large black and Hispanic populations, voters who polls show largely favor Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Sanders has the ability to keep raising money and let the race go on for a while if he loses Iowa. And a win in New Hampshire would be significant. But the map becomes less hospitable for him after that.Will Bill Clinton avoid the ghosts of 2008? But friends of Mr. Clinton describe that period as an aberration. Among other things, they note, he was only a few years out from a major heart incident.\u00c2\u00a0He has often been most provoked when he believes Mrs. Clinton is being attacked, but since 2008, he has been less animated publicly about it.Mr. Clinton will hit the stump for his wife on Monday for the first time this cycle with a pair of New Hampshire events. Mr. Trump has spent days talking about the sex scandals that plagued Mr. Clinton before and during his White House terms, almost seeming to dare Mr. Clinton to respond. Mrs. Clinton so far has not, even when a heckler shouted at her about her husband at an event in New Hampshire on Sunday.Mr. Clinton remains one of the Democratic Party\u2019s most popular figures. But he was last in the swing of a presidential campaign during Mr.\u00c2\u00a0Obama\u2019s re-election, almost four years ago.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Taliban Step Up Urban Assaults, Testing the Mettle of Afghan Forces", "Date": "2016-01-09", "News": "Supported byBut the attacks are not going unanswered. As the Afghan security forces have struggled elsewhere, the troops tasked with preventing such attacks have had a measure of success in minimizing the damage in recent months.\u201cThey come to die, their death is guaranteed. And we go there hoping to take care of them without casualties,\u201d said an Afghan special forces commander in Kabul who has been involved in repelling dozens of the attacks. He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the news media.\u201cFor us, there is no rush in clearing them, because they have achieved what they wanted in that first blast already: They have gotten the headline, they have sent fear through the city,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to do it carefully, making sure there is no collateral damage, no civilian casualties.\u201dFor both sides in the war, the urban attacks have become important symbols. For the Afghan government, rocked by the temporary loss of the provincial capital of Kunduz last year, a good showing by the special forces is vital in trying to fight panic after months of battlefield losses.For the Taliban, the propaganda value of being able to turn even relatively safe neighborhoods into war zones for a few hours has become central to their campaign to challenge the government\u2019s authority. Some officials believe that the recent increase in urban attacks is also meant to strengthen the insurgents\u2019 hand in any upcoming peace negotiations, which the Afghan government and its Western allies are again pushing for urgently.The cat-and-mouse game that has developed around complex attacks starts long before the Taliban strike. The Afghan special forces have aggressively mounted night raids around major cities, hoping to disrupt the Taliban\u2019s planning or gain intelligence on what might be coming.Security officials insist that the raids are crucial, even though such operations created deep bitterness against American forces when they were leading them.\u201cNight raids are easier for us, because we already have some information and we know how to go there and how to engage\u201d with Afghan civilians, said Sharifullah Chamto, an Afghan special forces commander in the south. \u201cBut this sort of incident in which the enemy is sheltering among civilians and aiming at you, where you have to make plans at the spot and hit them, this is very difficult and challenging.\u201dThe Taliban fighters conducting the complex attacks are drawn from what the insurgents call the \u201cmartyrdom battalion\u201d \u2014 a sort of special forces unit. The attackers are carefully screened for physical ability and religious seriousness, according to the Taliban\u2019s spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid. On many occasions, at least in Kabul, an attack has been traced to the Haqqani network, a lethal arm of the Taliban that has carried out some of the group\u2019s high-profile attacks.The insurgents\u2019 weapons are not particularly sophisticated. They use assault rifles, grenades and pistols, but they come prepared with enough ammunition and food for hours of fighting. Energy drinks and candy bars have been found at the sites of their attacks, according to the special forces commander in Kabul.In one of the attacks this month, near the Indian Consulate in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif, the militants took over a vacant four-story building. Afterward, policemen searching the building found two Kalashnikov PKM machine guns, one rocket-propelled grenade launcher and two AK-47 machine guns. The militants also left a message on the wall, written in blood: \u201cOne martyr, a thousand ready to die.\u201dThe pattern of the complex attacks is almost always the same: an explosion, often from a bomb placed in a vehicle, which creates an entrance. Then the Taliban fighters rush in. Blasts and gunfire puncture the night\u2019s silence.Afghan forces respond, with helicopters hovering above. That section of the city effectively comes to a halt.The Taliban often rush to the highest point in a building, making it hard for the government forces to clear each floor and engage the enemy firing from a better vantage point. The government forces sometimes simply blast the insurgents out using explosives, rocket-propelled grenades or helicopter gunships.The Afghan forces face other challenges, too. When they respond to an attack, they are not just fighting insurgents, but also the legacy of a long war that has militarized the cities. They have to push back a variety of armed groups \u2014 private security guards, bodyguards and militias of strongmen \u2014 to take charge of the battle.And even after government forces have cordoned the area, their chain of command is sometimes challenged as public leaders \u2014 many of them former warlords \u2014 try to step in.In the attack in Mazar-i-Sharif, for example, the province\u2019s governor, Atta Mohammed Noor, arrived at the scene with his American-made M4 assault carbine, wearing black sunglasses and a ski hat. Pictures were posted on Mr. Noor\u2019s Facebook page showing him looking through the targeting scope, aiming at the building under siege.Whether the purpose of the battleground visits by Afghan officials was to lift the morale of the security forces, as some officials have claimed, or to get publicity and satisfy a \u201cthirst for weapons\u201d as some analysts have said, the commanders of government forces say the public figures seem unaware that such battles take technical skill and experience.\u201cThe situation is getting better, and I would say now 70 percent to 80 percent of the time we can take control of the scene and the operation easily,\u201d the special forces commander in Kabul said. \u201cBut everybody is armed here, so some of those challenges are still there.\u201dFor the special forces, the fight is over only after the final militant has been killed and the building has been declared to be clear, which sometimes takes hours as each room is checked.The next day, life picks up again. In what has become a grisly routine, intelligence and police assessment teams sift the wreckage, surrounded by the gore of battle. But even when all that is cleared away, the attacks leave other marks. Somewhere in the city, cranes unload new layers of stark concrete walls, awaiting another assault.Reporting was contributed by Taimoor Shah from Kandahar, Najim Rahim from Kunduz, and Rod Nordland from Kabul.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Taxing Google and Other U.S. Giants Is Dividing Europe", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byBRUSSELS \u2014 For some European nations, big American corporations like Google are seen primarily as employers and technological innovators whose presence can help with their global competitiveness.But for others, the multinational giants are seen as having used complex accounting to sidestep corporate taxes. That, some argue, makes them prime targets at a time when governments are grasping for revenue to fill budget deficits and trying to address populist concerns about inequality.The divide, long present in Europe, is playing out with new intensity.European Union officials in Brussels are intent on imposing a blocwide standard for taxation and clawing back what they consider to be improper tax breaks granted by national governments to multinational companies.While some countries like France and Germany are happy to see back taxes collected from big corporations as a result of the effort, others are essentially saying they would rather the companies keep all or some of their tax breaks as long as they bring prosperity.The difference in approach may not rank with more existential problems for the European Union, like how to control the migrant influx without sacrificing open borders across much of the Continent. But it shows how tax policy cuts to the core of economic competitiveness for most countries in Europe, where sustained growth and balanced budgets have been hard to achieve lately.Ms. Vestager made her comments about Britain\u2019s deal with Google on the same day that the European commissioner for financial affairs and taxes, Pierre Moscovici, proposed measures meant to close a number of corporate tax loopholes across the European Union.The European Union wants no member state to use tax policy to achieve an unfair business advantage over its neighbors. But the ability of European countries to tailor tax practices to their own purposes is a matter of national sovereignty that many leaders are unwilling to cede to Brussels. That is true for the countries that are trying to compete for jobs and foreign investment brought by multinational titans like Google, Apple or Facebook as well as for those trying to wring more tax revenue from rich companies to help support a struggling economy.\u201cNational governments have competing objectives here,\u201d Neal Todd, an international tax expert and partner at the law firm Berwin Leighton Paisner, wrote in an email message to reporters on Thursday. \u201cWhilst nearly all governments want multinationals in general (and U.S. tech groups in particular) to pay more tax,\" he wrote, \"none of them want to change their own rules only to find that businesses simply relocate to warmer fiscal climes.\"Although the British prime minister, Mr. Cameron, defended his Google deal, his political opponents have criticized it as too generous to the company and not reflective of the full magnitude of its British revenue for the 10 years it covers.In studying the Cameron-Google agreement, Ms. Vestager may follow up on a request of the Scottish National Party, a British opposition party, which has sent a letter to the European Commission criticizing the tax deal with the search giant. A spokesman for Ms. Vestager\u2019s office said on Thursday that the complaint would need to be studied to see if it warranted a formal investigation.The issue could be particularly delicate, coming as Mr. Cameron has been trying to negotiate better terms for Britain within the European Union. As soon as June, Britain may hold a referendum in which voters would be asked whether they want to remain in the bloc or leave it.But Christian Cubitt, a Cameron spokesman, declined on Thursday to elevate the tax dispute to the level of the debate on Britain\u2019s place in the European Union. He said simply that it was \u201ca decision for the commission\" to decide whether to investigate, although he stressed that Google had agreed to pay all the tax that is due.Britain is by no means alone in seeking to handle corporate tax matters on its own terms.Italian financial police officials were to issue an investigative report to Google on Thursday, indicating whether the company has paid sufficient taxes in Italy since 2008. Although Google has not been accused of wrongdoing, tax officials say the delinquent amount could be about 300 million euros, or about $325.3 million.Google is also in discussions with France over back taxes. Last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the company\u2019s executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, met with the French economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, to discuss the matter.There has been no public discussion of how much in back taxes is being sought by France\u2019s Socialist government, but local news reports have placed the figure as high as \u20ac500 million.Google\u2019s official response to reports of those negotiations has been the same, which it repeated yesterday: \u201cGoogle complies with the tax laws in every country where we operate. We continue to work with the relevant authorities.\u201dThe biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Ms. Vestager is also investigating tax arrangements between Ireland and Apple, and Luxembourg and Amazon over whether the companies received preferential tax deals that broke the European Union\u2019s state-aid rules. A decision in the Apple case is expected in March, at the earliest; the Amazon case could also be decided in the coming months. The companies and governments say they have done nothing wrong.In previous cases where Ms. Vestager has ruled that corporate tax arrangements violated European Union law by favoring certain companies, governments have been ordered to recoup back taxes that they would rather not collect lest they signal to other multinationals that their countries are not business-friendly.While Ms. Vestager is investigating cases where countries might have let companies pay too little tax, the proposals by Mr. Moscovici on Thursday are meant to prevent tax avoidance before it happens by closing gaps in cross-border rules to channel profit to subsidiaries in lower-tax countries.In a news conference, Mr. Moscovici said losses from the loopholes amounted to nearly \u20ac70 billion a year, discriminated against small business and angered ordinary citizens.His proposals mean to deter European governments from, for example, letting companies shift profit to low-tax jurisdictions. Mr. Moscovici said his proposals also showed Europe\u2019s eagerness to put into effect international standards endorsed by the leaders of Group of 20 major economies last year.Mr. Moscovici\u2019s measures would also require corporations to fully disclose all of their taxes, profit, revenue and other financial data to the administrations of all countries where they operate.The proposals, though, might be hard to turn into law. They would require the unanimous approval of European Union governments, and some could balk. And the measures would not affect the low across-the-board corporate tax rates that countries like Ireland use as an inducement to attract foreign companies.Oxfam, an antipoverty group, criticized Mr. Moscovici as taking an ineffective \u201clowest common denominator approach\u201d to the tax overhaul.British lawmakers aligned with Mr. Cameron\u2019s government were wary of Mr. Moscovici\u2019s proposals.\u201cGlobally, there is a battle raging for jobs and growth,\u201d said Ashley Fox, the leader of the delegation of British Conservatives at the European Parliament. \u201cThe E.U. must ensure that its proposals do not act as a deterrent to international investment and employment.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Friday about divisions in Europe over the taxing of multinational corporations misidentified the recipients of written comments about European tax policies from Neal Todd, an international tax expert. They were sent to the news media, not to Mr. Todd\u2019s clients.James Kanter reported from Brussels, and Mark Scott from Rome.

{"Headline": "PAC Backing Jeb Bush Counters Campaign Message With Ad Critical of Marco Rubio", "Date": "2016-01-12", "News": "GRINNELL, Iowa \u00e2\u0080\u0094 The messages coming out of the political world of Jeb Bush could not be more different.For weeks, the Bush campaign, led by Jeb Bush himself, has used the candidacy of Donald J. Trump to argue that Mr. Bush is a responsible alternative, a serious leader for serious times.And then there is Right to Rise, the \u00e2\u0080\u009csuper PAC\u00e2\u0080\u009d supporting Mr. Bush, which has begun a furious advertising offensive against Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, accusing him of flip-flopping on immigration.\u00e2\u0080\u009cMarco Rubio, just another Washington politician you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t trust,\u00e2\u0080\u009d concludes the ad, which is airing in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.The spot has made some Bush supporters uneasy and created challenges for the candidate, whose own immigration plan \u00e2\u0080\u0094 about which he wrote an entire book \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is remarkably similar to the Rubio proposal that the super PAC ad dismisses as \u00e2\u0080\u009camnesty.\u201d The candidate himself has seemed uncomfortable with such attacks, particularly against Mr. Rubio, his one-time prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9e. In his one major broadside against Mr. Rubio during an early debate, Mr. Bush looked awkward and the attack failed, leaving donors grumbling and his campaign scrambling to explain away the moment.On Tuesday, asked by reporters if the super PAC supporting him was tarnishing his record, Mr. Bush distanced himself from the ad, saying he was focused only on his own campaign, but signaled that he expected the race to get tougher.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t control what anyone else does,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can only control what I do, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m advocating my record and my detailed plan to fix the mess in Washington, D.C. Everybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be scrutinized. This is not bean bag.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMoments later, referring to an ad that a super PAC supporting Mr. Rubio recently aired, featuring images of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey with President Obama, Mr. Bush posed a question of his own: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you ask him about his ad about Christie?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI saw that in New Hampshire. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a zinger.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cBush is not going to be the nominee, but is getting backed by a super PAC doing its level best to stop someone who is a potential nominee and a Bush prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9e,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote.Earlier in the day, at a town-hall-style event in Coralville, Iowa, a young female voter seemed to capture Mr. Bush\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ambivalence about going after Mr. Rubio, when she stood and asked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s over, when everything is over, do you go up to him and say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Hey man, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s O.K.? I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean everything,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause you know there was a great relationship at one time, and if you watch his face, sometimes he even looks disappointed that maybe there is the rift between you two.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut Mr. Bush \u00e2\u0080\u0094 unlike his super PAC, which has shown an increased willingness to take Mr. Rubio on directly \u00e2\u0080\u0094 instead largely talked about his own record and said, only, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMarco is my friend \u00e2\u0080\u0094he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my friend \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and what has been said by our campaign, I stand by, completely.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe new ad is not the first time Right to Rise has created problems for the Bush campaign. Late last year, the group \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which has raised more than $100 million\u00e2\u0080\u0094 began telling donors and supporters it was willing to spend as much as $20 million to hobble Mr. Rubio. The super PAC showed donors a contentious ad it had made, but never released, painting Mr. Rubio as unelectable in a general election because of his hard-line position against abortionRight to Rise says the ad is not about immigration, but an effort to portray Mr. Rubio as a calculating politician with no core principles who is trying to be all things to all people.The super PAC has also hit Mr. Trump repeatedly. But as the early voting nears \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Iowans head to their caucuses on Feb. 1, and New Hampshire voters go to the polls on Feb. 9 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Right to Rise seems to have focused its attacks most on Mr. Rubio, in contrast to Mr. Bush\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own campaign strategy. (Mr. Bush frequently mentions Mr. Trump on the campaign trail, railing against him, but does not bring up Mr. Rubio unprompted.)Another digital ad by the super PAC took a more lighthearted tone, but also attacked Mr. Rubio for changing his position on issues \u00e2\u0080\u0094 using a recent dust-up over a pair of trendy black boots Mr. Rubio was spotted wearing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese boots are made for flippin\u00e2\u0080\u0099,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says the narrator, in a sing-song voice.  Mr. Rubio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign dismissed the attacks as those of a desperate candidate.\u00e2\u0080\u009cJeb Bush and his establishment allies are trying to buy this election, and they know Marco is standing in their way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Alex Conant, a spokesman for Mr. Rubio, said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why their attacks grow more desperate by the day.

{"Headline": "Ice Problems and Injury Plague Women\u2019s Debut at the Winter Classic", "Date": "2015-12-31", "News": "Supported byPride 1, Canadiennes 1FOXBOROUGH, Mass. \u2014 The last three weeks exposed women\u2019s hockey to the hard business dealings of professional sports, along with its hierarchies and the need for more collaboration to advance the sport.After much confusion and delay, the lessons learned paid off with a seminal moment on Thursday afternoon, when the Boston Pride of the National Women\u2019s Hockey League and Les Canadiennes of the Canadian Women\u2019s Hockey League played outdoors at Gillette Stadium as part of the N.H.L.\u2019s Winter Classic festivities.The teams tied, 1-1, in a fast-paced contest. But an event that was already heavily scrutinized for its structure received another setback when a player was injured on ice conditions that had been questioned earlier in the day.Late in the first period, Denna Laing stepped on a stick and lost her footing as she went crashing into the boards, according to Pride Coach Bobby Jay. Replays were unavailable, since the game was not broadcast live.After about 10 minutes, Laing was placed on a stretcher, taken off the ice and transported to Massachusetts General Hospital, nearly 30 miles away.Before the women\u2019s game, the Montreal Canadiens and the Boston Bruins practiced for Friday\u2019s N.H.L. Winter Classic, and some players saw slushy and dangerous patches of ice. Laing\u2019s injury occurred behind the net on an end of the rink where the sun was shining for much of the afternoon.After the game, Patrick Burke, the N.H.L. director of player safety, said that Dan Craig, a league official who oversaw the playing surface, had said the ice was fine.The injury was a somber moment in a game that was intended to be a landmark, but at times was overshadowed by planning snafus.After a report surfaced on Dec. 5 that an outdoor women\u2019s hockey game was going to take place the day before the Winter Classic, the organizers said nothing until the N.H.L. officially announced the game on Monday.During the silence, fans and even players were unsure of the details and baffled at how a formative opportunity might slip away. Sponsorship debates and fractures between influential hockey organizations were clouding negotiations and adding to the worry.\u201cIt\u2019s super frustrating,\u201d Pride forward Rachel Llanes said on Sunday before the official announcement. \u201cI mean, not being informed pretty much about it, we\u2019re getting informed last second with things, we don\u2019t know the answers to our questions. We\u2019re not trying to blame anyone, because no one knows anything and the N.H.L. hasn\u2019t even released anything about it, so it\u2019s just frustrating to hear it from the grapevines what\u2019s going to happen.\u201dAfter the Pride\u2019s lone practice for the game on Wednesday, Jay said the players were realizing that business decisions occasionally outweigh hockey decisions.\u201cNow that you\u2019re a professional, you\u2019re going to start to see the business side of it \u2014 it\u2019s not always the prettiest side,\u201d Jay said. \u201cThey\u2019re going through it for the first time, some of these things; they kind of can be pawns sometimes.\u201dThose business decisions included no streaming or television options, even though other events throughout the day, including the N.H.L.\u2019s alumni game, were broadcast live.At times, the day felt like a full-fledged marquee event, except for the women\u2019s game. Parking at Gillette Stadium cost $50. The pregame festivities for the alumni game lasted almost as long as the women\u2019s game, which included two 15-minute periods played on a running clock.The alumni game was allowed an overtime shootout when their contest finished tied after regulation. During the women\u2019s game, the N.H.L.\u2019s official Twitter and Facebook pages did not provide any original content about it.Still, many players were just thankful for Thursday\u2019s stage.\u201cTo be a part of such a historic moment for us, to partner with the N.H.L., I think it\u2019s something that we don\u2019t take for granted and we\u2019re going to really appreciate this moment,\u201d Canadiennes forward Julie Chu said.Chu, a former United States Olympian, hugged Pride players after the game. C.W.H.L. Commissioner Brenda Andress and N.W.H.L. Commissioner Dani Rylan took photographs together before the game.The two leagues have never declared themselves rivals, but they have had a less than amicable relationship since the N.W.H.L. formed last March and became the first major North American women\u2019s hockey league to pay its players.The C.W.H.L., in its ninth season, does not pay its players, and it lost several top American players to the N.W.H.L. this season. Both leagues field premier talent \u2014 N.C.A.A. stars and members of the United States national team buoy the N.W.H.L., while the C.W.H.L. is led by players from the defending Olympic champion Canadian national team.Earlier this week, Andress said in a phone interview that she believed more collaboration was necessary to grow the sport.The game lost some luster because of the absence of members of the Pride who had a previous commitment to a United States national team training camp, including stars like Hilary Knight, Brianna Decker and Kacey Bellamy. Laing was one of eight players selected from the Pride practice squad or other N.W.H.L. teams as a replacement.In an interview with the Yahoo blog Puck Daddy, Burke said that U.S.A. Hockey had declined to let its players out for an exhibition. Earlier this month, U.S.A. Hockey did not respond to an email for comment.Llanes said that despite the advent of two viable professional women\u2019s hockey leagues, U.S.A. Hockey retained overwhelming influence over the sport\u2019s future.\u201cUnfortunately, that\u2019s women\u2019s hockey right now,\u201d Llanes said. \u201cI think top priority for anyone in the women\u2019s game is the Olympic team, whether it\u2019s U.S.A. or Canada.\u201dShe added, \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re all on the same page right now at different levels of the game.\u201dEarlier this month, the United States women\u2019s national soccer team successfully protested against playing on unfit field conditions, taking a stand against U.S. Soccer, which, like U.S.A. Hockey, is the commanding presence in the sport. It is debatable whether playing in an exhibition game is currently worth losing a roster spot on a national team, but those involved in the Outdoor Women\u2019s Classic hoped that the event was a step toward bringing women\u2019s professional hockey on equal footing.\u201cAs it goes, the women will understand that they have some leverage,\u201d Jay said. \u201cThey have to look out for themselves. You have to make sure you\u2019re doing what\u2019s best for yourself. I just think they got put in the middle and didn\u2019t really have much \u2014 it\u2019s a tough choice.\u201cOff the ice, there are business aspects that are a little bit out of your control, and money\u2019s a factor and sometimes political reasons that things don\u2019t always go your way and you\u2019re going to have to learn how to manage those, too.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Donald Trump Goes Rogue", "Date": "2016-01-25", "News": "Supported byI used to think 2015 was bad but that was before the first few weeks of 2016. It\u2019s still January and Donald Trump, the leading candidate for the Republican nomination, has already said, \u201cI could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn\u2019t lose any voters, O.K.?\u201dThe really scary part \u2014 without getting into what this line of thinking might presage in terms of Trump\u2019s actions if he ever got to the Oval Office \u2014 is he could be right. Teflon Trump: nothing sticks.People like to be bullied when the world feels too upended and menacing to cope; when, as Trump puts it in one his favorite tropes, \u201cSomething\u2019s going on.\u201d Trump\u2019s plugging into Dylan, odious as that thought is: \u201cSomething is happening here/But you don\u2019t know what it is/Do you, Mister Jones?\u201dWe\u2019ll find out just what over the next few months. Napoleon used to ask of his prospective generals, \u201cIs he lucky?\u201d Trump appears to be. That\u2019s scary too.The scariest part, however, is that Sarah Palin supports Trump and she said: \u201cTrump\u2019s candidacy, it has exposed not just that tragic ramifications of that betrayal of the transformation of our country, but too, he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the aisle that has enabled it, O.K.? Well, Trump, what he\u2019s been able to do, which is really ticking people off, which I\u2019m glad about, he\u2019s going rogue left and right, man, that\u2019s why he\u2019s doing so well.\u201dO.K.!Or as James Joyce put it in Finnegans Wake: \u201cDid you aye, did you eye, did you everysee suchaway, suchawhy, eeriewhigg airywhugger?\u201dNo wonder Stephen Colbert, preparing to imitate Palin on The Late Show, first fired a taser gun at \u201cthe part of my brain that understands sentence structure.\u201d That did the trick.Minus his occipital lobe Colbert was right at home with Palin\u2019s, \u201cWell, and then, funny, ha ha, not funny, but now, what they\u2019re doing is wailing, \u2018Well, Trump and his, uh, uh, uh, Trumpeters, they\u2019re not conservative enough.\u201d\u2019Uh, huh?I wonder what Palin will say if former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, appalled by this political spectacle, decides to spend a billion dollars of his loose change on going rogue center as a presidential candidate. Could happen. Or is it too \u201chopey, changey\u201d to imagine that?Still, I have to hand it to Palin. Her new word \u2014 \u201csquirmish\u201d \u2014 is useful. She characterized the Middle East as a place of \u201csquirmishes that have been going on for centuries.\u201dThe world in 2016 does make you squirm. In just three weeks close to $8 trillion has been wiped off global equity markets by a \u201ccorrection.\u201d The reasons seem unclear, which is not very comforting.China is slowing. There is no next China. Oil prices are sinking, a trend that should have benefits but appears to have few this time. The terrible relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia, that is to say the Shiite and Sunni Muslim worlds, just got far more terrible.Nobody really knows what to do about ISIS, unless it\u2019s Palin, who on the one hand wants to \u201ckick ISIS ass\u201d and on the other wants to \u201clet Allah sort it out.\u201dAllah\u2019s got a way with squirmishes if you just give him time.And it\u2019s not like the year began on a high. In fact 2015 was already a real downer. It brought the Charlie Hebdo massacre, the Paris massacre, the San Bernardino slaughter, the rise and internationalization of ISIS, the death toll in Syria to about 250,000, the arrival of over one million desperate migrants and refugees in Europe, dead little Alan Kurdi on a Turkish beach, a senseless Saudi war in Yemen, Putin offensives on various fronts, the warmest year on record, American bombing of a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Afghanistan, and sundry other disasters.At least an American Embassy in Havana opened. There was the Paris climate accord.Look no further than this troubling world to understand Trump and the various rightist populists making a lot of noise on the European fringes. Take two lost wars, stagnant wages for most people, threats of terrorism, plunging 401(k) retirement plans, and rampant anxiety \u2014 and put all that together with a practiced showman promising restored greatness \u2014 and you get the Weimar volatility of this unanchored America.Well, at least it snowed. It snowed a lot. It snowed on the nation\u2019s capital. It snowed on New York. We were snowed under with coverage \u2014 the build-up, the blizzard, the post-blizzard. At least the snow was white, unlike the black flags of ISIS, and at least it really had nothing to do with Trump or Palin.Unless, as I confess I did, you found yourself imagining Trump opening fire on Fifth Avenue on some slacker not wielding a shovel and staining the snow red with blood \u2014 to the roar of the \u201cTrumpeters.\u201dAdvertisement"}

His red hair earned him his nickname.He enlisted in the Navy during the Korean War and served on the hospital ship Repose, where he played with a shipboard group, the Repose Ramblers.After returning to Bakersfield, he played in local nightclubs, including the Blackboard, where he filled in for Mr. Owens on weekends. \u201cEven though Buck and Merle are regarded as the pillars of the Bakersfield sound, Red was right up there along with them,\u201d Michael Gray, the music editor of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, said in an interview on Tuesday. On his Facebook page, Mr. Haggard wrote, \u201cHe played a huge part in the Bakersfield sound.\u201dMr. Simpson and Mr. Owens became good friends and songwriting partners. Mr. Owens took their song \u201cSam\u2019s Place\u201d to the top of the country charts in 1967. Mr. Simpson also wrote \u201cYou Don\u2019t Have Very Far to Go\u201d for Mr. Haggard in 1965 and \u201cClose Up the Honky Tonks,\u201d recorded by Mr. Owens in 1964 and later by Gram Parsons and Dwight Yoakam.\u201cHe wrote more than 30 songs that Buck recorded,\u201d the music historian Scott B.

{"Headline": "Massachusetts Chief\u2019s Tack in Drug War: Steer Addicts to Rehab, Not Jail", "Date": "2016-01-24", "News": "Supported byCANTON, Ohio \u2014 Leonard Campanello, the police chief of Gloucester, Mass., took the microphone here in mid-December and opened with his usual warm-up line: I\u2019m from Gloucester, he said in his heavy Boston accent. \u201cThat\u2019s spelled \u2018G-l-o-s-t-a-h.\u2019\u201d\u201cAny addict who walks into the police station with the remainder of their drug equipment (needles, etc.) or drugs and asks for help will NOT be charged,\u201d he wrote. \u201cInstead we will walk them through the system toward detox and recovery\u201d and send them for treatment \u201con the spot.\u201dThat post from a small-town police chief was shared more than 30,000 times and viewed by 2.4 million people. By June, his Police Department had put his promise into action in what became known as Gloucester\u2019s Angel program.Critics said that he did not have the authority to take the law into his own hands and forgo arrests. But other police departments, fed up with arresting addicts and getting nowhere, saw the Gloucester approach as a promising way to address the epidemic of heroin and prescription pain pills, which together killed 47,055 people in 2014 nationwide \u2014 more than died in car accidents, homicides or suicides.Since the program began, 391 addicts have turned themselves in at the city\u2019s brick police station. About 40 percent are from the Gloucester area; the rest come from all over the country. All have been placed in treatment.Just as surprisingly, 56 police departments in 17 states have started programs modeled on or inspired by Gloucester\u2019s, with 110 more preparing to do so.In addition, 200 treatment centers across the country have signed on as partners. In six months, Gloucester, which steers people to treatment but does not itself provide it, has developed a nationwide network of centers willing to provide beds and take referrals by the police, regardless of whether the addict has insurance.\u201cThis has the potential to be a disruptive innovation that changes the picture of how we deal with the disease,\u201d said David Rosenbloom, a professor of health policy and management at the Boston University School of Public Health, who has been analyzing data for Gloucester. And it is a measure of the widespread desperation to move beyond the war on drugs that so many have been willing to try it.These days, the chief is often on the road, addressing police departments, parents and treatment providers in speeches like the one here last month to 150 substance abuse clinicians, sponsored by the Mental Health and Recovery Services Board of Stark County.He told the audience how his officers had developed their own database of treatment sites, which they call over and over until they secure a bed.\u201cA bed not available at 10 a.m. might be available at 10:10, but they won\u2019t tell you that,\u201d Chief Campanello said. \u201cIf you want Bruce Springsteen tickets, you aren\u2019t going to stop calling because you get a busy signal.\u201dBut being matched with a bed is just the first step on the long, grueling road to recovery. Heroin retains such a ferocious grip on brain cells that relapses are viewed as part of the process.Chief Campanello said addicts in his program were always welcomed back, no questions asked.He then turned somber, telling the audience about a phone call he received that morning.A man named Steve Jesi had called to say his daughter, Stephenie, 33, who had been in and out of the Gloucester program, had relapsed for a third time, overdosed and been found dead. She was the first person in the program who did not make it.\u201cDespite our best efforts, we know people will die,\u201d Chief Campanello told the audience. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make it feel any better.\u201dHis voice caught. His eyes welled with tears.\u201cI know it\u2019s successful,\u201d he said of the program. \u201cAnd I know we\u2019re saving lives. But we worry about the one we lost.\u201dThe Eriks of the WorldThe youngest of four children, Mr. Campanello grew up in a Roman Catholic Italian family in Saugus, a blue-collar town 10 miles north of Boston. His father was a department store salesman, while his mother raised the family.In 1990, Mr. Campanello was studying criminal justice at Northeastern University in Boston, where he earned his bachelor\u2019s degree, when he joined the Saugus police force. He later earned a master\u2019s degree in criminal justice administration at Boston University.Russell Campanello, his older brother by 12 years, a technology industry executive, tried to talk him into becoming a lawyer. But, Russell said, \u201che felt there were enough lawyers and not enough police on the street helping people.\u201dDuring his 22 years on the Saugus force, Chief Campanello worked undercover in the narcotics unit for seven years. There, he met a boy named Erik whose parents were heroin addicts. Erik was using by age 12 and dead by 19.\u201cWe arrested Erik a dozen times,\u201d Chief Campanello recalled one night on his way to O\u2019Hare International Airport after participating in a panel discussion in Chicago.\u201cWe thought things like \u2018Erik needs help,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut there were no avenues for that, especially through the police force. It wasn\u2019t our responsibility.\u201dIn 2012, he became chief in Gloucester, a fishing town of 28,000 and the setting for \u201cThe Perfect Storm.\u201d The chief, who plays the piano by ear, is drawn to songs like Mr. Springsteen\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019re Missing,\u201d an elegy about loss after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. It reminds him, he said, of those who have lost someone to heroin.And as head of a 60-person police force, he said, he was at last in a position to do something for the Eriks of the world.With CompassionThe Gloucester Angel program grew out of a town forum last spring on the heroin crisis. Four people had died of overdoses in the first three months of 2015, more than had died in all of 2014. Residents said they wanted addicts treated with compassion.Chief Campanello said the program, which operates around the clock, \u201cis about a community\u2019s journey helping one another, a humanitarian effort that they wanted their Police Department to reflect.\u201dWhen addicts show up, an officer calls on one of 55 \u201cangels,\u201d local volunteers who are in recovery or otherwise familiar with addiction, to listen and offer moral support. The officer takes a history and starts dialing treatment facilities, where clinicians determine what treatment best suits the addict and of what duration. Beds have been found in as little as 17 minutes and as much as a couple of days. Some of those beds are as close as Gloucester; others, as far as California.Many local businesses support the program: A pharmacy in Gloucester discounted naloxone, which reverses the effects of an overdose, and CVS and Walgreens followed suit. Taxi companies provide free rides to treatment facilities or the airport. The ambulance service offers a reduced rate.The department spends an average of $55 for each addict, Chief Campanello said, compared with $220 spent to arrest, process and hold an addict in custody for a single day.The police initiative has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars and received millions in in-kind contributions, including placement in treatment centers. \u201cWhen the chief wrote that blog post in the spring and got 2.4 million hits, he called and said, \u2018Help!\u2019\u201d Mr. Rosenthal said. \u201cI saw very quickly that this could be a tipping point.\u201dAmong the program\u2019s success stories is Kristina, 29, who had a steady job and lived near Gloucester. She did not want her last name used.She broke an ankle, started out on pain pills and ultimately moved on to heroin. After about two years, she said, she started \u201ccreating wreckage\u201d in her life, crashing her car and losing her apartment. She tried without success to find treatment on her own.Finally, she said, facing jail time, she turned herself in at the Gloucester police station.\u201cThey worked every avenue to get me into treatment,\u201d Kristina said. Occasionally officers call to check on her. \u201cThey said, \u2018If you ever need anything, the doors are still open, no matter what.\u2019\u201dStill, the program has its critics.Jonathan W. Blodgett, the district attorney of Essex County, where Gloucester is, warned Chief Campanello that he did not have the authority to offer amnesty to someone for the crime of heroin possession.The chief and other law enforcement officers insist that the police have discretion when it comes to arrests.Elizabeth D. Scheibel, a former district attorney for the Northwestern District of Massachusetts in Northampton, raises other questions. \u201cSelective enforcement\u201d of the law, she said, \u201ccould well have a disparate impact on the constitutional rights of other offenders.\u201dAnd, she said, promising amnesty not only takes away an incentive to complete a treatment program, it could also complicate an investigation involving an addict who might have been involved in a serious crime before surrendering to the police.Chief Campanello said that his officers pursued drug traffickers, and that some addicts had even pointed the police to their dealers. But during one speech, to officers in Belfast, Me., he realized he might come across as soft.\u201cI\u2019m sounding less like a police chief and more like a social activist,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to go arrest somebody.\u201dChief Campanello has laid out his philosophy \u2014 encapsulated in a bumper sticker on his office wall, \u201cStrong Men Don\u2019t Bully\u201d \u2014 and the program\u2019s nuts and bolts in officer-to-officer talks around the country. Chiefs from Scarborough, Me.; Cooperstown, N.Y.; Lodi, Ohio; and Rolling Meadows, Ill., among others, have sought his advice as they duplicated his program. So far, more than 400 addicts nationwide have turned themselves in at 56 police departments.\u201cLenny triggered some amazing out-of-the-box thinking,\u201d said Frederick Ryan, the chief in Arlington, Mass., a Boston suburb, which plans to offer its own amnesty program this year.Gloucester\u2019s mayor, Sefatia Romeo Theken, also stands behind the chief.\u201cI think it\u2019s a fantastic program,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we arrested every single addict, they\u2019d just be back on the street.\u201dOf course, overdoses continue to occur. On Jan. 17, Gloucester grappled with four in a 24-hour period. Naloxone revived the addicts. And Chief Campanello again took to Facebook, reaching out to all addicts and assuring them that if they turned themselves in, there would be no judgment.\u201cWe accept you,\u201d he posted.\u201cIf you\u2019re discouraged because you\u2019ve tried before,\u201d he wrote, \u201cknow that relapse is part of the disease, and we will be there again and again and again until you make it.\u201dEulogies, StillFor all his efforts, sometimes all Chief Campanello can do is deliver a heartfelt eulogy, as he did for Stephenie Jesi on a frigid Saturday before Christmas.Her problem started when she broke an ankle in 2012 and was prescribed OxyContin. She soon went from a good-paying job with Verizon and a nice home in Stoneham, about 10 miles north of Boston, to a losing battle with heroin.A year ago, she went to rehab in Florida, but relapsed. \u201cShe was using again, and was off and running,\u201d said her father, 62, a business consultant.Over the next several months, it would be the same story of treatment, relapse and trouble.Stephenie entered the Gloucester program in August, and the chief got her into a treatment facility. After further relapses, Chief Campanello got her into a second treatment facility, and then a third.\u201cThere\u2019s no manual about what to do,\u201d said her mother, Cheryl Marlow, 61. \u201cThe chief was our only resource.\u201dOn Dec. 8, Stephenie overdosed again, was treated at a hospital and was then discharged.Three days later, she sent her parents an email saying she was on a waiting list for a bed, but not through Gloucester.\u201cI don\u2019t know how to put all my pieces back together, and this is very embarrassing to go through this in front of so many people who don\u2019t understand anything about addiction,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe people who say, \u2018If she really cared at all about her family, she would have stopped a long time ago,\u2019 or, \u2018she\u2019s tried getting clean more times then I can count; what makes this time any different?\u2019 \u2014 those are the kinds of questions that make this so embarrassing and so hard to come back each time.\u201dThe next day, she exchanged texts with her mother, who asked if she had Chief Campanello\u2019s number. She did. \u201cI don\u2019t know why she didn\u2019t call him,\u201d her mother said later.Stephenie died that night, alone in a hotel room.Her parents said that despite having lost their daughter, they were grateful to the chief and his officers for all they had done. \u201cHe was the only go-to person that I had to go to,\u201d Mr. Jesi said.They urged friends and family to make donations to the Police Assisted Addiction and Recovery Initiative and asked the chief to deliver their daughter\u2019s eulogy.Hundreds of mourners packed the church, St. Mary of the Annunciation, in Danvers. \u201cHer death for us is a great loss, and one that we will suffer as a police department with all of you for a very, very long time,\u201d Chief Campanello said.His officers would redouble their efforts to fight the disease, he told the mourners. \u201cWe will, in the words of Dylan Thomas, rage against the dying of the light, again.\u201d His voice cracked.Stephenie\u2019s four brothers carried her coffin to a waiting hearse. Gloucester police cars led the procession to the cemetery. She was buried next to her grandparents.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Poll Watch: Obama\u2019s Gun Policies Are Popular, but Verdict Is Mixed on Other Issues", "Date": "2016-01-12", "News": "President Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plan to expand background checks to cover more gun sales generated wide support among Americans, but it did little to improve his overall standing with the public, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.As he prepares to deliver his final State of the Union address on Tuesday, Mr. Obama faces deep skepticism about his performance on a range of issues, including immigration, terrorism, health care and gun policy. Moreover, nearly as many Americans said that Mr. Obama exceeded his authority with his executive actions on gun control as said he acted properly.Over all, 46 percent of Americans approve of his handling of the job, while 47 percent disapprove, placing him below Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton at this stage of their presidencies, but significantly above George W. Bush. Democrats remain broadly supportive of the president and about three in five potential Democratic primary voters said they wanted their nominee to continue his policies if elected.The numbers suggested the challenge for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Gov. Martin O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Malley of Maryland as they jockey for the party mantle. To win the favor of Democrats, they may not be able to veer too far from Mr. Obama, yet he remains weak enough that being seen as the embodiment of a third term might not help with the general public in the fall.Of the issues tested, Mr. Obama is at his weakest on foreign policy, with just 34 percent approving of his performance. Only 37 percent approve his immigration policies and 40 percent of his handling of terrorism. His strongest area is the economy, and even there his ratings are mediocre, with 45 percent favoring his handling of the issue, compared with 49 percent disapproving.On the heels of strong job-creation numbers, Mr. Obama plans to spend much of his speech on Tuesday night highlighting the recovery of the economy on his watch. His Republican opponents, zeroing in on his weak areas, have focused in recent days on what they see as his foreign policy failures in places like Iran, North Korea, Syria and Ukraine.Mr. Obama, who has not enjoyed the support of a majority of Americans in the Times/CBS News survey since shortly after his second inauguration, in 2013, retains one saving grace, namely that Congress remains even less popular than he is. That has not changed drastically with the arrival of new management. Public opinion of Congress is still stubbornly low, with just 15 percent approving and 75 percent disapproving.The new House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, is unknown to many Americans but has a challenge first consolidating support among Republicans, who split with 34 percent approving of his performance, compared with 23 percent disapproving. Mr. Ryan took over from Speaker John A. Boehner after a conservative revolt, but some on the right remain suspicious of their new leader despite his conservative record.The latest poll was conducted after Mr. Obama announced his plans to expand the range of gun sellers who must conduct criminal background checks on customers and tighten enforcement of existing laws. More than six in 10 Americans support that, but they are divided on party and other lines. While 54 percent of Americans in households with a gun owner supported the action, 61 percent of those with a member of the National Rifle Association at home opposed it.Over all, 49 percent of the public said Mr. Obama had acted within his authority, while 43 percent said he went beyond his power to regulate guns. As with other issues, that one broke down along party lines, with three-quarters of Democrats concluding that he acted within bounds and a roughly equal proportion of Republicans disagreeing.While nearly three in five Americans would like to see stricter gun laws enacted, and 54 percent think such laws would help prevent gun violence, there is ground for consensus on the issue. Americans of all stripes with near unanimity support background checks for all potential gun buyers and strong majorities regardless of party affiliation think better mental health screening and treatment would reduce gun violence.The nationwide poll was conducted from Jan. 7 to 10 with 1,276 adults on mobile telephones and landlines. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points for all adults and six points for Democratic primary voters.Further results from the poll will be released at 6:30 p.m. \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

Earlier on Thursday, he criticized Jeb Bush for supporting national education standards. In his attack on Mr. Cruz, Mr. Rubio recounted an episode last year on the floor of the Senate in which the Texas senator voted against a crop insurance bill and then quickly reversed his vote to endorse it.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe voted against it. And then someone told him, \u2018Hey, you know, they are not going to like that in Iowa,\u2019\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Rubio said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFifteen, 20 minutes later, he came back and flipped his vote on that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz has said that he was confused about which bill he was voting on at the time.Mr. Rubio\u2019s criticism of Mr. Cruz was not new: He delivered several of the same lines against Mr. Cruz during the Republican debate last week. But he has since largely refrained from mocking Mr. Cruz by name on the campaign trail.

The Quinnipiac poll found that Mr. Sanders is seen as more honest and empathetic than Mrs. Clinton, and stronger on climate change and the economy. She is viewed as being more electable in a general election and stronger on foreign policy. Gender is also turning about to be a significant factor in how the candidates are performing, with men preferring Mr. Sanders by a margin of 61 percent to 30 percent. Women back Mrs. Clinton by a margin of 55 percent to 39 percent. Perhaps more worrying for Mrs. Clinton is the finding that a majority of New Hampshire voters said that their choice is set, while only 35 percent were completely decided two months ago.\u201cNew Hampshire Democratic preferences are getting baked in, with Sanders gaining the upper hand,\u201d Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, said in a statement. \u201cThe final question will be who does a better job at turning out their respective voting blocs.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Sanders is now leading Mrs. Clinton among all the major voting blocs in New Hampshire.

{"Headline": "Donald Trump Says He Favors Big Tariffs on Chinese Exports", "Date": "2016-01-07", "News": "Donald J. Trump said he would favor a 45 percent tariff on Chinese exports to the United States, proposing the idea during a wide-ranging meeting with members of the editorial board of The New York Times. Mr. Trump also spoke at length about the standoff with armed protesters who last Saturday seized the headquarters at a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon, suggesting that he would have called the leader of the group to try to make a deal to end it \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and would have acted against them if negotiations failed because \u201cyou cannot let people take over federal property.\u201d In addressing the trade imbalance with China, Mr. Trump addressed an issue that has been a focus of his speeches going back to 2011, when he considered running for president when President Obama was seeking re-election. In the editorial board meeting, which was held Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that the relationship with China needs to be restructured. \u201cThe only power that we have with China,\u201d Mr. Trump said, \u201cis massive trade.\u201d \u201cI would tax China on products coming in,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI would do a tariff, yes \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and they do it to us.\u201d Mr. Trump added that he\u2019s \u201ca free trader,\u201d but that \u201cit\u2019s got to be reasonably fair.\u201d \u201cI would do a tax. and the tax, let me tell you what the tax should be \u2026 the tax should be 45 percent,\u201d Mr. Trump said.China is on a path this year to surpass Canada as the biggest single trading partner of the United States, and its factories provide American consumers with lower-cost products ranging from clothing to computers, so such steep tariffs could hurt the pocketbooks of many Americans. In early November, Mr. Trump released a little-noticed plan about changing the United States economic dynamic with China. The tariff number was not featured in the plan, but Mr. Trump called for, among other proposals, pressing to give \u201cAmerican workers a level playing field\u201d to restore the manufacturing base.In addressing the Oregon standoff, Mr. Trump also spoke about the \u201cgreat anger out there\u201d that appears to be fueling the situation in Burns, Ore. \u201cI think what I\u2019d do, as president, is I would make a phone call to whoever, to the group,\u201d he said, adding later, \u201cI\u2019d talk to the leader. I would talk to him and I would say, \u2018You gotta get out \u00e2\u0080\u0094 come see me, but you gotta get out.'\u201d \u201cYou cannot let people take over federal property,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cYou can\u2019t, because once you do that, you don\u2019t have a government anymore. I think, frankly, they\u2019ve been there too long.\u201d Mr. Trump said he wasn\u2019t necessarily suggesting a large-scale military action, but that \u201cat a certain point you have to do something and you have to be firm and you have to be strong, you have to be a government.\u201d  An earlier version of this post misstated the day the editorial board meeting at The New York Times was held.

{"Headline": "When Philosophy Lost Its Way", "Date": "2016-01-11", "News": "The history of Western philosophy can be presented in a number of ways. It can be told in terms of periods \u00e2\u0080\u0094 ancient, medieval and modern. We can divide it into rival traditions (empiricism versus rationalism, analytic versus Continental), or into various core areas (metaphysics, epistemology, ethics). It can also, of course, be viewed through the critical lens of gender or racial exclusion, as a discipline almost entirely fashioned for and by white European men.Yet despite the richness and variety of these accounts, all of them pass over a momentous turning point: the locating of philosophy within a modern institution (the research university) in the late 19th century. This institutionalization of philosophy made it into a discipline that could be seriously pursued only in an academic setting. This fact represents one of the enduring failures of contemporary philosophy.Take this simple detail: Before its migration to the university, philosophy had never had a central home. Philosophers could be found anywhere \u00e2\u0080\u0094 serving as diplomats, living off pensions, grinding lenses, as well as within a university. Afterward, if they were \u00e2\u0080\u009cserious\u00e2\u0080\u009d thinkers, the expectation was that philosophers would inhabit the research university.\u00c2\u00a0Against the inclinations of Socrates, philosophers became experts like other disciplinary specialists. This occurred even as they taught their students the virtues of Socratic wisdom, which highlights the role of the philosopher as the non-expert, the questioner, the gadfly.The second event was the placing of philosophy as one more discipline alongside these sciences within the modern research university. A result was that philosophy, previously the queen of the disciplines, was displaced, as the natural and social sciences divided the world between them.This is not to claim that philosophy had reigned unchallenged before the 19th century. The role of philosophy had shifted across the centuries and in different countries. But philosophy in the sense of a concern about who we are and how we should live had formed the core of the university since the church schools of the 11th century. Before the development of a scientific research culture, conflicts among philosophy, medicine, theology and law consisted of internecine battles rather than clashes across yawning cultural divides. Indeed, these older fields were widely believed to hang together in a grand unity of knowledge \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a unity directed toward the goal of the good life. But this unity shattered under the weight of increasing specialization by the turn of the 20th century.Early 20th-century philosophers thus faced an existential quandary: With the natural and social sciences mapping out the entirety of both theoretical as well as institutional space, what role was there for philosophy? A number of possibilities were available: Philosophers could serve as 1) synthesizers of academic knowledge production; 2) formalists who provided the logical undergirding for research across the academy; 3) translators who brought the insights of the academy to the world at large; 4) disciplinary specialists who focused on distinctively philosophical problems in ethics, epistemology, aesthetics and the like; or 5) as some combination of some or all of these.This was the act of purification that gave birth to the concept of philosophy most of us know today. As a result, and to a degree rarely acknowledged, the institutional imperative of the university has come to drive the theoretical agenda. If philosophy was going to have a secure place in the academy, it needed its own discrete domain, its own arcane language, its own standards of success and its own specialized concerns.Our claim, then, can be put simply: Philosophy should never have been purified. Rather than being seen as a problem, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdirty hands\u00e2\u0080\u009d should have been understood as the native condition of philosophic thought \u00e2\u0080\u0094 present everywhere, often interstitial, essentially interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary in nature. Philosophy is a mangle. The philosopher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands were never clean and were never meant to be.There is another layer to this story. The act of purification accompanying the creation of the modern research university was not just about differentiating realms of knowledge. It was also about divorcing knowledge from virtue. Though it seems foreign to us now, before purification the philosopher (and natural philosopher) was assumed to be morally superior to other sorts of people. The 18th-century thinker Joseph Priestley wrote \u00e2\u0080\u009ca Philosopher ought to be something greater and better than another man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Philosophy, understood as the love of wisdom, was seen as a vocation, like the priesthood. It required significant moral virtues (foremost among these were integrity and selflessness), and the pursuit of wisdom in turn further inculcated those virtues. The study of philosophy elevated those who pursued it. Knowing and being good were intimately linked. It was widely understood that the point of philosophy was to become good rather than simply to collect or produce knowledge.An anthology of essays from The Times\u2019s philosophy series, published by Liveright.As the historian Steven Shapin has noted, the rise of disciplines in the 19th century changed all this. The implicit democracy of the disciplines ushered in an age of \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe moral equivalence of the scientist\u00e2\u0080\u009d to everyone else. The scientist\u2019s privileged role was to provide the morally neutral knowledge needed to achieve our goals, whether good or evil. This put an end to any notion that there was something uplifting about knowledge. The purification made it no longer sensible to speak of nature, including human nature, in terms of purposes and functions. By the late 19th century, Kierkegaard and Nietzsche had proved the failure of philosophy to establish any shared standard for choosing one way of life over another. This is how Alasdair MacIntyre explained philosophy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s contemporary position of insignificance in society and marginality in the academy. There was a brief window when philosophy could have replaced religion as the glue of society; but the moment passed. People stopped listening as philosophers focused on debates among themselves.Once knowledge and goodness were divorced, scientists could be regarded as experts, but there are no morals or lessons to be drawn from their work. Science derives its authority from impersonal structures and methods, not the superior character of the scientist. The individual scientist is no different from the average Joe; he or she has, as Shapin has written, \u00e2\u0080\u009cno special authority to pronounce on what ought to be done.\u00e2\u0080\u009d For many, science became a paycheck, and the scientist became a \u00e2\u0080\u009cde-moralized\u00e2\u0080\u009d tool enlisted in the service of power, bureaucracy and commerce.Here, too, philosophy has aped the sciences by fostering a culture that might be called \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe genius contest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Philosophic activity devolved into a contest to prove just how clever one can be in creating or destroying arguments. Today, a hyperactive productivist churn of scholarship keeps philosophers chained to their computers. Like the sciences, philosophy has largely become a technical enterprise, the only difference being that we manipulate words rather than genes or chemicals. Lost is the once common-sense notion that philosophers are seeking the good life \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that we ought to be (in spite of our failings) model citizens and human beings. Having become specialists, we have lost sight of the whole. The point of philosophy now is to be smart, not good. It has been the heart of our undoing.More From Fixes \u00bbMore From Private Lives \u00bbMore From Couch \u00bbMore From The Stone \u00bbMore From Moviegoers \u00bbMore From The End \u00bbMore From Draft \u00bbMore From Anxiety \u00bbMore From Menagerie \u00bbMore From Disunion \u00bbMore From Bedside \u00bbMore From The Conversation \u00bbMore From The Great Divide \u00bbMore From Errol Morris \u00bbFollowAdvertisement"}

It comes two days after President Obama announced in a tearful East Room speech his intent to expand background checks for gun purchasers and to strengthen enforcement of existing gun laws.Many of the efforts are \u00e2\u0080\u009cguidance\u00e2\u0080\u009d for federal agencies, not binding regulations, and some rely on funding increases that a Republican-led Congress is certain to reject.Despite how modest these efforts may prove, Republican presidential candidates and congressional leaders greeted them with protests and angry claims of a \u00e2\u0080\u009cgun grab\u00e2\u0080\u009d that would violate Second Amendment rights.Whether that kind of reaction will be on display Thursday night is anybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s guess. Shimrit Sheetrit, a CNN spokeswoman, said in an email that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe audience will be a mix of guests with pro- and anti-gun views, as well as people whose lives have been changed by guns.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Earnest said he expected the discussion to be civil.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe president is hopeful that he can have an enlightening discussion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.Mr. Earnest said that some of those attending Thursday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s event had received invitations from the White House.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve consulted with CNN about who will be in the audience, but ultimately it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CNN who is making the call,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Earnest said. \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

Biden Jr. called the Republican presidential primary campaign on Thursday \u201ca gift from the Lord,\u201d drawing hoots of laughter from House Democrats gathered here for three days of strategy sessions. Mr. Biden, in a lunchtime speech, seemed to be feeling especially grateful for his Republican colleagues, and told Democratic lawmakers that the G.O.P. was making the 2016 campaign easier for them in several ways. First, Mr. Biden focused on the new House speaker, Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, who has been one of his party\u2019s main spokesmen on fiscal issues for years. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t apologize for what we are for, and we should point out what they are for,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cPaul Ryan is a lovely guy. He gave us such a gift. He passed the Ryan budget.\u201d The room erupted in laughter, but Mr. Biden said he wasn\u2019t kidding. \u201cNo, no, no, no, no,\u201d he said. \u201cI am being deadly earnest. You guys don\u2019t have to make anything up.\u201d Democrats laughed even louder.  Mr. Ryan\u2019s fiscal blueprints, of which he is proud, include drastic cuts to Social Security and Medicare, and sweeping tax cuts, many that would benefit the wealthiest Americans. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to make this up,\u201d Mr. Biden added. \u201cIt\u2019s real. It\u2019s what they passed.\u201d But the vice president drew his biggest laughs when he turned to the Republican presidential contest. \u201cBy the way, we may have been given a gift from the Lord in the presidential race,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cI don\u2019t know who to root for more \u2014 Cruz, Bush or what\u2019s that guy\u2019s name?\u201d Asked later about Mr. Biden\u2019s remarks, the House Democratic leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, said she missed the comment on the presidential race because she was focused on the poke at Mr. Ryan. \u201cI was still probably enjoying his remark before about the Ryan budget being a gift and what it does, because it offers the clearest contrast,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said. Still, Ms. Pelosi noted that some Republican candidates seemed easier for Democrats to run against. \u201cThere\u2019s no question there are some candidates that seem to have more, shall we say, a place we can make a stronger contrast,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said. \u201cAlthough all of them are starkly different from our Democratic candidates, and we are very proud of our Democratic candidates.\u201d Pressed about the candidacy of Donald J. Trump, Ms. Pelosi said she had met him but did not expect to be working with him anytime soon. \u201cThe president is the president. We work with the president,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said. \u201cI am a courteous polite person, so I can work with almost everyone.\u201d But, she added, \u201cI expect to be working with a Democrat as president of the United States.\u201d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Everybody\u2019s a Critic. And That\u2019s How It Should Be.", "Date": "2016-01-30", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisNEXT month, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will complete its annual ritual of designating the best in two dozen cinematic categories. The Oscars have come under fire this year for the predictable, shameful racial homogeneity of their nominations, but that is not the only reason to complain.Meanwhile, the pantheon of all-time great films is largely a roster of the snubbed, from \u201cCitizen Kane\u201d to \u201cDo the Right Thing\u201d to \u201cBoyhood.\u201d The best film in any given year is almost guaranteed to be one that didn\u2019t win, or one that wasn\u2019t nominated at all.That much is obvious. The Oscars are silly. Why should we suppose that 6,000 members of an insular and entitled professional association would be reliable judges of quality? A show-business oligarchy can\u2019t seriously be in the business of legislating taste.But neither can the public. Box-office data is hardly an answer to industry-insider cluelessness. \u201cAvatar\u201d has made more money than any other movie ever, but does anyone think that makes it the best movie of all time?Then again: Who am I to talk? I make my living sorting, ranking and judging movies, part of a professional guild devoted, precisely, to the legislation of taste and the denomination of excellence. If the academy is out of touch, what does that make me? A dinosaur. A stagecoach driver in the age of Uber. An old man yelling at a cloud.On the Internet, everyone is a critic \u2014 a Yelp-fueled takedown artist, an Amazon scholar, a cheerleader empowered by social media to Like and to Share. The inflated, always suspect authority of ink-stained wretches like me has been leveled by digital anarchy. Who needs a cranky nag when you have a friendly algorithm telling you, based on your previous purchases, that there is something You May Also Like, and legions of Facebook friends affirming the wisdom of your choice?The days of the all-powerful critic are over. But that figure \u2014 high priest or petty dictator, destroying and consecrating reputations with the stroke of a pen \u2014 was always a bit of a myth, an allegorical monster conjured up by timid artists and their insecure admirers. Criticism has always been a fundamentally democratic undertaking. It is an endless conversation, rather than a series of pronouncements. It is the debate that begins when you walk out of the theater or the museum, either with your friends or in the private chat room of your own head. It\u2019s not me telling you what to think; it\u2019s you and me talking. That was true before the Internet, but the rise of social media has had the thrilling, confusing effect of making the conversation literal.Like every other form of democracy, criticism is a messy, contentious business, in which the rules are as much in dispute as the outcomes and the philosophical foundations are fragile if not vaporous. We all like different things. Each of us is blessed with a snowflake-special consciousness, an apparatus of pleasure and perception that is ours alone. But we also cluster together in communities of taste that can be as prickly and polarized as the other tribes with which we identify. We are protective of our pleasures, and resent it when anyone tries to mock or mess with them.Obsessives and dilettantes, omnivores and geeks, highbrow and low, we are more likely to seek affirmation than challenge. Some people love opera. Others love hip-hop. Quite a few are interested in both. \u201cIt\u2019s all good!\u201d you might say. But you don\u2019t believe that, any more than I do. Some of it is terrible. There is, axiomatically, no disputing taste, and also no accounting for it.Or maybe that\u2019s just me. This newspaper, after all, pays me to turn my personal impressions of movies into persuasive arguments \u2014 not only to share my feelings about movies but also to assess them and provide some useful counsel to readers. So it might seem as if I\u2019m setting out here to make a self-serving point. Don\u2019t trust the Hollywood insiders who control the Oscars! Ignore the quantified peer pressure of Rotten Tomatoes or Box Office Mojo! Listen to me!And sure: I do have a stake in defending the relevance of my own job, even as I grant that it\u2019s kind of a ridiculous way to pay the rent. Critics are sometimes appreciated \u2014 or even, in rare cases, admired, like Roger Ebert \u2014 but we are more often feared, resented or ignored altogether. In the popular mind, critics are haters and killjoys. Maybe we\u2019re sadists, like the viperous, martini-swilling New York Times theater reviewer in \u201cBirdman.\u201d Or maybe we\u2019re masochists: In spite of that cruel caricature, \u201cBirdman,\u201d an Oscar best picture, is \u201cCertified Fresh\u201d by Rotten Tomatoes (I think it\u2019s vastly overrated, by the way, but that\u2019s just my opinion).The ability of critics to make a living may be precarious, but criticism remains an indispensable activity. The making of art \u2014 popular or fine, abstruse or accessible, sacred or profane \u2014 is one of the glories of our species. We are uniquely endowed with the capacity to fashion representations of the world and our experience in it, to tell stories and draw pictures, to organize sound into music and movement into dance. Just as miraculously, we have the ability, even the obligation, to judge what we have made, to argue about why we are moved, mystified, delighted or bored by any of it. At least potentially, we are all artists. And because we have the ability to recognize and respond to the creativity of others, we are all, at least potentially, critics, too.This means, above all, that our job is to think. As consumers of culture, we are lulled into passivity or, at best, prodded toward a state of pseudo-semi-self-awareness, encouraged toward either the defensive group identity of fandom or a shallow, half-ironic eclecticism. We graze, we binge, we pick up and discard aesthetic experiences as if they were cheap toys. Which they frequently are \u2014 mass-produced widgets from the corporate assembly line.Meanwhile, in our roles as citizens of the political commonwealth we are conscripted into a polarized climate of ideological belligerence. Bluster substitutes for argument. Important political divisions are at once magnified and trivialized. There is little room for doubt and scant time for reflection as we find ourselves buffeted by sensation and opinion.How do we sort through it all? How do we manage the prodigious too-muchness of the demands on our attention? The incentives not to think \u2014 to be one of the many available varieties of stupid \u2014 are powerful. But there is also genius around us, and within us. There is \u201cHamilton\u201d and \u201cTo Pimp a Butterfly,\u201d \u201cTransparent\u201d and the novels of Elena Ferrante. Take your pick! Make your case!We are far too inclined to regard art as a frivolous, ornamental undertaking and to perceive taste as a fixed, narrow track along which we stumble, alone or in like-minded company. At the same time, we too often seek to subordinate the creative, pleasure-giving aspects of our lives to supposedly more consequential areas of experience, stuffing the aesthetic dimensions of existence into the boxes that hold our religious beliefs, our political dogmas or our moral certainties. We belittle art. We aggrandize nonsense. We can\u2019t see beyond the horizon of our own conventional wisdom.Enough of that! It\u2019s the mission of art to free our minds, and the task of criticism to figure out what to do with that freedom. That everyone is a critic means that we are each capable of thinking against our own prejudices, of balancing skepticism with open-mindedness, of sharpening our dulled and glutted senses and battling the intellectual inertia that surrounds us. We need to put our remarkable minds to use and to pay our own experience the honor of taking it seriously.The real culture war (the one that never ends) is between the human intellect and its equally human enemies: sloth, clich\u00e9, pretension, cant. Between creativity and conformity, between the comforts of the familiar and the shock of the new. To be a critic is to be a soldier in this fight, a defender of the life of art and a champion of the art of living.It\u2019s not just a job, in other words.A.O.

And I\u2019ve lived a good life.\u201dSupporters of the anti-government occupiers identified Mr. Finicum as the man who was shot and killed by law enforcement on Tuesday as the group\u2019s leader, Ammon Bundy, his brother Ryan and other protesters were arrested after being stopped on a rural highway.Many of the details surrounding Mr. Finicum\u2019s death remained unclear on Wednesday, including how the confrontation had played out and which agency had fired the shot, but supporters of the occupation at Malheur National Wildlife Refuge were already going online to lionize Mr. Finicum as a martyr.A post on the Facebook page of the Bundy Ranch, which has been providing videos and a stream of updates throughout the nearly monthlong occupation, said: \u201cLaVoy has left us, but his sacrifice will never be far from the lips of those who love liberty. You cannot defeat us. Our blood is seed.\u201dMr. Finicum, with his hat and sunburned skin, was one of the most recognizable faces of the occupation. He gave interviews under a blue tarp, and appeared beside Ammon Bundy during the first news conferences in early January, when the group discussed why the unoccupied federal buildings had been seized. They voiced support for two local ranchers who had been sentenced to prison for burning federal lands, and spoke of their belief that such lands should be returned to local ranchers and local governments.Mr. Finicum was friends with Cliven Bundy, the Nevada rancher and father of Ammon and Ryan, who drew national attention for leading a 2014 standoff with the federal government over illegal grazing on public lands. When the Bundy-led crew traveled to Oregon to protest the prison sentences for the two ranchers, Mr. Finicum was with them.An armed protest at a remote federal wildlife refuge was the latest flare-up in a decades-long struggle over control of federal land.Mr. Finicum would stride through the occupied reserve speaking of federal tyranny and the children he had left behind to come to Oregon. His ranch, he would say, was in the care of his youngest daughter, who is 17.He eagerly defied rules at the Oregon refuge, rushing to rip out a fence he said had oppressed local ranchers, and sifting through Native American artifacts he said were being mishandled.In a telephone interview, Robert Finicum, LaVoy\u2019s third child and eldest son, described his family as close and his father as loving. He said that he found out about his father\u2019s death through texts and phone calls, but that the family still did not have a clear picture of what had happened.\u201cHe is very, very passionate about freedom, and this is a fight that he\u2019s been fighting for quite some time,\u201d Robert, a 30-year-old officer in the Utah National Guard, said about his father. \u201cI mean from my point of view \u2014 it\u2019s hard. I can agree with so much of his cause, and sure, I wish that it had happened a little bit differently. I wish that they wouldn\u2019t have occupied that building, even though there was nobody there. Because I imagine he would still be with us had that not happened.\u201dHe continued: \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it should have ever escalated to this. I was very pleased that it hadn\u2019t. I was worried that something like this might happen.\u201dHe said his current concern was with retrieving his father\u2019s body \u201cto get him a proper burial.\u201dOne snowy Saturday night less than week into the occupation, a reporter knocked on the door of one of the refuge buildings, and LaVoy Finicum answered. He had a pistol on his hip, a knife in his belt and ring of gold bullets around his waist. He then sat at a refuge employee\u2019s desk and talked about the motives for the occupation.\u201cIt\u2019s about freedom for all of us,\u201d he said, \u201cand so I cross the Rubicon and I came here.\u201d In a video last Friday posted to the Bundy Ranch Facebook page, he was as defiant as ever in saying that he would not leave.\u201cWe are not going anywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are here to do a job and we\u2019re committed, we\u2019re determined.\u201dJulie Turkewitz reported from John Day, and Jack Healy from Denver.Advertisement"}

If the state ever allows me to be a father, will my children grow up learning how to drive? Or are smart cars going to be the new norm?All of that said, Uber\u2019s role here is interesting. The company has opted to research all of its tech in-house rather than, say, pairing up with an automaker as Lyft did. Perhaps that\u2019s to keep the research proprietary instead of sharing it with companies like G.M., which could become far more adversarial with Uber down the line. (For now, Uber has struck uneasy partnerships with automakers, helping drivers finance car purchases with certain discounts.)The advent of this type of technology could also affect the cost and implementation of auto insurance \u2014 something that ride-sharing companies like Uber could certainly benefit from.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "David Bowie Allowed His Art to Deliver a Final Message", "Date": "2016-01-11", "News": "Supported byDavid Bowie, 1947-2016At the same time, it turns out, he was telling everyone through his art.James C. Nicola, the artistic director of New York Theater Workshop, where \u201cLazarus\u201d runs through Jan. 20, said, \u201cWhat seemed not too long ago intriguingly complicated, ambiguous and opaque now seems pretty clear: a man who was yearning for immortality.\u201dDuring his life, Mr. Bowie pushed his music relentlessly forward while reinventing himself as many personas \u2014 from Davie Jones, a young rhythm and blues singer from the London neighborhood of Brixton, to the interplanetary pop star Ziggy Stardust and the dapper hedonist the Thin White Duke. He explored androgyny and otherworldliness, and sampled cultures from different continents (and galaxies) as his musical and visual palettes continued to evolve, always theatrical and deeply layered until his focus turned to his own looming end.But while laying bare his demons for an audience, Mr. Bowie kept much of his life private, even after his death. Mr. Bowie\u2019s family and representatives have opted not to disclose what kind of cancer he had, or where he died, preferring to let the icon speak, however abstractly, through the thinly veiled characters in his work, all versions of himself.\u201cThe production of \u2018Lazarus,\u2019 and also this new album, \u2018Blackstar,\u2019 when you look at them both, you find so many lines and phrases that meant so much more than people knew before today,\u201d said Ivo van Hove, the musical\u2019s director, who was one of a handful of collaborators with knowledge of Mr. Bowie\u2019s condition. \u201cIt\u2019s like two testaments,\u201d he said.The singer\u2019s recent collaborators described his work ethic as tireless throughout his last phase, which included simultaneous work on the album, its accompanying videos and the theater production, a nontraditional sequel to \u201cThe Man Who Fell to Earth,\u201d the novel that inspired his 1976 film.Mr. van Hove said that Mr. Bowie told him he was sick in November 2014, via Skype, when the show was in its early stages, but requested the information remain strictly confidential. (The director said in a Dutch radio interview on Monday that Mr. Bowie had liver cancer.)\u201cIt was immediately clear it was very serious,\u201d Mr. van Hove said, though he kept his word and did not tell the cast \u2014 including Michael C. Hall, who stars as the extraterrestrial Bowie stand-in, Thomas Newton: \u201cConfidential is confidential.\u201d\u201cIt was very strange,\u201d Mr. van Hove said of trying to convey Mr. Bowie\u2019s intentions. Citing the title track, he continued: \u201cThe song is a man in total distress, and then finding a way out, in his imagination, so he could still be alive, in freedom, as a bluebird. It\u2019s the message of the whole show.\u201dWhile \u201cLazarus\u201d was already in the works before the diagnosis, its themes were appropriate: \u201cIt\u2019s a very existential drama about why are we here, what does it mean, is there something after we are gone?\u201d Mr. van Hove said.On Monday, outside a Manhattan recording studio where the actors from \u201cLazarus\u201d were scheduled to record the cast album, Mr. Hall said of Mr. Bowie, \u201cHe was a very private person \u2014 it wasn\u2019t something he announced to any of us.\u201d\u201cHis passing certainly informs the experience of this recording session and will inform the experience of performing the show as we continue to do it,\u201d Mr. Hall continued, adding that he was \u201cin a state of awe\u201d at Mr. Bowie\u2019s closing run of releases.Of the \u201cLazarus\u201d music video, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s obviously made by a man who knows what he\u2019s up against and is turning it into something so vital and profound.\u201dMr. McCaslin said he recorded with Mr. Bowie \u201cessentially from 11 to 4 every day\u201d in early 2015 during his illness. The musicians were in the studio, often playing in the same small room, about one week a month from January to March. \u201cWhat I didn\u2019t know is that he was then going to Henry Hey\u2019s place and working on \u2018Lazarus,\u2019 \u201d Mr. McCaslin said, referring to the show\u2019s music director.Mr. Bowie \u201cwas just living life to its fullest \u2014 fully engaged in the moment, fully engaged in his art,\u201d Mr. McCaslin added through tears.Tim Lefebvre, who played bass on \u201cBlackstar,\u201d said: \u201cI don\u2019t know where he found the strength. It\u2019s amazing.\u201dDespite the recording sessions becoming \u201cpretty intimate, pretty quick,\u201d Mr. Lefebvre added, \u201cIt never looked to us like he was sick. He was just coming in and singing his ass off.\u201dTony Visconti, Mr. Bowie\u2019s most constant collaborator since \u201cSpace Oddity\u201d in 1969, described \u201cBlackstar\u201d as the singer\u2019s \u201cparting gift.\u201d Its finale, \u201cI Can\u2019t Give Everything Away,\u201d includes the lines: \u201cI know something is very wrong/The pulse returns for prodigal sons/The blackout\u2019s hearts with flowered news/With skull designs upon my shoes.\u201d\u201cDavid always did it his way and his way was the least obvious way,\u201d Mr. Visconti said. \u201cHis death was no different from his life \u2014 a work of Art,\u201d he added in a statement on Facebook. \u201cI knew for a year this was the way it would be. I wasn\u2019t, however, prepared for it.\u201dHe described a friendship mostly relegated to online correspondence in recent years: \u201cI received an email from him seven days ago,\u201d Mr. Eno wrote. \u201cIt was as funny as always, and as surreal, looping through word games and allusions and all the usual stuff we did. It ended with this sentence: \u2018Thank you for our good times, brian. they will never rot.\u2019 And it was signed \u2018Dawn.\u2019 I realize now he was saying goodbye.\u201dRobert Fox, a British producer who helped finance the show and knew about Mr. Bowie\u2019s illness, added, \u201cEven if he wasn\u2019t in the room, he was on the telephone, he was on Skype, he was on FaceTime, or wherever he could be to be involved.\u201dBut Mr. van Hove said that on opening night, Mr. Bowie was \u201cvery fragile. I knew that evening \u2014 I felt it deeply \u2014 that this would be the last time I see him.\u201d A frail but pleased Mr. Bowie took in the show, greeted the cast and even appeared on stage, beaming in a T-shirt and blazer, for a curtain call. He was too tired to make the after-party.Nate Chinen and Andrew Chow contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Migrant Influx in Germany Raises Fears of Anti-Semitism", "Date": "2016-01-26", "News": "Supported byLetter From EuropeBERLIN \u2014 These days, all talk here is of the ramifications of taking in more than one million asylum seekers who arrived over the past year.Many of the migrants are Muslim and from countries with a deep antipathy toward Israel, leading to a worried discussion about the degree to which some refugees may have brought anti-Semitic attitudes with them. This stoked existing fears among Jews here, who believe anti-Semitism is already on the rise, along with support for far-right movements.The concern is apparently so great that Chancellor Angela Merkel, without specifically mentioning the Muslim influx, addressed anti-Jewish feeling head-on in her latest weekly podcast.\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d she said, \u201canti-Semitism is more widespread than we naturally imagine. And so we must confront it.\u201dThe Central Council of Jews in Germany counts just over 100,000 members \u2014 compared with the estimated 520,000 Jews in Germany in early 1933. In the quarter-century since German reunification, Israelis and Jews have flocked to Berlin, where some 45,000 Jews are now said to live.Mr. Blumenthal, born and raised in and around Berlin before his family fled the Nazis, is among the many Americans who have praised Ms. Merkel for welcoming refugees.Yet even before the migrant influx, synagogues, Jewish schools and other organizations operated only under constant police protection. And now, there is apprehension over the arrival of hundreds of thousands of Muslims raised in countries where anti-Semitism and anti-Israeli sentiment are more virulent than in Turkey, the country of origin for most of Germany\u2019s perhaps four million Muslims.As Salomon Korn, the head of Frankfurt\u2019s Jewish community, put it in a public discussion this month: With the new arrivals, \u201cwe must operate on the assumption that they have a different relationship to Jews than the Muslims who have lived here to date.\u201dThere have been no reports of anti-Semitic attacks by recently arrived migrants.Even before the tide of migrants, some Jews worried that anti-Jewish sentiment was again becoming acceptable.\u201c \u2018I am a Jew,\u2019 I said. \u2018So you want to murder me?\u2019 \u2018In that case, yes,\u2019 came the answer,\u201d Ms. Anthony said.\u201cIt cannot be left to the Jews alone\u201d to fight anti-Semitism, she added.Reached three days later, Ms. Anthony was surprised by how many people praised what they called her courage.\u201cI find it really bad,\u201d she said, \u201cif we have to say in Germany that it is courageous to say that one is Jewish.\u201dMs. Anthony said she did not practice her religion; she acknowledges her Jewishness but has never advertised it. She expressed concern that politicians were content with lofty speeches that missed the reality on the ground.An appeal on Jan. 18 resulted in stiffer sentences but did not acknowledge that anti-Semitism was involved, said Leonid Goldberg, a leader of the Jewish community in Wuppertal. \u201cIt is nothing less than an invitation to all others to behave the same,\u201d he said.And with all the new Muslim arrivals, it will get worse, he feared.\u201cThey won\u2019t change just because they live in Germany,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Flamboyant Egyptian Politician Craves Public Eye ", "Date": "2016-01-16", "News": "Supported byCAIRO \u2014 Mortada Mansour, a pugnacious Egyptian politician, likes to boast that he beats his rivals with his shoe \u2014\u00a0so much, in fact, that he has lost count of the number of disputes he has settled in that manner. \u201cI ran out of shoes,\u201d said Mr. Mansour, who once spent time in jail for insulting a judge.That provocative style has made Mr. Mansour a darling of Egypt\u2019s gossipy television talk shows. But it led to an uproar in the new Parliament on Jan. 10 when Mr. Mansour refused to take the prescribed constitutional oath, saying he disliked the wording, drawing shouted rebukes from other lawmakers that plunged the session into chaos. The turmoil abated when Mr. Mansour reluctantly mumbled the correct words. But to many Egyptians who watched with a mix of fascination and dismay on television, it only confirmed their low expectations of the new Parliament, which is fragmented, weak and heavily tilted in favor of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.Newspapers lampooned the proceedings, in which lawmakers were seen taking selfies and waving to the cameras, and which one normally pro-Sisi television host derided as a \u201ccircus.\u201d One veteran lawmaker tendered his resignation in protest; others voted to cut the live transmission of proceedings. In contrast, outside Parliament\u2019s gates, Egyptian security forces were rounding up opposition activists in advance of an anniversary on Jan. 25 that, to some at least, represents the bitter failings of Egypt\u2019s turbulent political trajectory.That date marks the start of the 2011 revolution that led to the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak and, two years later, the arrival of Mr. Sisi after a military takeover that ousted President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood from power. This year, however, Mr. Sisi has repeatedly warned that no public protest will be tolerated.On the ground, though, there is little sign of major demonstrations in the works. The news media is largely supportive of Mr. Sisi, and since 2013 tens of thousands of people have been imprisoned \u2014 supporters of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood but also civil society activists and journalists. Instead the political space is dominated by the new Parliament, whose first task is to review 340 laws passed since January 2014, and which is filled with staunch pro-Sisi figures like Mr. Mansour.A jurist by training, Mr. Mansour has long relished his role in the public eye. Over the decades, he has clashed with public figures as diverse as judges, soccer fans and belly dancers. His favored platform is in the courts, where he has filed and been the subject of numerous lawsuits, and television, where he makes forceful if often lurid pronouncements against his rivals. Some are accused of being C.I.A. agents, others are subject to insults based on their appearance. (In an interview, he described former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as having \u201cthe legs of a goat.\u201d) Last year another lawyer successfully prosecuted him for libel. His public reputation soared two years ago when he was elected chairman of the Zamalek Sports Club, a cherished century-old institution in Cairo that hosts one of the country\u2019s most popular soccer teams. Mr. Mansour oversaw a major renovation of the club\u2019s facilities but became embroiled in a bitter confrontation with the soccer team\u2019s hard-core fan base, known as ultras, who at one point threw urine in his face. (He claimed it was acid.)Critics have painted Mr. Mansour as a booster for Mr. Mubarak, and accused him of organizing an infamous camel charge against anti-Mubarak protesters massed in Tahrir Square. (The case against him collapsed in court.) In an interview at Zamalek Sports Club, seated before a giant portrait of himself, Mr. Mansour insisted that he was no Mubarak supporter, yet also made it clear that he detested the events that led to his ouster five years ago \u2014\u00a0a commonly held position among Mr. Sisi\u2019s supporters. He refused the constitutional oath this past week, he said, because it described the 2011 protests as a \u201crevolution.\u201d \u201cA revolution has to have a leader,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was simply the biggest chaos in history.\u201d Egypt\u2019s real revolution, he added, was the military takeover that brought Mr. Sisi to power in 2013.He is also a vocal proponent of unlikely if common theories in Egypt that President Obama and the United States, despite $1.3 billion in annual aid to Mr. Sisi\u2019s government, are secretly conspiring to bring the Muslim Brotherhood into power.\u201cWe hate Obama because he\u2019s a liar and hypocrite,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who sponsored Al Qaeda until it turned against him. Now the United States wants the Muslim Brotherhood to rule Egypt.\u201dHe spoke in an office overlooking a complex of newly built swimming pools and cafes filled with families. Around him sat supporters, some clad in track suits, who cheered or laughed at his more provocative opinions.Mr. Mansour\u2019s brash manner and absurdist statements have paid rich electoral dividends: Both he and his son, Ahmed, have been elected to Parliament. Last week he became head of a committee responsible for reviewing human rights laws introduced under Mr. Sisi. The committee approved all eight laws in just one session, Mr. Mansour said.Analysts say they do not expect Parliament to oppose any of the tough laws on terrorism, political protest or freedom of expression. But laws on Civil Service reform and investment, which touch on the political or financial interests of leading lawmakers, may receive sharper scrutiny, and even risk being rejected.If Mr. Mansour continues on the human rights committee, he is likely to play a prominent role in shaping a proposed law to regulate, and likely curtail, the activities of foreign aid organizations in Egypt. But his immediate concern is countering the young Egyptians, many openly disillusioned with politics, who mock him on Facebook, a medium he describes as a \u201cgutter of filth.\u201d\u201cThis is the youth that are wearing tight pants and taking money from their fathers and taking 15 years to graduate from college,\u201d he said. \u201cThey smoke pot. They insult their girlfriends on Facebook. They have no value in this country.\u201dAmina Ismail contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Words Unwired ", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "Supported byCritic\u2019s TakeWhat\u2019s the point of a literary magazine today? That\u2019s a question I heard a lot five years ago, when my colleagues and I decided to relaunch The Paris Review.At the time print quarterlies didn\u2019t exactly look like a going concern. The journals we\u2019d grown up on had folded or seemed to be on life support. Every month brought word that another bookstore had closed. Social media was held up as the new literary community, and the Kindle was king. Print, we heard again and again, was dead.Worse, if you talked to editors, writers and teachers off the record, you encountered a consensus \u2014 or at least a prevalent view \u2014 that American literature itself was in decline. Short stories especially: Nobody actually wanted to read them. Nobody was learning how to write them. The savviest M.F.A. students were pouring their energies into fat historical novels \u2014 and their Facebook pages. When I told my sister I was quitting my job as a book editor to edit a magazine of stories and poems, she looked as if I\u2019d said I was running away to join the circus: a tiny, doomed, irrelevant circus.Five years later I won\u2019t say all that has changed. But things look slightly different. We spend more time than ever on our devices, but it seems fair to say we like them less, especially when it comes to reading. E-book sales have plateaued. Bookstores have staged a modest resurgence. Turning off your phone has become a prized luxury. Over these last few years all of us, readers and writers alike, have developed a growing appreciation for what the Internet wants to take away: our time alone with the written word.As the poet Nick Laird recently observed, \u201cthe Internet \u2014 with its endless choice, its banner ads, its I.M.s and GIFs and Vines \u2014 is a disastrous locale\u201d for most poetry. \u201cDoes anything less than the immediately shocking or charming get attention? .\u2008.\u2008. Trying to hear the tonally complex voice of a complicated poem is like trying to hear a moth in a hurricane \u2014 and all the time the hurricane is screaming that there are a billion other things you could be doing.\u201dThe same goes for complicated fiction. There is a sound I hear in lots of \u201cliterary\u201d stories and novels today, not just the ones that come to me on submission, but published work too. It\u2019s the sound of fingers on a keyboard. When I\u2019m supposed to hear the voice of a narrator, or see a family around a dinner table, what I\u2019m actually aware of is the author pushing a product, specifically, the image of the writer at work, doing his or her best to shock and charm.Method actors like to talk about something called \u201cpublic solitude\u201d \u2014 that is, the ability to seem alone onstage. Really, to be alone, without wondering how you look to the audience. They will tell you this is the basis of naturalistic acting: to forget about the audience. Only then can you build a character, pay attention to others onstage and act out a scene.To write a story also requires public solitude. You can\u2019t be worrying how you sound. You can\u2019t wonder whether you or your characters are likable or smart or interesting. You have to be inside the scene \u2014 the tactile world of tables and chairs and sunlight \u2014 attending to your characters, people who exist for you in nonvirtual reality. This takes weird brain chemistry. (A surprising number of novelists hear voice, and not metaphorically. They hear voice in their heads.) It also takes years of reading \u2014 solitary reading.For all these reasons, writing fiction is pretty much the opposite of writing a good tweet, or curating an Instagram feed. It\u2019s the opposite of the personal-\u00ad\u00ad\u00adslash-professional writing that is now part of our everyday lives. More than ever, we need writers who are unprofessional, whose private worlds come first. Surely this has something to do with the wild success of immersive, multivolume imports like \u201cMy Struggle\u201d and Elena Ferrante\u2019s Neapolitan tetralogy.I think it must have something to do with the small renaissance we\u2019ve seen in American letters. And it has been a renaissance. Five years ago Ben Lerner, \u00adAtticus Lish and Ottessa Moshfegh had yet to publish any fiction. John Jeremiah Sullivan had yet to publish a book of essays or Rowan Ricardo Phillips a collection of poems. These and dozens of other young writers have found shelter in the Paris Review. What\u2019s more, they\u2019ve found an audience. In the past five years our circulation has nearly doubled. The review has more print readers now than ever in its 62-year history.The reason seems plain to me. By writing offline, literally and metaphorically, this new generation of writers gives us the intimacy, the assurance of their solitude. They let us read the word \u201cI\u201d and feel that it\u2019s not attached to a product. They let us read an essay, or a stanza, and feel the silence around it \u2014 the actual, physical stillness of a body when it\u2019s deep in thought. It can\u2019t be faked, in life or on the page. We see the opposite all around us every day, but to me, that kind of writing matters now more than ever before, \u2014 precisely because it\u2019s become so hard to do.Lorin Stein is the editor of \u201cThe Unprofessionals: New American Writing From The Paris Review.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "Lagos is an African megacity humming with chaotic energy. Potholed roads and even the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s superhighways are crowded with traffic, overloaded vendors, earsplitting noise, choking pollution, piercing colors and powerful smells. Extreme wealth is set against a backdrop of grinding poverty, hope battles despair, daily acts of kindness and generosity are offset by cruelty, greed and corruption, and creativity is inspired by necessity because of the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s broken infrastructure and the looming threat of ruin. Between these extremes, and usually to the background drone of a generator, exist the rich and textured lives of some 20 million people.Our past coverage of the LagosPhoto Festival.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is easy to expect the book to be representative of Lagos, but it\u2019s really a chronological sequence of the work we have done with the festival over the years, and not a book about Lagos,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the festival founder and director Azu Nwagbogu said.As such, it mirrors the evolution from the festival\u00e2\u0080\u0099s early days of African photographers telling African stories to more expansive conceptual work, and the inclusion of projects that were rarely seen in Africa, like the Dutch photographer Kadir van Lohuizen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cDiamond Matters,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which charts the diamond trade from excavation in Africa to markets overseas.The result is a record \u00e2\u0080\u0094 at times uneven \u00e2\u0080\u0094 of a particular period in African photography. Long gone is the homogeneous colonial gaze portraying the \u00e2\u0080\u009ccivilizing\u00e2\u0080\u009d work of exploitative European empires, as is the image of the noble savage. Western media tropes are also challenged. With the spread of digital technology and the growth of Internet access on the continent, we now have insight into the complex inner lives of \u00e2\u0080\u009csubjects\u00e2\u0080\u009d once observed only from the outside. This self-expression broadens the filter through which we view a diverse continent.Some of the book\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stronger work explores identity in projects such as the South African photographer Mary Sibande\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cLong Live the Dead Queen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a series of self-portraits featuring her alter ego, a domestic worker, dressed in striking blue outfits against a stark white background, and the Nigerian photographer Jenevieve Aken\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cMasked Woman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d another self-portrait series revealing Ms. Aken, a former model, performing the role of a femme fatale in a black-and-white examination of women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s roles in Nigeria. The Zimbabwean artist Kudzanai Chiurai\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cState of the Nation\u00e2\u0080\u009d features hyperstylized, ultrachromatic scenes probing how conflict can give birth to something else, even the possibility of a female head of state. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFlamboya,\u00e2\u0080\u009d by the Dutch artist Viviane Sassen, offers dreamy and seductive images that speak to the legacy of an imperialist aesthetic reimagined through a combination of documentary and staged photography that offers a fresh view of modern Africa.The quality of these and other projects featured in the book highlights a weakness: With a few notable exceptions, the work from Lagos is the least accomplished, meaning the festival has yet to capture the frenetic energy of its host city. This is an honest representation of the festival\u00e2\u0080\u0099s output to date, Mr. Nwagbogu said, explaining that a main objective of the festival was to address this gap by helping African photographers to mature through collaboration with outside artists.Such creative growth means that a book about Lagos is finally in the offing. Over the years, established photographers invited to the festival, including Stanley Greene of the United States, Robin Hammond of New Zealand and Mr. van Lohuizen, among many others, have worked with a handful of Nigerian photographers to document the city for a book of combined work titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cLagos: Entropy Unchecked,\u00e2\u0080\u009d to be published in 2016. Until then, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAfrica Under the Prism\u00e2\u0080\u009d offers a glimpse at LagosPhoto\u00e2\u0080\u0099s past, and potential."}

Many parents find themselves trying, and often failing, to legislate phone use at the table and at bedtime. So going away to college does mean, among many forms of independence, phone freedom.Telemedicine has been much in the news as researchers investigate how technology can extend the reach of medical services, and a host of start-ups and app developers look for ways to incorporate medical care into our relationships with our devices. And so in pediatrics, there is discussion about the potential for making health part of that adolescent connectedness.It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a truism in pediatrics that teenagers are often frustratingly vague about their symptoms \u00e2\u0080\u0094 how long, how severe, getting better or worse. Their readiness to document their lives via cellphone can be highly useful since what used to be hard-to-pin-down stories in the office are now often illustrated. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEven when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not long-distance communication, it improves communication because they think to use the phone to take a picture of the rash that they can show you when they come in to see you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Cindy Osman, a clinical associate professor of pediatrics at New York University.It also seems to be a truism in pediatrics that parents who work in medical fields develop a strong sense of what you can diagnose by text and by telephone. One pediatrician friend told me a story about getting a my-throat-hurts text from her college-age son and assuming it was a viral infection, likely to get better by itself, until he called and she heard his changed tone, and the amount of pain in his voice, and sent him to get the strep test he needed.Miki Conrad, who worked as a critical care nurse in Olympia, Wash., for 35 years, has four children, now in their 20s and 30s, who have been texting her with their medical questions, and sending photos, since they left for college. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey sent a lot of photos \u00e2\u0080\u0094 oh, I kicked so and so in the shin, look at my toe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd then pretty soon they started to send photos of their friends\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rashes, injuries.\u00e2\u0080\u009dPatrick K.

{"Headline": "Marcella Hazan and Her Namesake Bean", "Date": "2016-01-05", "News": "Supported bySoon after, he received a Facebook friend request from the buyer.So began an online correspondence with the celebrated cookbook author that produced the Marcella bean, which Mr. Sando has raised, and named after her.Beans may have originated in Latin America, but no one worships at their altar quite the way Italians do. For Mr. Sando, 55, whose business in Napa, Calif., is known for its heirloom beans, receiving the request from the Italian-born Mrs. Hazan, then 85 and widely considered to be the Julia Child of Italian cooking, was like a priest getting a text from the pope.\u201cTo Marcella, one of the ultimate pleasures in life was warm beans with good olive oil,\u201d said her husband, Victor Hazan, 87, who lives in Longboat Key, Fla., where Mrs. Hazan lived before her death in 2013.Like the current pope, Mrs. Hazan enjoyed communing with her disciples. \u201cShe loved to talk to anyone who shared her moral sense about cooking,\u201d Mr. Hazan said. \u201cFood had to be genuine \u2014 made to satisfy, not to impress.\u201d Not only did she often call people who sent fan mail, but she also insisted on having her name listed in the phone book, and frequently fielded questions about her recipes.\u201cShe enjoyed it,\u201d Mr. Hazan said. \u201cOf course, if she was in the middle of watching a movie, she\u2019d say, \u2018I\u2019ll call you back.\u2019\u201dShe and Mr. Sando, however, were more kindred spirits than mere acquaintances. \u201cThey were as friendly as can be for two people who never met,\u201d said Mr. Hazan. At first, they bonded over their mutual affection for Italian pop music; Mr. Sando lived in Milan in the late 1980s \u2014 long after Mrs. Hazan immigrated to the United States \u2014 and hosted a radio show. They traded notes on their favorite singers.Inevitably, the conversation turned to beans. Mr. Sando asked Mrs. Hazan which ones she missed most from Italy, expecting her to choose a variety famous among the \u201cbean people\u201d he knew \u2014 the lamon, for instance, the cranberry bean grown in the Venetian province of Belluno, or the zolfino, the pale yellow Tuscan bean that he described as \u201cdelicate, almost gelatinous orbs.\u201dInstead, she picked the sorana, calling it \u201cthe most precious bean grown in Italy.\u201d Mr. Sando had never heard of it. \u201cGrow them,\u201d Mrs. Hazan wrote to Mr. Sando, \u201cand you have a customer.\u201dThe sorana is a variety of cannellini grown in small quantities along the Pescia River near the town of Sorana. Uncommon even in Tuscany and virtually impossible to find in the United States, it is perhaps the most prized bean in the land of the so-called mangiafagioli (bean eaters), which is a bit like being the most sought-after grape in Burgundy.The bean\u2019s renown had been established by at least the early 19th century, when the opera composer and gourmand Gioachino Rossini \u2014 he of \u201cThe Barber of Seville,\u201d the famous tournedos and the lovely sentiment that \u201cappetite is for the stomach what love is for the heart\u201d \u2014 accepted several pounds of sorana as payment for correcting another composer\u2019s score. \u201cThe wonderful thing about the bean is that its skin is impalpable,\u201d Mr. Hazan said. \u201cEach bean is just a single sweet, creamy substance.\u201dMr. Sando got to work. For his business, he scouts heirloom beans and contracts a network of farmers to grow them in California\u2019s Central Valley, as well as in Oregon and Washington. He and his staff spent many months chasing down sorana seeds, poring over European catalogs, interrogating exporters and tracking down farmers until, at last, he purchased a modest amount and had them planted.As the beans grew, he sent Mrs. Hazan updates. \u201cI\u2019d email: \u2018They\u2019re in the ground! I can\u2019t wait to send you some!\u2019\u201d he said. The first harvest was meager, even for characteristically low-yielding heirlooms, but there were enough beans to do two things: attempt a second planting and send a small bag of them to Mrs. Hazan.But before Mr. Sando could ship it, he heard the news that echoed throughout the food world: Mrs. Hazan had died.A few months later, on a whim, Mr. Sando asked Mr. Hazan whether he could name them after his wife, as a tribute. He knew he would have to rechristen them anyway. Growers of the sorana in Italy have established a protocol to protect the location and traditional methods of production, so his beans weren\u2019t technically soranas.To prepare the Marcella bean, Mr. Sando channels the woman whose books taught him the joys of uncomplicated, ingredient-driven food. He eschews chicken stock, ham bones and other flavoring agents, and instead opts for water, olive oil and salt, occasionally \u201ctarting up\u201d the liquid with aromatics like carrot and garlic and herbs like thyme or sage. He serves the beans in a bowl with a splash of the cooking liquor or piles them on toast, always with more olive oil and salt.The keys, he says, are particularly gentle cooking of the beans \u2014 no stirring and the most placid of simmers, with bubbles that barely break the water\u2019s surface \u2014 and extra vigilance. \u201cIf you don\u2019t cook them long enough, you\u2019ll think, \u2018What\u2019s the big whoop?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut cook them too long and they\u2019ll fall apart.\u201dAfter that, just stay out of their way. \u201cRemember,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s about the bean.\u201dcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thousands Turn Out on King Day to Hear Bernie Sanders Speak in Alabama", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "BIRMINGHAM, Ala. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Thousands of people packed into an auditorium here on Monday night for a Martin Luther King Day rally held by Senator Bernie Sanders that at times felt like a boisterous football game.After pointedly debating Hillary Clinton on Sunday, Mr. Sanders seemed more energized than ever as he engaged with people in the crowd who shouted his name, loudly applauded at his policy ideas and booed at mentions of Mrs. Clinton and Republican presidential candidates. The Vermont senator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hourlong speech focused on the legacy of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and on how his presidency would continue Dr. King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legacy by fighting various forms of discrimination and inequality.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is absolutely imperative that we see his life not as a museum piece, something simply to be looked at, to be studied, to be appreciated, to be kept on a shelf,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said of Dr. King. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo truly honor the life of Dr. King, we must fight to carry out his radical and bold vision for America. And his vision was of a nation in which we not only end all forms of institutional racism, and bigotry, but a nation in which all of us, black, and white, and Latino, Asian-American, Native American, all of us, come to together to create a country which provides economic, social and environmental justice for all.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Sanders also spoke about other core issues of his campaign, including the need to break up big commercial banks, to reform campaign finance laws, to increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour, to invest in sustainable energy and to transform wealth distribution. He talked of recently released details about his plan to create a \u00e2\u0080\u009csingle-payer Medicare for all\u00e2\u0080\u009d health care system, and of his plans to use taxes on the rich to pay for progressive programs. And, riding the high of his debate performance, Mr. Sanders reminded the crowd that he is close to beating Mrs. Clinton in Iowa and New Hampshire.About 5,700 people were at the event at Boutwell Auditorium, and another 1,400 people outside watched it from an overflow area on large televisions.Earlier in the day, Mr. Sanders visited the 16th Street Baptist Church, where four black girls were killed in a bombing in 1963. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis was terrorism,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said during the tour.He also stopped by the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute, where he touched the bars of the Birmingham jail cell where Dr. King was held and viewed exhibits including segregated water fountains and a Ku Klux Klan robe.Before the event, people eager to get into the auditorium braved frigid weather and stood for more than an hour in a line that extended blocks and wrapped into a nearby parking lot. As the event\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start time neared, volunteers bellowed that the space was filling up fast and was standing room only.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe end of the line is all the way down,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a volunteer shouted to people who looked shocked at the turnout. One supporter sighed, dismayed by the wait. Another, however, cheerfully stared at the line and declared, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis gives me hope.\u00e2\u0080\u009dChris Echols, 41, drove about 90 miles from his home in Montgomery to see Mr. Sanders. As he stood in line, Mr. Echols said that until Sunday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debate he had been undecided about which Democratic candidate to support.Now, he plans to vote for Mr. Sanders. Mr. Echols also said that if Mrs. Clinton were to win the Democratic nomination and Mr. Sanders were to run as an independent, he would still vote for Mr. Sanders.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe biggest thing for me is health care,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Echols, an audio-visual technician, said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe finally laid out how he is going to pay for it, and he kind of stood his ground on a lot of issues. I think before now I looked at him like he was just a cranky old guy going on and on about the same things.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAs the event came to a close, Mr. Sanders said he would have to work hard to win Alabama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s March 1 primary. He added that those in the crowd had harder work to do in the Southern state to garner support than he had to do in Vermont. In the end, he left them with a direct message.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have got to go out to our white, working-class friends,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said to the mostly white crowd. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have got to go out to our brothers and sisters there and say stop voting against your own best interests.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Fermi, Sinatra, DiMaggio \u2014 and Capone", "Date": "2016-01-14", "News": "Supported by President Obama showcased a Syrian immigrant, Refaai Hamo, during his State of the Union address as evidence of \u201cour diversity and our openness,\u201d qualities that have long defined and sustained the United States.But given the degree of openness America has offered Syrian refugees over close to five years of war in which a quarter of a million people have been killed, this political choreography qualified as serious chutzpah.Hamo, who lost his wife and daughter in the war, is one of about 2,500 refugees Washington has admitted since 2012. That\u2019s roughly 0.06 percent of the 4.4 million Syrians who have fled their country, most of them marooned in neighboring Middle Eastern states, many staggering into Europe.In fact Hamo, in his relative isolation on this side of the Atlantic, might better have been offered as a symbol of the closing of the American mind \u2014 its post 9/11 susceptibility to fear of terrorism, its anxiety about downward social drift, its uncertainty about the future, its postwar fatigue, its plague-on-all-their-houses dismissal of the war-without-victory Middle East.Obama tried to inject hope. That\u2019s where the world began with Obama. Yes, we could. In truth, after seven years in the White House, he seemed weary himself, straining for conviction.As the world knows by now, Obama\u2019s temperament is more inclined toward explanation than exhortation. The president is primed to out-reason the Islamic State \u2014 they want this, so we\u2019ll do that \u2014 as if reason even flirts with the outer galaxies of the Raqqa universe. When feeling does take over, as with Obama\u2019s passionate appeal this month for America to rein in its gun madness, the effect is particularly powerful because rare.Republicans have sought to block Obama at every turn, not least on immigration, balking even at his plan to admit 10,000 Syrian refugees this year. The politics of anti-Muslim bigotry will not be far from the surface throughout this American election year.For everyone \u2014 from Donald Trump to rightist parties in Germany and Sweden \u2014 itching to close borders, the sexual assaults on women in Cologne on New Year\u2019s Eve have become the great I-told-you-so moment. Germany last year admitted 1.1 million refugees and asylum seekers, of whom close to 40 percent are Syrian. That\u2019s a huge number. Sweden\u2019s admission last year of up to 190,000 refugees is also substantial, relative to its population.In small towns, when hundreds of newcomers abruptly arrive, social tensions are inevitable. Far-right forces \u2014 Germany\u2019s Pegida movement or the Sweden Democrats \u2014 believe they can benefit.The refugee flow is unlikely to stop. Saudi Arabia just took a hatchet to already forlorn international peacemaking efforts through a mass execution that infuriated Iran. No peace is possible in Syria until the Saudis and Iranians both want it.Still, I\u2019d bet on Germany and Sweden, societies that have absorbed substantial numbers of refugees in the past, to prove resilient, and the aging European countries most open to immigration to be the more dynamic over time. What happened in Cologne was vile. Chancellor Angela Merkel has rightly spoken of \u201cdisgusting, criminal acts,\u201d and responded by toughening laws. She should go further. As a woman who reached the pinnacle, addressing refugees who have fled Muslim countries where women are often demeaned, she is uniquely placed to address the direct relationship between successful societies and female dignity, freedom and independence.Meanwhile, let\u2019s keep some perspective. Even the most aggressive estimate of the number of asylum seekers involved in the Cologne incidents still leaves more than 1,099,500 newly admitted refugees in Germany who had nothing to do with what happened.Merkel has done the right thing. Where would Europe be today with 1.1 million desperate people trudging from closed border to closed border? The Western responsibility for the Syrian debacle is immense. Her decision, alone among leaders, implicitly acknowledges this fact. Germany, over the past quarter-century, has absorbed 16 million former East Germans and ushered them from the paranoid, subjugated mind-set of the Soviet imperium. Its large Turkish community is unevenly integrated, but ever better with the years. Germany will handle the current influx.Immigration is a challenge but also a measure of the confidence of a society, its preparedness for self-renewal. That confidence is low in America right now. \u201cThe dignity of a person is untouchable\u201d \u2014 so begins Germany\u2019s postwar Constitution, with words drawn from bitter experience. Merkel has shown the conviction that this idea can eventually be absorbed by everyone now in Germany. She will be vindicated.The United States, between the 1880\u2019s and 1924, admitted about 4 million Italian immigrants. As Leon Wieseltier, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, observed to me, \u201cWe got Enrico Fermi, Frank Sinatra, Joe DiMaggio, Antonin Scalia \u2014 and Al Capone. Who in their right mind would suggest that the Italian immigration was not a great blessing for our country?\u201dCall it the Capone Principle: Costs of immigration are outweighed by benefits.

The idea, the company says, is to give riders tailored information and entertainment during their time in an Uber vehicle.  Uber gave a few examples of how it might look. Upon entering the vehicle, riders could receive a quick news briefing or perhaps be served with a music playlist built to last the length of their ride.This approach invites developers to work directly with Uber to submit and test their ideas, but Uber will have final say over whether a developer\u2019s trip experience will be allowed. It is a different, more cautious approach than that taken by companies like Facebook and Twitter, both of which have had strained relationships with third-party developers in the past. The announcement coincided with Uber\u2019s first hackathon in Bangalore, India, where the company is soliciting developers for new integration ideas. The company expects that the first trip experiences will not appear for at least a few weeks, depending on how quickly developers submit, test and release their ideas. FollowAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "Niklas Meltio has spent much of the last four years covering Syria\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complex and dangerous civil war and its spillover into Iraq, hewing to the front lines and living under frequent bombardment. While that proximity lets him get to know his subjects, it can also lead to close calls, which is why last year he took a break and returned to his home in Finland.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt feels like I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just continuing covering the same conflict but from a different point of view,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Meltio, 36, said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI often come across refugees on the trail and find out that we have common friends.\u00e2\u0080\u009d   On a trip to northern France last month, he explored \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Jungle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a migrants\u2019 camp in Calais that has long been a gateway for desperate migrants trying to cross the channel illegally into England. Most of the camp\u2019s 2,000 residents \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from Syria, Iraq, Kurdistan, Afghanistan and parts of Africa \u00e2\u0080\u0094 entered Europe through Greece and trekked there by bus, train and walking. Few nongovernmental organizations operate there, leaving it to volunteers to fill in the gaps. Most of the migrants spend just a few months in the camp, living in tents or shacks made of wood and plastic, hardly enough of a buffer against recent freezing temperatures. Yet some have stayed longer, setting up restaurants and small businesses.Mr. Meltio spent most of his time following two small groups of middle-class Kurds, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnormal people with great hopes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d who were trying to reach England. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause of my history in Kurdish areas, I understood where they were coming from and could bond with them very easily,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.  Increased police patrols mean that most of the migrants have little chance of reaching England. Still, every night hundreds try to cross by hopping atop a truck or onto a moving Eurotunnel train even though only a handful make it. The rest return to the camp, sometimes injured in a fall, a confrontation with the police or cut by barbed wire. Many try unsuccessfully every night for months, while others pay smugglers between $2,000 and $5,000 to get them across. Mr. Meltio is hardly surprised by the migrant crisis, which he said was the \u00e2\u0080\u009ctotally predictable outcome\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the Syrian conflict and leaders\u2019 lack of willingness to address the deeper issues involved.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a refugee problem,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have a conflict in the Middle East that this is just a symptom of.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not their girlfriend either.I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m their university professor. At times I encounter students, both male and female, who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite grasp this, and I consequently find myself in a whole host of awkward situations, trying to subtly remind them that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m neither going to make their bed nor go to bed with them.The problem is that my students lack the cultural scripts to know how to deal with our teacher-student relationship. In 1925, Sigmund Freud coined the idea of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cMadonna-whore complex,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to which men are able to see women only as their saintly mothers or their sexual playthings. Whatever one thinks of Freud, we can all recognize some truth to this insight.If I were to serve as their mother, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have only compassion and unconditional acceptance to offer, not intellectual lessons. And being their sexual plaything isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t an option either; playthings aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t generally accorded the kind of respect needed for effective teaching and learning, not to mention the respect I deserve after more than a decade of postsecondary education.My male colleagues don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have these problems. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no shortage of roles they can avail themselves of in trying to reach their students.The sex has (for the most part) dropped out for us now, but a mentoring relationship between older and younger men remains one of the most accepted and effective ways of transmitting knowledge and power in a patriarchal society such as ours.One of male professors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 most effective strategies for reaching their female students is an old one, described by the feminist and existentialist philosopher Simone de Beauvoir in 1949. De Beauvoir argued that women crave men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s authority to protect them from their own liberty. Existentialists are, in general, pretty pessimistic about people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tendency to live in bad faith. They think most people want to avoid the anxiety of taking existential responsibility for their lives, preferring instead to find a way to have someone else make their decisions for them.De Beauvoir argues that a distinctively feminine manifestation of this existential inauthenticity is women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tendency to subsume their identity under the identity of the man they love. Consider women who take on a whole new set of hobbies and interests every time they start dating a new man. (Lest you think this is a thing of the past, my students assure me that they still see it all the time among their friends.) Why do so many women take on their husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surname when they marry? An apt metaphor for all this, de Beauvoir says, is found in the fairy tale of the little mermaid, who gave up her fishtail and had her tongue cut out for the chance to be loved by a human man, only to find herself turned into sea foam after he spurned her.Many a female student has been turned into sea foam. They lust after their professors and are, too often, greeted with open arms, but the ensuing erotic relationship, unlike the pederastic one, does little to help women realize any higher intellectual lesson. Instead, the beloved is frequently stuck \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or more accurately, objectified \u00e2\u0080\u0094 valued only on the basis of her physical appearance or sexual appeal. The contrast between this situation and the one articulated by Plato is stark: In the \u00e2\u0080\u009cSymposium,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Socrates makes it clear that while his students might fall in love with him, he views this love as merely a tool to help them grow up and ultimately wrest themselves from childish attractions.Erotic relationships between female students and their male professors, however, are not usually an effective steppingstone to further intellectual pursuits for the student, who will be more likely to face accusations of \u00e2\u0080\u009csleeping her way to the top\u00e2\u0080\u009d than to be taken seriously as an intellectual interlocutor. But such relationships serve to flatter the ego of many an aging male academic, even when they show enough restraint to keep things at the level of \u00e2\u0080\u009charmless\u00e2\u0080\u009d flirtation.Of course, not all male professors exploit the intimacy of the pedagogical relationship by permitting it to turn sexual. But there are plenty of advantages to reap even for those who stay on the right side of the line. In our culture, men are the keepers of the intellectual flame and can bestow it as they see fit. Male professors can take on a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfather knows best\u00e2\u0080\u009d persona, or an avuncular one, and use their comfortable position of authority to inspire a student to delve deeper into an academic subject. Female professors have no such personae available to them. In our culture mothers dispense hugs, not pearls of wisdom, and when they do venture to have opinions we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re likelier than not to roll our eyes at them for being nags or scolds. And we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even have a word for the aunt-equivalent of \u00e2\u0080\u009cavuncular.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAs female professors age, the typecasting changes: We move with depressing predictability from the role of girlfriend to the role of mother. Julinna Oxley, an associate professor at Coastal Carolina University, reports that when she first started teaching, her teaching evaluations would say things like \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe wears great skirts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Now, 10 years later, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lost her chili pepper on RateMyProfessors.com and her students look to her for advice in their personal lives and for extensions on assignments.My students, thankfully, aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just men. But there are even fewer cultural scripts on which to model the pedagogical relationship between female professors and their female students. Some of my female students are able to recognize the need for and benefits of finding a female mentor, but surprisingly few of them actually do. One explanation for this comes from feminist philosophers as old as John Stuart Mill and de Beauvoir, who argue that solidarity is particularly hard for women because they often have more in common with the men in their lives than with women across race, class or age boundaries. Another explanation comes from contemporary feminist philosophers like Sandra Bartky, who describes the phenomenon of internalized oppression. Bartky argues that self-loathing is an inevitable result of living in a culture saturated with messages about the inferior status and value of people like you. Given this, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no surprise that many of my female students find it no easier than their male counterparts to look up to someone who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a man. Mermaids would rather cut out their tongues than spend a life stuck with other mermaids.The problem is that we, as a culture, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really know what a female professor is supposed to be. The archetypal professor is decidedly male \u00e2\u0080\u0094 rumpled tweed jacket, argyle socks, bushy beard, pipe \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and even if it were an option not much in this aesthetic is terribly appealing to a cisgender woman like me. In my more optimistic moments I try to see this cultural void as an opportunity \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m lucky enough to have the chance to avoid falling into age-old stereotypes and to invent new, more appropriate roles. But most of the time it just feels like a desert. Feminists have been telling us for a very long time that women in positions of authority find themselves stuck between a rock and a hard place. Too assertive or confident and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll call you a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbitch.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Too passive or self-deprecating and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a doormat and unfit to be taken seriously.An anthology of essays from The Times\u2019s philosophy series, published by Liveright.And Patricia Hill Collins, a philosopher of feminism and race, has argued that women of color face even more rigid limitations on their social roles, usually finding themselves stereotyped as \u00e2\u0080\u009cmammies, matriarchs, welfare recipients, [or] hot mommas.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The problem is that there really isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a middle ground for any of us here: We can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t handle it when women aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u00e2\u0080\u009cnice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but being in a position of authority means that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sometimes going to tell people things they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to hear. So, for example, taking male colleagues to task for abusing their power for sexual gain is one of the best ways to alienate a reader.Sociologists such as Arlie Hochschild and philosophers such as Cheshire Calhoun have written about the \u00e2\u0080\u009cemotional work\u00e2\u0080\u009d for which women are responsible even in the workplace. Because women are thought to be naturally caring and empathetic they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re expected not only to have their own emotional ducks in a row, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also expected to take on the task of helping others manage their emotions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 calming tempers, mending wounded egos, boosting confidence, mediating frictions, ensuring harmony. This work is essentially invisible and uncompensated. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost never a formal requirement listed on job descriptions or performance and tenure reviews, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so taken for granted that it tends to fall below the radar of even our informal moral accounting.Alice MacLachlan, an associate professor at York University, tells a story about joking with a male colleague about how she always knew midterms were over because she had to bring out her backup box of tissues. He looked at her blankly, and it was only then that she realized none of her male colleagues had to replace their tissues at least once a semester after crying students had used them up. Women are expected to be kind and caring, so the bar is higher for what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expected of them, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re penalized more harshly when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re perceived not to be. Serena Parekh, an associate professor at Northeastern University, still cringes at the memory of receiving a bad teaching evaluation that criticized her for not being \u00e2\u0080\u009cnurturing\u00e2\u0080\u009d enough. The philosopher Claudia Card has argued that if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to upset these unfair cultural expectations women need to care less and men need to care more. This is wonderful advice about how we should try to revise our expectations when making moral assessments of a given professor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s risky practical advice for female professors to take, given that we know that women who fail to live up to expectations of caring will be vilified.As a female professor, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve found that a bigger challenge than \u00e2\u0080\u009cleaning in\u00e2\u0080\u009d to my career has been figuring out how to avoid falling into roles that are far from my own choosing. We lack the cultural narratives to make sense of women in positions of social power or authority. The ones we do have haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t changed much since the days of Freud and de Beauvoir. This failure of cultural imagination affects women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s political, economic and social prospects. It always has. The trick, as educators, is to start figuring out how to teach our students without losing them in the sea foam, so they can grow up to look for, or to be, something other than girlfriends and mothers.Carol Hay is an associate professor of philosophy and the director of the gender studies program at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, and the author of \u201cKantianism, Liberalism, and Feminism: Resisting Oppression.\u201dMore From Fixes \u00bbMore From Private Lives \u00bbMore From Couch \u00bbMore From The Stone \u00bbMore From Moviegoers \u00bbMore From The End \u00bbMore From Draft \u00bbMore From Anxiety \u00bbMore From Menagerie \u00bbMore From Disunion \u00bbMore From Bedside \u00bbMore From The Conversation \u00bbMore From The Great Divide \u00bbMore From Errol Morris \u00bbFollowAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Happiness Code", "Date": "2016-01-14", "News": "FeatureA new approach to self-improvement is taking off in Silicon Valley: cold, hard rationality.Supported byThe goal of the \u2018\u2018CoZE\u2019\u2019 exercise, Smith explained, was to \u2018\u2018peek over the fence\u2019\u2019 to a new self; by doing something that makes you uncomfortable and then observing the result. There was an anticipatory hush, and then the room erupted. One person gave a toast. A product manager at Dropbox broke into song. In a corner, a programmer named Brent took off his shirt, revealing a milky chest and back, then sat with his head bowed. (He would later walk around wearing a handwritten sign that read, \u2018\u2018Please touch me.\u2019\u2019)The exercise went on for an hour, and afterward, participants giddily shared their stories. One person described going onto the patio and watching everyone else through the window, in order to experience a feeling of exclusion. Another submerged his hand in a pan of leftover chicken curry, to challenge his natural fastidiousness. Unexpectedly, he enjoyed the experience. \u2018\u2018It felt playful,\u2019\u2019 he said.Some of these problems are byproducts of our brain\u2019s reward system. We cash checks quickly but drag our feet paying credit-card bills, no matter the financial cost, because cashing a check generates a surge of dopamine but paying a bill makes us stressed. Other mistakes are glitchier. A person who owes back taxes might avoid talking to the I.R.S. because of a lingering monkey-brain belief that avoiding bad news keeps it from being true. While such logical errors may be easy to spot in others, the group says, they\u2019re often harder to see in ourselves. The workshop promised to give participants the tools to address these flaws, which, it hinted, are almost certainly worse than we realize. As the center\u2019s website warns, \u2018\u2018Careful thinking just isn\u2019t enough to understand our minds\u2019 hidden failures.\u2019\u2019Most self-help appeals to us because it promises real change without much real effort, a sort of fad diet for the psyche. (\u2018\u2018The Four-Hour Workweek,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up.\u2019\u2019) By the magical-thinking standards of the industry, then, CFAR\u2019s focus on science and on tiresome levels of practice can seem almost radical. It has also generated a rare level of interest among data-driven tech people and entrepreneurs who see personal development as just another optimization problem, if a uniquely central one. Yet, while CFAR\u2019s methods are unusual, its aspirational promise \u2014 that a better version of ourselves is within reach \u2014 is distinctly familiar. The center may emphasize the benefits that will come to those who master the techniques of rational thought, like improved motivation and a more organized inbox, but it also suggests that the real reward will be far greater, enabling users to be more intellectually dynamic and nimble. Or as Smith put it, \u2018\u2018We\u2019re trying to invent parkour for the mind.\u2019\u2019This is all the more surprising given that the workshops, which cost $3,900 per person, are run like a college-dorm cram session. Participants stay on-site for the entire time (typically four days and nights), often in bargain-basement conditions. In San Leandro, the organizers packed 48 people (36 participants, plus six staff members and six volunteers) into a single house, using twin mattresses scattered on the floor as extra beds. In the kitchen, I asked Matt O\u2019Brien, a 30-year-old product manager who develops brain-training software for Lumosity, whether he minded the close quarters. He looked briefly puzzled, then explained that he already lives with 20 housemates in a shared house in San Francisco. Looking around the chaotic kitchen, he shrugged and said, \u2018\u2018It\u2019s not really all that different.\u2019\u2019Those constraints produced a peculiar homogeneity. Nearly all the participants were in their early- to mid-20s, with quirky bios of the Bay Area variety. (\u2018\u2018Asher is a singing, freestyle rapping, former international Quidditch All-American turned software engineer.\u2019\u2019) Communication styles tended toward the formal. When I excused myself from one conversation, my interlocutor said, \u2018\u2018I will allow you to disengage,\u2019\u2019 then gave a courtly bow. The only older attendee, a man in his 50s who described himself as polyamorous and \u2018\u2018part Vulcan,\u2019\u2019 ghosted through the workshop, padding silently around the house in shorts and a polo shirt.If the demographics of the workshop were alarmingly narrow, there was no disputing the group\u2019s studiousness. Over the course of four days, I heard not a single scrap of chatter about anything unrelated to rationality. Nor, so far as I could discern, did anybody ever leave the house. Not for a quick trip to the Starbucks a mile down the road. Not for a walk in the sprawling park a half-mile away. One participant, Phoenix Eliot, had recently moved into a shared house where everyone was a \u2018\u2018practicing rationalist\u2019\u2019 and reported that the experience had been positive. \u2018\u2018We haven\u2019t really had any interpersonal problems,\u2019\u2019 Eliot told me. \u2018\u2018Whereas if this were a regular house, with people who just like each other, I think there would have been a lot more issues.\u2019\u2019When I first spoke to Galef, she told me that, while the group tends to attract analytical thinkers, a purely logical approach to problem-solving is not the goal. \u2018\u2018A lot of people think that rationality means acting like Spock and ignoring things like intuition and emotion,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018But we\u2019ve found that that approach doesn\u2019t actually work.\u2019\u2019 Instead, she said, the aim was to bring the emotional, instinctive parts of the brain (dubbed \u2018\u2018System One\u2019\u2019 by Kahneman) into harmony with the more intellectual, goal-setting parts of the brain (\u2018\u2018System Two\u2019\u2019).At the orientation, Galef emphasized this point. System One wasn\u2019t something to be overcome, she said, but a wise adviser, capable of sensing problems that our conscious minds hadn\u2019t yet registered. It also played a key role in motivation. \u2018\u2018The prefrontal cortex is like a monkey riding an elephant,\u2019\u2019 she told the group. \u2018\u2018System One is the elephant. And you\u2019re not going to steer an elephant by telling it where it should go.\u2019\u2019 The challenge, Galef said, was to recognize instances in which the two systems were at war, leading to a feeling of \u2018\u2018stuckness\u2019\u2019: \u2018\u2018Things like, \u2018I want to go to the gym more, but I don\u2019t go.\u2019 Or, \u2018I want my Ph.D., but I don\u2019t want to work on it.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 She sketched a picture of a duck facing one way and its legs and feet resolutely pointed in the opposite direction. She called these problems \u2018\u2018software bugs.\u2019\u2019Afterward, I chatted with O\u2019Brien and Mike Plotz, a circus juggler-turned-coder, about the program\u2019s appeal. When I asked Plotz why he thought the workshops attracted so many programmers, he glanced at O\u2019Brien. \u2018\u2018I think most of us are fairly analytical,\u2019\u2019 he began. \u2018\u2018We like to think about how complex systems work and how they can be optimized.\u2019\u2019 Because of this, Plotz added, he tends to notice patterns of behavior, in himself and in others. \u2018\u2018When you realize that people are complex systems \u2014 that we operate in complicated ways, but also sort of follow rules \u2014 you start to think about how you might tweak some of those variables.\u2019\u2019Deliberately or not, CFAR\u2019s application process also filters out many of the less committed. There is an extensive, in-person interview, conducted by an instructor. Afterward, participants are required to fill out an elaborate self-report, in which they\u2019re asked to assess their own personality traits and behaviors. (A friend or family member is given a similar questionnaire to confirm the accuracy of the applicant\u2019s self-assessment.) \u2018\u2018We get a fair number of people who say, \u2018I want to come to the workshop because everybody I work with is really irrational and I want to fix them,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Anna Salamon told me. \u2018\u2018Which is not what we are looking for.\u2019\u2019Despite this rigorous vetting, Salamon acknowledged that the center\u2019s aims are ultimately proselytic. CFAR began as a spinoff of MIRI, which Yudkowsky created in 2000, in part to study the impending threat posed by artificially intelligent machines, which, he argued, could eventually destroy humanity. (Yudkowsky\u2019s concern was that the machines could become sentient, hide this from their human operators and then decide to eliminate us.) Over the years, Yudkowsky found that people struggled to think clearly about A.I. risk and were often dismissive of it. In 2011, Salamon, who had been working at MIRI since 2008, volunteered to figure out how to overcome that problem.When I spoke with Salamon, she said that \u2018\u2018global catastrophic risks\u2019\u2019 like sentient A.I. were often difficult to assess. There wasn\u2019t much data from which to extrapolate; this not only made the threats harder to evaluate but also discouraged researchers from digging into the question. (Studies have shown that people are more likely to avoid thinking about problems that feel depressing or vague and are also more likely to engage in mental \u2018\u2018discounting\u2019\u2019 \u2014 assuming that the risk of something bad happening is lower than it actually is.) CFAR\u2019s original mandate was to give researchers the mental tools to overcome their unconscious assumptions. Or as Salamon put it, \u2018\u2018We were staring at the problem of staring at the problem.\u2019\u2019Like many in the community, Salamon believes that the skills of rational thought, as taught by CFAR, are important to humanity\u2019s long-term survival, in part because they can help us confront such seemingly remote catastrophic risks, as well as more familiar ones, like poverty and climate change. \u2018\u2018One thing that primates tend to do is to make up stories for why something we believe must be true,\u2019\u2019 Salamon told me. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s very rare that we genuinely evaluate the evidence for our beliefs.\u2019\u2019It was a point of view that nearly everyone at the workshop fervently shared. As one participant told me: \u2018\u2018Self-help is just the gateway. The real goal is: Save the world.\u2019\u2019As a lecturer, Smith had a messianic quality, gazing intensely at students and moving with taut deliberation, as though perpetually engaged in a tai-chi workout. Goal factoring, Smith explained, is essentially a structured thought exercise: a way to analyze an aspiration (\u2018\u2018I want to be promoted to manager\u2019\u2019) by identifying the subgoals that drive it. While some of these may be obvious, others (\u2018\u2018I want to impress my ex-girlfriend\u2019\u2019) might be more embarrassing or less conscious. The purpose of the exercise, Smith said, was to develop a process for seeing your own motivations honestly and for spotting when they might be leading you astray. \u2018\u2018These are blind spots,\u2019\u2019 Smith warned. \u2018\u2018Blind spots that can poison your ability to keep track of what\u2019s truly important to you.\u2019\u2019To begin the factoring process, Smith asked each of us to choose a goal, list all the things we believed would come from accomplishing it and then brainstorm ways to achieve each thing. If you wanted a promotion to make more money, was there another way to get a higher salary \u2014 say, by asking for a raise or changing jobs? Finally, Smith said, we should imagine having achieved each of those subgoals. Were we satisfied? If not, that indicated the presence of a hidden motive, one that we had either overlooked or didn\u2019t want to acknowledge.Though the exercise didn\u2019t strike me as especially penetrating \u2014 garden-variety introspection made punctilious \u2014 it was hugely popular. My group in the goal-factoring session included Ben Pace, a sweetly lumbering 18-year-old in a suit jacket and running shoes, who tended to balance his notepad on his knee like an old-timey newspaper reporter. Pace had flown over from Britain for the workshop, which he discovered at 15 by reading the LessWrong blog. He had applied to Oxford for the fall, and was hoping to attend. \u2018\u2018I was feeling very worried about it,\u2019\u2019 he confided, \u2018\u2018but then I goal-factored it and realized that I could get many of the same things I want from Oxford in other ways.\u2019\u2019While Pace said that he had come to the workshop to practice the techniques of rationality, others had more pressing worries. During one break, I chatted with Andrew, a software developer specializing in mobile platforms who asked to be identified only by his first name to protect his privacy. Andrew acknowledged that he tended to struggle in social situations and suffered from depression and anxiety. \u2018\u2018My brain has a lot of ridiculous social rules,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018I tend to be very closed off. And then there\u2019s a switch where I\u2019m almost completely open. It\u2019s this binary transition.\u2019\u2019Andrew said that he had initially been dubious of applied rationality, which he first heard about in a Reddit philosophy forum. Over time, though, he found that using the techniques made it easier to catch himself in the act of rationalizing a bad decision or avoiding an unpleasant task, like applying for a job. Initially, Andrew said, he assumed that he was simply afraid of rejection. But when he used aversion factoring \u2014 like goal factoring, but focused on what makes you avoid an unpleasant but important task \u2014 he made a surprising discovery. While visualizing how he would feel about applying for jobs if there were no chance of rejection, he realized that he still found the task aversive. In the end, he determined that his reluctance was rooted in a fear not of rejection but of making a bad career choice.It was a significant insight, the kind more typically won through hours of talk therapy. And indeed, some participants reported that the techniques had genuinely changed their lives, either by helping them with mental-health issues like attention deficit or obsessive-compulsive disorder or simply by allowing them to recognize unquestioned assumptions. For a few \u2014 especially a set of high achievers for whom success hadn\u2019t brought happiness \u2014 that process had been nearly tectonic. \u2018\u2018For most of my life, I believed \u2018If I do a good job, good things will happen,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 one person told me. \u2018\u2018Now I ask, \u2018If I do a good job, what does that mean?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019Others, though, seemed to see rationality less as a fundamental recalibration and more as a tool to be wielded. One participant, Michael Gao \u2014 who claimed that, before he turned 18, he made $10 million running a Bitcoin mine but then lost it all in the Mt. Gox collapse \u2014 seemed appalled when I suggested that the experience might have led him to value things besides accomplishment, like happiness and human connection. The problem, he clarified, was not that he had been too ambitious but that he hadn\u2019t been ambitious enough. \u2018\u2018I want to augment the race,\u2019\u2019 Gao told me earnestly, as we sat on the patio. \u2018\u2018I want humanity to achieve great things. I want us to conquer death.\u2019\u2019Given that I had already undergone a fair amount of talk therapy myself, I didn\u2019t expect the workshop to bring me much in the way of new insights. But then, at one point, Smith cited the example of a man with a potentially cancerous mole who refuses to go see the doctor. It was part, he said, of \u2018\u2018a broader class of mental errors\u2019\u2019 we\u2019re all prone to: the belief that avoiding bad news will keep it from becoming true. While this didn\u2019t strike me as particularly revelatory at the time, it turned out to be a stealthy insight. For an exercise the next day, I listed all the reasons I was avoiding talking with a financial planner, something I had intended to do for months. Many of them were pedestrian. Getting my financial records together would be tedious, and I was also mildly embarrassed by my income, which is on the low side. Working through the problem, though, I realized that the actual reason was humiliatingly simple: I was afraid of hearing that I needed to spend less and save more. Like mole man, I was afraid of what I might learn.But are such realizations alone enough to create change? Fears can be stubborn and not particularly easy to argue with. When I mentioned this to Smith, he shrugged. \u2018\u2018Hiding from the painful states of the world doesn\u2019t prevent them from happening,\u2019\u2019 he said. Then, like a strict parent telling a sniffling child to shape up, he added: \u2018\u2018The point isn\u2019t just \u2018How do I get myself to go to the doctor this time?\u2019 It\u2019s \u2018How do I make it so that I will never be susceptible to that type of thinking error again?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019Among other things, they found that people are typically both risk-averse and loss-averse: more likely to choose a guaranteed payout of $1,000 than to gamble on winning $1,400 when there\u2019s a 20 percent chance they could end up with nothing. They also discovered that people tend to underestimate the chance of a low-probability event occurring, thus inadvertently exposing themselves to terrible risks. (The 2011 tsunami, for example, caught the Japanese off guard and devastated parts of northeastern Japan.)In the past few decades, psychologists have identified dozens of cognitive biases, including \u2018\u2018gambler\u2019s fallacy\u2019\u2019 (believing that a coin toss is more likely to come up heads if the previous five flips were tails); \u2018\u2018anchoring\u2019\u2019 (the tendency to rely heavily on one piece of information \u2014 usually the first thing we learn \u2014 when making a decision); the \u2018\u2018Ikea effect\u2019\u2019 (disproportionately valuing things that you\u2019ve labored over); and \u2018\u2018unit bias\u2019\u2019 (assuming that a \u2018\u2018portion\u2019\u2019 is the right size, which accounts for our tendency to finish off an opened bag of cookies).What makes CFAR novel is its effort to use those same principles to fix personal problems: to break frustrating habits, recognize self-defeating cycles and relentlessly interrogate our own wishful inclinations and avoidant instincts. Galef described \u2018\u2018propagating urges\u2019\u2019 \u2014 a mental exercise designed to make long-term goals feel more viscerally rewarding \u2014 as an extension of operant conditioning, in which an experimenter who hopes to increase a certain behavior in an animal will reward incremental steps toward that behavior. Goal factoring and aversion factoring, she added, came out of behavioral economics, as well as research on a cognitive bias known as \u2018\u2018introspection illusion\u2019\u2019: thinking we understand our motives or fears when we actually don\u2019t. (That illusion is why the factoring process begins with listing every reason you\u2019re either avoiding something or pursuing a goal, and then uses a second round of thought experiments to ferret out hidden factors.)Figuring out how to translate behavioral-economics insights into a curriculum involved years of trial and error. Salamon recruited Galef, a former science journalist, in 2011, and later hired Smith, then a graduate student in math education at San Diego State. (Smith first met Yudkowsky at a conference dedicated to cryonics, in which a deceased person\u2019s body is stored in a supercooled vat, to be resuscitated in a more advanced future.) In early 2012, the group began offering free classes to test its approach and quickly learned that almost none of it worked. Participants complained that the lectures were abstract and confusing and that some points seemed obvious while others simply felt wrong. A session on Bayes\u2019s Theorem was especially unpopular, Salamon recalled, adding, \u2018\u2018People visibly suffered through it.\u2019\u2019The group also discovered a deeper problem: No one was very motivated to make his or her thinking more accurate. What people did want, Salamon recalled, was help with their personal problems. Some were constantly late to things. Others felt trapped by their own unproductive habits. Nearly everyone wanted help managing their email, eating better and improving their relationships. \u2018\u2018Relatively early on,\u2019\u2019 Salamon said, \u2018\u2018we realized that we had to disguise the epistemic rationality content as productivity advice or relationship advice.\u2019\u2019In the end, the group built a curriculum largely from existing research into human behavior, but the goal of Applied Rationality remained the same: to provide tools, not advice. \u2018\u2018Unlike a lot of self-help programs, we don\u2019t advocate particular things that people should do,\u2019\u2019 Galef told me. \u2018\u2018We just encourage them to look at the models that are driving their choices and try to examine those models rationally.\u2019\u2019 She shrugged. \u2018\u2018People are already making predictions, whether or not they\u2019re aware of it. They\u2019re already saying \u2018I\u2019ll be miserable if I leave this relationship\u2019 or \u2018I won\u2019t be able to make any difference in this big global problem because I\u2019m just one person.\u2019 So a lot of what we do is just trying to make people more aware of those predictions and to question whether they\u2019re actually accurate.\u2019\u2019The TAPs session was led by Salamon, a thin, muppety woman with a corona of brown hair. As a graduate student, Salamon studied the philosophy of science, and her lectures often seemed to take the wry view of humans as only marginally more evolved chimps. Involuntary TAPs already drive much of our behavior, she said \u2014 \u2018\u2018Like: See open bag of Cheetos. Put in hand\u2019\u2019 \u2014 but could also be made intentional and productive.My partner for the TAPs exercise, a soft-spoken engineer who works at Google, told me that he had tried TAPs before, but with limited success. \u2018\u2018For a while, I was trying to drink more water, so I set up a TAP to drink a glass of water the minute I got to work,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018It worked for a few weeks, but then I stopped. I started just wanting to get to work.\u2019\u2019 Now, he said, he was considering changing his TAP, to cue himself to drink water when he wanted a break. \u2018\u2018Maybe it\u2019ll help me stop reading Reddit,\u2019\u2019 he added.If TAPs felt slightly gimmicky, like rat-maze training for adults, other techniques seemed more profound. My favorite was propagating urges, the one that focused on motivating yourself to reach long-term goals. What makes things like weight loss or learning to play the violin difficult, Salamon said, is that they often conflict with System One-driven urges (wanting a nap, craving a cookie). And because long-term goals typically require sticking it out through a series of unpleasant intermediate steps (eating less, practicing the violin), it can be easy to lose the original motivation. \u2018\u2018Things we feel rewarded by, we do automatically,\u2019\u2019 Salamon added. \u2018\u2018When I want Thai food, I\u2019ll drive there, look at the menu, go inside, order. I don\u2019t have to convince myself to take those steps. But in other cases, the connection is lost.\u2019\u2019The solution, she said, is finding a way to make long-term goals feel more like short-term urges, especially because our brains are wired to associate actions and rewards that follow closely in time. (To discourage bad habits, conversely, you should stretch out the time between an action and its reward. \u2018\u2018If you want to stop reading stuff online instead of working, have the pages load more slowly,\u2019\u2019 Salamon advised.) Because of this powerful association, small but immediate negative experiences can have disproportionate impact: the aversive moment of getting into a cold swimming pool can overwhelm the delayed rewards of doing morning laps. To override that resistance, she said, you need to associate the activity with a powerful feeling of reward, one with a stronger neurochemical kick than the virtuous goals (\u2018\u2018being healthier\u2019\u2019) that we normally aspire to. The next step is to come up with a mental image that vividly captures that feeling and that you can summon in moments of weakness. \u2018\u2018It has to be a very sticky image,\u2019\u2019 Salamon said. \u2018\u2018If it isn\u2019t, you won\u2019t experience that gut-level surge of motivation.\u2019\u2019 She told a story about how Smith overcame his aversion to doing push-ups, which made him feel unpleasantly hot and sweaty, by tapping into his obsession with longevity: now he pictured the heat from the exercise as a fire that burned away cell-damaging free radicals.What made propagating urges so compelling, at least for me, was that it cut to the heart of a fundamental internal struggle: the clash between the shortsighted impulses that drive our daily behavior (checking email until it becomes \u2018\u2018too late\u2019\u2019 to go to the gym) and the long-term aspirations that might make us genuinely happier if we could only persuade the petulant toddler in our minds to get onboard.In a practice session, I paired up with Brian Raszap, a programmer at Amazon with a gentle smile and empathic manner. The aim of the exercise was to troubleshoot a long-term goal that we had each been struggling with and then create a new, sticky image to use as motivation. Raszap went first. He explained that he and some co-workers go to a Brazilian jujitsu class during lunch, usually once or twice a week. \u2018\u2018When I go, I love it,\u2019\u2019 Raszap told me. \u2018\u2018I feel so good. But half the time, I don\u2019t go.\u2019\u2019We talked through the problem for a while, then I asked Raszap to describe the feeling that he got from the class. He brightened. After working out, he told me, he is very relaxed, filled with a deeply pleasurable lassitude. When I asked if he could tap into that for motivation, Raszap nodded. \u2018\u2018Maybe that would work,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I usually think about wanting to get better at jujitsu. But maybe instead, I can think about feeling really good this afternoon.\u2019\u2019Many of CFAR\u2019s techniques resemble a kind of self-directed version of psychotherapy\u2019s holy trinity: learning to notice behaviors and assumptions that we\u2019re often barely conscious of; feeling around to understand the roots of those behaviors; and then using those insights to create change. But there was something unsettling about how CFAR focused on superficial fixes while overlooking potentially deeper issues. While talking with Raszap, I began by asking why, if he truly wanted to go, he often skipped the jujitsu class. Raszap listed practical obstacles: Sometimes he doesn\u2019t want the interruption; sometimes he just has a lot to do. But he also said that even the idea of attending the class more regularly makes him feel anxious. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s a feeling of not doing enough,\u2019\u2019 Raszap told me. Perversely, the workout only heightened his fear of failing, of missing the next class. This was coupled with a claustrophobic sense of obligation, what Raszap called \u2018\u2018a fear of foreverness\u2019\u2019 \u2014 \u2018\u2018Like, if I go today, I\u2019ll have to keep going forever.\u2019\u2019When I told Raszap that these last anxieties sounded like the sort of thing that might benefit more from psychotherapy than from behavior-modification techniques, he agreed. \u2018\u2018I do have a good therapist, and we do talk about this,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018But it\u2019s a different approach. Therapy is more about grand life narratives. Applied rationality is more practical, like, \u2018What if you went to jujitsu in the evening, rather than at lunch?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019Yet applied rationality doesn\u2019t typically acknowledge this gap. Proponents of rationality tend to talk about the brain as a kind of second-rate computer, jammed full of old legacy software but possible to reprogram if you can master the code. The reality, though, is almost certainly more complex. We often can\u2019t see our biggest blind spots clearly or recognize their influence without outside help.Several weeks after the workshop, I asked Salamon whether CFAR was intended to be a kind of D.I.Y. therapy, because that seemed to be how some participants were using it. She demurred, saying that the instructors have occasionally recommended counseling to participants who exhibit truly alarming behaviors and beliefs. But she considered therapy-grade problems to be relatively rare. \u2018\u2018Ninety percent of the time, when people aren\u2019t remembering to fill out their expense forms, there\u2019s nothing deep there,\u2019\u2019 Salamon said. Even when a participant does have a deep-seated issue, she added, the techniques can still be effective. \u2018\u2018You just have to give things a bit more space,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018And not expect that they\u2019ll yield to hacks.\u2019\u2019And while some exercises seemed useful, other parts of the workshop \u2014 the lack of privacy or downtime, the groupthink, the subtle insistence that behaving otherwise was both irrational and an affront to \u2018\u2018science\u2019\u2019 \u2014 felt creepy, even cultish. In the days before the workshop, I repeatedly asked whether I could sleep at home, because I lived just a 15-minute drive away. Galef was emphatic that I should not. \u2018\u2018People really get much more out of the workshop when they stay on-site,\u2019\u2019 she wrote. \u2018\u2018This is a strong trend ... and the size of the effect is quite marked.\u2019\u2019As it turns out, I wasn\u2019t the only one to find the workshop disorienting. One afternoon, I sat on the front steps with Richard Hua, a programmer at Microsoft who was also new to CFAR. Since the workshop began, Hua told me, he had sensed \u2018\u2018a lot of interesting manipulation going on.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018There\u2019s something about being in there that feels hypnotic to me,\u2019\u2019 he added. \u2018\u2018I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a social pressure, exactly, but you kind of feel obliged to think like the people around you.\u2019\u2019 Another woman, who recently left her software job in Portland, Ore., to volunteer with CFAR, said her commitment to rationality had already led to difficulties with her family and friends. (When she mentioned this, Smith proposed that she make new friends \u2014 ones from the rationalist community.)But there was also the fact that the vibe was just a little strange, what with the underlying interest in polyamory and cryonics, along with the widespread concern that the apocalypse, in the form of a civilization-destroying artificial intelligence, was imminent. When I asked why a group of rationalists would disproportionately share such views, people tended to cite the mind-expanding powers of rational thought. \u2018\u2018This community is much more open to actually evaluating weird ideas,\u2019\u2019 Andrew told me. \u2018\u2018They\u2019re willing to put in the effort to explore the question, rather than saying: \u2018Oh, this is outside my window. Bye.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 But the real reason, many acknowledged, was CFAR\u2019s connection to Yudkowsky. Compulsive and rather grandiose, Yudkowsky is known for proclaiming the imminence of the A.I. apocalypse (\u2018\u2018I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if tomorrow was the Final Dawn, the last sunrise before the earth and sun are reshaped into computing elements\u2019\u2019) and his own role as savior (\u2018\u2018I think my efforts could spell the difference between life and death for most of humanity\u2019\u2019).When I asked Galef and Smith whether they worried that the group\u2019s association with Yudkowsky might be off-putting, they seemed genuinely mystified. Galef said the group designed its own curriculum, without consulting Yudkowsky, and also worked hard to remain \u2018\u2018value neutral,\u2019\u2019 emphasizing the techniques of rational thought rather than focusing on MIRI. Smith was more direct. Yudkowsky, he said, is \u2018\u2018entangled in our origins.\u2019\u2019 Then he shrugged. Newton was a jerk, he pointed out, \u2018\u2018but that doesn\u2019t affect physics.\u2019\u2019To keep people on track, CFAR holds online practice sessions for 10 weeks after a workshop and also assigns \u2018\u2018accountability buddies\u2019\u2019 to encourage participation. The center is debating whether to develop an online version of its workshops that anyone can access. At the same time, it is also considering whether it would be \u2018\u2018higher impact\u2019\u2019 to focus on teaching rationality to a small group of influential people, like policy makers, scientists and tech titans. \u2018\u2018When I think about the things that have caused human society to advance, many of them seem to stem from new and better ways of thinking,\u2019\u2019 Galef added. \u2018\u2018And while the self-help function of the workshops is great, I wouldn\u2019t be devoting my life to this if that was all that I thought we were doing.\u2019\u2019I hadn\u2019t planned to practice the techniques myself, but in the weeks after the workshop ended, I found myself using them often. I began to notice when I was avoiding work \u2014 \u2018\u2018finishing\u2019\u2019 a section of the newspaper (unit bias!) or doing other unproductive foot-dragging \u2014 and then rationalizing the lost time as mental \u2018\u2018preparation.\u2019\u2019 I also found myself experimenting more and noting the results: working in a library rather than a coffee shop (more effective); signing up and paying for spin classes in advance (ditto); going to a museum on the weekend rather than doing something outdoors (so-so). Against all odds, the workshop had cracked open a mental window: Instead of merely muddling through, I began to consider how my habits might be changed. And while it was hard to tell whether this shift was because of the techniques themselves or simply because I had spent four days focusing intensely on those habits, the effect was the same. Instead of feeling stuck in familiar ruts, I felt productive, open and willing to try new things. I even felt a bit happier.When I emailed some of the other participants, most reported a similar experience. Mike Plotz, the juggler turned coder, told me that he had recently done \u2018\u2018a flurry of goal-factoring.\u2019\u2019 Among other things, he wanted to understand why he spent so much time checking Facebook every morning before work. Plotz said that he knew the Facebook habit wasn\u2019t helping him and that he often ended up running late and feeling harried. After goal-factoring the problem, Plotz said, he realized that what he really wanted was autonomy: the feeling of being able to choose what he did each morning. Now, he said, rather than passively resisting work through Facebook, he gets up an hour earlier and does whatever he wants. \u2018\u2018This morning I got up, made coffee and listened to \u2018Moby-Dick,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Plotz said when we spoke. \u2018\u2018So I\u2019d say that, so far, it\u2019s going well.\u2019\u2019I asked Plotz if he could tell whether the changes he made were due to the applied-rationality techniques or simply the product of a more active, problem-solving mind-set. \u2018\u2018In some ways, I think the techniques are that: a way to kick you into a more productive state of mind,\u2019\u2019 he told me. But he also noted that they supplied a framework, a strategy for working through the questions that such a mind-set might raise. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s one thing to notice your thoughts and behaviors,\u2019\u2019 Plotz said. \u2018\u2018Turning that into a technique that actually lets you accomplish stuff? That\u2019s hard.\u2019\u2019Jennifer Kahn is a contributing writer for the magazine.

Then, he will speak at the United Automobile Workers-General Motors Center for Human Resources on the Detroit Riverfront. He is also planning to have lunch with Mike Duggan, the Detroit mayor, and highlight the support his administration has provided to that city, including after it declared bankruptcy in 2013, through federal funds to eliminate blight and through initiatives to bolster transportation and housing.The success story stands in stark contrast to embattled Flint, the birthplace of General Motors and the U.A.W. \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

The worst financial crises since the Great Depression.\u00e2\u0080\u009dRather than poking at Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policies as she has done in recent weeks, Mrs. Clinton returned to an earlier theme of connecting the Republican presidential candidates of advocating a so-called trickle down economic philosophy that hurts working people.\u00e2\u0080\u009cEverything I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve just said the Republicans disagree with,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery single one of them has put forward policies that would cut taxes even more on the wealthy.\u00e2\u0080\u009dShe brought up Mr. Sanders in the friendliest of terms to try to reassure caucusgoers here that she would be sufficiently tough on Wall Street. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have the toughest, most effective plan to go after Wall Street and the financial industry of anyone running,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have an esteemed opponent in Senator Sanders, who I really respect, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s made a big issue about this.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cSenator Sanders has been very clear and passionate about breaking up the big banks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton continued, and reminded the audience that the Dodd-Frank regulatory act allows the government to break up the major financial firms. (Mr. Sanders has pleased liberals in his calling for reinstating the 1939 Glass-Steagall Act to break up the banks, which Mrs. Clinton does not support.)\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have said I will break them up because no bank should be too big to fail and no executive too powerful to jail, but we already have the authority,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton said.

(\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you want me to go down there with a mop?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked sarcastically.)Mr. Christie said that the comment had been a joke and that he suspected the question had been planted by rivals seeking to undermine his campaign. The young woman had described herself as having family and friends in New Jersey affected by the storm, but Mr. Christie said she had declined to share any details about how to contact them.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think she was a plant, quite frankly, because she wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give any of the information,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Christie said at a news conference in Trenton about Atlantic City\u2019s financial crisis. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI genuinely wanted to call her family members who were concerned.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cEither she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a really shy person who decided to ask the first question in a town-hall meeting, and just overcame her shyness for that period of time, or something else was afoot.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Christie acknowledged, however, that he had called Mayor Patrick Rosenello of North Wildwood on Tuesday morning and apologized for having insulted him at the same meeting.Though Mr. Christie said his comment had been \u00e2\u0080\u009cover the top,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he stood by his assessment that the scale of damage from the blizzard over the weekend did not approach that caused by Hurricane Sandy in 2012.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI mean, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not even close,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not even in the same ballpark.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Rosenello had said that in his town, the flooding was worse this past weekend than it had been during Hurricane Sandy. After the governor called him \u201ccrazy,\u201d the mayor said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to speculate on whether his position on this storm is in any way shape or form related to his presidential ambitions,\u201d according to The Philadelphia Inquirer.On Tuesday Mr. Rosenello said in an interview that he had not meant that the damage in his town, which was not as badly hit by the 2012 hurricane as towns farther north, exceeded the hurricane damage in those towns. But because of \u201cmiscommunication,\u201d he said, his remark had been interpreted that way.While the governor told reporters Tuesday that he was friends with the mayor and that they had known each other for several years, Mr. Rosenello said that he has never exactly been close friends with Mr. Christie. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not drinking buddies,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.But he had been an early supporter in his run for governor.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI remember the first time I met him, nobody knew who he was,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Rosenello. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was introducing him to people.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe said Mr. Christie has met his children, and they look up to him.\u201cThere was a personal element I reacted to,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Rosenello, 43, said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was surprising to me to hear those comments, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m grateful he took the time to call me and apologize.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMore than anything, though, the mayor has just been left surprised by the attention paid to the back-and-forth.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI got sucked into a vortex there I never imagined, never wanted to experience, and never want to experience again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Rosenello said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not what I signed up for whenever I became mayor of a small town.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Obama\u2019s Gun Initiative Seen as Having Limited Effect on Unlicensed Dealers", "Date": "2016-01-07", "News": "Supported byJack Strahan has been a small-time trader of guns and gun parts for years, and he is not stopping now.\u201cIt\u2019s the way we do it down here,\u201d said Mr. Strahan, 67, who has worked a number of odd jobs over the years in Hudson, Fla., and who says he sells, at most, a few guns a year. His current collection includes an AK-47, an AR-15, a Remington 742 and several Mossberg shotguns.\u201cYou get a gun, you play with it for a while, then you trade or sell it, then get another one,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to stop us doing that.\u201dMr. Strahan is one in a large universe of gun enthusiasts who buy and sell firearms \u2014 online, at gun shows and even on Facebook \u2014 with no dealer\u2019s license, no official records and no criminal background checks.Federal Bureau of Investigation records show that nearly 21 million gun sales were processed through the background-check system in 2014, and retail sales of firearms came to an estimated $3.1 billion in 2015, according to IBISWorld, a research firm. But some industry analysts say as many as 40 percent more firearms might have been sold through private transactions not subject to background checks \u2014 a figure that gun advocates vigorously dispute.On Tuesday, President Obama thrust enthusiasts like Mr. Strahan into the spotlight by clarifying that even irregular gun sellers could be considered dealers under federal law, and could face stiff penalties for selling firearms without a license.\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see scores of individuals racing to A.T.F. to be licensed as a dealer,\u201d said Mike Sullivan, the former director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which issues federal licenses to gun dealers.\u201cIf you are engaged in the business of selling firearms, and you know that, and you\u2019re knowingly not pursuing a license, this is not going to make you go out and get a license,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said.Despite its limited scope, gun-control advocates have welcomed Mr. Obama\u2019s actions as a way to crack down on a small segment of unlicensed dealers who are thought to sell dozens or even hundreds of firearms a year.On Wednesday, a White House spokesman, Josh Earnest, said that clarifying the penalties for \u201chiding behind the hobbyist exemption\u201d would spur a substantial number of sellers to comply with existing law.\u201cWhat this does suggest is that high-volume sellers make up an important but relatively small share of the gun sales without background checks that are currently occurring in the United States,\u201d said Ted Alcorn, research director at Everytown and author of the study.Going after this group, though small, gives law enforcement officials \u201cmore bang for their buck\u201d in cutting down on unlicensed gun sales. But he said it was unclear how much Mr. Obama\u2019s actions would affect the behavior of smaller sellers who made up the bulk of unlicensed gun sales.Armslist did not respond to a request for comment.Scott Schmoke, a chef in Daytona Beach, Fla., says he uses Facebook forums to post listings for the two to three guns he sells a year. For now, he has no plans to get a dealer\u2019s license, though he said some of his friends were considering getting one after Tuesday\u2019s announcement.Mr. Schmoke, 53, said he was a responsible seller. He never ships guns through the mail and always meets buyers in person. Like Mr. Strahan, he asks to see a driver\u2019s license, but a background check is not required.\u201cIf I think they\u2019re thugs or drug dealers, I use my own judgment and don\u2019t sell,\u201d Mr. Schmoke said.Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But in 2014, the social network said it was taking steps to regulate gun sales on its site, including deleting posts that seek to circumvent gun laws, and restricting minors from viewing pages that sell guns. People can still purchase guns legally online. But guns must be shipped to a licensed dealer who can perform a background check on the buyer.\u201cNobody is buying guns on the Internet legally right now without going through a background check,\u201d he said.Of course, the Internet is not the only source of unlicensed gun sales. Gun shows have long been the target of law enforcement because they are often heavily attended by enthusiasts, collectors and sellers.\u201cIf you go to a place like Arizona or Texas, you\u2019ve got individuals who go to gun shows, they advertise on the Internet, maybe they sell out of homes,\u201d said William Vizzard, a former A.T.F. agent and professor emeritus at California State University in Sacramento. \u201cI\u2019ve seen as many as 250 guns on a table at a gun show, and often they don\u2019t run any checks.\u201dThere is no consensus about whether most sales at gun shows involve background checks.Ms. Jubinski said she did not expect Mr. Obama\u2019s actions to have much effect on turnout or sales at her gun shows, including one scheduled this weekend in Binghamton, N.Y., which will feature about 100 dealers of guns and other hunting gear.\u201cEvery now and then, we\u2019ve seen people out in the parking lot with the trunk open, trying to sell guns,\u201d said Ms. Jubinski, 61.\u201cWe call the police on them.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The digital spot, which also aired on cable television, showed Mrs. Clinton speaking to the camera and invoking Mr. Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s push for new gun control measures as a chance for voters to decide whether candidates stand with the president or against him. Mrs. Clinton did not name Mr. Sanders, but she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to. Mrs. Clinton, who was such a prohibitive leader in polls that her presence in the race discouraged some Democratic elected officials from challenging her, finds herself in a tightening contest with Mr. Sanders, a self-described Democratic socialist and independent from Vermont. There are clear shades of warlike flashbacks for Mrs. Clinton and her aides. Harking back to her 2008 days trying to fend off Mr. Obama, then a senator, in the primaries, Mrs. Clinton talked on Tuesday about the belief that a \u00e2\u0080\u009cmagic wand\u00e2\u0080\u009d can be waved to fix all problems \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a line she used then to paint Mr. Obama as na\u00c3\u00afve, and is using now similarly on Mr. Sanders.

So have the political arm of Planned Parenthood and former Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, a victim of gun violence.

Chris Christie of New Jersey, smarting from weeks of negative commercials against him in New Hampshire, has struck back at several Republican opponents in animated appearances on the campaign trail this week.One rival has drawn especially biting attacks: Senator Marco Rubio of Florida.Mr. Christie has long criticized Mr. Rubio for lacking executive experience. But in recent days he has dialed up his attacks, repeatedly deriding Mr. Rubio as a political lightweight in a tone that verges on contempt.In an appearance on Boston Herald Radio on Wednesday, Mr. Christie dismissed Mr. Rubio as \u00e2\u0080\u009ca 44-year-old first-term senator who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never accomplished anything,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and ridiculed an interviewer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suggestion that Republicans could rally around Mr. Rubio as an alternative to Donald J. Trump.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe only thing that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ever done in the United States Senate is write an amnesty bill with Chuck Schumer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Christie said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd then as soon as the heat got high, he ran away and hid and now claims he had nothing to do with it.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe Wednesday broadside caps a week of hard swipes from Mr. Christie against Mr. Rubio, and may signal to Republican elites \u00e2\u0080\u0093 who have grown impatient with the fractious primary race \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that uniting party support behind one establishment-friendly candidate remains a distant prospect.No other Republican has attracted such criticism from Mr. Christie. On the radio Wednesday, Mr. Christie added that while it was too soon to rally behind any one candidate, he considered former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida and Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio to be his friends, and \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery good governors.\u00e2\u0080\u009dJoe Pounder, a spokesman for the Rubio campaign, said in response to Mr. Christie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s radio interview that the governor \u00e2\u0080\u009cmust be frustrated that conservatives aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t rallying around his record of supporting abortion rights, Planned Parenthood, gun control, Common Core, and Obama Supreme Court picks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

He doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mention that he has the second most, behind only Jeb Bush.On Tuesday, he told voters that the attack ads being run against him in Iowa and elsewhere were being paid for not with small donations from grass-roots conservatives, but by very wealthy people. He didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mention that his own campaign has not done well with small donors, or that his supporters include some of the wealthiest and most influential Republican financiers.With push coming to shove in the final days before the Iowa caucuses, Mr. Rubio is trying to persuade conservative Republican voters that he is the most anti-establishment establishment candidate.All along, his strategy has been to make himself acceptable to most segments of the party: the activists in the heartland and the power brokers in Washington; the deeply religious conservatives and the more moderate, less church-going crowd; the pro-interventionist hawks; the fiscal conservatives. As Donald J.

{"Headline": "Lawsuit Questions Ted Cruz\u2019s Eligibility to Be President", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Donald J. Trump predicted that the lawsuits against Senator Ted Cruz, doubting\u00c2\u00a0his constitutional eligibility to be president, would start trickling in as questions continued to percolate about the fact that he was born in Canada. As the Republican candidates gathered to debate in South Carolina on Thursday, one had already been filed.\u201cThe entire nation cannot afford such constitutional confusion and uncertainties overhanging the electorate process,\u201d Mr. Schwartz, who lives and practices law in Mr. Cruz\u2019s home state of Texas, wrote in the 73-page lawsuit.Mr. Trump has\u00c2\u00a0brought up the issue of Mr. Cruz\u2019s eligibility as the Texas senator\u2019s poll numbers have climbed, arguing that the Republican Party cannot risk the possibility that a Cruz nomination would be tied up in court. Mr. Cruz, along with many\u00c2\u00a0legal experts, contend that there is no constitutional basis for such questions. While\u00c2\u00a0Mr. Trump has promised not to sue, he has warned on several occasions that Democrats will look to disqualify Mr. Cruz.Mr. Schwartz appears to be the first to have done so.\u201cThe country would be in chaos,\u201d Mr. Schwartz said in an interview on Friday, in which he discussed the prospect of someone who was not eligible to run being elected president.Mr. Schwartz said he has no ties to Mr. Trump and that he is not a fan of the billionaire developer. He is, however, a Democrat who voted for President Obama and said he plans to support Senator Bernie Sanders.Although Mr. Schwartz said that a judge has already been assigned to the case and that he is prepared to take it to the Supreme Court, legal scholars\u00c2\u00a0remain skeptical that it could get that far.Peter Spiro, a law professor at Temple University who reviewed the filing, noted that the arguments were meandering and the language was full of typographical errors. But of greater concern, he said, is the probability that Mr. Schwartz does not have legal standing to bring such a case against Mr. Cruz.Many agree that the definition of a \u201cnatural born citizen\u201d \u2014 a constitutional requirement for seeking the presidency \u00e2\u0080\u0094 remains muddled. The issue has not been decided by the courts because most lawyers think it would require a presidential candidate, or an opponent of one who can claim \u201cinjury,\u201d for courts to consider the merits of the case. Mr. Schwartz argues in his complaint that because he is a voter, he has standing to bring the lawsuit.According to Mr. Spiro, being a voter is too broad a classification to have standing and that the most realistic situation that would bring legal clarity would be for Mr. Cruz to file a lawsuit in the event that a state elections commissioner decided to take him off the ballot because of his Canadian roots. The suggestion that Mr. Trump has made, urging Mr. Cruz to seek a \u201cdeclaratory judgment,\u201d is also unrealistic, Mr. Spiro said, because courts do not offer such guidance unless there is an active case.\u201cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s zero chance of a court getting to the merits on this claim,\u201d Mr. Spiro said. \u201cIf Trump wants to put his money where his mouth is, he should be the one filing for a declaratory judgment against state election commissioners who put Cruz\u2019s name on the ballot.\u201d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

He then hosted two town-hall-style meetings as well as a speech that was streamed live online. His message: Mrs. Clinton is getting nervous and so is Wall Street.\u00e2\u0080\u009cEight years ago, Obama was being attacked for everything,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders told 700 people in Clinton, Iowa. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis ideas were pie in the sky. He did not have the experience that was needed. But you know what? People in Iowa saw through those attacks then and they are going to see through those attacks again.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Sanders, who frequently mentions the millions of dollars in speaking fees that Mrs. Clinton earned from Wall Street companies, noted that some of the \u00e2\u0080\u009csuper PAC\u00e2\u0080\u009d ads attacking him were supported by Wall Street donors.

{"Headline": "One Syrian\u2019s Journey From Hometown Rebel to ISIS Bomber", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byThe Saturday ProfileBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 IN the early years of Syria\u2019s revolt, he filmed protests in the streets of his rebel-held neighborhood, in the historic center of the city of Homs. He chanted for dignity and freedom with a green, white and black banner, the old version of the national flag.When government forces besieged the old city, he grew vegetables on the roof of his family\u2019s house; he cried over leaving tomatoes on the vine as he departed reluctantly under a cease-fire. Later, homesick, he quoted his sister\u2019s poetry: \u201cThere is nothing warmer than your neighborhood, your country, your house.\u201dEven during the darkest times, he joked and even flirted with reporters around the world, briefing them on battles, lacing his text messages to them with smiley faces and flowers. \u201cSoon,\u201d he teased once during an online chat, \u201cwe\u2019ll have our engagement.\u201dThe man who called himself Abu Bilal al-Homsi was, in short, a classic hometown rebel. A media activist, he was well known to foreign journalists, an advocate for the rebels fighting against the government but also an important source of information. He used a nom de guerre to protect his relatives from reprisals, which could still come against his family if his real name were revealed now.No foreign jihadist, he was a Syrian fighting to change his own country and defend his own neighborhood, and while he was religiously conservative, he seemed open to the outside world. So his old friends were shocked last month to learn that he had blown himself up, becoming, as the extremist Islamic State put it in its online praise, a \u201cknight of martyrdom.\u201d\u201cI never thought Abu Bilal would do that,\u201d said a friend, Jalal al-Talawy, who worked closely with him from the early protest days through the siege. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t an extremist or a fanatic. But his whole attitude changed during the siege.\u201dAbu Bilal\u2019s trajectory follows an arc common to a number of fighters and activists who started with relatively secular, nationalist rebel groups and moved first to the Islamists, and then to extremists like ISIS.Some young insurgents switch their allegiance to ISIS out of ideological commitment, or coercion, or because it is their best or only option to secure arms, money and protection. But in the maddening environment of the siege of Homs, Mr. Talawy said, Abu Bilal\u2019s attitudes \u2014 not to speak of his own \u2014 grew more and more sectarian.Many besieged fighters, Mr. Talawy said, started to hate Alawites, who belong to the same sect as Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad, and dominate senior security positions. \u201cBefore the revolution, we never had this feeling toward any sect,\u201d he said. \u201cBut after what we passed through, our attitude changed. We hated the regime and those who are \u2018pro\u2019 them.\u201d\u201cWe will come back to this land, and we will liberate it with our blood and our body parts,\u201d Abu Bilal declared in a video he made at the time. Then he headed north and east to join ISIS, while Mr. Talawy chose to pull back from extremism, sticking with insurgent groups opposed to Mr. Assad and to ISIS.Abu Bilal, who was 28, grew up in old Homs, but his activist friends from there said they know little of his childhood, having met him during protests against Mr. Assad in 2011. Abu Bilal\u2019s neighborhood, Bab al-Dreib, was one of the first to join in, and he was one of the first to become deeply involved, Mr. Talawy said.Abu Bilal had big, sleepy eyes, chubby cheeks and a talent for communication. He spent hours online, briefing reporters about protests, battles and bombardments that were harder and harder for journalists to cover in person.Following the exploits of ISIS online, Abu Bilal held out hope that its commanders might be more honorable. In his messages to journalists, he started to blame Alawites for the suffering in Homs.Abu Bilal whiled away the claustrophobic, empty hours by chatting online and by text. One contact, he said, was a wealthy Lebanese woman with a sports car, who sent pictures of herself in skimpy outfits from trips to Italy.\u201cNot even Haifa would dare to take these pictures!\u201d he said, referring to a Lebanese pop diva known for her revealing outfits.Another online contact, a Tunisian woman, proved more important. It turned out she had followed her brother, an Islamic State fighter, to Raqqa, Syria. Eventually, he asked for her hand in marriage.But first came the difficult departure from Homs. Abu Bilal raged on Facebook at rebel leaders and international powers, and especially the United Nations officials who had helped facilitate the evacuation.\u201cThey claim they are neutral \u2014 how neutral?\u201d he wrote, accusing the officials of helping Mr. Assad and his government. \u201cThey are participating with the butcher to kick the people out of their lands and houses, instead of punishing the criminal regime.\u201dWeeks later, ISIS swept into much of Iraq, taking over the city of Mosul and declaring a caliphate. Abu Bilal was thrilled, and defended the group against fellow rebels who accused it of ignoring the fight against Mr. Assad to establish its state.\u201cWait before you judge,\u201d he wrote on Facebook. \u201cThey are devout, pure Muslims. They left everything for jihad.\u201dHe made time for an act of kindness, helping an anti-Assad, anti-ISIS activist from Palmyra \u2014 an old friend \u2014 smooth relations with the group. The friend, Khaled al-Homsi, who also uses a nom de guerre for safety, said that bought him enough time to escape.After his marriage, Abu Bilal communicated less with female reporters \u2014 though when he did, he still sometimes called them by poetic nicknames, like \u201cMother of Eyes.\u201d But he assiduously courted his old friends from Homs, trying to recruit them to ISIS and offering to help them pay to be smuggled to the group\u2019s territory.The last signal they got from him was cryptic. His status changed on his social media accounts. It now said, \u201cForgive me.\u201dHis sister and parents, financially struggling refugees in a neighboring country, refuse to talk about him. \u201cWhat do you want to write, to give advice to others not to be like him?\u201d his sister said bitterly over the phone.\u201cMy brother was martyred, and he was still normal,\u201d she said. \u201cMay God accept him.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook to Shut Down Parse, Its Platform for Mobile Developers", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Most of what Parse does involves things most people will never see. Parse helps developers with support and tools, so that independent programmers can spend more time writing code and less time on keeping up the back end. Developers who use Parse include those at Quip, a productivity app, and Expedia\u2019s Orbitz, a travel website. Facebook would make money from Parse by storing data from developers and sending customers product notifications.Achieving that goal, however, would be no easy feat. Microsoft, Google and Amazon have similar developer offerings, along with a much richer set of other computing tools and services that developers need. Amazon Web Services, in particular, has in the past two years stressed both its developer tools and analytic services, so companies can think about what to build next. In every case, these companies can also benefit by selling other computing services, like complex commercial databases, which Facebook does not provide.Parse seemed like a good opportunity for expansion. At the time, Internet businesses were in the midst of a major industry change, as users were shifting away from desktop computing and increasingly relying on mobile devices. Parse, the thinking went, could provide Facebook the opportunity to be the foundation of a whole new generation of developers building mobile apps in the age of the smartphone.Facebook also would have had to invest untold millions of dollars in capital and, more importantly, engineering talent, to get the Parse business fully off the ground to have a better chance at making a dent in competitors like Amazon, Microsoft and Google.Moreover, Facebook has already made two big, risky bets in Oculus, the virtual reality platform, and WhatsApp, the messaging service. Neither service currently generates material revenue for Facebook.Parse may have touched millions of people through the apps that developers built there, but that mattered little against Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s size. With more than 1.5 billion registered users, a population of even 15 million customers is not 1 percent of Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s audience. Building up Parse, it seems, eventually became more of a distraction than it was worth.\u201cMoving forward we want to dedicate more resources to high-impact products and services in areas like analytics, monetization, discovery, and authentication,\u201d Michael Kirkland, a Facebook spokesman, said in a statement. \u201cAs a result, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made the difficult decision to wind down support for Parse.\u201dOther Silicon Valley companies have encountered similar difficulties. Inside Cisco Systems, in its heyday, there was pressure to build businesses that yielded $1 billion or more in revenue, since anything less could not affect the overall company. Facebook, which unlike other clouds has not sought to rent computing and software to businesses, must essentially find this from social networking.Developers who used Parse will have a set of tools and a year-long window to be able to migrate their data off of the platform to other services.\u201cWe\u2019re proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished together with the Parse community, and we thank them for their support,\u201d Mr. Kirkland said.FollowAdvertisement"}

Tracy, 50, a tenured associate professor of communications at the Boca Raton university, has repeatedly called into question the authenticity of recent mass shootings, including the slaying of churchgoers in Charleston, S.C., and office workers in San Bernardino, Calif. In his blog postings and radio interviews, Mr. Tracy has said the Newtown massacre may have been carried out by \u201ccrisis actors\u201d employed by the Obama administration.Mr. Tracy\u2019s ideas fall into part of a larger movement of Internet conspiracy theorists who believe the spate of mass murders have simply been staged by the government. A few of the theorists do not think the shootings took place at all.Mr. Tracy continued his clash with the Pozners on Facebook, where he called the Newtown shootings a \u201cdrill,\u201d a reference to a theory that the massacre was an exercise in which no one died staged by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.Mr. Tracy, who has taught at the university since 2002, has also spread his views in the classroom, saying in interviews that it is his job as an academic to spark debate among students.\u201cIt is the responsibility of the employee to report outside activity on activity forms so that the administration can address potential, actual, or perceived conflicts of commitment or interest,\u201d wrote Diane Alperin, the university\u2019s vice provost. Since Mr. Tracy\u2019s first blog post appeared in 2013 shortly after the Newtown shootings, his views have caused the university mounting embarrassment. The university first reprimanded Mr. Tracy that year for failing to make clear to readers and listeners that his views were his own and did not reflect the institution\u2019s positions.Mr. Tracy went on to write blog posts and speak out about the Boston Marathon bombings and the Paris shootings. He was reprimanded in November for \u201cinsubordination and failure to follow university policy.\u201dAn article on Thursday about a decision by Florida Atlantic University to fire a professor who repeatedly questioned the authenticity of recent mass shootings misidentified, in one instance, the person dismissed.

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "In the early 1960s, when African-American photographers were keenly aware of their isolation in a field dominated by white men, two collectives held a joint meeting. The result of that encounter was a decision to merge and form a more robust group they called Kamoinge, which in Kenya\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Kikuyu language means a group of people acting together.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe saw ourselves as a group who were trying to nurture each other,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Louis Draper, a founding member of the Kamoinge Workshop who died in 2002, once wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe had no outlets. The magazines wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t support our work. So we wanted to encourage each other \u2026 to give each other feedback. We tried to be a force, especially for younger people.\u00e2\u0080\u009dTo commemorate its 50th anniversary, the workshop has published \u00e2\u0080\u009cTimeless: Photographs by Kamoinge\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Schiffer), a survey of its evolving and wide-ranging work and an important contribution to the history of photography. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe speak of our lives as only we can,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Draper wrote about the personal and individualistic perspective of Kamoinge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s African-American photographers, and the book affirms that with a multifaceted, richly textured and global view of the black experience. Today, even as media depictions of people of color continue to rely on negative stereotypes and clich\u00c3\u00a9s, these pictures resonate with complexity.A continuing exploration of the relationship of race to photographic portrayals of race by the professor and curator Maurice Berger.Founding members of the workshop included Mr. Draper, Albert Fennar, Ray Francis, Herman Howard, Earl James, James Mannas, Calvin Mercer, Herbert Randall, Larry Stewart, Shawn Walker and Calvin Wilson. Roy DeCarava, who helped shape the group and give it direction, was voted its first director. As the group expanded and its roster changed \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Mr. DeCarava left the workshop in 1965, and its first female photographer, Ming Smith, joined in 1972 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it supported a range of projects. These included exhibitions, initially at the gallery and meeting space the workshop rented in a Harlem brownstone and later at the Countee Cullen Library, the Studio Museum in Harlem, the International Center of Photography and other sites. The workshop also hosted lectures and group critiques and published portfolios, which it distributed to museums. The book includes a brooding and elegant portrait of the writer and activist Amiri Baraka; a silhouette of bass players in a Lower East Side club; an austere bird\u2019s-eye view of a city park in winter; a photo of a child in Bedford-Stuyvesant learning how to tie a necktie; a haunting image of a sheet hanging on a clothesline, evoking Ku Klux Klan hoods; an arid Malian landscape, camels resting in the distance; a jarring photograph of a mother holding a toddler in Louisiana, an electronic monitoring device strapped to her leg; a dapper gentleman in a white fedora, his clothes an essay in bold contrasting patterns; and a study of children playing in a Rwandan refugee camp.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe photographs are a rich contrast to the \u00e2\u0080\u0098headline\u00e2\u0080\u0099 images that have circulated worldwide about black communities known only as the roughest and toughest neighborhoods to live in,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the photographer and photo-historian Deborah Willis wrote in the book. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have seen countless images of black life across the diaspora and I consider these photographs to be a mosaic of the black experience; they expand our consciousness and challenge what we think we know about black life.\u00e2\u0080\u009dEmbracing abstraction, conceptualism, surrealism, portraiture, social documentary, performance documentation and landscape, cityscape and street photography, this work challenges the myth of a unified African-American aesthetic. Nevertheless, its interpretation has sometimes been limited by this idea: A Kamoinge portfolio published in the July 1966 issue of Camera, a leading Swiss photo magazine, was titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cHarlem\u00e2\u0080\u009d by an editor, despite its range of locations, content and viewpoints. Despite this misconception, Kamoinge photographers have approached their subjects from differing emotional, political and cultural perspectives. As the art historian Erina Duganne observed in an article on the diversity of the group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s imagery, \u00e2\u0080\u009crather than speak for African Americans as a group or act as a corrective lens, the Kamoinge members used their photographs to explore how the particularities of their individual circumstances \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including their collective experience of racial difference \u00e2\u0080\u0094 informed and complicated their art.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIf Kamoinge members worked together and learned from one another in order to change how global black life was represented, their photographs were also influenced by, and produced in dialogue with, eminent artists of all races. It is in this context that their work helps us to better understand not only the people and communities they engaged, but also aesthetic, cultural and social issues germane to the broader history of modern art and photography, a history from which these artists have been largely excluded.The workshop has evolved over the last half-century: Some participants have died, including Mr. Draper and Mr. Francis. New members were welcomed. Solo and group exhibitions were mounted and articles written about the group. Members opened studios, became college teachers and took on magazine and advertising assignments. But even as the Kamoinge Workshop grew in stature, its members remained focused on their profoundly individualistic creative mission.\u00e2\u0080\u009cKamoinge photographers have never followed the latest trends, but nonetheless we have been influenced by what is around us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d wrote Anthony Barboza, the current workshop president. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs artists, we are moved by all that happens every day; artists are sponges that absorb the feelings of the self and the world and reflect back what we see. Within each photograph is what the artist has lived, and you see the individual\u00e2\u0080\u0099s truth that has been breathed into the art form.\u00e2\u0080\u009dA companion exhibition, \u00e2\u0080\u009cKamoinge: Timeless,\u00e2\u0080\u009d is  on view at the Wilmer Jennings Gallery in New York through Feb. 20."}

She watched as the contraption molded sand and resin and spit out a two-foot three-dimensional replica of her \u00e2\u0080\u009cH\u00e2\u0080\u009d campaign logo.The director of the job-training program then told Mrs. Clinton that the material was made of discarded corncobs. She was impressed. She was excited. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, come on! Come on!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton said, putting a hand on his arm. Now, several weeks later, as Mrs. Clinton tells the story over and over on the stump, she mistakenly puts the 3D printer at a community college in a different city, and in a state that is not Iowa, which may or may not have a 3D printer.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was at the Black Hawk Community College,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton said at a rally in Des Moines on Monday, in her standard lead up to the 3D printing story.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey bought the biggest 3D printer in North America because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thinking about the future,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u2019re training people about how to use that.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe only problem: Black Hawk College is in Moline, Ill., which borders Davenport, Iowa, and which Mrs. Clinton did not visit.But somewhere between Waterloo, the breakneck schedule of campaigning across Iowa and the can-do spirit of Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policy-laden stump speech, the details became muddled along the way. A campaign spokeswoman said that Waterloo was in Black Hawk County and that is what Mrs. Clinton was referring to. In Dubuque on Monday afternoon, Mrs. Clinton, standing in front of a giant American flag, told the standing-room-only crowd, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was up at Black Hawk Community College,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and called the printer, which is actually at Cedar Valley, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca job magnet for Iowa and for the Midwest.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe details may have been mixed up, but Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s point speaks to her stump speech as a whole. It\u2019s a mix of policy details and American exceptionalism (particularly during the period when her husband was president) and it intersperses examples of real-life Iowa.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t buy this argument some folks made that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to build anything American anymore,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton told a crowd in Newton on Wednesday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne of the things that has convinced me is traveling around Iowa, seeing what is happening at your community colleges.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAgain, bringing it all back to that 3D printer.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

Mr. Trump has threatened in the past to skip debates, but his remarks Tuesday night were his strongest statement yet that he would not participate.Fox News said Mr. Trump\u2019s refusal to debate his rivals was \u201cnear unprecedented.\u201d\u201cThis is rooted in one thing \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Megyn Kelly, whom he has viciously attacked since August and has now spent four days demanding be removed from the debate stage,\u201d the network said in a statement.\u201cCapitulating to politicians\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ultimatums about a debate moderator violates all journalistic standards, as do threats, including the one leveled by Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski toward Megyn Kelly,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cIn a call on Saturday with a Fox News executive, Lewandowski stated that Megyn had a \u00e2\u0080\u0098rough couple of days after that last debate\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and he \u00e2\u0080\u0098would hate to have her go through that again.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Lewandowski was warned not to level any more threats, but he continued to do so. We can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give in to terrorizations toward any of our employees.\u201d The drama capped an increasingly heated war of words involving Mr. Trump, Ms. Kelly and Fox News as the debate neared and as Mr. Trump found himself facing the prospect of being questioned by her again before a national audience.Mr. Trump had lashed out against Ms. Kelly back in August over her questioning of him at a debate, when she asked if previous remarks he had made were a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpart of the war on women.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe clash between Mr. Trump and Fox News reignited over the last few weeks, as the network set out to defend Ms. Kelly from the repeated criticisms of Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump threw the first punch, tweeting that Ms. Kelly had a \u00e2\u0080\u009cconflict of interest\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cshould not be allowed to be the moderator of the next debate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The network was quick to respond, saying: \u201cMegyn Kelly has no conflict of interest.

I\u2019m not a big fan of hers at all,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the interview.Fox responded, again defending Ms. Kelly: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSooner or later Donald Trump, even if he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president, is going to have to learn that he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get to pick the journalists \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very surprised he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s willing to show that much fear about being questioned by Megyn Kelly.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut what seemed to really draw the ire of Mr. Trump was two statements put out by the network Tuesday morning. In one, Roger Ailes, the chairman and chief executive of Fox News, personally weighed in, saying in a statement that \u00e2\u0080\u009cMegyn Kelly is an excellent journalist and the entire network stands behind her \u00e2\u0080\u0094 she will absolutely be on the debate stage on Thursday night.\u00e2\u0080\u009dA statement from the network was even harsher, invoking President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Iran\u2019s supreme leader: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe learned from a secret back channel that the Ayatollah and Putin both intend to treat Donald Trump unfairly when they meet with him if he becomes president \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a nefarious source tells us that Trump has his own secret plan to replace the Cabinet with his Twitter followers to see if he should even go to those meetings.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Trump alluded to those two statements in a news conference on Tuesday before an event here, calling them \u00e2\u0080\u009cwise guy\u201d and adding, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI said bye-bye.\u201d He did not mention his decision not to attend the debate at his two rallies in Iowa.Mr. Lewandowski said that instead of attending Thursday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debate, Mr. Trump would hold an event in Iowa, raising money for wounded soldiers in the state. Mr. Trump\u2019s main rival in various polls, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, accused Mr. Trump of chickening out of the debate.\u201cIf Donald is afraid to defend his record, that speaks volumes,\u201d he said, before alluding to Mr. Putin: \u201cI promise you, Putin is a lot scarier than Megyn Kelly.\u201dMr. Trump made his remarks about skipping the event right after the Fox News debate moderator Bret Baier announced the debate lineup on the program \u201cSpecial Report.\u201dAnother of Mr. Trump\u2019s rivals, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, will rejoin the top tier of candidates on the stage Thursday, Fox News said, meaning eight candidates qualified to share the stage for the prime-time debate. Mr. Trump was to stand in the middle because he leads in polls nationally and in New Hampshire, and he is battling for the lead in Iowa polls against Mr. Cruz.For Mr. Paul, who chose not to participate in the undercard debate this month after failing to make the cut for the later debate, the return to the main stage reflects a recent rise in his poll numbers, particularly in New Hampshire. His campaign sought to capitalize on the good news, fund-raising on Twitter after his inclusion was announced on Fox News. Rounding out the top-tier field on Thursday are Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, Ben Carson, former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey.And former Gov. Jim Gilmore of Virginia, the Republican presidential candidate who has failed to qualify for the undercard debate every time except during Fox News\u2019s first debate, will return to the debate stage, participating in the earlier debate with Carly Fiorina, former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas and former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania.By MAGGIE HABERMAN and NICK CORASANITIMr. Trump and Fox News faced off again, this time over the anchor Megyn Kelly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inclusion as moderator for Thursday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debate.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Global Brands, Taking Cue From Tinkerers, Explore Crowdfunding", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byEntrepreneurshipCrowdfunding, a trend popularized by artists and tinkerers, is now so hot that corporate giants are looking for a way in. G.E.\u2019s approach is an unusually bold one, but a growing number of large companies are experimenting with programs intended to capture some of the creativity and passion that popular crowdfunded projects can inspire.\u201cThe conversations are very similar to the ones companies were having 15 years ago about social media \u2014 like, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu,\u201d said Jerry Needel, Indiegogo\u2019s head of revenue and corporate partnerships. \u201cIt\u2019s not just, \u2018We want to run a campaign, give us some best practices and we\u2019ll go do the rest.\u2019 It\u2019s much more early stage. It\u2019s, \u2018What should we do? What can we do? Let\u2019s figure it out.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIn many cases, major brands are investing their resources in the work of independent entrepreneurs.Some participants, like Fizzics, simply want Brookstone to sell their goods. Others are looking for a more extensive partnership.\u201cI\u2019m not an engineer, and neither is my co-founder,\u201d said Ms. Hu, who obtained a degree in political economy from the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cWe were searching pretty actively for more professional help.\u201dBrookstone spotted the project and reached out. Ms. Hu initially ignored the message, but after a production deal in China fell apart, she agreed to talk. With her and Ms. Yan\u2019s blessing, the company took over nearly all aspects of the project, including the manufacturing, shipping and customer service.\u201cOne of our priorities is to expand our innovation pipeline,\u201d said Thomas M. Via, Brookstone\u2019s chief executive. \u201cCrowdfunding seemed to be a natural place for us to go. We\u2019re counting on these unique items to be a growing percentage of our overall revenue.\u201d\u201cCreators of all shapes and sizes are welcome on Kickstarter,\u201d said David Gallagher, a Kickstarter spokesman. \u201cBackers ultimately decide what does well on Kickstarter, and they typically look for creators who are trying something genuinely new and creative.\u201dEthan Mollick, a crowdfunding researcher at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, thinks that is a very tricky pitch for big brands to pull off.\u201cThese are not normal transactions,\u201d Mr. Mollick said. \u201cEveryone concentrates too much on \u2018funding\u2019 and not enough on \u2018crowd.\u2019 These are people investing in you because they want to believe in you, and to believe that you need their help.\u201dG.E. acknowledges a few misfires in its FirstBuild crowdfunding experiments \u2014 but not the ones it anticipated.The company, which spends $5 billion a year on research and development, got very little negative reaction for shaking the donation jar on Indiegogo to fund its product preorders, according to Natarajan Venkatakrishnan, FirstBuild\u2019s director. The Opal ice maker, FirstBuild\u2019s second crowdfunded product, significantly exceeded its $150,000 funding target.But the backers did not just want a device to eventually arrive in their mailboxes. They wanted to feel involved in and informed about its development.\u201cThey want a personal email in their inbox every couple of weeks,\u201d Mr. Venkatakrishnan said. \u201cThat\u2019s something we\u2019re still trying to find a balance on.\u201dAs brands pile in and attach themselves to crowdfunding successes, the original backers of successful projects sometimes feel squeezed out. It is like finding that your favorite indie band has gone corporate and booked a stadium tour.For some entrepreneurs, though, going mass-market is not a risk \u2014 it is the entire goal.Fizzics, based in Newark, gave Brookstone a few months of sales exclusivity in the United States, but in March, it plans to begin selling its machine through several more national retailers. The company also sees a commercial fit for its device at any place that serves beer, like breweries and sports bars.\u201cThis is a whole new category that we\u2019re building,\u201d Mr. Petracca said. \u201cWe\u2019re working on products with lower price points, and we\u2019re working on a higher-end product that does some very unique things.\u201dHe isn\u2019t worried about big brands overrunning the crowdfunding market.

{"Headline": "You Don\u2019t Need More Free Time", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "Supported byGray MatterOur study, which drew on data from more than 500,000 respondents to the Gallup Daily Poll, examined the day-to-day fluctuations and patterns in people\u2019s emotions, week after week. Two facts about emotional well-being emerged \u2014 one that was intuitive, the other surprising.The intuitive finding was that people\u2019s feelings of well-being closely tracked the workweek. As measured by things such as anxiety, stress, laughter and enjoyment, our well-being is lowest Monday through Thursday. The workweek is a slog. Well-being edges up on Friday, and really peaks on Saturday and Sunday. We are, in a real sense, living for the weekend.The surprising finding was that this is also true of unemployed people. We found that the jobless showed almost exactly the same day-to-day pattern in emotional well-being as working people did. Their positive emotions soared on the weekend, and dropped back down again on Monday.It seems obvious why working people cherish the weekend: It\u2019s a respite from work. But why is the weekend also so important to the unemployed?The key to answering this question is to recognize that not all time is equal. Time is, in many ways, what sociologists call a \u201cnetwork good.\u201dNetwork goods are things that derive their value from being widely shared. Take your computer: Its value depends in large measure on how many other people also have a computer. This is because you use your computer as, among other things, a communication technology: for Internet access, email, Facebook and file sharing. When everyone you know has a computer, the technology is indispensable. But if you were the only person with a computer, its value would be limited.Free time is also a network good. The weekend derives much of its importance from the fact that so many people are off work together.To help demonstrate this, my colleague and I conducted a second study, this time using the American Time Use Survey, which tracks how much time people spend doing various activities. We found that the weekly cycle in well-being from our previous study was mirrored in the pattern of time that people spent with family and friends \u2014 which was roughly double on weekends what it was during the week. According to our calculations, this increase of social time on the weekend accounted for roughly half the spike in weekend well-being.Again, this was the same for the jobless. Monday to Friday offers five days when the unemployed are off work by themselves, searching job ads, doing household chores and so on. While the jobless have \u201cfree time\u201d during the week, their friends and family still have to go to work. The weekend is when the jobless fall back into sync with society.The weekend, then, is not just a respite from work, but also gives similar relief from unemployment. It is a time when people can get what they\u2019ve been missing: time together.This conclusion points to a key feature of the work-life problem: You cannot get more \u201cweekend\u201d simply by taking an extra day off work yourself. If we were to take more time off as individuals, we would be likely to spend that time, as the jobless do, waiting for other people to finish work. We are stuck \u201cat work,\u201d in a sense, by the work schedules of our family and friends.Over the past few years, many workplaces have looked for ways to create more flexibility in individual work schedules. There is no question that doing so has many benefits. But my research suggests that a disadvantage of these efforts is that they may lead us even further from a weekend-like system of coordinated social time. They threaten, ultimately, to exacerbate the decline in civic engagement and social contact known as the \u201cbowling alone\u201d problem.The solution might be found in a form of constraint: more standardization of the time for work and the time for life.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "Who was Vivian Maier?Maier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parents were unhappy in their marriage from the day she was born. She grew up in the shadow of an older brother who spent time in a vocational school and, later in life, a psychiatric hospital. Both Maier children spent time living with guardians other than their parents, from grandparents to foster parents. Meanwhile, both of Maier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grandmothers had negative things to say about their own children, her parents.And yet some of the family difficulties she encountered in childhood may have contributed to the photographer she became. From early childhood, Maier spent a significant amount of time with a woman named Jeanne Bertrand, who worked as a professional photographer, as well as other positive female role models.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u2019s always this incredible elusiveness about the maker of those photos,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jeffrey Goldstein, who was one of the first to acquire and champion her work. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo me, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s miraculous,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said of Ms. Marks\u00e2\u0080\u0099s research. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s absolutely miraculous.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe\u2019s basically picked up the obsession that I had in making the film,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Maloof\u00c2\u00a0said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut she\u2019s picked it up where I left off and continued with it. And she filled in a lot of blanks.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIt is always a pleasure to look through the photographs of Vivian Maier. Here are five previous Lens posts featuring her work.The film spurred Ms. Marks, a retired business executive who lives in New York, into action when she first saw it just over a year ago. She didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what she was getting into. Afterward, she said she felt that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere were so many loose ends, and mysteries,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and decided to do a little sleuthing.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wanted to challenge myself and show myself that I could find someone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Marks said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause I felt in the Internet age, when there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so much information, people can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t disappear anymore. And then, of course, once I got started, I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop.\u00e2\u0080\u009dVivian Maier was obsessed. She was obsessed with the practice of taking photographs \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which she did for most of her life, until she died in Chicago in 2009 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and she was obsessed with details of daily life on the streets, from newspapers to men wearing hats.Ms. Marks\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obsession is with the gaps in Maier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story. As she kept researching, though, she got stuck. She reached out to Mr. Maloof and Mr. Goldstein, assuming they knew things she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. When it became clear that neither had the answers she wanted, she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when I really started researching.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u201cBecause I felt in the Internet age, when there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so much information, people can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t disappear anymore.\u201dShe also began looking at the photos, including prints Maier made herself that had handwritten captions. In the fall, Ms. Marks found dozens of photographs taken at an estate in Brookville, on Long Island, including photos of a toddler. The name \u00e2\u0080\u009cJohn Akin\u00e2\u0080\u009d was written on one of the prints. When she looked the name up online, she eventually came across John\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter, a photographer named Gwen.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI did remember that I had a babysitter back then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ms. Akin, 65. But she was only a toddler in the photos, and so she recalls little with clarity. One thing she did notice upon seeing the photos, she said, was that Maier \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who was then in her 20s \u00e2\u0080\u0094 had yet to find herself as a photographer.Ms. Akin could see the \u00e2\u0080\u009crealization and recognition of light and shadow and all that stuff,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was later on that she hit her stride.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThat year, 1952, Maier invested in a medium-format twin-lens Rolleiflex.The breakthrough that has most excited Ms. Marks was the moment she found the baptismal record for Maier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brother, Karl, who was also called Charles or Carl. One night while watching television, she scrolled through pages and pages of documents online and located the death record for Maier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only sibling, whose life included run-ins with the law, drug addiction, a dishonorable discharge from the Army and, ultimately, a diagnosis of schizophrenia.And there was more. According to documents and letters Ms. Marks found, Maier was not raised in a happy household. Her world included unhappy marriages, disagreements and alcoholism. Her own mother didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t include Maier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name in her will.Ms. Marks\u00e2\u0080\u0099s findings are significant, not only in filling in so many blanks about how Vivian Maier came to be an extraordinary, secretive photographer, but also in helping to explain her worldview.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt suddenly makes sense to me why she selected the imagery that she did,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Goldstein said of the insights into Maier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s upbringing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think the edginess, which is one of the things I love \u00e2\u0080\u0094 there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this underlying edginess that runs through her work. And she had a very edgy life.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhile records excite Ms. Marks, what she wants most is to find more people who knew the Maier family. She isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t finished looking. She is also not the only person studying the circumstances of Maier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life, of which many details are still very murky.Among the questions she hopes to answer: What kind of relationship did Maier have with her brother?\u00e2\u0080\u009cVivian was a compassionate person and cared about the underdog,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms.Marks mused, \u00e2\u0080\u009cso why didn\u2019t she have a relationship with the brother?\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}
{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "One push through a revolving door and I was in complete darkness. I walked to the right to get a sheet of resin-coated paper and then turned toward the enlarger, where I could finally rest my mind. The most sacred moments were when I could just stand there and dissolve into the test prints. There were no New York hospitals, no expectations of my father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recovery or death. Not even the constant companion of intensive care beeping sounds, those Montefiore monitors I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get out of my head.I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t good at taking photos, but the darkroom was a safe haven after a rough spring. My father had been hospitalized for a congenital brain defect which he ultimately survived. At the time, however, his prognosis was not clear. To cope with the uncertainty, I stopped eating. At 14, I began to feel as though life were not for me.About midway through the summer, it was announced that Gregory Crewdson was coming to camp to find a central subject for his next photograph. He gave a lecture on his work and asked a handful of girls to stay afterward. I resorted to my constructed smile as he looked us over.Stepping off the bus in Lee was like stepping into another world. A crew of at least 30 paced a residential street that had been shut down. Mr. Crewdson was sitting high above in a cherry picker with a loudspeaker and his 8\u00d710 camera. Our buses were lined up in a right angle. Some girls were asked to stay on the bus, others to draw hopscotch, and still more to bounce on a trampoline.I was led to a pool of fake blood in front of a vacated home. A crew member told me to hold one arm out and tilt my head while he poured fake blood on my palm. Mr. Crewdson said that the photograph was about transformation and that I was to look sad.But was the isolation mine alone?Mr. Crewdson projects his own solitude in how he works. His three-part process \u00e2\u0080\u0094 preproduction, production and postproduction \u00e2\u0080\u0094 establishes his organizational removal. Photographing from a cherry picker, he removes himself from his subjects physically.Still, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCathedral of the Pines\u00e2\u0080\u009d is by far his most intimate work. After a few years of not photographing at all after a divorce, Mr. Crewdson cut his core crew down to about 15 and worked in the hill town of Becket, Mass., with models he knew \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including his daughter \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a break from his tradition of hiring actors such as Julianne Moore and William H. Macy.He says that his new work is \u00e2\u0080\u009cconcerned with a central theme of longing and trying to make a connection.\u00e2\u0080\u009d How contrary that seems to my summer moment, which he depicted as isolation without the possibility of connection. But perhaps it is just a new turn in his road.\u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery artist has one central story to tell and that story is told and retold over the course of a lifetime,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I think in these particular pictures, those things became very clear for me. And I think there is a sensibility in the work that for me is coming from a new place, a deeper place.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

Mr. Cruz, who has been consolidating the support of evangelical Christians there in recent months, has seen his support soften a bit since December as Mr. Trump has intensified his attacks.The billionaire developer has raised questions about Mr. Cruz\u2019s eligibility to be president because he was born in Canada and has questioned the Texas senator\u2019s standing with evangelicals by noting his Cuban heritage. After months of trying to embrace Mr. Trump and his supporters, Mr. Cruz has finally started to hit back, mocking his knowledge of foreign policy and accusing him of being someone that \u201cembodies New York values.\u201dThe poll released on Wednesday found that most Iowans are not overly concerned with Mr. Cruz\u2019s Canadian roots and that they find his strong Christian values to be very appealing. Mr. Trump is seen as the candidate more likely to disrupt the way government works.\u201cI love Iowa,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m gonna buy a farm and settle down out here.\u201d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "John Kasich Courts New Hampshire Independents", "Date": "2016-01-30", "News": "KEENE, N.H. \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Of all the Republicans campaigning in New Hampshire, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio has appealed most explicitly to the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population of unpredictable independent voters and moderate Republicans, who play an outsize role in presidential primaries here.That strategy was on vivid display Saturday: With the rest of the Republican presidential field scouring Iowa for last-minute converts, Mr. Kasich wooed middle-of-the-road voters in southern New Hampshire with some of his most direct language yet.At a town-hall-style meeting in Keene, Mr. Kasich described himself as a conservative but not a partisan and asked voters who disagree with Republican orthodoxy to consider supporting his campaign.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m an independent guy. The Republican Party is my vehicle, but it has never been my master,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Kasich said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I am a conservative that believes that conservative principles can help us to rise.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I am president, I get to call the tune, but other people who may not think exactly the way I do, that want to come and play in the orchestra \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all going to be welcome.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Kasich has defended his credentials as a conservative, highlighting his austere approach to fiscal issues in Congress and as governor.But he has also embraced praise from institutions that conservatives typically distrust. At a morning event in Merrimack, Mr. Kasich boasted of receiving the endorsement of The Boston Globe; in Keene, he brandished the just-issued endorsement of The New York Times. (The editorial boards of both papers are widely seen by conservatives as leaning to the left.)At both events, Mr. Kasich alluded to the MSNBC show \u00e2\u0080\u009cMorning Joe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a mainstay of centrist economic elites and political insiders in New York and Washington.Speaking to reporters outside the Historical Society of Cheshire County in Keene, Mr. Kasich said endorsements from outside the conservative coalition showed his \u00e2\u0080\u009cability to reach out and win a general election, so you can begin to bring about the conservative principles that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always governed under.\u00e2\u0080\u009dRepublicans, Mr. Kasich argued, should look to his approach as a model that works for the party, citing his record of balancing budgets and Ohio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent economic growth.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a formula that works, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a formula that cares about people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.The campaign in New Hampshire has entered a critical phase for Mr. Kasich, who has until recently flown under the radar in the Republican race and drawn few attacks from his opponents. As a result, he has been free to deliver an upbeat and moderate-in-tone message aimed squarely at New Hampshire\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ideological middle.In that respect, Mr. Kasich has emulated the model of Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former Utah governor who focused on pursuing centrist votes in the 2012 New Hampshire primary. (Mr. Huntsman finished third in the state, with 17 percent of the vote.)America Leads, a \u00e2\u0080\u009csuper PAC\u00e2\u0080\u009d supporting Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, has gone on the offensive for the first time in the race, sending mail to New Hampshire voters that brands Mr. Kasich as a tax-raiser. (\u00e2\u0080\u009cDoesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going out or staying home,\u00e2\u0080\u009d one piece of mail says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t avoid John Kasich\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tax increases.\u00e2\u0080\u009d)Mr. Kasich said outside his event in Keene that he was prepared to fight back against his opponents, though he said he would continue to run a \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery positive campaign.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou want to come after me, O.K., well, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to sit back and take it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Kasich said.Alluding to his upbringing outside Pittsburgh, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a McKees Rocks boy.

{"Headline": "Crackdown by Egypt Draws Attention to an Anniversary It Aimed to Avoid ", "Date": "2016-01-23", "News": "Supported byCAIRO \u2014 The normally invasive Egyptian authorities had long left Studio Emad Eddin alone, seeing no threat from a performance space that houses rehearsal studios and offers classes in set design and drama.But this month, 18 plainclothes men from the Interior Ministry showed up with a warrant, asked about licenses and then confiscated equipment, including some speakers and a sound mixer, according to Nevine El Ibiary, one of the studio\u2019s founders.The search came within weeks of similar raids at several cultural venues and amid a vast security dragnet in downtown Cairo \u2014 part of an extraordinary effort by the government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to prevent any protest commemorating the uprising that started on Jan. 25, 2011, and toppled President Hosni Mubarak.The security response has been in keeping with the government\u2019s reputation for repressing most kinds of dissent. But the scale of the clampdown has baffled many people here, as has the level of official alarm, from a government that has faced no challenge from large-scale protests in years. In word and deed, Mr. Sisi and other officials have treated even the possibility of demonstrations on the anniversary as a grave threat to the nation.The sense of panic has been attributed to concerns that the public is losing patience with the government amid high unemployment, rising prices and a persistent militant insurgency that, among other things, has devastated Egypt\u2019s tourism industry.But those factors alone were not sufficient to explain the overheated response, analysts said. From the perspective of the security services, the date \u2014 Jan. 25 \u2014 was itself a danger, as a reminder of their catastrophic, if momentary, loss of control.\u201cThere is kind of a trauma that is highly attached to this date,\u201d said Amr Abdul Rahman, the director of the civil liberties unit at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights. For the police, a particular focus of protester anger in 2011, \u201cthis is a black day \u2014 a day of defeat, and something they cannot swallow.\u201dThe authority of the Interior Ministry, which supervises the police, has been restored under Mr. Sisi, a former army general who came to power after leading the 2013 military ouster of President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood. In the run-up to Jan. 25, the ministry has tried to reclaim the anniversary, urging people to celebrate Police Day, which falls on the same date.The ministry recently released several videos that highlight the chaotic transition after Mr. Mubarak\u2019s fall and focus on the Muslim Brotherhood. Set against foreboding music, the videos depict protester violence and end with a slogan: \u201cCrimes the Egyptians will not forget.\u201dAn open letter from the ministry to the Egyptian people posted on Facebook noted the 64th anniversary of Police Day and made no mention of the Jan. 25 uprising. \u201cWe will always be the police of the people,\u201d it said.The interior minister did offer a gesture to at least one group for Jan. 25 \u2014 announcing special family visits for prisoners, in honor of both the uprising and Police Day, according to Al-Ahram, the flagship state newspaper.Even before the latest police raids, government efforts were well underway to repossess the downtown streets where the 2011 protests grew. Among the most significant was the alteration of Tahrir Square, the focal point of the demonstrations.In the center of Tahrir, officials tried to erect a monument to commemorate the \u201cmartyrs\u201d of Jan. 25 and June 30, the date of mass demonstrations against Mr. Morsi\u2019s rule, but protesters tore it down. The government settled for a large flag post instead. The authorities also placed a large metal gate at one entrance to the square that they could shut against an advancing crowd.The streets beyond the square are also being transformed by a private initiative to beautify the grand neoclassical buildings downtown. Ms. Ibiary, of Studio Emad Eddin, said it was possible that the visit from Interior Ministry officials was related to a broader gentrification campaign, which has included the dispersal of vendors in the area.But it seemed to be a warning from the police, she said \u2014 a message to cultural organizations like hers, where 75 percent of the users of the space are young people. \u201cThey are saying, we exist, so beware,\u201d she said.The downtown security sweeps included visits to hundreds of apartments and cafes and were the most visible manifestation of the government\u2019s alarm. But across Egypt, dozens and perhaps hundreds of antigovernment activists were also rounded up, including Islamist administrators of Facebook pages, Mr. Abdul Rahman said.The day after the raid on Studio Emad Eddin, the authorities arrested three people from a downtown apartment, including Taher Mokhtar, a doctor and political activist who participated in the 2011 revolt. His lawyer, Mokhtar Mounir, said the officers came without a warrant, calling the arrest \u201ca precautionary measure to inspect the area around the Ministry of Interior, and Tahrir.\u201dThe police officers seized a laptop, a voltmeter and a report on health conditions among prisoners, Mr. Mounir said. Since their arrest, the men have been held on charges that include holding meetings to plan for protests on Jan. 25 and plotting to overthrow the government.Mr. Mounir dismissed the charges as false. \u201cDue to the poor performance of the state economically, and the increase of violations, they are worried that people will take to the street again,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat they are doing is not justified, because no one has called for any protest \u2014 on the contrary, people are against protesting,\u201d he added.Some groups, including the Muslim Brotherhood, have called for demonstrations, but with thousands of dissidents in jail, there is little sign that anyone is in a position to mobilize a crowd. Less prominent activists have remained free, raising doubts about whether they commanded any real support. Mohamed Fawzy, a leader of a youth group called Liberation, said members were planning protests, though he refused to reveal any specific plans. \u201cWe are going to confront the regime with surprises and fast movement,\u201d he said. Mr. Fawzy said his movement was started by defectors from Tamarrod, a group that mobilized anti-Morsi protests, and helped pave the way for Mr. Sisi to take power. \u201cI have the courage to admit I made mistakes,\u201d he said.But he added: \u201cThere is evidence of the weakness of the regime. They fear the return of the nonviolent revolution.\u201dAmina Ismail contributed reporting from Cairo.Advertisement"}

When he arrived just shy of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cSummer of Love\u00e2\u0080\u009d on a Guggenheim grant, he followed a group of kids around Haight-Ashbury. But he neither romanticized psychedelia nor focused on protests. Instead, he photographed a prostrate figure wrapped in a sheet or a group of immobilized men slouched against a staircase with only one alert enough to play guitar. Mr. Gedney, it seemed, was interested in the low that followed the high.The San Francisco work calls to mind his earlier photos from O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Rourke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, a neighborhood bar in Brooklyn, where he lived for years before moving to Staten Island.

But he also kept his friends close. In the late 1980s when his AIDS was diagnosed (at a time when the disease was stigmatized), he told only a few people, including Lee and Maria Friedlander, whom he asked to be executors of his estate. He died in 1989 at the age of 56 without fame or fortune.

Dr. Riordan said that, in fact, she did know of one handsome, possibly single, chemical and mechanical engineering professor: Rodney Andrews.When Ms. Eddy saw Dr. Andrews on campus, she recognized him right away. \u201cHe has crystal blue eyes,\u201d she said. \u201cI already knew what he looked like because I\u2019d been Googling him.\u201d Dr. Andrews, who is 43 and the director of the Center for Applied Energy Research at the university, is particularly interested in researching cleaner ways to turn coal and fossil fuels into energy.Ms. Eddy and Dr. Andrews were both members of a committee charged with formulating a five-year strategic plan for the university, so they often saw each other at meetings. \u201cHe\u2019s a powerful, confident person,\u201d she said. \u201cI was really attracted to his strength.\u201dDr. Andrews, a divorced father, thought she was \u201cvery clever and very funny\u201d and was surprised to find himself thinking about her a lot. \u201cI wasn\u2019t particularly looking,\u201d he said. \u201cI was busy and keeping busy.

Since Ms. Eddy often complained about the undrinkable coffee at the hotel in Lexington, Ky., where she was temporarily living, he began inviting her to the Starbucks near campus. Their orders reflected their opposite personalities. Dr. Andrews, a taciturn and serious scientist, never wavers into frothy territory. He always ordered black coffee. Ms. Eddy said she usually ordered \u201ca grande extra hot skinny cinnamon dolce latte.\u201dPeople describe Dr. Andrews as an idiosyncratic intellectual, a scientist with many unscientific interests and hobbies.

Once, after she commented that his homemade meals were sometimes too flavorful for her, he brought home a test kit that measured her taste buds. \u201cHe proved scientifically that I am indeed a \u2018super taster,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Eddy, who is now the senior manager for external affairs in the university\u2019s office of the executive vice president for health affairs.After a few dates, Ms. Eddy recalled, she asked Dr. Andrews if he wanted to be in an exclusive relationship. \u201cI think everyone avoids that conversation because it\u2019s hard to have,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a lot better to have that conversation than to live with the consequences of not having it.\u201d Dr. Andrews, who appreciates clear definitions, said yes.She began mailing him greeting cards, which arrived in a steady flow. The very first card had a diagram of a caffeine molecule on the cover. The second showed a man peering into a test tube, with the caption: \u201cLove Doesn\u2019t Just Happen \u2026 It\u2019s Science, Girl.\u201d Inside that card, Ms. Eddy wrote, \u201cThank you for making the \u2018happy\u2019 chemical levels in my brain soar!\u201dDr. Andrews waited four months before introducing her to his children, a meeting that wasn\u2019t awkward at all. \u201cShe just easily rolled into my life with them,\u201d he said. Ms. Eddy, who is currently pursuing a doctorate in family sciences at the university, said: \u201cI entered this new family in a very mindful way. I try not to be intrusive while at the same time influencing them in a positive way.\u201dThe couple and his children began spending a lot of time together on a farm that Dr. Andrews owns in Kentucky \u2014 hiking, cooking on an outdoor grill and conducting official-seeming searches for Bigfoot using an expensive thermal-imaging camera. \u201cHe can take a lighthearted approach to life,\u201d Ms. Eddy said. \u201cHe\u2019s not just a scientist in his lab coat researching coal. He\u2019s also a Bigfoot lover!\u201dOn June 1 last year \u2014 her birthday \u2014 he proposed in the small house near campus that they had recently purchased. He made steak, potatoes and a perfect chocolate mousse. While Frank Sinatra songs \u2014 another of her favorite old school things \u2014 played in the background, he presented her with three greeting cards. \u201cThe first was a happy-birthday card,\u201d he said. \u201cThe second card was a funny, smart-aleck card. The third was about how great it is that she\u2019s in my life.\u201dJust before their wedding, on Dec. 19, Dr. Andrews received a $500 gift card from Volkswagen \u2014 a good-will gesture after it was revealed that the company had tampered with the emissions technology on its diesel cars, including his Jetta. \u201cThat Jetta bought me my beautiful pearl-drop wedding necklace!\u201d Ms. Eddy exclaimed.They were married at the Brown Palace Hotel in Denver, where the bride worked during her college years. Like a float in the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade, an enormous chandelier constructed of lights and crystals hung above people drinking tea in the historic lobby, their heavy winter coats thrown over its chintz couches.The ceremony was held in a small room upstairs and officiated by the Rev. Thomas Mertz, the groom\u2019s brother-in-law, who is the pastor of the South Mountain Community Church in St. George, Utah, officiated. It was brief, with 22 guests, and perfectly captured the personalities of the couple in its balance of understatement and overstatement, of reserve and exuberance.The couple exchanged rings made of different materials: hers was platinum, while his was cobalt chrome, a material he described as \u201cindestructible\u201d and chose only after considering many other materials, including gold, carbon, iron, dinosaur bones and even metals contained in meteorites.The bride\u2019s brother Jordan also spoke, describing the challenges of two academics falling in love and adjusting to using their hearts rather than their brains. Several days afterward, he added: \u201cI\u2019ve seen intelligence get in the way of finding true love. It can be difficult to give in to your more emotional side. Hannah is a perfectionist. She has lived her life very precisely, and love is messy. So it was a risk, but it worked out pretty beautifully.\u201dGabrielle Karol and Benjamin Jacobs: After Years of Breakup Regret, He Wins Back the OneAdvertisement"}

The Trump campaign distributed more than 20,000 tickets to the event, sending the theater\u2019s administrators and the local police department into a frenzy on how to handle the huge overflow.Those bundled up outside just wanted to see the billionaire businessman in the flesh. Surprisingly, some were fans of both Mr. Trump and Mr.\u00c2\u00a0Sanders, the Vermont senator seeking the Democratic nomination, and were trying to decide which one to back.\u201cI think he\u2019s smart, and he has the best chance of winning support and maybe flipping the state,\u201d Daniel Nadeau, 22, of St. Albans, Vt., said of Mr. Trump. \u201cBernie is my No. 1 choice, and Trump is No. 2. They\u2019re not that different.\u201dVoters who were on the fence between the seemingly polar-opposite candidates said that both communicated well with working-class people and made strong cases for how they would boost the economy, despite their differing policy ideas.\u201cI\u2019m a Trump guy, but I do like Bernie,\u201d said Peter Vincenzo, 59, who works installing hardwood floors and traveled from Ohio for the rally. \u201cThere are a lot of parallels between these two guys.

{"Headline": "Anger in a Palestinian Town Feeds a Cycle of Violence ", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported byThen Mr. Jaradat said he was going to university in Hebron, gave his mother his gold bracelet and his married sister his necklace, and went to a nearby Israeli military checkpoint of Beit Anoun, where he stabbed and seriously wounded a soldier before being shot to death himself.Hours later, his cousin Iyad Jaradat, 19, was killed at an angry demonstration at Beit Anoun, hit in the head by a rubber-coated steel bullet.The cousins are among 12 young Palestinians killed over three months who were from this town of about 24,000 people, a few miles from the city of Hebron, a flash point. Sa\u2019ir, with a long history of resistance to Israel, has become heralded in Palestinian lore as the hotbed of this latest wave of stabbings and attempted stabbings by young people.The Jaradats\u2019 deaths in October are part of the cyclical violence increasingly being called a third intifada, one bubbling like lava with little organization or strategy from a weak Palestinian leadership and spilling around Israeli political and security officials\u2019 attempts to curtail it.As Raed Jaradat\u2019s heartbroken father, Sakit, spoke last week in his large home \u2014 which has already been measured for retaliatory demolition by Israeli troops as part of a revival of a deterrence policy largely abandoned in 2005 \u2014 a funeral was underway for Moyyad Jabarin, 19. in Sa\u2019ir\u2019s little Cemetery of the Martyr. Mr. Jabarin, a plumber, had been killed at the Beit Anoun checkpoint after trying to stab a soldier.\u201cWe live well; my son needed nothing,\u201d said Sakit Jaradat, 53. \u201cBut the only thing missing in the lives of these youths is freedom. They have lost hope and dignity, they are humiliated at the checkpoints, and now we are afraid. I tell my family to go through checkpoints in groups, never alone. You can say that safety and security have vanished from the lives of these young people.\u201dSince Oct. 1, some 25 Israelis \u2014 along with an American Jewish student and a Palestinian bystander \u2014 have been killed in near-daily attacks by knife, vehicle and gunfire, along with 155 Palestinians, most of whom Israel describes as assailants. Some Israelis, like the defense minister, Moshe Yaalon, say this wave will peter out when it produces no clear results. Others, like Isaac Herzog, the leader of the opposition in Parliament, believe it is the beginning of a third intifada.Palestinian political leaders fear a harsher crackdown by Israel and more useless sacrifice, but they embrace the young dead as martyrs to the cause of Palestinian resistance to Israel\u2019s occupation of the West Bank, accuse Israel of an excessive \u201cshoot to kill\u201d policy, which the military strongly denies, and are under increasing pressure to act.Daoud al-Zaatari, Hebron\u2019s mayor, sees the violence as a \u201cboiling up of anger from a young generation who were born after Oslo,\u201d the agreements of the mid-1990s that set up the interim Palestinian Authority and were supposed to lead to an independent Palestinian state. \u201cBut now they and we find ourselves lost,\u201d he said. \u201cTravel is restricted, there are few jobs, and doors are closed.\u201d These young people, he said, \u201care not political, but angry at the political system that delivers them nothing.\u201d The violence has sprung with \u201cno plan or strategy by the Palestinian Authority or Fatah,\u201d he said, referring to the party of the Palestinian Authority\u2019s leader. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes things confusing, both for us and the Israelis.\u201dIsraeli military officials, speaking anonymously after interviewing assailants and their families, see a long-term phenomenon that began with anger about the fate of Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City but has morphed into a relatively intimate cycle of outrage and revenge.In Sa\u2019ir, for example, most of the dead have come from two other extended families: the Shelaldehs and the Qawazbehs. On Jan. 7 alone, three Qawazbeh cousins were killed after they tried to stab soldiers who approached them near the Gush Etzion Junction. The 16-year-old brother of one of them was killed later that day at Beit Anoun after he tried to avenge their deaths by stabbing soldiers, and then Muhammad Qawazbeh met the same fate trying the same thing at the same checkpoint five days later.Sakit Jaradat said Raed was polite and respectful, \u201cand I swear, if I knew my son would carry out an attack, I would have bound his hands with metal.\u201dHe began to cry softly, and his youngest son, Muhammad, 9, brought in a box of tissues. \u201cThey say when someone dies, you start forgetting,\u201d Mr. Jaradat said. \u201cBut with me, day by day I miss him more.\u201dHe spoke then of his Israeli friends and customers from an earlier, happier time and said some of them had telephoned him with their condolences. \u201cBut now all I see, and all these youth see, are Israeli soldiers and settlers,\u201d he said.At his son\u2019s funeral, Mr. Jaradat met the father of the woman whose death Raed Jaradat had sought to avenge, and \u201cto ease everyone\u2019s tension and misery,\u201d he said, he suggested a posthumous marriage. Some in the conservative village consider the ceremony they conducted un-Islamic, but Palestinians broadly have celebrated it as a macabre romance of national sacrifice.Shawan Jabarin, the director of the Palestinian human rights group Al Haq and a relative of the plumber buried Friday, said Sa\u2019ir was well known from the 1970s for fighting Israeli efforts to establish civilian administrative councils and is now hemmed in by checkpoints designed to protect the Israeli settlements around Hebron. The day of the plumber\u2019s funeral, for example, the town was reachable only by a circuitous route, and soldiers had raided the place the night before, looking for potential attackers.\u201cThe politicians of both sides promised this Oslo generation, these youth of 16 to 22 or 23, many things \u2014 dignity, freedom, development \u2014 and everything failed,\u201d Mr. Jabarin said. \u201cBecause the political parties failed, the Palestinian leadership failed, they take things into their own hands against the occupation.\u201cIt\u2019s like a snowball,\u201d he added. \u201cIt starts with Raed Jaradat when he reacted to Dania on Facebook. And then there was more reaction, and when the Israelis kill anyone, and you see the funerals and the anger of the people, but the young don\u2019t take everything into account, they react.\u201cAnd now it\u2019s horrid, because the killing becomes routine, and no one family, no one father or mother can give you a guarantee that their children will not do something.\u201dRami Nazzal contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders Courts Elusive Voters: Young Iowans", "Date": "2016-01-23", "News": "Supported byUNDERWOOD, Iowa \u2014 With the Iowa caucuses just over a week away, the Bernie Sanders youth brigade is on the move.Seven hundred college-age volunteers from across the Midwest and as far away as California are streaming into Iowa to help get the vote out. Organizers on Iowa campuses are reserving rooms to turn into phone bank centers, distributing campaign-provided toe warmers to the foot soldiers and playing Mr. Sanders\u2019s spoken-word version of \u201cThis Land Is Your Land\u201d to motivate them.Ahead of Feb. 1, the day Iowa voters finally have their say, the Sanders campaign is activating \u201cGo Home for Bernie,\u201d a plan to dispatch a fleet of rental cars, vans and buses, if necessary, to carry students who are from Iowa back to their hometowns, where they will have maximum impact on the caucuses.With his talk of free tuition, unabashed unhipness and calls for political revolution, Mr. Sanders has undoubtedly struck a chord with young people. But they are one of the least dependable constituencies in politics, and his campaign acknowledges that beating Hillary Clinton in Iowa will require harnessing their enthusiasm, overcoming their history of dismal attendance and replicating the 2008 turnout inspired by the historic candidacy of Barack Obama.\u201cWe are working very hard to make that happen,\u201d Mr. Sanders, a Vermont senator, said in an interview on Thursday. \u201cThat is exactly what we are focusing on right now to Election Day,\u201d he added.Of the 15,000 people in Iowa who have done at least one volunteer shift, 27 percent are 18 to 24 years old, and 32 percent are 25 to 34, according to the campaign. The campaign has at least one representative, essentially a precinct captain, on 38 Iowa college campuses, where students will spend the final days calling likely voters, holding caucus training camps and figuring out how to get the greatest number of supporters to the largest number of precincts.\u201cIf you have a car,\u201d said Dhruv Gupta, 21, the president of Grinnellians for Sanders at Grinnell College, \u201cyou are enlisted.\u201d\u201cAnd then we fill it up with as many people as we can.\u201d\u201cI know the young people will think this is impossible: When I was elected mayor of Burlington, we did not have a computer in City Hall. Can you imagine that?\u201d Mr. Sanders said here Tuesday. The stage behind him was packed with supporters in their teens and 20s seated under a banner saying, \u201cA Future to Believe In.\u201d\u201cHard to imagine,\u201d Mr. Sanders continued. \u201cGeorge Washington. Bernie Sanders.\u201dJared Freemon, 20, a junior economics and marketing major at Drake University in Des Moines, said he liked Mr. Sanders\u2019s ideas about making public college free and providing health care for all, as well as the senator\u2019s candor in talking about the injustices minorities face.\u201cI think he cares for people in America, so whether it\u2019s immigrants, or people coming over our borders, or the black and brown populations here, I can tell that he really does want equality,\u201d Mr. Freemon said. In New Hampshire, where the primary will be held Feb. 9, Veri di Suvero, a student at Dartmouth College, said she also liked the senator\u2019s proposals, but mostly just believed that he believed in the revolution he called for. \u201cBernie Sanders is the most unproblematic old white man we\u2019ve ever heard of,\u201d she said.Expanding the voting universe to include more young people is central to his strategy in Iowa and New Hampshire, where he has been faring well in polls. But as the race moves on to more diverse states, Mrs. Clinton is hoping those gains will be outweighed by her support among African-Americans and Latinos, two key Democratic constituencies with which she is performing strongly.In counting on the young, Mr. Sanders is swimming against a strong current of history. Younger citizens tend not to vote; in 2000, for instance, when both parties had competitive races, only 9 percent of Iowa caucusgoers were under 30, according to researchers based at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy. The exception came in 2008, when Mr. Obama made young people a key part of the Iowa coalition that propelled him to victory; that year, 19 percent of caucusgoers were under 30.That was despite an early January caucus date, when many college students were on break. The Obama campaign had to persuade students from out of state to come back. According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.This year, Mr. Sanders has the opposite challenge. College students will be in school, but concentrated in precincts around the universities where he is already expected to do well. The Sanders campaign has to persuade students who come from other parts of Iowa to go back to their home precincts, where a few votes could be the difference.\u201cThey really want to be part of the political process, and they want to be empowered,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to be wined and dined a little bit. They want to feel special, and he is making that extra effort that others aren\u2019t.\u201dThe campaign\u2019s senior strategist, Tad Devine, said that over the next few days the campaign would roll out six-second Tumblr ads and send emails and texts to voters it had identified as college students. It will also begin a web advertising campaign about the \u201cGo Home for Bernie\u201d program that uses geographic targeting to reach mobile phones around the colleges.\u201cIf we win this thing,\u201d he said, \u201cin large measure it\u2019s going to be because these young voters turn out beginning in Iowa and also because we can convince the Democratic establishment that Bernie can be a stronger candidate because of his appeal to young people, the way Barack Obama was in 2008.\u201dJason Horowitz reported from Underwood, and Yamiche Alcindor from Des Moines.

Super PACs supporting the campaign of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas are set to unload on Senator Marco Rubio of Florida on television in Iowa and elsewhere. Jeb Bush\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supportive super PAC, Right to Rise USA, ran its first negative ad against Mr. Rubio shortly before the new year. Mr. Bush has also signaled potential coming lines of attack against Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, pointing out the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s credit downgrades during his tenure and contrasting that record with his own. So far the group supporting Mr. Bush has attacked Mr. Rubio, Donald J. Trump and Mr. Cruz, but it is unclear how much it will expand its target list.But it has become clear, as the calendar pages turn and as the race enters the final weeks before voting in Iowa and New Hampshire, that the tone has become far nastier and that it is increasingly taking place on the air. In 2012, the first presidential cycle since the outside groups arose, the super PAC supporting Mitt Romney, Restore Our Future, savaged a rising opponent, Newt Gingrich, in the primary race. The group dumped tens of millions of dollars into negative television spots, kitchen-sink style ads that included a claim that, as the speaker of the House, he had helped support China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s restrictive policy of one child per family. Super PACs have so far not been exceptional in the 2016 race, in terms of supplementing campaigns or keeping flagging candidates alive. But they might still prove effective at the task of negative campaigning, sparing the candidates from doing it themselves and saving them the harder-to-raise, limited campaign funds in the process. By JONATHAN MARTINSupporters of Senator Marco Rubio, Senator Ted Cruz, Jeb Bush and Mike Huckabee are poised to unleash a wave of ferocious attacks before the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

You know that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s who Jeb Bush is. It is why you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re supporting him for president.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMs. Bradshaw said she watched with her son from inside the debate hall in Charleston, S.C., and \u00e2\u0080\u009cbelly-laughed\u00e2\u0080\u009d at some of the exchanges between the other candidates. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re great performers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only guy who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ready to be the president at the end of the day, and I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what people are walking away from this debate with.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBush aides on the call also highlighted their candidate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s willingness to go after Donald J. Trump \u00e2\u0080\u0094 something he has been doing on the campaign trail, and something voters can expect to see more of in the weeks before the early voting begins.In post-debate talking points the campaign distributed to donors and supporters, the first item promoted Mr. Bush\u00e2\u0080\u0099s preparedness to be commander in chief in the wake of the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif.\u00e2\u0080\u009cJeb took on Donald Trump and the back benchers in the Senate once again, and articulated his plan to make America safer, stronger, freer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the suggested message read.And another talking point in the memo offered a similar theme: \u00e2\u0080\u009cJeb\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record of accomplishment can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be matched by the other candidates,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the message read. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo one in this field, from Donald Trump to Ted Cruz to Chris Christie to Marco Rubio, is more prepared to be president on Day 1 than Jeb Bush. \u00e2\u0080\u009c At the end of the donor call, Heather Larrison, the campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s finance director, urged supporters not just to continue to raise money, but also to help on the ground in the early voting states.\u201cWe are actively recruiting all of our friends, family, peers, colleagues for the deployment effort,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Larrison said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need boots on the ground in Iowa and New Hampshire and South Carolina, so if you all are willing to go \u00e2\u0080\u0094 if you all know friends who are willing to go \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we would love to have your help there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders Releases Details on Health Plan That Would Raise Taxes but, He Argues, Save on Costs", "Date": "2016-01-18", "News": "Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, under pressure from the Clinton campaign to explain how he would pay for his progressive policies, unveiled a universal healthcare plan on Sunday night that includes sweeping tax increases and a drastic tax hike for the wealthiest.  Ahead of a nationally televised Democratic presidential debate, Mr. Sanders said that his \u00e2\u0080\u009cMedicare-for-all\u00e2\u0080\u009d plan was in the spirit of Democratic presidents such as Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman and projected that the health savings would outweigh the higher taxes that would pay for the plan.The Vermont senator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal would be made possible by a 2.2 percent health care premium, calculated under the rules for federal income taxes and a 6.2 percent health care payroll tax paid by employers. Mr. Sanders would also impose an estate tax on the wealthiest Americans and make changes in the tax code to make federal income tax rates more progressive.Under the plan, individuals making $250,000 to $500,000 annually would be taxed at a rate of 37 percent. The top rate, 52 percent, would apply to those earning $10 million or more a year, a category that in 2013 included only the 13,000 households in the United States.\u00e2\u0080\u009cUniversal health care is an idea that has been supported in the United States by Democratic presidents going back to Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said in a statement on Sunday night. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is time for our country to join every other major industrialized nation on earth and guarantee health care to all.\u201dMr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal would expand Medicare and \u00e2\u0080\u009cbuild on the success of the Affordable Care Act,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. The senator said patients could choose their doctors and receive comprehensive care for various services, including hospital stays, emergency room visits and primary and specialty care.Mr. Sanders said the plan would save $6 trillion over 10 years compared with the current system, citing an analysis by Gerald Friedman, an economist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who studies health care costs.The typical family earning $50,000 a year would save nearly $6,000 annually in health care costs, Dr. Friedman calculated, according to the announcement. The announcement said the average working family now pays $4,955 in premiums for private insurance and spends an additional $1,318 on deductibles for care that isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t covered. Mr. Sanders said a family of four earning $50,000 would pay $466 per year to this  program.He added that businesses would save more than $9,400 a year in health care costs and that the average annual cost to the employer for a worker with a family who makes $50,000 a year would go from $12,591 to $3,100. The plan would include savings \u00e2\u0080\u009cfrom reducing outlays for taxpayer-supported health care expenditures.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Sanders\u2019s campaign said the plan woulds cost an estimated $1.38 trillion per year and that a family of four, taking the standard deduction, can have income of up to $28,800 and not pay the health care tax.Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the non-partisan Tax Policy Center, estimated that the tax increase that Mr. Sanders is proposing would be the largest since World War II, increasing taxes by approximately $450 billion per year.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt seems to be very, very large,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Williams said, noting that the highest earners would bear most of the pain.Mr. Williams suggested that the cost estimates for that the Sanders campaign is using will require more scrutiny and that employers are likely to pass on the new payroll tax to consumers or employees in other ways. The political feasibility of imposing such a vast overhaul is also a concern.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talking about is turning the government into the provider of health insurance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Williams said, noting that the Obama administration would have been interested in a single-payer system if it could have passed Congress. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about replacing an entire industry with a federal government plan, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a big order.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHillary Clinton and Mr. Sanders have sparred in recent days as polls show a tight Democratic presidential race in both Iowa and New Hampshire.As Mrs. Clinton has intensified her attacks on Mr. Sanders, he has rolled out policy details. On Saturday, Mr. Sanders announced that he was supporting legislation to amend a 2005 law on gunmakers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 liability that he voted for and that Mrs. Clinton has been using to attack him as weak on gun regulations.Mr. Sanders has defended his support of the gun law by saying he was trying to shield small gun dealers who followed the law from expensive litigation. He also proposed an amendment to the legislation that would require the Commerce Department to monitor and report on the law\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impact in rural areas.In an interview on Sunday before the release of the plan, Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign manager, defended the idea of raising taxes on the middle class by saying families would save money through the single-payer program.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to replace much larger expenses that you pay currently to the private sector,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Weaver said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I ask you to pay $5 in taxes and I save you a $100,000 in costs, am I raising your taxes? I guess technically I am, but really it is the net of what the effect is.\u00e2\u0080\u009dOn Sunday night before the debate, Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s issued a statement in response to Mr. Sanders\u2019s plan, saying that he \u201chas been changing a lot of positions in the last 24 hours because when his plans and record come under scrutiny, their very real flaws get exposed\u201d referring to this plan and his support for the new gun legislation. \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas remain locked in a tight race for the lead in Iowa less than three weeks before the state\u2019s caucuses, according to a new poll. Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz remain essentially tied in the crucial state that kicks off the presidential nominating process. Trailing them are Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, at 15 percent, and Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon, whose support has dropped to 7 percent.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Iowa Republican caucuses are tight as a tick entering the final two weeks of the campaign,\u201d said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll.  \u201cVoters like Senator Ted Cruz better than Donald Trump and give him much higher scores for honesty, empathy, experience and for sharing their values.\u201dMr. Cruz has seen a surge in popularity in Iowa, where the caucuses take place on Feb. 1, in recent months as he has consolidated the support of evangelical Christian voters and as Mr. Carson\u2019s backing has receded. But Mr. Trump has been attacking the Texas senator more aggressively of late, raising questions about the Cruz family\u2019s roots in Cuba and Canada. A December poll from Quinnipiac also showed Mr. Trump leading Mr. Cruz by a single percentage point, suggesting the dynamics in the state are starting to stabilize. While Mr. Trump remains polarizing in Iowa, he is viewed by many as the best suited to handle the economy and terrorism, which Iowans view as the most important issues facing the country. Republicans in the state also like his stance on immigration, which includes building a wall along the border with Mexico and deporting anyone who has entered the country illegally.Mr. Cruz is seen as stronger generally on foreign policy, more trustworthy and more empathetic than Mr. Trump. The poll finds that the rest of the Republican field has largely faded in Iowa, with Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey with 4 percent support and former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida at 3 percent.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

Users Debate a Missing Twitter Feature", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byAfter reports on Tuesday that Twitter was considering increasing its character limit to 10,000 from the traditional 140, large numbers of longtime users again began lobbying for the ability to revise their tweets after posting. Facebook has long offered this function.Right now, if tweets have typos or factual errors, users have to live with them or, in extreme cases, delete the original and post a new version, losing any retweets, likes and embedded shares elsewhere.The idea of an editing button or similar tool has attracted fans from all walks of life: Journalists, entrepreneurs and musicians have endorsed the idea.In October, Kevin Weil, the senior vice president of product at Twitter, again addressed the proposed feature at a conference, and said that the nature of tweets could change if an edit function were added.Public tweets are often embedded on blogs, other social networks and on news websites. If a tweet is widely shared but then edited significantly, this could complicate the experience for those who share it, which, from a user experience and product standpoint, could become problematic for both new and engaged users.Another argument against the edit button is that altering a widely shared tweet can change its meaning \u2014 and give people who misbehave a loophole for covering their tracks.\u201cAm I alone in not wanting an \u2018edit\u2019 button on Twitter?\u201d Matt Zoller Seitz, the editor in chief of RogerEbert.com, posted on Wednesday. \u201cSeems an invitation to revise history and encourage liars.

Mrs. Clinton has likened the proposal to \u00e2\u0080\u009casking the arsonists to be the firefighter.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe Clinton campaign has recently seized on his remarks, and has released a video in which Jake Sullivan, the campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s senior policy adviser, puts Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plan in the context of protecting Israel.\u00e2\u0080\u009cNormal relations with Iran right now?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sullivan says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPresident Obama doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t support the idea.

What I have said is that I would like to see \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and I understand, believe me, that Iran and Saudi Arabia hate each other \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but to the degree that we can create a process where Muslim countries can come together to fight ISIS, that is a positive thing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d(Mr. Sanders said last November that \u00e2\u0080\u009cMuslim nations in the region \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Jordan\u00e2\u0080\u009d needed to \u00e2\u0080\u009cget their hands dirty, their boots on the ground.\u00e2\u0080\u009d)The Clinton strategy on this front raises the risk of deterring powerful supporters of Israel from embracing Mr. Sanders should he capture the nomination.Brian Fallon, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, called Mr. Sanders \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe very caricature that Republicans like to put forward\u00e2\u0080\u009d of Democrats.In her 2008 presidential campaign, Mrs. Clinton tried to portray Mr. Obama as na\u00c3\u00afve about foreign policy when he pledged to open diplomatic channels to the Iranians \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a prism through which Republicans continue to view Mr. Obama.The back and forth on the campaign trail somewhat oversimplifies Mr. Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s position.Mrs. Clinton is correct that no one in the Obama administration \u00e2\u0080\u0094 either when she served as secretary of state or since she left \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is discussing full normalization of relations with Iran.But at the same time, Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s successor as secretary of state, John Kerry, have often talked of the benefits of a more normal relationship with Iran.Mr. Kerry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship with Iran\u00e2\u0080\u0099s American-educated foreign minister, Mohammed Javad Zarif, helped smooth the way to last week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s release of 10 sailors who drifted into Iranian waters and the prisoner swap announced last weekend.That kind of intense interchange had not taken place since 1979, and many see it as a step toward routine cooperation, even if formal diplomatic relations are years away.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI congratulate President Obama and his team, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m proud of the role I played to get this process started,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton said last week after news broke that the prisoners would be freed.After the rally here, a woman rushed to the rope line to shake her hand. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was for Bernie, but you convinced me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d the woman, Kathy Kellman, a 72-year-old retiree, shouted at Mrs. Clinton.\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, thank you, I really appreciate that so much and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll work really hard for you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton replied.Asked by a reporter what, specifically, made her change her mind, Ms. Kellman did not hesitate: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better informed internationally.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDavid Sanger and Jason Horowitz contributed reporting from Washington.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "News Analysis: Why Donald Trump Walked", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "But the reasons for his withdrawal from the kind of high-profile forum that he has so often dominated may involve more than just hurt feelings.What may be the most intriguing possible explanation is that a debate, at this point in his neck-and-neck contest with Senator Ted Cruz, would almost certainly subject Mr. Trump to tough questions about vulnerabilities \u00e2\u0080\u0093 like his previous support for abortion rights, or his much more recent suggestion that Iowans, the people whose votes he is courting, are stupid.People who have spoken with Mr. Trump insist he believes he is headed to victory here and wants to play out the clock, a view that was bolstered by a few public opinion polls this week.But whether he does or not, a debate \u00e2\u0080\u0093 particularly one moderated by a network, and an anchor, whom Mr. Trump believes is motivated to challenge him aggressively \u00e2\u0080\u0093 amounts to an uncontrollable, high-risk confrontation whose outcome could greatly affect his chances.The truth could be as simple as advertised: Mr. Trump was enraged when Fox News executives issued a statement mocking him as unserious over his threats to bolt the debate unless the cable channel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anchor, Megyn Kelly \u00e2\u0080\u0093 whom Mr. Trump has attacked for months \u00e2\u0080\u0093 was removed as a moderator.It could also be seen as strategic genius. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDonald Trump knows that by not showing up, he\u2019s owning the entire event,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rush Limbaugh said on his radio show. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSome guy not even present will end up owning the entire event, and the proof of that is Fox News last night.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut for Mr. Trump, participating in a debate four nights before the Iowa caucuses would also most likely mean being pelted with many of his past remarks, in a setting in which he could not expect to dominate the microphone or the questioners.It would be the exact opposite, for example, of the exchange between Mr. Trump and an NBC reporter who, at the same news conference Tuesday at which Mr. Trump pulled out of the debate, tried to confront him about his previous support for abortion rights, including the late-term procedure that opponents call partial-birth abortion.Mr. Cruz and a well-funded group supporting him have been bombarding Mr. Trump with attack ads using footage of a 1999 interview in which he called himself \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery pro-choice\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cpro-choice in all respects.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But when the NBC reporter, Peter Alexander, tried to ask Mr. Trump about that quotation, Mr. Trump repeatedly cut him off, talked over him and turned the tables on him, demanding an apology.Abortion is not the only subject on which Mr. Trump could be forced to defend or explain his remarks in a tough-minded presidential debate: The ads being run by Mr. Cruz, for example, also show a clip of Mr. Trump, in November, asking \u00e2\u0080\u009chow stupid\u00e2\u0080\u009d the people of Iowa must be for believing Ben Carson\u2019s story of personal redemption.Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debate performances debates have not always been unmitigated triumphs: While he acquitted himself well in rebutting Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s denigration of what he called \u00e2\u0080\u009cNew York values\u00e2\u0080\u009d in a Jan. 14 debate in South Carolina, for example, Mr. Cruz savaged Mr. Trump for much of the first half-hour.David Carney, a Republican strategist who ran Rick Perry\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign, said Mr. Trump made a wise move in pulling out of the debate when he could not count on turning in a strong performance. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe debates aren\u2019t his thing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, predicting it would not hurt Mr. Trump with his supporters.What is undeniable is that Mr. Trump does not like feeling as if he is being backed into a corner \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and that the sarcastic statement by Fox News on Tuesday bothered him greatly.Escalating a back-and-forth with Mr. Trump leading up to the debate, the network openly mocked him for complaining when challenged by aggressive journalists. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe learned from a secret back channel that the ayatollah and Putin both intend to treat Donald Trump unfairly when they meet with him if he becomes president,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the network said.Referring to Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s survey of his Twitter followers as to whether he should go ahead with the debate, Fox News added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cA nefarious source tells us that Trump has his own secret plan to replace the cabinet with his Twitter followers to see if he should even go to those meetings.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAt his news conference, held in a high school in Marshalltown, Iowa, Mr. Trump called the network\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parody a \u00e2\u0080\u009cwiseguy press release,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and dared Fox News to hold the debate without him.\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s see how they do with the ratings,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.Fox News has steadfastly stood by Ms. Kelly. Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aides said they were planning a competing event in Des Moines during the debate, a fund-raiser to help wounded veterans. But his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, seemed to leave open at least the possibility of a reversal, telling MSNBC on Wednesday morning that he \u00e2\u0080\u009cdidn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think\u00e2\u0080\u009d there was any way Mr. Trump would change his mind.But in the interview, Mr. Lewandowski dismissed the notion that Mr. Trump might be concerned about answering questions, and pointed out that he had already taken part in six debates. This is not the first time Mr. Trump has threatened to walk off a debate stage. But Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earlier brinkmanship over debates came months ago, not on the eve of a vote, when it could shape the opinions of Iowa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s late-deciding caucusgoers.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis debate is in Iowa,\u00e2\u0080\u009d noted Kellyanne Conway, a Republican strategist and the president of the main \u00e2\u0080\u009csuper PAC\u00e2\u0080\u009d supporting Mr. Cruz. If it were anywhere else, she said, the flap with Fox News might not add up to much. But voters here are paying attention.Still, exactly what they are taking away from the standoff is unclear.Matt Strawn, a former chairman of the Iowa Republican Party, said he saw no sign yet that it would cut into Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s support.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThose voters have been drawn to him because he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s willing to flout\u00e2\u0080\u009d establishment rules, Mr. Strawn said.Would the timing of the dispute make a difference? \u00e2\u0080\u009cLike most of the Donald Trump experience over the last 12 months,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all going to learn together.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

Those who cannot speak it are marginalized.Hank, a taxi driver, has to post a sign saying he does not speak the language. His income is dwindling, as non-Mandarin-speaking drivers are barred from picking up passengers in some areas. Children are taught in Mandarin at school and, in one poignant scene, Hank\u2019s son walks up to him after class calling him the Mandarin \u201cbaba\u201d instead of \u201cloudau\u201d in colloquial Cantonese.\u201cTen years ago, they had to learn Cantonese to be here,\u201d a passenger laments to Hank.In other stories, books are censored, homes are bulldozed against their owners\u2019 will, and the Chinese government meddles in local policy-making, aided by obsequious Hong Kong officials and even hired thugs.Fantastic as these fables might be, they have clearly resonated with many people in Hong Kong.\u201cThe movie is a reminder that if we do nothing, Hong Kong will become another Shenzhen,\u201d said Oscar Lai, who watched the film with fellow activists from the pro-democracy group Scholarism.\u201cHong Kong people did not care about the booksellers until the disappearance of Lee Bo, the only one who went missing from Hong Kong, not in the mainland or Thailand,\u201d said Nathan Law, secretary general of the Federation of Students, a union active in democracy movements. The group has organized screenings of the film at universities in coming weeks. \u201cPeople had thought they were safe in Hong Kong,\u201d he said.\u201cThe film\u2019s popularity in Hong Kong is generally thought to speak to Hong Kong\u2019s deep anxiety in the past two years,\u201d it said. \u201cClearly, the implementation of \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 is more complicated than thought.\u201dAfter the editorial\u2019s publication, comments written in the simplified Chinese characters used in mainland China began appearing on the film\u2019s Facebook page, with many expressing a wish for the film to be shown in the mainland.While Mr. Ng agrees that the film portrays a dark future, he points viewers to glimmers of hope.

{"Headline": "Clinton, Sanders and O\u2019Malley Save Sharpest Jabs for G.O.P. in Las Vegas", "Date": "2016-01-07", "News": "LAS VEGAS \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Using strikingly similar pitches, Hillary Clinton, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Gov. Martin O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Malley of Maryland tried their best on Wednesday to persuade a room full of Nevada Democrats to support their bids to be the next Democratic presidential nominee.The sold-out event, the Battle Born Battleground First in the West Caucus Dinner, was hosted by the state Democratic Party and Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the minority leader. There was no debate or a question-and-answer session with the audience. Instead, each candidate made separate remarks, pointedly criticizing Republicans. They touched on their plans to keep Americans safe from terrorism, to strengthen the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy, to move toward cleaner energy sources and to address social issues like protecting the working class.About 2,200 people attended the $125-a-seat event, which at times felt like a sporting event with supporters of Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders sitting in large sections on opposite sides of the room and taking turns cheering, waving signs and blowing horns with chants of \u00e2\u0080\u009cH.R.C.\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cBernie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Malley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supporters did not have a similar large section at the dinner but his campaign did set up a table nestled in between his opponent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tables.The candidates only briefly appeared on stage together before going backstage and coming out one at a time to address the boisterous crowd, where they tried to differentiate themselves from their opponents.Mrs. Clinton seemed to question Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plan\u00c2\u00a0to make public colleges tuition-free, saying that taxpayers shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u00e2\u0080\u009cpay for Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kids to go to college for free.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders appeared to be taking a shot at Mrs. Clinton by arguing that the change America needs will not come from \u00e2\u0080\u009cestablishment politics and establishment economics.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut the candidates saved their harshest critiques for the Republicans. Each said that an immigration overhaul should not include mass deportations, that the American economy should better serve the middle class, and that keeping the country safe from terrorism should not mean vilifying ethnic groups. They also all talked about raising the minimum wage and strengthening the ability of workers to organize and bargain with employers.Mrs. Clinton, a former secretary of state, energetically framed herself as the best candidate to match up against the Republican nominee in the general election. She criticized Senator Marco Rubio of Florida for helping write a 2013 immigration bill and then renouncing it, and Donald J. Trump for wanting to deport millions of immigrants and for referring to Mexicans as criminals.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Republicans, what do they do? They just promise more new big giveaways to the wealthy at a time when the superrich and big corporations are already gaming the system,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey should pay their fair share, and under my administration they will.\u00e2\u0080\u009dShe also laid out her experience as first lady, as a senator from New York and as secretary of state, while adding that Republicans were afraid of her and had already begun attacking her in advertisements.\u00e2\u0080\u009cAsk yourself this, if the Republicans weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worried, then why are the hedge fund billionaires already running ads against me?,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy are the Koch brothers throwing in everything they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to stop me? You know why. They know I will stand up to them and defeat their right-wing, top-down agenda that is bad for America.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Sanders, an independent and self-described Democratic socialist, continued his focus on income inequality, improving life for working-class Americans and on his plan to break up \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoo big to fail\u00e2\u0080\u009d commercial banks. He also said that while he agreed with Mrs. Clinton and Mr. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Malley that the Affordable Care Act had accomplished great things, he added that Americans need an expanded system that guarantees health care for everyone.Mr. Sanders also said that electing Republicans would widen the gap between the rich and poor, and he acknowledged that he would need to galvanize voters if he is to be elected.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe only way that Democrats win elections is when we have a large voter turnout,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRepublicans win, as they did last year, when people are demoralized and people give up on the political process. What we need in this campaign is energy. We need youth. We need working people. We need a Democratic Party that makes it clear to every worker in this country that we are on their side, and that we are prepared to take on the billionaire class.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Malley sought to portray his experience as what differentiates him from Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders. But he spent most of his time on Wednesday explaining why electing a Republican president would take the country backward. He took several jabs at Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plan to bar foreign Muslims from entering the United States, and at Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, while also praising President Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s executive actions on gun regulations.\u00e2\u0080\u009cTed Cruz actually says the answer to gun violence is more guns,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Malley said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSenator, the answer to cancer is not more cancer.\u00e2\u0080\u008b The answer to poverty is not more poverty. And the answer to gun violence isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t more guns.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWednesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s event was intended to raise awareness about the Nevada caucuses, the power of the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s increasingly diverse electorate and the West\u2019s growing political influence. Nevada will hold its Democratic caucuses on Feb. 20, making it the third state in the nominating process to vote, after Iowa and New Hampshire.Sue Stephens, 59, a retired budget analyst who lives in Las Vegas, said that she was a registered Republican but that she would consider voting for a Democratic candidate, as she did in the presidential elections of 2008 and 2012. Ms. Stephens said she was most concerned about the economy, gun control, the threat of terrorism and how young people will fare in the future.On Wednesday, she said she would be most supportive of the candidate who delivered a rational message that was focused on the future. Although she had heard all three candidates for the Democratic nomination speak before, she said she had yet to really connect with their messages.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hear what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re saying, but I feel like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just blah, blah, blah,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Stephens said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt sounds so scripted.\u00e2\u0080\u009dShe added that she might be swayed by \u00e2\u0080\u009csomeone who sounds authentic, and someone who impresses me with their knowledge and with some plans about how to move forward without being extremely radical.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMichelle Gack, 62, a retired insurance adjuster, came to the event with campaign gear showing her support for Mrs. Clinton. Though she has already decided to vote for Mrs. Clinton, she said she hoped her candidate would show a more personable and relatable side so that she draws more support from voters in Nevada.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t realize what a nurturing mother and grandmother she is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Gack said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see that side of her, and it is tough for women to go up against what has traditionally been a man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s world politically. I think it does her a lot of good to show her strength as well as her calm demeanor.\u00e2\u0080\u009dEduardo Ruiz, 24, of Las Vegas, said that he planned to vote for Mr. Sanders, and that he hoped the senator would show people that he is willing to take somewhat moderate stances if elected, to work with lawmakers. He also said he hoped Mr. Sanders would more thoroughly explain his views as a Democratic socialist and would emphasize the importance of taking part in the political system.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI feel like the biggest problem is that a lot of people who support him don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe he can make it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Ruiz, who works at an electronics store. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are not the most political people, and are just getting started. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my biggest concern. I have friends who write #FeelTheBern.

{"Headline": "Instagram and the Watch World", "Date": "2016-01-18", "News": "Supported byInstagram, the photo-sharing app that has become the social media conduit of choice for the world\u2019s creative classes, is playing a big role in the luxury watch sector, too.\u201cCustomers come in to the boutique having seen what\u2019s just been posted, receiving it direct on their phone,\u201d said Tim Malachard, global managing director at Richard Mille, the Swiss watchmaker.A relative newcomer on the luxury watch scene, Richard Mille, a 15-year-old company, went from an Instagram following of 7,000 at the start of 2015 to 93,600 by year\u2019s end. (It also has a Facebook site and a Twitter account with 12,800 followers.) In recent years the company has synched its marketing and press materials with its social media efforts, Mr. Malachard said, so that all external communications are part of the same conversation \u2014 illustrating and reinforcing brand identity.The company\u2019s 194 Instagram posts, for example, range from a recent photograph of the French racing driver S\u00e9bastien Loeb wearing a RM 36-01 G-sensor Tourbillon \u2014 which echoes the company\u2019s tag line, \u201cA racing machine on the wrist\u201d \u2014 to a close-up of its RM 07-02 Pink Lady Sapphire.Instagram\u2019s visual nature is what makes an impact, many watchmakers say. And the detail shots of watches display \u201cdifferent angles, highlighting the complexities,\u201d Mr. Malachard said, in a way that would be hard to duplicate in another medium.Shiny dials, intricate cogs, lean leather straps and diamond detailing: For Jens Henning Koch, executive vice president for communications and product at Montblanc, Instagram \u201callows you to really talk and show more than you normally would.\u201dCartier, with its 2.3 million Instagram followers, has taken similar considerations into account, according to its official comment: \u201cSocial media has become more and more influential in the past few years and has become a very important source of information for luxury consumers; it provides platforms for consumers to access directly the Cartier brand, following us to see what we are doing and what is new.\u201dThe house\u2019s December posts included a variety of gift suggestions from its product lines, holiday greetings with Cartier\u2019s iconic panther rendered as a cuddly baby animal and photographs of its decorated stores in locations as diverse as Paris, Milan and Chengdu, China. (The house also uses WeChat, the text messaging service popular in China, to extend its outreach.)Even retailing outlets are using the app\u2019s appeal to extend sales efforts. Harrods, the London department store, recently introduced an Instagram account dedicated to fine watches \u2014 @HarrodsTimes \u2014 recognizing that the account would be a useful addition to its social media array.\u201cSocial media is an incredibly important tool for fine watch brands and retailers alike, who are becoming increasingly aware of its ability to enhance the brand experience and awareness,\u201d Jason Broderick, fashion director of men\u2019s wear, sports and fine watches at Harrods, said in an email.\u201cWe have seen an increased number of customers telling us about their research using many forms of digital communication before making their final decision on a potential purchase,\u201d he added.Beyond marketing and sales, Instagram \u2014 and social media as a whole \u2014 has created a level of consumer interaction that the rarified world of fine watchmaking had never experienced before.\u201cWe can get immediate, unfiltered and globally varied feedback on our work output from media and customers alike,\u201d Zaim Kamal, creative director at Montblanc, said in an email. (Montblanc has 187,000 Instagram followers.) \u201cThis allows us to constantly review our design approach. We are much more in tune with the audience rather than second-guessing their perception, expectations and aspirations.\u201dHis sentiment was echoed by Caroline Scheufele, artistic director and co-president of Chopard (589,000 Instagram followers). \u201cBasically you can reach the world in a click,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can communicate much faster with our clients who come back to the house year after year\u201d as well as potential Chopard customers.Fawaz Gruosi, founder and director of the watch and jewelry maker De Grisogono, agreed that \u201cInstagram is a very interesting opportunity to discuss and engage with the brand\u2019s fans and influencers.\u201d But in an email, he added that the \u201clikes\u201d of its 120,000 followers did \u201cnot affect the design process, but it clearly provides access to receiving immediate feedback on the specific designs and products.\u201dMr. Henning Koch briefly explained Montblanc\u2019s overall approach to social media: \u201cWe look at it as: update, inspire and deepen.\u201cUpdate \u2014 you can talk about the launches and what is very new; then inspire: more interactive, a playful element of how you present things while still adhering to the brand DNA. There is also an exchange of feedback.\u201d\u201cThe third is to deepen the relationship with the fans,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are certain behind-the-scenes elements you can play with\u201d \u2014 like the precision diagrams showing how a watch is designed.Four thousand and eighty-nine \u201clikes,\u201d and it isn\u2019t even on a wrist yet.CHOOSING THE MONEY SHOTExecutives at watch and jewelry houses say there are several things to keep in mind in the hunt for Instagram followers and \u201clikes.\u201dWelcome to our world\u201cIt\u2019s not just about posting images of the latest products,\u201d said Tim Malachard, global managing director of Richard Mille, the Swiss watchmaker. \u201cIt\u2019s about graphic photos and storytelling, showing off the complexities and showing the different disciplines we\u2019re involved with.\u201dBut, he added, it pays to keep an air of mystery and not to spam users: \u201cWe post when there is something important to say.\u201dCaroline Scheufele, artistic director and co-president of Chopard, agreed. \u201cWe communicate a lot of our international events and the more social side of Chopard than the product itself,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce in a while we show new product, but we are not constantly hammering it on Instagram.\u201dGet up close and personalAnish Bhatt, whose popular blog Watch Anish has an even more popular Instagram account, with 1.5 million followers, says photographs must be \u201cgood quality, magazine quality, at least.\u201d And, he added, it helps if they include faces that the public knows \u2014 brand ambassadors, celebrities or so-called influencers.Jason Broderick, fashion director of men\u2019s wear, sports and fine watches at Harrods, said, \u201cTAG Heuer\u2019s ongoing collaboration with model and influencer Cara Delevingne, for example, highlights the way in which brands are increasingly harnessing the power of the social media savvy generation.\u201dThe celebrity factor draws more than just die-hard watch fans, with the result that, as Mr. Bhatt observed, brands have \u201cseen a whole new type of business and commerce evolve, that wouldn\u2019t have happened 10 years ago.\u201dThe planJens Henning Koch, executive vice president for communications and product at Montblanc, said an Instagram feed was \u201ca mixture of relevance, uniqueness and surprise; putting it in context and creating something new.\u201d\u201cBut when you do find a formula,\u201d he added, \u201cyou have to be careful not to repeat it because then it can become the wrong context.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the year that the Richard Mille Facebook page was created. It was 2008, not 2001.Advertisement"}

He added that he believed his strategy was working because polls used to put him 40 to 50 points behind Mrs. Clinton, and now they showed him running neck and neck with her in Iowa.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are now nip and tuck with Hillary Clinton,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe kind of positive campaign that we are running is not just because I think it is the moral and right thing to do.

{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders Is Healthy, His Doctor Declares", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "The letter, released Thursday by the Sanders campaign, was dated Jan. 20 and signed by Dr. Brian P. Monahan, the attending physician of Congress.Dr. Monahan wrote that Mr. Sanders was last examined on Nov. 18, and had normal readings for blood pressure, pulse and blood count. He said the senator had no history of cardiovascular disease.\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are in overall very good health and active in your professional work, and recreational lifestyle without limitation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he concluded.Mr. Sanders, who would be the oldest person ever elected president (he turns 75 in September), had been under pressure to release information about his health before the Iowa caucuses on Monday.His chief opponent for the Democratic presidential nomination, Hillary Clinton, 68, released a letter from her doctor in July that said she was also in good health.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is nothing surprising in these medical records,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Symone Sanders, a spokeswoman for the Sanders campaign, said Thursday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe senator is in great health, as he has previously said.\u00e2\u0080\u009dReferring to his candidacy, Ms. Sanders added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe would not have done this if he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think he was up to this both mentally and physically.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAmong the ailments for which Mr. Sanders has been treated over the years are gout; mild elevation of cholesterol; an underactive thyroid gland, for which he takes hormone replacement therapy; and inflammation of out-pouches in the colon known as diverticulitis.Mr. Sanders also been treated for superficial skin cancers, lower back strain and laryngitis from acid reflux. He has had surgery to remove the cyst in his vocal cord and laparoscopic repair of a hernia on both sides of his lower abdomen, Dr. Monahan wrote. He did not list the surgery dates, but Mr. Sanders was widely reported to have had outpatient hernia surgery in November.The doctor did not state when Mr. Sanders was treated for high cholesterol. Because Dr. Monahan did not list a statin or similar drug under Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current medications, presumably the senator no longer takes such treatment.Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cholesterol level was 196 milligrams per deciliter; a level of less than 180 milligrams is considered normal. His LDL (bad) cholesterol level was 125 milligrams per deciliter; optimal is considered less than 100 milligrams.His HDL (good) cholesterol was 46; greater than 60 is considered protective. Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 electrocardiogram was normal.Mr. Sanders, who is 6 feet and 179 pounds, does not smoke and uses alcohol \u00e2\u0080\u009cinfrequently,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the doctor wrote. He said Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most recent colonoscopy, the date of which was not given, was normal.Dr. Monahan did not state when or how often Mr. Sanders had attacks of gout.Gout, a painful ailment affecting joints resulting from deposits of needlelike uric acid, was known for centuries as a rich man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease, as many patients were wealthy and had diets rich in purines (which break down into uric acid) like meats and seafood. But scientists have come to understand that gout is as much, if not more, a metabolic than a nutritional disease.The National Institutes of Health estimates that 4 percent of Americans have gout and that its prevalence has been increasing.

{"Headline": "I.P.F., Not Aging, Could Be Causing Breathlessness", "Date": "2016-01-11", "News": "Daniel Castner of Napa, Calif., speaks from experience when he advises people to pay attention to their bodies and have anything unusual thoroughly checked out without delay. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just possible there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a treatment that can nip a problem in the bud if treatment is started soon enough.Mr. Castner learned at age 63 that he has a progressive, incurable lung disease called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or I.P.F., that more often than not seems to come out of nowhere (idiopathic means of no known cause). Mr. Castner, now 67, was no slouch at the time. He had been an avid backpacker, cyclist, hiker, skier and gardener most of his adult life. But in 2012, while hiking with his family at Lake Tahoe at nearly 7,000 feet above sea level, he experienced \u00e2\u0080\u009cpronounced shortness of breath,\u00e2\u0080\u009d his wife, Susan, told me.Two months later, a pulmonologist diagnosed I.P.F., a disease that reduces the lungs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ability to extract oxygen from the air and distribute it to the rest of the body. At the time, there were no effective treatments in the United States. But there was a drug in use in Europe called Esbriet that had been shown to slow the loss of lung function and significantly reduce deaths from the disease.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can get breathy if I have to lift things, so Susan steps in to help,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no problem with her doing some of the heavy work. I like hanging with her.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe wonders, though, how much better off he might be now if he had been able to start one of the new drugs at the time of his diagnosis, when his loss of lung function was only at 20 percent, rather than when he was finally able to get the drug, when his loss of function was at 60 percent.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve experienced no change in my condition, no major deterioration, since I started on Esbriet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Castner told me, adding that he has been free of the drug\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible side effects. Now he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hellbent on getting the word out to the more than 100,000 people in this country known to have idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, along with many others who have yet to learn this is why they are often breathless.Dr. Talmadge E. King, Jr., the dean of the medical school at the University of California, San Francisco, who directed one of the definitive studies of Esbriet, said that the drug \u00e2\u0080\u009creduced by about 48 percent the proportion of patients who declined, showing that the drug worked to slow the rate at which patients got worse. The mortality rate dropped more than we expected.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDr. King said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I started in pulmonology 30 years ago, everyone with this disease died. Now we can say to patients that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to get worse, but at a slower rate, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be alive.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAs Mr. Castner put it: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I was first diagnosed, I started thinking about the last things I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d get to see before I died. Now I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think about death. I have this disease \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fact of life \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and even though I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do all the physical stuff I used to do, I can still cook and garden with my wife, go out to dinner, walk on flat surfaces and enjoy a glass of wine with friends.\u00e2\u0080\u009d All of which has inspired his effort to \u00e2\u0080\u009cget the word out to other patients that there is now hope.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMore than 14,000 patients in this country have begun treatment with Esbriet, so clearly there are many more who might benefit from it or Ofev, a much newer drug with a somewhat different mechanism of action. Studies are planned to see if the two drugs together \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or with other drugs now in development \u00e2\u0080\u0094 might be more beneficial than either alone.Though categorized as a rare disease, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI.P.F. is much more common than is usually realized,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Steven Nathan, a pulmonologist at Inova Fairfax Hospital in Falls Church, Va. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd for whatever reason, its prevalence is increasing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said the disease was believed to occur mainly in genetically susceptible people who are exposed to irritants like cigarette smoke or occupational dusts or fumes.On average, it takes patients with I.P.F. two years to be diagnosed correctly. People often attribute their breathlessness to lack of fitness or advancing age because I.P.F. is typically a disease of older people. And doctors often mistake it for asthma, heart disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or confuse it with one of the dozens of other interstitial lung diseases. In addition to shortness of breath, sometimes even during normal daily activities, a persistent cough that does not produce phlegm is a common symptom.Yet with a high index of suspicion and the right tests, diagnosing I.P.F. is not that challenging. Listening through a stethoscope when patients inhale, doctors can hear a crackling sound that resembles pieces of Velcro being pulled apart. Pulmonary hypertension, or elevated blood pressure in the lungs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 vessels, is common. Its presence can be suggested by an echocardiogram and confirmed by catheterizing the right side of the heart. And while the signs of I.P.F. are usually missed with a traditional chest X-ray, a high-resolution CT scan of the chest can show a pattern of lung scarring characteristic of the disease.A patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lung function is assessed with a six-minute walk test to show how much the oxygen level in the blood drops during the exercise. Another test uses carbon monoxide to measure how much air the lungs can inhale and exhale.Esbriet, known generically as pirfenidone and marketed by Roche, is thought to counter lung fibrosis by decreasing the production of collagen and factors that promote growth and inflammation. It is not recommended for people with liver or kidney problems, and smoking can diminish its effectiveness. Ofev, known generically as nintedanib, is marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim; it too inhibits fibrosis by targeting various growth factors.Mr. Castner, who receives Esbriet free through Medicare, said that without insurance, the drug would cost $94,000 a year. Ofev is slightly more expensive, $96,000 a year.Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "Senate to Consider House Bill Tightening Restrictions on Refugees", "Date": "2016-01-20", "News": "The Syrian refugee issue returns to Capitol Hill on Wednesday with Senate Republicans eager to bring up a bill passed by the House in November to tighten scrutiny of those entering the United States from Syria and Iraq.Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, has set a vote for Wednesday afternoon on opening debate over the refugee measure, which was approved by the House before Thanksgiving in the immediate aftermath of the Paris terrorist attacks. While 47 Democrats joined Republicans in speeding the measure through the House, the legislation\u2019s politics have shifted slightly.After the Thanksgiving break, Congress turned its attention from the refugee issue to strengthening the Visa Waiver Program, which many lawmakers and the Obama administration identified as a greater vulnerability for allowing terrorists into the country, especially those with European passports. At the same time, critics of the refugee bill pointed to the extensive vetting that applicants undergo, arguing that the existing review would deter any terrorists, while tightening the program would penalize legitimate refugees fleeing violence in Iraq and Syria.Mr. McConnell took aim at those arguments on Tuesday. \u201cThis debate should be driven by facts and common sense, not fear-mongering about targeting \u00e2\u0080\u0098widows and orphans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 or other straw-man arguments from the White House that demean a serious conversation,\u201d he said.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Living With Cancer: A Broken Covenant With Patients", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Susan Gubar writes about life with ovarian cancer.In 2007, federal law mandated that all pharmaceutical companies, universities and hospitals conducting clinical trials must disclose study results and adverse events on ClinicalTrials.gov, a website used by a large percentage of doctors and patients. Mr. Piller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s evidence proves that pharmaceutical companies have often failed to follow the law while prestigious medical research institutions have routinely flouted it. Malfeasance appears to be the rule, not the exception.An example from the pharmaceutical industry: According to Mr. Piller, in my home state, Indiana, the nonprofit Hoosier Cancer Research Network, which runs trials for drug companies, terminated a study of Avastin in 2009 because it did not help but harmed patients with metastatic breast cancer. During the next two years, the trial\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investigators neither published their results in a journal nor posted them on ClinicalTrials.gov. It was not until 2011 that the F.D.A. revoked approval of Avastin for metastatic breast cancer because of its life-threatening risks. How many sick women were unnecessarily endangered between 2009 and 2011?An example from the prestigious medical research institutions: According to Mr. Piller, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center broke the law on 100 percent of its studies\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009creporting results late or not at all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In two trials of the experimental drug ganetespib, it failed to report adverse consequences \u00e2\u0080\u0094 heart and liver disorders, bowel and colon obstructions, death \u00e2\u0080\u0094 affecting \u00e2\u0080\u009cvolunteers\u00e2\u0080\u009d with breast and colorectal cancers.The word \u00e2\u0080\u009cvolunteers\u00e2\u0080\u009d reminds us that the often debilitated participants in clinical cancer trials decide on their own accord to put their lives on the line, usually with no resulting personal health benefit. It also brings to my mind the first anxious days of my participation in the Phase I trial that I began in August 2012.My husband and I undertook the one-hour drive from Bloomington to the Indianapolis cancer center at the crack of dawn. Inside a hospital room from 8 a.m. until 11 p.m., I spent a long period of that time fasting. Because the experimental drug had never been used on human beings before, I was monitored every hour with all sorts of tests that were followed by various infusions to offset potential side effects. Totally exhausted upon release, my husband and I got lost finding our way to a bleak motel, paid for by the trial because we had to return to the hospital the next morning for more testing.The stressful and demanding start of the trial forecast its evolution. To date, I have had approximately 20 CT scans for the trial\u00e2\u0080\u0094not one of which was good for me physically or psychologically, but all of which help researchers ascertain how the drug I take works. Yet the knowledge they gain from this study remains barren, if it does not circulate among other researchers, cancer doctors, and patients. I benefit from the study drug, but no one else will be aided unless at its conclusion the results of the trial are promptly reported not just in a medical journal but on the site provided for the dissemination of information required by law.Because of my own prejudices, I was dismayed but not surprised to read about the noncompliance of big pharma in Mr. Piller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s article. What I found appalling were the widespread legal and, to my mind, ethical violations of academics like me. Clearly university hospitals need to help faculty members disclose their trial results in a timely manner. Busy schedules, technical difficulties, or staff shortages should not be used to justify an egregious failure to report findings since widely circulated trial results \u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially adverse or failed findings \u00e2\u0080\u0094 insure the progress of research as well as the quality of treatment.The scandal proliferates. Apparently the F.D.A. can levy fines up to $10,000 a day per trial for late reporting; however, it has never penalized any institution or company for failing to post on ClinicalTrials.gov. Why would such a revenue opportunity \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that could be used to fund cancer research \u00e2\u0080\u0094 be lost? And why has the N.I.H., which supplies so much federal funding for clinical studies but which has a spotty history of disclosure itself, not enforced the obligation to report?Like quite a few patients, I live and breathe today because of cutting-edge research. With conventional medicine, I would have died back in 2013. So I remain fervent in my support of clinical trials. I am not alone among such supporters in believing that research investigators need to improve their accountability and transparency. Alltrials.net campaigns for all clinical trials to be registered and their result reported.When before the start of my trial I read the 20 or 30 pages of boilerplate, I signed on the dotted line, even though the document informed me that the drug might kill me and that its administrators would not be held accountable. I signed because I wanted to see if a new approach might save me from the miseries of standard treatments that had proven inefficacious. I also signed because I wanted to help other people with cancer.It was a legal and moral contract. Thousands of patients have kept our side of the covenant. The researchers and the institutions for which they work should keep theirs.Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "Bill de Blasio Not Keen on a Bloomberg Presidential Run", "Date": "2016-01-25", "News": "Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York weighed in Monday on a potential presidential run by his predecessor, Michael R.

Still, the mayor said he could not support a Bloomberg candidacy, even one that remains notional at this point.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s focused on income inequality,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. de Blasio, who has molded his administration, now at its midway point, around that issue. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is why I think the people of this country are going to look and say, \u2018Some very wealthy and powerful people put us in this mess, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to want a solution that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very different.\u2019\u00e2\u0080\u009dSpeaking at a news conference on New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response to a near-record snowfall, Mr. de Blasio reiterated at several points that \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy candidate for president\u00e2\u0080\u009d is Hillary Clinton. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe will be the next president of the United States,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m very convinced.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Bloomberg has not announced he is running for president.

{"Headline": "Meredith Wild, a Self-Publisher Making an Imprint", "Date": "2016-01-30", "News": "Supported byOne chilly morning this month, Meredith Wild, the best-selling romance novelist, was sitting in her library in Destin, Fla., wrapped in a loose black sweater in front of a crackling fire. Most mornings, Ms. Wild writes her novels in this spot after her children leave for school, but that day she had other business to attend to. She had a call with a reality TV production company that is developing a show about her, and later, a conference call with a team at Waterhouse Press, the small imprint that is publishing her new novel in June.Ms. Wild has an unusual amount of sway for an author, owing to her high-profile position at Waterhouse: She founded the company. After sales of her self-published erotic novels took off on Amazon and other sites, Ms. Wild created the press partly as a way to get print versions into bookstore chains and big-box stores.\u201cI wanted something that sounded like it was a real imprint, because nobody takes you seriously as an independent author,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt I was being discriminated against as an indie.\u201dHer marketing abilities proved so effective \u2014 she sold 1.4 million print and digital copies \u2014 that she decided to expand her business by taking on other authors, in essence becoming a publisher herself.Last year, Ms. Wild began quietly acquiring works by other self-published romance writers, including Helen Hardt and Audrey Carlan, and publishing their books under her Waterhouse imprint. The press will release at least nine novels this year, including two in Ms. Wild\u2019s current series. She\u2019s become a kind of value investor in erotic prose, pinpointing undervalued writers and backing their brands.\u201cWe\u2019re hoping to discover the next big person and replicate some of the success we had building the visibility of my books,\u201d Ms. Wild said. \u201cWe\u2019re interested in taking these diamond-in-the-rough type people and building their brands.\u201dThe fledgling imprint is already off to a promising start. One of the series it acquired, Ms. Carlan\u2019s \u201cCalendar Girl,\u201d has sold more than a million copies since Waterhouse rereleased it last summer, and it recently appeared on the USA Today and New York Times best-seller lists.Ms. Wild\u2019s path from becoming a self-publishing star to operating her own small imprint is the latest sign that independent authors are catching up to publishers in the sophistication of their marketing and the scope of their ambitions. Self-published authors can negotiate foreign-rights deals and produce audiobooks. A handful of the most successful independent writers sell print copies of their books in physical retail stores like Barnes & Noble, Walmart and Target, giving them access to a market that traditional publishers have long dominated.Now enterprising authors like Ms. Wild are forming their own small publishing houses. Just like the old-guard editors and publishing companies that they once defined themselves against, these new imprints promise to anoint fledgling authors with legitimacy and give them an edge in a flooded and cutthroat marketplace.In a sense, these authors-turned-publishers are thriving because the self-publishing ecosystem has become oversaturated. Amazon has more than four million e-books in its Kindle store, up from 600,000 six years ago, making it harder for new authors to find an audience. Building your own brand may sound appealing and empowering, but only a small fraction of self-published authors sell enough books to make a living, and many are put off by the drudge work and endless self-promotion involved.\u201cAuthors are hungry to try to find new methods to crack the market, and if someone is saying, \u2018I did it, come work with me, and I\u2019ll teach you the secret sauce,\u2019 that sounds like an interesting proposition,\u201d said Peter Hildick-Smith, founder of the Codex Group, which analyzes the book industry.Standing in front of a bookcase in her library, where she has prominently displayed books by Ms. Hardt and Ms. Carlan, Ms. Wild seemed to derive equal satisfaction from the books of others she has published as from those she has written herself. The bottom shelves remained empty, reserved for future acquisitions.\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to filling them up,\u201d she said.Later that morning, Ms. Wild and her husband, Jonathan, sat on the couch in front of the fireplace, each holding a printed agenda. It was time for the conference call with David Grishman, Waterhouse\u2019s chief executive, and three other Waterhouse employees. A former firefighter, her husband now works at Waterhouse on the marketing team. Floor-to-ceiling windows looked out onto a swimming pool and beyond it, the choppy, blue-gray water of Choctawhatchee Bay.They discussed Ms. Wild\u2019s writing schedule and the marketing strategy for Ms. Hardt\u2019s next novel, an erotic romance set in the Victorian era. Then the conversation shifted to Ms. Carlan. Barnes & Noble had just placed a paperback order for her \u201cCalendar Girl\u2019\u2019 series, about a young woman who becomes a high-priced escort to settle her father\u2019s gambling debts.\u201cWe\u2019re at the top of Nook, iBooks and Kindle,\u201d Mr. Grishman said. \u201cWe\u2019re selling a lot. We should look at another print run.\u201d He suggested printing an additional 30,000 books of the first two volumes.When the call ended, the mood was giddy.For decades, the literary world dismissed self-published authors as amateurs and hacks who lacked the talent to land a book deal. But that attitude gradually began to change with the rise of e-books and the arrival of Kindle from Amazon, which gave authors direct access to millions of readers. Over the last five years, close to 40 independent authors have sold more than a million copies of their e-books on Amazon, the company said.After Ms. Wild\u2019s self-published \u201cHacker\u201d series took off in 2014, she was bombarded with offers from publishers, agents and film producers. She was earning so much by then that she told her agent she would entertain only eight-figure offers. She eventually settled for a bit less, agreeing to a $6.25 million advance from Forever, a Grand Central Publishing imprint, for five books.Forever has sold nearly 500,000 digital and print copies of the \u201cHacker\u201d series \u2014 a healthy sum, but far less than the 1.4 million digital and print books Ms. Wild had sold on her own, without any of the editorial guidance, marketing muscle or sales and distribution channels of an established publisher.Perhaps that\u2019s why Ms. Wild opted not to sell the rights to her other books. Instead, she\u2019s publishing her current series through her own imprint.\u201cI\u2019m more comfortable being in control of my successes and failures,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to be on the sidelines.\u201dEditors and publishers are adjusting to a new power dynamic, one in which even multimillion-dollar advances aren\u2019t enough to ensure an author\u2019s loyalty.\u201cIt\u2019s a challenge, because a lot of the ones who are very successful at it are making a lot of money, which in all honesty can be hard to match with the traditional publishing royalty structure,\u201d said Leah Hultenschmidt, the Forever editor who acquired the Hacker series from Ms. Wild.Publishers fighting to recruit top-selling authors have other reasons to be alarmed by the growth of self-publishing. As independent authors grab a bigger slice of the e-book market, digital sales by traditional publishers fell by 11 percent in the first nine months of 2015, according to data gathered from more than 1,200 publishers by the Association of American Publishers.Last year, a third of the 100 best-selling Kindle books were self-published titles on average each week, an Amazon representative said. Some analysts attribute the dip in publishers\u2019 e-book revenue in part to the glut of cheap self-published books, which often sell for as little as $1.Independent authors are now moving beyond e-books and making inroads into the physical retail market. A handful of the top-selling self-published authors, among them Ms. Wild, Barbara Freethy, H.M. Ward, C J Lyons and Bella Andre, have struck distribution deals with Ingram Content Group, a major book printer and distributor, allowing them to sell their novels in bookstore chains, big-box stores and airports. Thirty-six percent of book buyers read only print books, according to a 2015 survey conducted by the Codex Group.\u201cI can sell my books exactly as if I was Random House or Simon & Schuster,\u201d said Ms. Freethy, who started self-publishing romance novels in 2011 and said she had sold more than five million copies. \u201cThere\u2019s been no pushback from booksellers.\u201dWith all the tools of a publisher at their disposal, it\u2019s no surprise that a few of the most ambitious authors \u2014 among them the paranormal suspense writer J.R. Rain and the mystery writer Gemma Halliday \u2014 are forming their own imprints and recruiting other writers. The business models for author-led imprints vary, but most of them buy publication rights to the books and take a cut of royalties in exchange for editing, formatting, packaging and marketing the books, much like a traditional publisher. Some offer a modest advance. The biggest draw for struggling authors, though, is the chance to be associated with a more successful author\u2019s brand.After selling three million copies of her own books, Liliana Hart, a high school band teacher turned mystery writer, started her own imprint, SilverHart last year and acquired works by four other authors.\u201cThey don\u2019t want the headache of being their own publisher,\u201d Ms. Hart said.When Ms. Wild started writing several years ago, it was mainly to escape the pressures of a day job running her own web design and software development company. She never intended to become a publisher, but seemed unable to resist the entrepreneurial urge. \u201cI can\u2019t do anything without turning it into a business,\u201d said Ms. Wild, 33, who is blond with icy blue eyes and sharp, pixielike features.As a girl growing up in Fulton, Ill., a small town of about 3,500 people, Ms. Wild was a voracious reader. She was the only child of free-spirited, hippie parents \u2014 her mother and stepfather ran an auction company \u2014 and entertained herself with paperback bodice-rippers she bought at the grocery store. She started writing her own elaborate stories on her mother\u2019s computer.She moved east to attend Smith College, where she majored in English and met her husband at a fraternity party at a nearby university. They married when she was 20 and moved to Destin, where he was stationed in the Air Force. Ms. Wild had studied graphic design, so she decided to start her own company. Within a few years, it had 10 employees.The experience of starting and running a business gave Ms. Wild the idea for her first novel in the \u201cHacker\u201d series, \u201cHardwired,\u201d which is about a young Harvard graduate, Erica Hathaway, who is raising money from investors for her start-up. During a pitch meeting to a group of angel investors, she meets Blake Landon, a handsome billionaire, who later seduces her at a tech conference. Erica\u2019s focus on building her company, a fashion-themed social networking site, is occasionally derailed by her torrid relationship with Blake, who introduces her to an array of sexual kinks.Ms. Wild never bothered trying to find a traditional publisher.\u201cI came from such an entrepreneurial background,\u201d Ms. Wild said. \u201cI knew I could market them myself.\u201dShe chose Meredith Wild as a pen name. (She asked that her real name and her husband\u2019s last name not be used to protect their children\u2019s privacy, citing the news coverage of her multimillion-dollar book deal.) She hired an editor to help shape the story and clean up the prose, and published the first novel in September 2013.Ms. Wild\u2019s success wasn\u2019t accidental, but grew out of a meticulously planned marketing campaign. Before the book was even released, she began buying online ads targeting erotic romance readers. Her husband took out 10 credit cards and a personal loan to pay for advertising. They borrowed $70,000 from Mr. Grishman, a former banker who is Ms. Wild\u2019s brother-in-law. They eventually raised enough to fund a six-figure national marketing campaign, which included paid posts on social media and movie theater ads promoting \u201cHardwired\u201d that played before the \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d movie.\u201cHardwired\u201d took off instantly, and sales snowballed when the second and third novels were released.By that summer, Ms. Wild was making $500,000 a month in royalties. Her books were selling briskly through Amazon and Barnes & Noble. She arranged her own audiobook deal with Audible, forgoing an advance in exchange for higher royalties. She sold translation rights to publishers in several countries.Ms. Wild sold her web design company. She hired Mr. Grishman to run Waterhouse, so that she could focus on writing. As the company grew and her sales surged, she realized she already had the infrastructure for a publishing house of her own. She just needed more authors.The first author she signed was Ms. Hardt, who had been writing romance novels for a decade but never did much to market them. Waterhouse is acquiring all her books \u2014 more than 30 titles. \u201cI thought it could get my name out there better than I had been able to do for myself,\u201d she said, \u201cand it certainly has.\u201dA few months later, Waterhouse discovered Ms. Carlan. \u201cWe found her through her Amazon ranking, not because she was doing well but because she wasn\u2019t doing very well,\u201d Ms. Wild said. Ms. Carlan had great reviews but low Amazon sales rankings, suggesting that she was talented but lacked marketing skills.Ms. Carlan, a mother of two who lives in Northern California, had been self-publishing romance novels for about a year, charging 99 cents and selling about 1,000 copies a month. She was dubious at first when she got an email from a marketing manager, who asked her if she wanted to publish her books with Meredith Wild\u2019s imprint.\u201cWhen she said \u2018Meredith Wild\u2019 I thought, \u2018You\u2019re full of it,\u2019\u201d Ms. Carlan said. \u201cI\u2019d read all her books.\u201dWaterhouse bought all of Ms. Carlan\u2019s existing books and signed her to a 27-book deal. Ms. Carlan said she was paid a few thousand dollars per book, plus a percentage of royalties. Waterhouse raised the price of her novellas to $2.99 and toned down the sexy covers on her \u201cCalendar Girl\u201d series so that it could be marketed to mainstream retailers. It promoted the books through paid web advertising, and Ms. Wild endorsed them on her Facebook and Twitter feeds.In December and January, the first book in the series shot up the USA Today and New York Times best-seller lists. The novellas have sold more than 800,000 copies in January. In December, Ms. Carlan says, she made about $20,000 in royalties.Ms. Carlan, whose contract calls for a book every two months, said it was a relief to be able to focus on writing sex scenes.\u201cI\u2019m not interested in designing websites and formatting my books,\u201d she said. \u201cI just want to write wicked hot books.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Reducing Preventable Harm in Hospitals", "Date": "2016-01-26", "News": "First of two articles.Each year, in the United States, millions of patients are harmed while receiving care in hospitals. They get infections, experience adverse reactions to drugs, develop dangerous bed sores, or come down with pneumonia from the very ventilators meant to help them breathe.Amid the complexity, the chaotic pace, and the increasing need for coordination, how can hospitals do better to improve patient safety? How can they ensure, for example, that every single time a patient receives a medication, precautions are taken to reduce the risks of an adverse drug reaction?Or that every time medical practitioners insert a central line catheter into a major artery or vein, they wash their hands, use sterile drapes, and remove it as soon as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no longer needed?Wagner found a small group of hospitals with organ donation rates over 70 or 80 percent. Clearly, it was possible to do better. Would they share their practices with others? He went to hospitals with low donation rates, and asked the leaders if they would join and commit to a 75 percent organ donation rate. Surprisingly, he saw that just making a simple request was often enough to bring people onboard.The collaborative organized learning sessions and showcased successes. Wagner saw that the best thing for the government to do was get out of the way and let hospital teams learn from one another. As more hospitals joined, the pace of learning accelerated. Wagner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team checked in regularly to track progress and challenge partners to do more.

{"Headline": "The Health Benefits of Knitting", "Date": "2016-01-25", "News": "Jane Brody on health and aging.My mother had taught me to knit at 15, and I knitted in class throughout college and for a few years thereafter. Then decades passed without my touching a knitting needle. But within two Mondays in the group, I was hooked, not only on knitting but also on crocheting, and I was on my way to becoming a highly productive crafter.I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made countless afghans, baby blankets, sweaters, vests, shawls, scarves, hats, mittens, caps for newborns and two bedspreads. I take a yarn project with me everywhere, especially when I have to sit still and listen. As I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d discovered in college, when my hands are busy, my mind stays focused on the here and now.Last April, the council created a \u00e2\u0080\u009cStitch Away Stress\u00e2\u0080\u009d campaign in honor of National Stress Awareness Month. Dr. Herbert Benson, a pioneer in mind/body medicine and author of \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Relaxation Response,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says that the repetitive action of needlework can induce a relaxed state like that associated with meditation and yoga. Once you get beyond the initial learning curve, knitting and crocheting can lower heart rate and blood pressure and reduce harmful blood levels of the stress hormone cortisol.But unlike meditation, craft activities result in tangible and often useful products that can enhance self-esteem. I keep photos of my singular accomplishments on my cellphone to boost my spirits when needed.Since the 1990s, the council has surveyed hundreds of thousands of knitters and crocheters, who routinely list stress relief and creative fulfillment as the activities\u00e2\u0080\u0099 main benefits. Among them is the father of a prematurely born daughter who reported that during the baby\u00e2\u0080\u0099s five weeks in the neonatal intensive care unit, \u00e2\u0080\u009clearning how to knit preemie hats gave me a sense of purpose during a time that I felt very helpless. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a hobby that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve stuck with, and it continues to help me cope with stress at work, provide a sense of order in hectic days, and allows my brain time to solve problems.\u00e2\u0080\u009dA recent email from the yarn company Red Heart titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cHealth Benefits of Crocheting and Knitting\u00e2\u0080\u009d prompted me to explore what else might be known about the health value of activities like knitting. My research revealed that the rewards go well beyond replacing stress and anxiety with the satisfaction of creation.For example, Karen Zila Hayes, a life coach in Toronto, conducts knitting therapy programs, including Knit to Quit to help smokers give up the habit, and Knit to Heal for people coping with health crises, like a cancer diagnosis or serious illness of a family member. Schools and prisons with craft programs report that they have a calming effect and enhance social skills. And having to follow instructions on complex craft projects can improve children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s math skills.Some people find that craftwork helps them control their weight. Just as it is challenging to smoke while knitting, when hands are holding needles and hooks, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s less snacking and mindless eating out of boredom.I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve found that my handiwork with yarn has helped my arthritic fingers remain more dexterous as I age. A woman encouraged to try knitting and crocheting after developing an autoimmune disease that caused a lot of hand pain reported on the Craft Yarn Council site that her hands are now less stiff and painful.Although it is possible that only people who are cognitively healthy would pursue such activities, those who read newspapers or magazines or played music did not show similar benefits. The researchers speculate that craft activities promote the development of neural pathways in the brain that help to maintain cognitive health.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "Former Twitter Executive Kevin Weil Is Expected to Join Instagram", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Kevin Weil, a longtime Twitter executive, will soon join the photo-sharing service Instagram, according to two people familiar with the matter, joining the ranks of a company many consider one of Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main competitors.Mr. Weil, a well-liked veteran in Silicon Valley, will become head of product for Instagram, these people said.

{"Headline": "Gains Against ISIS Bring More Deaths Elsewhere in Iraq", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byBAGHDAD \u2014 When tens of thousands of civilians escaped an Islamic State onslaught on the Iraqi city of Ramadi last year, Amir Mishaan and his three children, the youngest barely a year old, were among those who settled into makeshift lives here in the capital.\u201cWe thought we escaped the terrorists to live peacefully in Baghdad,\u201d Mr. Mishaan\u2019s brother, Thamir, said in an interview. \u201cBut it seems that my brother was destined to get killed by terrorists.\u201dThe attacks in Iraq had the most casualties, and were all too familiar. Long before the rise of the Islamic State, its predecessor group, Al Qaeda in Iraq, was a guerrilla force that inflicted terror on almost a daily basis, especially in Baghdad.So after a recent shift in the world\u2019s focus to the Islamic State\u2019s seizure of territory in Iraq\u2019s north and west, Monday\u2019s attack created a back-to-the-future feel. Any celebration of military gains against the Islamic State \u2014 such as in Ramadi, the capital of Anbar Province, where Iraqi forces backed by heavy American air power managed to oust the group from much of the city \u2014 is tempered by a fear of the re-emergence of guerrilla tactics that paralyzed this city for so long.\u201cFor the last period, when ISIS was controlling Anbar, Baghdad was safer,\u201d said Faraj Yalda, who works at an appliance shop in the same neighborhood as Mr. Mishaan\u2019s store. \u201cAs soon as the security forces launched an offensive in Ramadi, ISIS resumed attacking people in Baghdad.\u201dBaghdadis are worried because the military successes have not been underpinned by progress in solving the issues that allowed ISIS to establish roots in Sunni areas in the first place. Political alienation from the Shiite-led government persists, along with a justice system that has allowed the widespread detention of young Sunni men, many without charges, and the continued exclusion from public life of anyone with connections to the Baath Party that reigned during the time of Saddam Hussein.The attack on Monday night in Baghdad involved several suicide bombers who exhausted their arsenals of grenades and guns before detonating their explosives. The next day, a shopkeeper named Hussein Hashim described the terrorists as \u201cwell-dressed, good-looking young men who were probably under the age of 30.\u201dBy Friday, much of the street was back in gear. \u201cWe clean up our shops, we take the casualties away, then we resume our lives the next day,\u201d said Ayman Raheem, 19, who works in a women\u2019s clothing shop at a shopping mall that was among the militants\u2019 targets.But up and down the street, death remained in the air. At a barber shop, a boy and his father were killed. At a furniture shop where several of the victims died, Mustafa Abdul Hussein narrated what had happened, using video from his cellphone to back him up.He pointed to a street corner to his left, where a friend nicknamed Aboodi was killed while sitting in the blue minivan he used to deliver furniture.In his own shop, Mr. Hussein stood at the spot where victims had fallen, and showed their bloodied bodies on his phone. One, he said, had been learning to teach Arabic at a local college, and died clutching a textbook.Abdul Hussein Hassan, his father and the owner of the shop for nearly 40 years, was focused on the sidewalk. That was where he had spent many of his days sitting with his friend Abu Ahmed, who owned a kitchen store a couple of doors down and was gunned down Monday night.\u201cWe would sit down out there every day in the morning and drink tea, from morning to evening,\u201d Mr. Hassan said. \u201cFor 20 years.\u201dHe went on: \u201cThere was no military installation here, no government building. They just deliberately meant to kill as many innocent civilians as possible, and terrify the people.\u201dThe father of Ali Mushin, 13, said his son had asked him on Monday morning for money to buy school supplies. Ali was killed before he made it to the stationery store. \u201cWhen I went to the hospital to receive his body,\u201d his father said in an interview later, \u201cI found the money still in his pocket.\u201dThe night of the Baghdad attack, the new-old terror also struck Diyala Province, where nearly two dozen people were killed when an explosion ripped through a cafe in Muqdadiya, a hardscrabble farming community. Men had gathered to watch a soccer game on television, play dominoes or just chat and drink tea. A subsequent suicide bomber struck as security forces and ambulances arrived.\u201cISIS wants to open a new front in the liberated areas through causing tensions and to use its sleeper cells,\u201d said Karem Abdullah Sadeeq, 34, who suffered a shrapnel injury in the cafe. \u201cThe sectarian violence will create new fighters who will join ISIS and make the Sunnis think that it is better to live under ISIS than the militias.\u201dAmong the victims in Baghdad was Ali Mukdad, 20, whose brother said he was trying to build a body like Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s and hoped to find a job. Mr. Mukdad had fallen in love with a cousin, the brother recalled, but because \u201che was poor and because he had no money, she refused to marry him.\u201dOn Facebook, Iraqis have been sharing photos of loved ones lost, like a boy named Ali, who is shown holding a soccer trophy. \u201cHe is my schoolmate,\u201d a friend wrote. \u201cHe went with his family for shopping to prepare for his brother\u2019s wedding. They were all killed. I won\u2019t forget you, Ali.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Jan. 16 about fears that the massacre of 17 civilians on a commercial street in Baghdad presaged a return to the guerrilla violence that plagued the city years ago referred incorrectly to the Islamic State\u2019s connection to an attack earlier the same week, in Istanbul. Although the Turkish authorities say the Islamic State was behind the attack, the group itself did not claim responsibility for it.Reporting was contributed by Falih Hassan, Omar Al-Jawoshy and\u00a0Ahmed Salah\u00a0from Baghdad, and an employee of The New York Times from Diyala Province.Advertisement"}

What seems like a permanent revolution among Twitter\u2019s senior ranks hasn\u2019t done any favors for the $12 billion media business. With the stock trading below its initial public offering price and Mr. Dorsey a part-time chief executive who also runs the payments company Square, the danger is that the company becomes aimless.The departing leaders include the head of product, of which there have been at least five since 2010, including a stint by Mr. Dorsey. His reinsertion as chief executive last year was the most prominent turn of the revolving door. He had led the company when it was a start-up, but wasn\u2019t an obvious choice to return because running a troubled yet fast-growing public company would normally be a full-time job. As well as bringing Mr. Dorsey back, Twitter has replaced its finance boss, chief operating officer and head of engineering since the company filed to go public in the summer of 2013.Revenue at the microblogging company is growing fast, increasing more than 50 percent annually. Yet the company is in the red, losing $430 million in the first nine months of last year. Adding more users may solve this problem, which is why Twitter spends heavily to develop new products. But the constant churn at the top must make it hard for the company\u2019s engineers to plan what they are doing.Add Twitter\u2019s market meltdown \u2014 the company\u2019s stock now trades about a third below where it went public in 2013 \u2014 and Mr. Dorsey\u2019s creation looks vulnerable. Moreover, unlike at many tech businesses, there\u2019s no dominant or super-voting shareholder able to block takeover attempts. Google, Facebook or a more traditional media company could perhaps be tempted to buy Twitter.That might be a better outcome than a fate like Yahoo\u2019s. The company squandered its moment in the sun and ended up struggling with its core businesses and looking for new ideas under a series of chief executives, the latest being Marissa Mayer. Twitter has not reached that point yet, but the possibility should focus Mr. Dorsey\u2019s mind on the need for greater stability.Advertisement"}

Mr. Beck has long been a fierce defender of Mr. Cruz on the airwaves.Appearing at a mostly full college gymnasium here, Mr. Beck delivered a forceful case for Mr. Cruz as the only viable option for conservatives hoping to elect one of their own, by turns praising the Texas senator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard-right credentials and warning of the perils of an Iowa caucus victory for Mr. Trump.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf Donald Trump wins, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be a snowball to hell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Beck said.Frequently invoking faith and United States history, Mr. Beck contrasted Mr. Cruz with the man he is chasing in national polls and hoping to outlast in Iowa: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a guy who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bunch of strip clubs and casinos.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThroughout the gathering, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Beck alluded to the left-leaning positions of Mr. Trump for much of his life, from his history of support for abortion rights to political contributions to Democrats like Anthony Weiner and Rahm Emanuel.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn 2016, we cannot get burned again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz said, in the throes of a particularly animated stump speech nine days before the voting begins.He noted Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s support for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as TARP or more commonly the bank bailout, and for President Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stimulus plan, among other issues, suggesting Mr. Trump stood little chance of effecting conservative change in Washington.\u00e2\u0080\u009cNobody on earth ever grew a backbone after they got into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs there any chance on earth that individual would actually stand up to the cronyism and cartel in Washington?\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe also took aim at Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s signature issue, his hard line on immigration. Mr. Cruz suggested his own position was stronger because Mr. Trump has said that, after carrying out a mass deportation, he would grant legal status to some undocumented immigrants who sought to return.\u00e2\u0080\u009cListen, I like Donald Trump. He may say unpleasant things about me, I have no intention of responding in kind,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Cruz, whose campaign on Friday released an ad attacking Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use of eminent domain. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think you want or deserve to see politicians engaging in name-calling and insults.

Mr. Smith lamented to Mrs. Clinton that he could not afford to pay off his college loans and pursue his dream of owning a bowling alley, and the visit turned him into something of a local celebrity. He is now running for the Iowa House in his hometown district.\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt the end of it, she said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I would love to stop by your small business,\u2019 and I said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I would love that, too,\u2019\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Smith said introducing Mrs. Clinton on Wednesday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing motivates you more to clean a business than having a potential president stop by.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBowling alley visits have become something of a staple for presidential campaigns, and perhaps sensing the pitfalls of a gutter ball, Mrs. Clinton demurred from trying out the Adel lanes. During the 2008 Democratic contest, Senator Barack Obama bowled a 37 at the Pleasant Valley Lanes in Altoona, Penn. The area\u00e2\u0080\u0099s working-class voters were not impressed.

She continues to refer to and draw on the stories she heard in the first few months of her candidacy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI went for education in college so I could teach, but I fell in love with bowling,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Smith explained to Mrs. Clinton in their first discussion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my biggest thing, is the barrier of entry and financing.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMrs. Clinton lit up as she recalled the period in her campaign when she wanted to hear directly from voters in Iowa and New Hampshire. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe all know about the student loan debt, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never heard anyone so persuasively link it to the slowdown in business startups,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve given me an insight that nobody else has,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said to Mr. Smith, \u201cand I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m grateful to you.\u201d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

But by late Friday evening, the members of the High Negotiations Committee, a Saudi-backed umbrella group of opposition parties, felt compelled to fly to Geneva, less to talk about how to end the war than to make that case.Hind Kabawat, a member of the committee, said at a hastily organized news conference that the opposition bloc would send a few representatives \u2014 she would not say how many \u2014 to talk to Mr. de Mistura. They would only discuss lifting the government siege of towns, stopping the bombings and releasing political prisoners, and would not get involved in negotiating a political settlement with the government, she said.Diplomats expressed cautious hope over the fact that both sides were going to show up at all. Their best hope was that the parties would come to a deal on something that should not be the subject of deal-making in the first place: the delivery of food and medicines to people trapped behind front lines. That is an obligation under international law and also specified in a binding United Nations Security Council resolution adopted last December.Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement that the United States \u201cwelcomes the important decision\u201d of the committee to attend the talks and discuss the implementation of the resolution. \u201cThe United States further expects that both sides in these negotiations will participate in good faith and achieve early, measurable progress in the days ahead,\u201d the statement said.If the negotiations succeed in lifting some sieges, it would be hailed as a victory. That by itself is a measure of how low the standards have sunk in this war.In the plaza outside the gates of the United Nations complex, opposition supporters held aloft Syrian flags and banners venting their frustrations. \u201cUN Stop Talking and Start Acting,\u201d one banner read.The activists\u2019 masks showed beaming smiles. \u201cLaughing at the suffering of the Syrian people,\u201d is how Wael Mashati, a refugee from Idlib dressed as Mr. Lavrov, put it.The talks, which were to start Monday, have already been delayed. Mr. de Mistura was to be the only point of contact for each side in the so-called proximity talks. Several rooms have been set aside.Asked about whether he had extracted a promise from the government, and its backer, Russia, to lift the sieges, Mr. de Mistura told reporters: \u201cYou should give a chance for these talks to start in order to be able to discuss exactly that.\u201dAs if to underscore that the negotiations would yield nothing close to a political settlement, he cautioned that \u201cthese talks cannot just be about politics.\u201d\u201cWe need them to be about some evidence of improvement for their own people,\u201d he said.The last round of peace talks in January 2014 ended because the government delegation, led then as it is now by the country\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, Bashar al-Jaafari, did little but denounce the opposition delegation. The death toll in the war in Syria has doubled since then, reaching at least 250,000.Through those talks \u2014 and since then \u2014 the Syrian government has dropped barrel bombs on rebel-held towns, carried out chemical attacks and systematically starved civilians. Rebel groups have lobbed rockets into civilian neighborhoods and surrounded a handful of government-held towns. A legally binding Security Council resolution, which included a call to halt indiscriminate attacks on civilians and a lifting of sieges, has been flouted.The talks come as part of a Security Council resolution adopted last December laying out a road map for negotiations brokered by the United Nations. American and Russian officials lobbied heavily for the measure and many regarded it as a signal of unity among world powers to hammer out a political settlement to the war.That optimism, as inflated as it may have been, seems to have fallen by the wayside.Many of the world powers pressing on different sides of the conflict have shown halfhearted interest in negotiations. Russia said in a statement that it hoped the talks would yield \u201ca political settlement,\u201d even as it intensified airstrikes intended to fortify its ally, Mr. Assad, on the battlefield. Iran, which supplies a steady stream of fighters, openly denounced the members of the opposition team as terrorists.The opposition\u2019s most influential backers, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, have demonstrated little appetite for negotiations. The Obama administration has vigorously urged the opposition to attend, with officials saying that the alternative \u2014 more war \u2014 is even less palatable than a potential compromise with the Assad government.Mohannad, a doctor serving in Moadhamiyeh who uses only his first name for his safety, said that 150 explosions had shaken the town in the past two days, and that it was under a barrage of barrel bombs \u2014 unguided, makeshift cylinders of explosives dropped from helicopters.According to Dr. Mohannad and others, nine civilians have died, three of malnutrition and related causes this month.\u201cPeople are dying from barrels and from cold,\u201d Dr. Mohannad said. \u201cPeople in the street don\u2019t know where to go. Some fled to another part of Moadhamiyeh and others are sleeping in the streets.\u201dHwaida Saad and Nick Cumming-Bruce contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tunisia Sets Nationwide Curfew Amid Growing Unrest", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "Supported byTUNIS \u2014 The Tunisian government imposed a nationwide curfew on Friday after protests against unemployment spread across the country and grew more violent, in an echo of the Arab Spring uprising five years ago.The Interior Ministry announced the measure \u2014 a curfew from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. \u2014 on its Facebook page, warning of \u201cdanger to the security of the state and its citizens.\u201d A spokesman said violent jihadist groups could take advantage of the chaos created by the protests to cause more violence.Demonstrations have been growing all week, after an unemployed man died on Saturday in the western town of Kasserine. The man, Ridha Yahyaoui, 28, was electrocuted when he climbed a telephone pole in protest after seeing that his name was not included on a list of new public-sector jobs, his father told a local radio station.Mr. Bouazizi\u2019s death became a symbol of popular frustration that many say has not eased in the five years since. Unemployment stands at 30 percent among young people; the interior of the country remains underdeveloped and its population marginalized.Kasserine, a poor agricultural town that was one of the centers of protest in 2011, has led the latest wave of demonstrations. Protesters are demanding jobs and economic development, saying successive governments have failed to deliver them since the revolution.The daily protests turned violent as young people threw stones at the police, and security forces dispersed the crowds with tear gas and water cannons.On Wednesday, a police officer died and several others were injured in an accident when their vehicle rolled over in Kasserine.Protests spread across the country by Thursday night, as protesters blocked roads with burning tires, and they smashed and looted stores and government buildings. Tunisian news outlets reported that protesters had attacked the governor\u2019s office in the town of Jendouba in the northwest and that a customs building had been burned in the holy city of Kairouan.Police stations were attacked and seven security vehicles were burned on Thursday, said Walid Lougini, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry. He warned that threats on social media from Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the most prominent jihadist group in the region, proposed taking advantage of the unrest.In the sprawling working-class neighborhood of Ettadhamen in the capital, a bank and an electronics store were looted and a vehicle was set alight on Thursday night.Members of the National Guard in armored vehicles stood watch at either end of the main thoroughfare by midafternoon on Friday, flanked by half a dozen riot police vans.Crowds of young people milled in the streets as residents inspected the damage. Few voiced support for the looting, but they warned that people were cracking under economic hardship and unemployment.\u201cWhat happened here was mostly stealing,\u201d said Moez Hlel, 28, who works as a cook. He said he had seen looters carrying off a refrigerator the night before. \u201cBut in other places people are poor; they do not have enough to eat.\u201d\u201cPeople are fed up; they cannot take it anymore,\u201d he said, grasping his throat in a choking gesture.\u201cFrom the top to the bottom, the officials are corrupt,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Armed Group Vows to Continue Occupation at Oregon Refuge", "Date": "2016-01-03", "News": "Supported byBURNS, Ore. \u2014 The protesters arrived in this old lumber town to support a 73-year-old rancher and his son who had been sentenced to prison for setting fires that spread to federal lands. It was billed as a peaceful demonstration, but after \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d was sung and hugs were exchanged, a small, armed contingent declared outside a supermarket that it was taking a stand and asked who wanted to join.So began the latest armed flare-up in a decades-long struggle between federal officials and local landowners and ranchers over how to manage the Western range. The armed antigovernment group seized empty administrative buildings on a federal refuge for wildlife about 30 miles away through the snowy sagebrush, and by Sunday night, had hunkered down for what they vowed would be an indefinite standoff with the government.\u201cWe will be here for as long as it takes,\u201d said Ryan Payne, an Army veteran who characterized the group\u2019s action as a liberation of public lands. \u201cPeople have talked about returning land to the people for a long time. Finally, someone is making an effort in that direction.\u201dHe said there was already talk of renaming the refuge the Harney County Liberty Center.Relatives of the ranchers convicted of arson, Dwight L. Hammond and his son Steven D. Hammond, 46, distanced themselves from the armed takeover, but said they understood the underlying anger over federal land policies that many here feel are intrusive and overreaching.\u201cI don\u2019t know those people that well, except that I just see from the outside that we have a lot of things in common,\u201d said Dwight Hammond\u2019s wife, Susan. \u201cWe share a lot of sentiments in regards to our government, and the overreach into management of our country.\u201dThe Harney County sheriff, David M. Ward, said in a statement on Sunday, \u201cThese men came to Harney County claiming to be part of militia groups supporting local ranchers, when in reality these men had alternative motives to attempt to overthrow the county and federal government in hopes to spark a movement across the United States.\u201dDespite the stern language, there did not appear to be any imminent plan to confront the protesters. There was no sign of law enforcement outside the wildlife refuge on Sunday night, though the Oregon State Police urged people to stay away and federal authorities said they were monitoring the situation.At the entrance to the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, people associated with the occupying group blocked the road. As the temperature dropped below freezing Sunday night in the high desert outside the stone cottage that is the refuge\u2019s headquarters, the occupiers set a small fire to stay warm, but the snow-saturated sagebrush would not stay lit. Other local ranchers periodically drove up, looked and then drove away.Roger Wilson, 74, a retired outdoor outfitter, drove about 60 miles just to sit in his vehicle and watch what was happening. He said his own view of the situation was a bit conflicted.Mr. Wilson said he was an admirer and a friend of the Hammond family \u2014 \u201cI support them 100 percent,\u201d he said. But he added that he was wary about what might unfold with the arrival of the armed outsiders.\u201cI don\u2019t want to see them causing problems down here,\u201d he said.Members of the protest group allowed reporters to walk down to the cluster of buildings \u2014 which include the headquarters, a visitors center and a museum \u2014 but did not allow entry into any of them. A few people lingered outside in the cold among a cluster of brick and stone buildings, picnic tables and birdfeeders. A lookout tower near the headquarters was clearly manned by at least one person.LaVoy Finicum, 55, a cattle rancher from Mohave County, Ariz., said he had not planned on being part of the protest. He said he had originally come to support the Hammonds. Then he found himself involved.Here is what is known about the armed group occupying an Oregon wildlife refuge, and their beliefs and demands.\u201cI want to leave as soon as possible, but I will stay as long as necessary,\u201d he said when asked how long the protests might go on. He said none of the buildings had been damaged because doors had been open or keys could be found.The group was led by Ammon Bundy, a rancher whose family became a symbol of antigovernment sentiment in 2014 when his father, Cliven Bundy, inspired a standoff between armed local antigovernment activists and federal officials seeking to confiscate cattle grazing illegally on federal land in Nevada. But their actions drew a mixed response here in Harney County, an economically struggling rural area with 7,100 residents that has relied on sheep and cattle ranching and the timber industry. Residents expressed sympathy with the underlying complaints, but elected officials criticized the armed protesters as an outsider militia group whose actions had thrown their community into a harsh national glare.\u201cThe battle was brought to us,\u201d said Dan Nichols, a county commissioner who is a neighbor of the Hammond family. \u201cThis county isn\u2019t supportive of what\u2019s being done here at all. Once again, it\u2019s a bunch of those who live without the county telling us what we need to do, how we need to be doing it and the repercussions if we don\u2019t.\u201dIn this parched corner of eastern Oregon, some counties are nearly 90 percent public land and many ranchers depend on grazing leases from the federal government. Ranchers in the region have tried to buck federal management since at least the 1970s, when ranchers tried to claim federal land during the so-called Sagebrush Rebellion.The Hammonds bought their ranch in Oregon in 1964, and have spent years at odds with federal land officials in the area. Three years ago, Dwight and Steven were convicted of lighting fires, in 2001 and 2006, that they said were efforts to protect their property from wildfires and invasive plant species.The fire in 2001 accidentally spread to about 140 acres of government land, documents show. In 2006, a burn ban was in effect while firefighters battled blazes started by a lightning storm on a hot day in August. Steven Hammond had started a \u201cback burn\u201d to prevent the blaze from destroying the family\u2019s winter feed for its cattle.The Hammonds each served sentences for the arson charges, but they were ordered to report to a prison in California on Monday after a federal judge ruled that the sentences they had served were not long enough under federal law. Ms. Hammond said her husband and son would surrender themselves as ordered. The case caused a local uproar, but it also touched a nerve with far-right groups like the one headed by Mr. Bundy. The Bundys have been organizing opposition to the government case against the Hammonds on social media in recent weeks. They described the case as a tyrannical use of federal authority.Mr. Payne, the veteran who is also at the site, said the group was not violent. But he also said members had discussed the possibility that the standoff could turn violent.Referring to the federal government, he added, \u201cIf they think that\u2019s worth bringing their armies in here and harming or fouling that endeavor, we\u2019ll just have to read the Constitution and look at our Bibles and see who\u2019s on the right side.\u201dKirk Johnson reported from Burns, and Jack Healy from Denver.

Another was an editor who made documentaries in his free time and dreamed of winning an Oscar. A third employee, whose child died of an illness last year, often posted pictures of his surviving child on Facebook in hopes of a brighter future.The bombing was the first the Taliban has claimed against a media group. It highlighted the risks faced by media professionals in a country that has been one of the deadliest for journalists.Saad Mohseni, the chairman and chief executive of the Moby Group, insisted on Thursday that \u201cthe voices of those who we have lost will not be forgotten, and the voice of Afghanistan will not be silenced by this incident.\u201d\u201cThe Taliban think they can stop the wheel of the free press with such attacks,\u201d Mr. Tawhidi said. \u201cBut our journalists have repeatedly shown that they cannot be stopped.\u201dMost of those who were killed Wednesday were the sole breadwinners of their families, going about their daily lives.Mohammad Jawad Hussaini, 28, an editor, had left work earlier than usual to make sure he had a seat on the bus, which he had ridden home for seven years. He still had two videos to edit and upload on YouTube, but he had promised his boss he would finish the task the next morning.As the news of the explosion spread, on the far side of the city, Mr. Hussaini\u2019s mother became worried and phoned to check on him, which parents in Kabul find themselves doing almost daily as the Taliban step up their attacks. \u201cShe called him many times, but he didn\u2019t pick up,\u201d said Mr. Hussaini\u2019s brother Mohammad Wasikh Hussaini.An hour later, the phone rang: Someone had pulled the SIM card out of Mr. Hussaini\u2019s burned phone and dialed his mother\u2019s number. Your son is among the casualties, she was told \u2014 rush to the hospital. But which one? Was he wounded or dead? A frantic search took his family and friends from hospital to hospital and morgue to morgue, viewing bodies burned beyond recognition.\u201cOne of Jawad\u2019s teeth was chipped,\u201d said Ali Sayyed Hussaini, a friend who works as a reporter for another local channel and who joined the search. \u201cI scraped the burns from the teeth of the male bodies, and it wasn\u2019t Jawad. It gave us hope that he could still be alive.\u201dIt proved false. Jawad Hussaini lay dead at a hospital, and his body was transferred to a morgue in west Kabul. It was badly burned and still bleeding more than 15 hours after he was killed in the blast, and morgue workers who were trying to clean the remains kept having to change the shroud. Finally, they wrapped the body in plastic.\u201cHe was a very creative man,\u201d said Mohammed Jamil Sediq, another friend, who had known Mr. Hussaini from college when they both studied political science. Mr. Hussaini started working at Tolo when he was still a student, to pay his fees.\u201cHe made short films in his free time, outside work,\u201d Mr. Sediq said. \u201cI joked with him that once one of his films made it to the Oscars, he won\u2019t even take me as a secretary, let alone a friend.\u201dMr. Hussaini\u2019s brother expressed frustration with the government, but promised that revenge for his death would come from a surprising source.\u201cOur sister is a second lieutenant in the army; she is a lioness,\u201d he said. \u201cThey killed our brother in the trench of freedom, but she will avenge it.\u201dAnother of the victims of the bus attack was Mehri Azizi, who started at Tolo TV as a teenager and had risen to lead the graphics department, though she was just 22. Colleagues described her as always on the move. She was a beloved only daughter, and when she returned recently from a three-day business trip abroad, the whole family was at the airport to greet her.Mohammed Naim, a pharmacist and neighbor, said it was Ms. Azizi\u2019s uncle who got the call about the bus attack. When Mr. Naim and other neighbors rushed to the hospital, Ms. Azizi\u2019s parents were already there, he said; both had passed out after seeing their daughter\u2019s burned body.Five days before, Ms. Azizi had agreed to marry a well-educated cousin, but the formal engagement was postponed by a week, to Friday, because of a death in her extended family.\u201cEveryone was madly in love with her great attitude,\u201d said her cousin Azizullah. \u201cShe has left us burned, numb.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to a child of one of the Tolo TV employees killed the suicide bombing. After the death of one of his children, the employee often posted photographs of his surviving child on Facebook, not the child who died.Ahmad Shakib, Jawad Sukhanyar and David Jolly contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudi Aramco I.P.O. Is Weighed by Kingdom", "Date": "2016-01-07", "News": "Supported byIt is difficult to understate just how big Saudi Aramco is believed to be. Its stated oil reserves amount to 261 billion barrels, or more than 10 times those of Exxon Mobil. As the world\u2019s biggest exporter of petroleum, it supplies roughly a tenth of the world\u2019s oil.Consider that Exxon Mobil, the world\u2019s biggest publicly traded oil producer, is valued at just over $320 billion. It\u2019s not hard to believe that Saudi Aramco would be valued at huge multiples of its American counterpart.In the interview with The Economist, Prince Mohammad agreed with the implication that an I.P.O. would be tantamount to a \u201cThatcher revolution\u201d for Saudi Arabia, referring to the 1980s privatization of a number of Britain\u2019s government enterprises under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.Saudi Aramco could be different, of course. It has unparalleled cheap access to the ocean of petroleum that floats beneath Saudi Arabia\u2019s sands.The kingdom could have fetched an even higher valuation for its crown jewel before oil began plunging in price. (Brent crude closed on Thursday just above $33 a barrel.)The kingdom would virtually certainly refuse to cede any control over the company if it is listed on a public exchange, which The Economist said would most likely be the Tadawul in Riyadh. While some companies with concentrated ownership have taken a hit on valuation, the biggest such market debutantes, like Alibaba and Facebook, have escaped such a fate.Discussions about Saudi Aramco\u2019s fate appear to be at an early stage. The Economist reports that Prince Mohammad has held two \u201chigh-level meetings\u201d to discuss a potential stock sale. And discussions about how such a stock sale would look \u2014 whether it would be for some of the producer\u2019s constituent businesses or for its parent company \u2014 are still going on.At the least, the world\u2019s biggest banks are undoubtedly salivating at the chance to work on such a big I.P.O., as much to claim credit for a prestigious assignment as it would be for the fees.Surely all of them, and Wall Street\u2019s other top institutions, would compete hard to gain an I.P.O. mandate.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "3 Democrats May Debate Next Week in New Hampshire", "Date": "2016-01-26", "News": "The Democratic presidential candidates may gather one more time in New Hampshire for a televised debate days before voters head to the polls there.The debate, which has not been sanctioned by the Democratic National Committee, would be hosted by NBC News and The New Hampshire Union Leader, and it would be held Feb. 4 in New Hampshire. Joseph McQuaid, the publisher of The Union Leader, confirmed the plans.  The final sanctioned debate before the New Hampshire primary has already taken place. The D.N.C. could bar candidates from future debates if they took part in unsanctioned ones. It was not immediately clear whether Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont would take part in the debate. Martin O\u2019Malley, who has repeatedly called for more debates,  immediately accepted.But Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers have said they believe they erred in urging a limited number of debates when they were being scheduled last year. And Mr. Sanders said recently that if Mrs. Clinton and Mr. O\u2019Malley were willing to participate, he would support holding more debates.    In a statement Tuesday, Mr. O\u2019Malley\u2019s campaign director in New Hampshire, John Bivona, pointed out that the state has only had one debate. \u201cToday is a big victory not only for our campaign and our supporters that championed this effort, but it is also a victory for voters across New Hampshire and the United States,\u201d Mr. Bivona said. \u201cWe look forward to participating.\u201d   \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "\u2018City of Thorns,\u2019 by Ben Rawlence", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.In 2010, Ben Rawlence, then a researcher for Human Rights Watch, visited the refugee camp of Dadaab on the eastern Kenyan border, home to 300,000 people, many of whom had fled the chronic civil war in Somalia. The next year, he returned for what would be the first of seven long visits to follow the lives of nine of its inhabitants and to watch the camp grow until it became the largest refugee settlement in the world, more town than camp, with its own hospitals, cinemas and soccer teams, occupying an area the size of New Orleans. It would be good to be able to say that his story is encouraging or uplifting; but Rawlence\u2019s \u201cCity of Thorns\u201d is a deeply disturbing and depressing portrait of the violence, destitution, fear, sense of hopelessness and neglect in which a large number of the world\u2019s estimated 60 million forcibly displaced people now live.At the time of Rawlence\u2019s first visit to Dadaab, a combination of repeated droughts and al Shabaab offensives had already driven up to half of Somalia\u2019s six to eight million people to leave their homes. Those who stayed behind were too poor or wanted to guard what little they had left or, as Rawlence puts it, had become \u201cso inured to the roulette of war, it had simply become the landscape of life.\u201d Those determined to leave had struggled their way across the parched desert and through the scrubby bush, dragging their exhausted, famished children behind them, scaring them into keeping going with stories of lions. They were preyed upon by marauding soldiers and insurgents, raped, their possessions looted, until they found a corner of this vast camp in which they could build a mud hut and receive just enough food rations to stay alive. Around them lay a vast denuded plain, a treeless dust bowl, with acacia thorns planted in the sand to demarcate boundaries. Soon they discovered that they had exchanged one hell for another.In theory, the camp services \u2014 provided by United Nations and nongovernmental agencies \u2014 were free. In practice, Dadaab had too little of everything \u2014 food, water, schools, medical supplies. Corrupt policemen and criminals ensured an atmosphere of constant fear and watchfulness. The dry season brought dust and sand and grit that got into everything; the rains bore insects, disease and overflowing sewage, and turned the roads into slurry and bogs.Among those who came were a young man called Guled, who had been kidnapped and escaped from al Shabaab; Nisho, born as his parents were fleeing Somalia in 1991; and clever, strong-willed Muna, to whom schooling gave the confidence to defy the strictures of her clan. It is through their individual stories, their efforts to claw out just tolerable lives, find work, have children, remain healthy, that Rawlence has built his remarkable book.In 2012, things took a turn for the worse. Two Spanish women volunteering with Doctors Without Borders were kidnapped near the camp. Within hours, the aid agencies suspended their activities and evacuated most of their staff. Then Kenya decided to declare war on al Shabaab, one more installment in the long series of hostilities between Kenyan forces and Somali insurgents. The U.N. budget dropped substantially, and funds had to be found for the Syrian crisis. The Kenyan government brought pressure on the refugees to go home, particularly after the terrorist attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi. Dadaab collapsed into a world of terror, bomb explosions, the targeting of the police and their subsequent retribution, gang rapes for which no one was held accountable. The lawlessness and menace became such that some of the young men Rawlence writes about, who had volunteered to try to keep the peace, were now forced to flee and hide in Nairobi\u2019s sprawling slums, where they were soon regarded as fifth columnists.The inhabitants of Dadaab had coined a word: buufis. It meant an ache, a depression, a persistent longing to be elsewhere, to be resettled in some other part of the world, so strong that it pushed the present into the shadows. Buufis was made worse by the Internet and Facebook, which enabled the refugees to follow the fortunes of those who had got away and thrived; and sometimes it was so bad that they invented parallel lives of their own and gave their addresses as Cleveland or Minneapolis. In the past, countries like Canada, Australia and the United States were generous with their offers to take in people unable to return to their own countries; those days have gone. There is little cure for buufis now. Those stuck in Dadaab are truly stuck.Rawlence\u2019s book does not resolve into a particular ending: It simply stops. Some families have opted to risk going home; others have stayed. Like Dadaab itself, the story has no conclusion. It is a portrait, beautifully and movingly painted. And it is more than that. At a time when newspapers are filled with daily images of refugees arriving in boats on Europe\u2019s shores, when politicians and governments grapple with solutions to migration and erect ever larger walls and fences, it is an important reminder that a vast majority of the world\u2019s refugees never get as far as a boat or a border of the developed world. They remain, like the inhabitants of \u00adDadaab, in an indefinite limbo of penury and fear, unwanted and largely forgotten.CITY OF THORNSNine Lives in the World\u2019s Largest Refugee CampBy Ben RawlenceIllustrated. 384 pp. Picador. $26.Caroline Moorehead\u2019s \u201cVillage of Secrets,\u201d the second book in her trilogy on resistance during World War II, was published in paperback in October.Advertisement"}

Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey was uncharacteristically charitable, calling Mr. Bloomberg \u00e2\u0080\u009ca good mayor\u00e2\u0080\u009d of New York City.After learning that Mr. Bloomberg had ordered his advisers to draw up a possible plan to seek the presidency, the candidates uniformly sought to project a lack of anxiety, despite the former mayor\u2019s immense wealth and willingness to spend $1 billion on a third-party candidacy that would bypass their party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primaries.Mrs. Clinton, who remains close with Mr. Bloomberg, was the most pointed. She seized on comments from Mr. Bloomberg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team that the former mayor would be less likely to run if she won the Democratic nomination.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe way I read what he said is, if I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get the nomination we might consider it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said on NBC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cMeet the Press.\u00e2\u0080\u009dShe added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to relieve him of that and get the nomination so he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to\u00e2\u0080\u009d run.Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose campaign bemoans the influence of the super rich, quickly incorporated Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s flirtation into his message.\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy reaction is, if Donald Trump wins and Mr. Bloomberg gets in, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to have two multibillionaires running for president of the United States against me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cAnd I think the American people do not want to see our nation move toward an oligarchy, where billionaires control the political process.\u201dMr. Trump gamely encouraged Mr. Bloomberg to enter the race. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d love to compete against Michael,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told CBS\u2019s \u00e2\u0080\u009cFace the Nation.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut he mischievously suggested that Mr. Bloomberg was chronically indecisive. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wanted to do this for a long time. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never pulled the trigger,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Trump, who himself had flirted with earlier presidential bids only to decide against running \u2013 until this time.Mr. Bloomberg entered politics as a Republican but changed his party affiliation to Independent and has embraced traditionally liberal social causes, like same-sex marriage and gun control.Republicans zeroed in on those issues Sunday.Jeb Bush, the former Republican governor of Florida, who has served on the board of Mr. Bloomberg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s charitable foundation, called Mr. Bloomberg \u00e2\u0080\u009ca good man\u00e2\u0080\u009d and a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpatriot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But he was quick to point out their differences.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe disagree on a whole lot of things,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Bush said.Mr. Rubio took a similar route. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t agree with his stance on the Second Amendment and some other issues,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said on \u00e2\u0080\u009cFox News Sunday.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Rubio sensed political opportunity in a presidential field that already includes one billionaire, Mr. Trump, and could soon absorb another in Mr. Bloomberg.He proudly reminded television viewers that the son of a bartender and a maid could seek the same office as the \u00e2\u0080\u009cson of a millionaire,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a reference to Mr. Trump.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn no other country in the world would that be possible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Rubio said.Mr. Christie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s praise was not exactly full-throated. He could not judge Mr. Bloomberg, he told CNN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cState of the Union,\u00e2\u0080\u009d until the former mayor had made up his mind about running for president.The host followed up.

He and a cousin, both food runners at a Times Square restaurant, planned to climb to the roof just before the stroke of midnight, the cousin said, and watch the storied ball drop.But early on Thursday, Mr. Galindo, 24, was killed, attacked by six men on the street in the Norwood neighborhood of the Bronx. They set upon him with punches, and ultimately stabbed him and left him unconscious, bleeding on Decatur Avenue, just blocks from his home, the police said.\u201cWe were planning to sneak upstairs and watch the ball together, and then go back to work downstairs,\u201d said his cousin, Omar Franco, also 24, sitting in the kitchen at Mr. Galindo\u2019s mother\u2019s home as a stream of family members arrived at the house, many red-eyed and trembling. \u201cHe was like, \u2018Yeah! We are going to have fun, and dress up,\u2019\u00a0\u201d the cousin said. \u201cWe were just talking about it at lunch on Monday.\u201dA surveillance video from a nearby building shows that the six men surrounded Mr. Galindo around 2:45 a.m., according to the police. As one pummeled him, another, a heavyset man, began attacking him with his hands in a \u201cthrusting\u201d motion, the police said. Mr. Galindo was found unconscious and without identification, according to the police, who said they believed he was robbed. He was pronounced dead at Montefiore Medical Center.Nicknamed Juice, a play on the Spanish meaning of his first name, Mr. Galindo was a father figure to his many cousins, who considered themselves more like siblings, said one of them, Iliana Franco, 26. There were so many cousins that they formed a family soccer team; at their scrimmages, Mr. Galindo was the star, she said. Off the field, the young man was a fulcrum of his family, stepping into a fatherly role to help his single mother, an immigrant from Mexico. He would often give his mother his restaurant earnings, Ms. Franco said, insisting that she use the money to treat herself to a night out on the town.\u201cIf he felt like there was tension in a certain situation, he would be the one who would mend it,\u201d Ms. Franco said. When he was 15, he gave her the entire contents of his piggy bank for her birthday: $27. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget it,\u201d she said. His cousins admired him for the role he took on, she said, and joked about coveting his long eyelashes.He was especially protective of his sister, Arelis Galindo. \u201cWe were best friends,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was more than a brother to me.\u201d Overcome with emotion, she laid her head down on the kitchen counter and sobbed. In the next room in her mother\u2019s apartment, a dozen people had gathered, praying in Spanish, some on their knees. \u201cWe told each other everything, everything,\u201d she said. He had a weakness for children. His Facebook page is dotted with selfies featuring him and his cousins\u2019 babies. When his niece Delilah was born eight months ago, she became his world.\u201cShe has his eyelashes,\u201d the baby\u2019s mother said.At Maple Restaurant and Lounge in Midtown, where he worked for nearly a year, he would challenge the staff to feats of strength in an effort to encourage others to exercise, slipping in friendly push-up competitions between serving diners. He met his girlfriend there, a colleague, his sister said. Recently he had confided to her his resolution to take his girlfriend hiking in the new year, she said, something he had never done.\u201cThe staff are coming into work, but they are too sad for it,\u201d said Rony Delgado, a server at the restaurant. \u201cThe crew is so down.\u201dOn Decatur Avenue, residents set up a small shrine where Mr. Galindo was attacked. At midday Thursday, several stood around the flickering candles, discussing the violent act. At night, said Wanda Urbina, a resident, she frequently calls the police when she hears fights though her first-floor window. The mourners tried to understand what had happened to a young man known for his smile and composure.\u201cWe are going to fight to the end to get those six men that hurt him,\u201d said Ms. Urbina. \u201cThe boy just worked every day to pay his bills,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they took his life away?

And with polls suggesting Mrs. Clinton is struggling again, this time against Bernie Sanders, Mr. Clinton has returned to the place he likes best: the campaign trail.Here in Nevada, whose Feb. 20 Democratic caucuses follow the contests in New Hampshire and Iowa, and where Mr. Clinton has long been popular, the former president offered a spirited defense of his wife Thursday night \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but also some not-too-subtle shots at the Vermont senator who is giving his wife unexpected trouble in a contest she once thought would be easy.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis other guy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s madder than she is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton said, his voice hoarse, as some in the crowd at a school gymnasium struggled to hear him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd that feels authentic.

But in an interview Wednesday, Mr. Dole said that the party would suffer \u201ccataclysmic\u201d and \u201cwholesale losses\u201d if Mr. Cruz were the nominee, and that Donald J. Trump would fare better. \u201cI question his allegiance to the party,\u201d Mr. Dole said of Mr. Cruz. \u201cI don\u2019t know how often you\u2019ve heard him say the word \u2018Republican\u2019 \u2014 not very often.\u201d Instead, Mr. Cruz uses the word \u201cconservative,\u201d Mr. Dole said, before offering up a different word for Mr. Cruz: \u201cextremist.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know how he\u2019s going to deal with Congress,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody likes him.\u201d But Mr. Dole, 92, said he thought Mr. Trump could \u201cprobably work with Congress, because he\u2019s, you know, he\u2019s got the right personality and he\u2019s kind of a deal-maker.\u201dThe remarks by Mr. Dole reflect wider unease with Mr. Cruz among members of the Republican establishment, but few leading members of the party have been as candid and cutting. \u201cIf he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the nominee, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to have wholesale losses in Congress and state offices and governors and legislatures,\u201d said Mr. Dole, who served in the House and Senate for 35 years and won the Iowa caucuses twice. He described Mr. Cruz as having falsely \u201cconvinced the Iowa voters that he\u2019s kind of a mainstream conservative.\u201d The only person who could stop Mr. Cruz from capturing the nomination? \u201cI think it\u2019s Trump,\u201d Mr. Dole said, adding that Mr. Trump was \u201cgaining a little.\u201d  He said he had met Mr. Trump only once, 30 years ago. \u201cBut he has toned down his rhetoric,\u201d he added. As for Mr. Cruz, he said: \u201cThere\u2019ll be wholesale losses if he\u2019s the nominee. Our party is not that far right.\u201d Mr. Dole repeatedly said he was strongly supporting Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, although he acknowledged that Mr. Bush has had trouble gaining traction. \u201cHe needs to break out, and he hasn\u2019t done it yet,\u201d said Mr. Dole. But he was openly concerned that Mr. Cruz would win the presidential nomination but then lose the Senate for the Republicans in the process. The animosity between the two men began after Mr. Cruz invoked Mr. Dole\u2019s name as an example of the missteps the party had made with past presidential nominees \u2014 as in, \u201cRemember President Dole? Remember President McCain? Remember President Romney?\u201d \u201cIn other words, we weren\u2019t right wing like he is, and I didn\u2019t like that very much,\u201d Mr. Dole said in the interview. \u201cIt kind of hurt, because we worked hard, we did the best we could. We are conservatives, we are traditional Republican conservatives. And then, of course, he doesn\u2019t have any friends in Congress. He called the leader of the Republicans a liar on the Senate floor.\u201d \u201cIf you want to call somebody a liar in the Senate, you go to their office \u2014 you don\u2019t go on the Senate floor and make it public,\u201d Mr. Dole said. He described Mr. Bush as well qualified to be president, but he also described Senator Marco Rubio and Gov. Chris Christie warmly. Mr. Bush, he said, \u201cdoesn\u2019t scream and yell in the debates, so I guess that\u2019s a minus, but he\u2019s a decent, honest guy who\u2019s had experience, and he\u2019s dealt with a legislature.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of friends in this town, and in the Congress,\u201d Mr. Dole said.Mr. Dole added that he thought it would be harder for Hillary Clinton to defeat Mr. Trump in a general election than Mr. Cruz. \u201cI think she\u2019d be a pretty easy target in the general, if we nominate the right person,\u201d Mr. Dole said. Was Mr. Cruz in that category, just in case there was any doubt? \u201cNo, he\u2019s not that person,\u201d said Mr. Dole. \u201cIf he does it, I think she\u2019ll win in a waltz.\u201d In a statement, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cruz, Catherine Frazier, called Mr. Dole\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments part of the \u00e2\u0080\u009csame flawed narrative the Washington establishment has unsuccessfully pushed for years.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cRunning to the middle and nominating a moderate who will continue to bank the payroll of the Washington cartel is a losing strategy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Frazier said, without mentioning Mr. Dole.Mr. Dole is one of the most prominent members of the Republican \u201cestablishment,\u201d a term he described as meaningless. \u201cCruz is in the Senate, so maybe he\u2019s part of the establishment. You know, I\u2019ve never really known what the establishment was.\u201d He sounded a sorrowful note about how difficult a time people like Mr. Bush have had in an election cycle dominated by voter anger. \u201cExperience is important,\u201d Mr. Dole said. \u201cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the one thing that the voters don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to care about this cycle, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know \u00e2\u0080\u0093 there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no substitute for experience.\u201d  \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Matt Damon: You Could Call Him Down to Earth", "Date": "2015-12-29", "News": "Supported byBEVERLY HILLS, CALIF. \u2014 In the 1997 film \u201cGood Will Hunting,\u201d Matt Damon faces an existential crisis: Stay in Southie and work construction with his pals \u2014 \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with layin\u2019 brick?\u201d he asks \u2014 or use his prodigious mathematical powers for, well, who knows what. His best friend, Ben Affleck, promises to kill him if he squanders his \u201cwinnin\u2019 lottery ticket\u201d and picks the bricks.Flash forward to 2015, to director Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cThe Martian,\u201d and Mr. Damon, as NASA astronaut Mark Watney, is stranded in another hostile area, his nearest chance for help millions of miles away. In \u201cThe Martian,\u201d Watney doesn\u2019t have the luxury of wasting his mental gifts. He sets about creating water from spare rocket fuel and heat from a degrading plutonium core. The stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. If he messes up, it won\u2019t be Mr. Affleck who kills him, but Mars.Both films afford viewers a singular pleasure: watching Mr. Damon use that big brain of his to get out of jams. Superspy Jason Bourne. Con artist Tom Ripley. His varied roles in \u201cThe Rainmaker,\u201d \u201cThe Departed,\u201d \u201cSyriana,\u201d \u201cThe Adjustment Bureau.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s fun to watch people smarter than us solving problems,\u201d he said.Directors insist it\u2019s no act. \u201cThe man is smart as a whip,\u201d Mr. Scott said. Paul Greengrass (\u201cThe Bourne Ultimatum\u201d) described Mr. Damon, a Harvard-educated actor, as \u201cferociously intelligent.\u201dNot that he takes his image too seriously. \u201cI\u2019m not that smart in \u2018Team America,\u2019\u201d he admitted.All that brainpower, however, didn\u2019t keep Mr. Damon from becoming embroiled in two much-publicized controversies in 2015. During a recent interview here at the Four Seasons, he discussed the ups and downs of the last year as well as the night in 1998 when he won his best screenplay Oscar for \u201cGood Will Hunting.\u201dIn person, Mr. Damon is all wide smiles and hearty handshakes. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Matt,\u201d he\u2019ll say, even though clearly one knows. Dressed in black jeans, boots and a white thermal shirt buttoned all the way up, he looks fit (he\u2019s been spending the past few months filming the next Bourne thriller in London, Berlin and Tenerife, one of Spain\u2019s Canary Islands) and happy (he\u2019s finally back home in Los Angeles, with his wife and four kids).\u201cIt was such a confusing time,\u201d he said of that first Oscar go-round. \u201cBen and I became famous, so there\u2019s this feeling of befuddlement and confusion that accompanies all the memories that I have. The second something would happen, somebody would put a microphone in my face and say, \u2018How do ya feel?\u2019 Well, I didn\u2019t have any idea.\u201dHis fellow winner was similarly rattled. \u201cI\u2019m really glad I had him to go through it with, or I probably would have come completely unglued,\u201d Mr. Affleck said in an email interview.Mr. Damon found himself sitting alone at 3 in the morning, staring at the award and unable to sleep. \u201cI remember getting this overwhelming feeling of, thank God I didn\u2019t\u201d \u2014 here he used an expletive, the equivalent of mess up \u2014 \u201canybody over for this,\u201d he said, laughing.\u201cHe was always terrifically good,\u201d Mr. Greengrass said by phone from London, \u201cbut he\u2019s the father of children now, he\u2019s lived life more, and you can see it in him and in his acting. There\u2019s a broader humanity to what he does now.\u201dMr. Damon is quick to dismiss any Oscar talk about himself \u2014 \u201cI just don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way to handicap it,\u201d he said \u2014 but said he would love to see Mr. Scott take home a statue in February. It wasn\u2019t until recently that he discovered, to his great surprise, that the 78-year-old director of \u201cBlade Runner,\u201d \u201cGladiator\u201d and \u201cThelma & Louise\u201d had never received an Academy Award. (He\u2019s been nominated three times.)\u201cIt\u2019s kind of how I felt when I worked with Marty, and everybody was saying, look, this has gotta be the time for him,\u201d Mr. Damon said, referring to \u201cThe Departed\u201d and its director, Martin Scorsese. \u201cHopefully there\u2019ll be a similar groundswell of support for Ridley.\u201dIf Mr. Damon is reticent about his own Oscar chances, he was less so about the controversy over HBO\u2019s filmmaking competition \u201cProject Greenlight,\u201d for which he and Mr. Affleck serve as executive producers. After being off the air for 10 years, the show returned in September with a Season 4 premiere episode in which Mr. Damon lectured Effie Brown, an African-American producer (\u201cDear White People\u201d), about diversity, behind and in front of the camera.As they were trying to decide which director to hire \u2014 Ms. Brown\u2019s choice was a white woman and a Vietnamese-American man who had teamed up \u2014 Mr. Damon told her, \u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about diversity, you do it in the casting of the film, not in the casting of the show.\u201d\u201cWow,\u201d Ms. Brown replied.His comments drew a tsunami of criticism from critics and bloggers, who accused him of talking down to her, simultaneously whitesplaining and mansplaining.\u201cUm, there are a few parts to it,\u201d Mr. Damon said. \u201cSo I\u2019ll unpack it for you.\u201dWhat viewers didn\u2019t see, he said, were the weeks \u2014 if not years \u2014 of frustration that led up to that exchange. \u201cBen and I had taken a lot of stick for this 10 years ago, that our committee of mostly white men had selected three white men, in succession, as winners,\u201d he said. This time, the producers actively pursued a more diverse cross-section of applicants, partnering with Facebook and actively recruiting at film schools. Even so, when Mr. Damon and the other judges, which included Mr. Affleck and Ms. Brown, were given the final cut of candidates, 17 of the 20 were, yes, white men.\u201cBy the time we arrived to do our judging, we knew we had blown it, so Ben and I were already frustrated and upset about that,\u201d he said. \u201cSo when Effie brought it up, it was like, yes, O.K., we got it.\u201dThe other concern, Mr. Damon said, was the reality series itself. \u201cThe dark secret of \u2018Project Greenlight\u2019 is that the TV show is bigger than the movie,\u201d Mr. Damon said. \u201cIt costs more than the movie.\u201dThat simple fact leads to a constant struggle between the needs of the film and the needs of the show \u2014 with the show often winning out. Muddying the waters even more is that the \u201cbehind the camera\u201d winner chosen to direct the film becomes, of course, the de facto star of the TV series.\u201cThe idea that I would say that there didn\u2019t need to be diversity behind the camera, it\u2019s not only complete anathema to what I believe in my heart and always have,\u201d Mr. Damon said, \u201cbut it\u2019s not something that I think anybody would ever say with a camera on.\u201dHe added: \u201cAnd so when Effie was advocating for the woman and the Vietnamese-American guy, what I actually said was, \u2018Are we judging a contest or are we casting a reality show?\u2019\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd that\u2019s when she said, \u2018Wow.\u2019 And I went, no, Effie, I\u2019m completely serious, what is our responsibility at this point? Because we had already blown it on the competition.\u201d\u201cWe were fine that day,\u201d Mr. Damon insisted. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like I left and said, \u2018Boy, I got in an argument with Effie Brown,\u2019 and I don\u2019t think she would have left thinking that she had had an argument with me. But the truth is, Effie did an awesome job for us. She\u2019s an awesome producer.\u201dMs. Brown declined to comment.Soon after, Mr. Damon was taking heat once again, this time, for an interview in The Guardian that seemed to suggest that actors should stay in the closet. At one moment, he\u2019s talking about the brilliance of Rupert Everett and the price the actor paid for coming out in Hollywood; the next, he\u2019s discussing why actors should try to keep some \u201cmystery\u201d in their private lives. \u201cI actually just conflated two stories that I\u2019ve told a thousand times at junkets, and did it in a really clumsy way,\u201d he said.Despite Mr. Damon\u2019s bad luck with poor edits, a spur-of-the-moment good one led to a particularly memorable scene in \u201cThe Martian.\u201d\u201cAll the other actors, Jessica Chastain and Michael Pe\u00f1a, had already wrapped and were at home in America,\u201d he said. It was just Mr. Damon and Mr. Scott in Budapest, filming a scene in which the stranded astronaut, after two years alone on Mars, finally learns he might be going home. Without telling Mr. Damon his plans, Mr. Scott combined parts of his fellow actors\u2019 dialogue with old NASA recordings from the glory days of the space program and piped them into Mr. Damon\u2019s helmet. The actor broke down, and Mr. Scott used that very first take. \u201cIt was completely unrehearsed, unexpected and unplanned,\u201d Mr. Damon said. \u201cI just went.\u201dMr. Affleck explained: \u201cMatt is totally willing to look foolish, scared, weak, or to take on any of the very human qualities that we all have but that our vanity makes us want to hide from others. You can see his willingness to do this in almost all of his performances, and \u2018The Martian\u2019 is no exception.\u201dThis month, around the time the Oscar nominations are announced, Mr. Damon will return to Las Vegas to continue shooting the next installment of the Bourne series. After sitting out the most recent Bourne film, he and Mr. Greengrass were discussing whether to take on a new one. \u201cHe persuaded me,\u201d Mr. Greengrass said, laughing.\u201cI was a little bit anxious about how it was going to go, and I remember he said to me, \u2018It\u2019s not a bad thing to do it just because people would really love to see us do another one,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat really landed with me. \u2018It\u2019s a noble thing to serve your audience,\u2019 he told me, \u2018if you\u2019re lucky enough to have one.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Germany on the Brink", "Date": "2016-01-09", "News": "Supported byThe underlying controversy here is not a new one. For decades conservatives on both sides of the Atlantic have warned that Europe\u2019s generous immigration policies, often pursued in defiance of ordinary Europeans\u2019 wishes, threaten to destabilize the continent.The conservatives have made important points about the difficulty of assimilation, the threat of radicalization, and the likelihood of Paris-style and Cologne-style violence in European cities.With the current migration, though, we\u2019re in uncharted territory. The issue isn\u2019t just that immigrants are arriving in the hundreds of thousands rather than the tens of thousands. It\u2019s that a huge proportion of them are teenage and twentysomething men.As Hudson notes, these trends have immediate implications for civil order \u2014 young men are, well, young men; societies with skewed sex ratios tend to be unstable; and many of these men carry assumptions about women\u2019s roles that are diametrically opposed to the values of contemporary Europe.But if you add a million (or millions) of people, most of them young men, in one short period, you get a very different kind of shift.How transformative depends on whether these men eventually find a way to bring brides and families to Europe as well. In terms of immediate civil peace, family formation or unification offers promise, since men with wives and children are less likely to grope revelers or graffiti synagogues or seek the solidarity of radicalism.But it could also double or treble this migration\u2019s demographic impact, pushing Germany toward a possible future in which half the under-40 population would consist of Middle Eastern and North African immigrants and their children.If you believe that an aging, secularized, heretofore-mostly-homogeneous society is likely to peacefully absorb a migration of that size and scale of cultural difference, then you have a bright future as a spokesman for the current German government.You\u2019re also a fool. Such a transformation promises increasing polarization among natives and new arrivals alike. It threatens not just a spike in terrorism but a rebirth of 1930s-style political violence. The still-imaginary France Michel Houellebecq conjured up in his novel \u201cSubmission,\u201d in which nativists and Islamists brawl in the streets, would have a very good chance of being realized in the German future.This need not happen. But prudence requires doing everything possible to prevent it. That means closing Germany\u2019s borders to new arrivals for the time being. It means beginning an orderly deportation process for able-bodied young men. It means giving up the fond illusion that Germany\u2019s past sins can be absolved with a reckless humanitarianism in the present.It means that Angela Merkel must go \u2014 so that her country, and the continent it bestrides, can avoid paying too high a price for her high-minded folly.Advertisement"}

Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Mr. Cruz came armed with a plan to get in Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head after the billionaire businessman spent nearly two weeks discussing whether Mr. Cruz, who was born in Canada but whose mother was a United States citizen, was eligible to be president. Mr. Cruz suggested that by an extension of that logic, it could also be an issue for Mr. Trump, whose mother was born in Scotland. Mr. Trump quickly pointed out that he himself was born in the United States \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but he was plainly on the defensive.But Mr. Trump recovered as the debate went on. He said he welcomed carrying the \u00e2\u0080\u009cmantle of anger\u00e2\u0080\u009d for voters who are mistrustful of their government. His best moment of the debate, and one of the best over all, was when in response to Mr. Cruz branding him with \u00e2\u0080\u009cNew York values\u00e2\u0080\u009d spoke of the city\u2019s spirit after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The  \u00e2\u0080\u009csmell of death\u00e2\u0080\u009d hung over the World Trade Center site, Mr. Trump said, in a rare moment of eloquence. Mr. Cruz stood silently, and even applauded, as Mr. Trump spoke.The fight cemented their status as leading candidates for the nomination. Mr. Cruz also filibustered through a question from the moderators about his $1 million in loans from Goldman Sachs and Citibank, painting himself as under attack by the mainstream news media.Jeb Bush had one of his stronger debate performances, but it took him a while to warm up. He tried hard to fight Mr. Trump for the soul of the Republican Party over his proposal to bar Muslims from entering the country. But Senator Marco Rubio of Florida overtook that battle when he fought with Mr. Cruz about immigration overhaul, in an exchange in which both men scored points. Mr. Rubio, armed with a thick opposition research file on Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s votes and statements, unloaded them one by one.Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey also had a strong night, particularly at the beginning, when he swung aggressively at Mr. Rubio. But Mr. Christie repeatedly misstated his record, particularly on gun control, and those claims could come back to haunt him. The presence of Ben Carson and Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio was barely felt, to the point that Mr. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, joked that he had to be woken up when the questions moved his way.  \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

A few bouquets were left outside on Monday morning, along with a single candle burning and a note with two words: \u201cThank you.\u201dIn New York City, bouquets of flowers, flickering candles and a piece of paper with the message \u201cStarman Forever,\u201d were left outside Mr. Bowie\u2019s SoHo home.Patrice Mack, a real estate broker from the East Village who brought a bouquet, said that listening to Mr. Bowie\u2019s music as a teenager gave her the \u201cfeeling you could do anything, and it was OK.\u201d She chose roses in colors to symbolize the various parts of Mr. Bowie\u2019s career: pink for Ziggy Stardust; white for the Thin White Duke.\u201cHe influenced what books to read, what music to listen to, what movies to see probably more than any education my folks paid for,\u201d she said.Around the world, fans listened to Bowie songs, sent messages to friends reminiscing about Bowie concerts from decades ago, grappled with his loss and thought about what his music, and his life, had meant to them. Some spoke of how he opened them to the idea of the avant-garde, and others of how his openness about his bisexuality and androgynous characters, dating back to the days of Glam Rock and even earlier, had made it acceptable to come out as gay, or bisexual, or different.Spotify said that streams of Mr. Bowie\u2019s music grew 2,700 percent from Sunday to Monday. And at iTunes, Mr. Bowie\u2019s albums had taken over much of the Top 10 of the store\u2019s chart rankings, with \u201cBlackstar\u201d at No. 1 on Monday afternoon; \u201cBest of Bowie,\u201d No. 2; and \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars,\u201d his hit from 1972, at No. 4.Stars like Madonna and Lady Gaga posted testimonials to him.Yoko Ono recalled Mr. Bowie\u2019s friendship with her husband, John Lennon, who collaborated with Mr. Bowie on the song \u201cFame,\u201d and how it grew to friendship with her family.Many fans took the loss personally. John Boyle, a writer from Merrick, on Long Island, placed a tall white candle outside Mr. Bowie\u2019s SoHo home and kneeled. After a few moments, he crossed himself, rose, and shouted \u201cLazarus arise!\u201d a reference to a song on Mr. Bowie\u2019s \u201cBlackstar.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s something within his canon for each and every one of us,\u201d said Mr. Boyle, 60. \u201cHe covered every aspect of the human heart, and I really will miss him.\u201dElizabeth Paton, Matthew Schneier, Dan Bilefsky, Madeleine Kruhly, Colin Moynihan, Andrew Chow, Joe Coscarelli and Ben Sisario contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "David Brock, Ally of Hillary Clinton, Skewers New Bernie Sanders Ad", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "The race between Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Hillary Clinton ramped up Thursday with a top Clinton ally criticizing a new Sanders ad as focused too much on white Americans.Mr. Sanders released a 60-second commercial in Iowa on Thursday that features the Simon and Garfunkel song \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerica\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that seeks to remind his supporters how far he has come since declaring his candidacy. The ad is intended to motivate people to caucus for him on Feb. 1. No words are spoken, apart from the song\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lyrics, and Mr. Sanders is seen greeting voters on the campaign trail, first in small groups, then in gymnasiums and finally at huge rallies.David Brock, a longtime Clinton supporter who founded the \u201csuper PAC\u201d backing her, told The Associated Press on Thursday that the advertising presented a \u201cbizarre\u201d image of America focused on white voters. Mr. Brock also said the ad was a \u201csignificant slight to the Democratic base,\u201d according to the news agency.\u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom this ad it seems black lives don\u2019t matter much to Bernie Sanders,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Brock told The Associated Press.Mrs. Clinton has historically had close ties with black voters, and several polls show her with significant leads on Mr. Sanders among the black electorate.Mr. Brock has emerged in this campaign as one of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s most acerbic allies, challenging both her critics and unflattering news stories about her, and increasingly turning his fire on Mr. Sanders. On Thursday, Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders, dismissed Mr. Brock, who during Bill Clinton\u2019s administration was a writer for conservative publications, as \u201ca mud-slinging, right-wing extremist.\u201d And during Clarence Thomas\u2019s confirmation hearing to the Supreme Court, Mr. Briggs added, Mr. Brock \u201ctried to destroy\u201d Anita Hill, a black law professor who had accused Mr. Thomas of sexual harassment. Mr. Brock has acknowledged lying to hurt Ms. Hill\u2019s case.\u201cBernie Sanders, as everyone knows, has one of the strongest civil rights records in Congress,\u201d Mr. Briggs said in the statement. \u201cHe doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need lectures on civil rights and racial issues from David Brock.\u201dThe Clinton campaign did not immediately respond on Thursday night to requests for comment.Mr. Briggs also pointedly criticized Mrs. Clinton. \u201cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bad enough that Hillary Clinton is raising millions in special-interest money in her super PACS,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is worse that she would hire a mudslinger like David Brock. She should be ashamed of her association with Brock.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Sanders stuck to his usual themes as he began a two day swing through New Hampshire on Thursday, focusing on income inequality, campaign finance reform and his calls for raising the minimum wage.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

Here\u2019s how they stacked up in terms of grade-point averages out of 4.0.\u25a0 Google (Google) \u2014 3.1\u25a0 Siri (Apple) \u2014 2.9\u25a0 Cortana (Microsoft) \u2014 2.3\u25a0 Alexa (Amazon) \u2014 1.7Apple was the strongest at productivity tasks like calendar appointments and email; Google was the best at travel and commute-related tasks. Alexa excelled at music, and Cortana was mediocre across the board. Facebook was left out of the grading system because the company denied access to M, though I did hang out with her for two hours on a friend\u2019s account. More on that later.Apple said that Siri had \u201cbecome faster and smarter\u201d and spoke more languages than other assistants. Microsoft said it was \u201cjust scratching the surface\u201d on how Cortana could help people. Google said that it wanted smartphones to do more of the heavy lifting, and that users could do a host of things just by speaking to Google. Amazon did not respond to requests for comment.On the productivity front, Siri, summoned by pressing the home button on the iPhone or by saying, \u201cHey, Siri,\u201d was best able to schedule a meeting with a friend in Hawaii, check what was on my calendar for tomorrow, send an email and read my most recent email aloud. Others could complete only some of those tasks \u2014 Google could not read my last email out loud, and Alexa could not compose an email or create a calendar event.Siri also fared well in music-related tasks, but was bested by Alexa. Both assistants could play the song \u201cHey\u201d by the Pixies, put on the latest episode of the \u201cRadiolab\u201d podcast and play music in the instrumentals genre. But Alexa, summoned simply by saying \u201cAlexa,\u201d could play a specific music station on Pandora, whereas Siri could only open the Pandora app.Google, which builds its voice-controlled assistant into the Google mobile app, achieved the highest marks for completing travel and commuting-related tasks. It responded perfectly to the question \u201cWhat is the traffic like to 221 Main Street?\u201d by showing me how long it would take to drive there.When I said, \u201cTake me to the Dogpatch Boulders gym,\u201d it showed me a map and gave voice directions. When I said, \u201cFind me plane tickets to New York next week,\u201d it offered an impressive response: Flights from San Francisco to New York next week start at $435, and the shortest flight is five hours and 10 minutes long.On travel and commuting, Cortana could offer solutions for the questions about traffic and directions, but not the one about flights. Siri earned a C-minus in the category: She could not give traffic estimates, and in response to the question about flights to New York, she spat out an unhelpful list of web search results related to traveling to New York. And instead of taking me to a bouldering gym to hone my physique, she took me to a brewery.Alexa got a D \u2014 she could offer traffic estimates for only one fixed location that was set up inside the app, like your office, and she added the task of finding a flight to New York to my to-do list. (I gave Alexa a pass on failing to map me to the gym. It seemed too much to ask from a home audio speaker.)For food-related tasks, Google and Apple were even. Each of the assistants was able to find a list of nearby Indian restaurants. Only Google\u2019s voice assistant could order delivery food, but with an unintuitive process that required naming a specific restaurant that delivers food through one of the apps that Google has teamed up with. Siri was the only one capable of booking a restaurant table.In my limited time with M, I asked her to handle some of the most mundane tasks: Call the water company to ask about my utility bill, find out what meats are on sale at the local Whole Foods store and research when would be the cheapest time for my editor to fly to Hong Kong (not that I was trying to get rid of my editor).M pondered for a few minutes before answering each question, which made me suspect that a person handled most of the tasks. So I asked M to schedule a photo shoot with a studio owned by a friend of mine. Within minutes, the photo studio\u2019s phone rang, and my friend picked up.\u201cHi, I\u2019m calling on behalf of my boss,\u201d said M, who sounded like a young woman. \u201cHe wanted to find out if you guys have the ability for a photo shoot at 2 p.m. tomorrow.\u201dM left a contact phone number with a 650 area code, which includes Menlo Park, Calif., where Facebook has its headquarters.\u201cI didn\u2019t catch your name,\u201d my friend at the photo studio said.\u201cFirst name is M,\u201d the not-so-virtual assistant replied. \u201cLast name is Messenger.\u201d\u201cIs that Greek?\u201d my friend at the photo studio asked. M laughed nervously.In other words, M probably is more capable than all the virtual assistants, but largely because humans are on the other end of the puppet strings handling tasks that artificial intelligence cannot. That makes me doubt that many consumers will get to meet M, at least in its current state, in which it is free.\u201cM is still in its very, very early stages,\u201d Facebook said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re not yet focused on scaling M to a large number of people.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The SIFI designation only costs $150 million a year, but that could change once regulators complete the rules for insurers.

This happened in the financial crisis of 2008, and history seems to be repeating itself this year with hedge funds, including Pershing Square and Icahn Enterprises, buffeted by the downturn. The result would not only be a reduction in the number of activist attacks. One or two highflying funds may collapse, and some of the stronger funds may survive and buy opportunistically.

It is Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who holds no elective office but who, as head of the governing Law and Justice Party, is one of the most familiar names in Polish politics and arguably the most powerful.They promised to complete the unfinished work of the Solidarity movement with a platform stressing traditional Catholic values and a zeal for unmasking and prosecuting anyone who had collaborated with the Communist authorities.\u201cThe death of his twin, which affected Kaczynski profoundly and continues to be a focus of his concerns, forced him into the spotlight,\u201d said John S. Micgiel, a professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University who has studied Poland closely.Never married, Mr. Kaczynski lived with his mother until her death early last year and now lives alone, with his cat, Fiona. He is said to be an affable and unerringly polite person, but one with a steel spine who brooks no rivals within the party.What remains unanswered is how far Law and Justice will be able to go \u2014 even with a hobbled constitutional tribunal and firmer control of the national prosecutor\u2019s office and government-controlled media \u2014 before running up against the limits of both domestic and European politics.\u201cWe believe that culture should be free,\u201d said Katarzyna Janowska, who recently resigned as head of the public television channel covering Polish culture. \u201cThey believe that culture should be used to promote something. But you can\u2019t discuss it with them because you live in two different countries, in two different realities.\u201dGuy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister who leads a liberal coalition in the European Parliament, said, \u201cThis is just another hastily adopted step to quickly create facts and dissolve Poland from the European value order, manipulating the country eastward.\u201d\u201cPublic television will become a place of honest debate and fair fight,\u201d Mr. Kurski said Friday, vowing to model the network upon BBC. \u201cAs the public television, we will do everything to rebuild national unity and aim for grand, noble goals.\u201d\u201cTheir feeling is, \u2018We won the election, so now we should be able to put our people into positions of power and authority,\u2019 \u201d Dr. Micgiel said.\u201cI want to strongly state that no pressure, no threats, no words which should never be spoken, particularly by Germans, will make us turn back from this path,\u201d Mr. Kaczynski said. \u201cWe will not turn back!\u201dCritics in the opposition, the European Union and the Western media are objecting, officials of the new government say, not because they truly believe Law and Justice is acting in an undemocratic fashion, but because they see their hold on power slipping and their vision of a diverse, liberal Poland evaporating.Liberal politicians in Western Europe, like Mr. Verhofstadt, did not complain when the previous government humiliated and persecuted Law and Justice, said Anna Fotyga, a former foreign minister who represents Law and Justice in the European Parliament.In any case, the criticism has shown no signs of deterring Mr. Kaczynski. When Mr. Orban visited southern Poland this month for consultations, neither Poland\u2019s president, Andrzej Duda, nor its prime minister, Beata Szydlo, were anywhere to be seen.

But it has been embraced by the theatrical establishment, and many producers and power brokers will be mixing with adolescents belting out their favorite songs from Disney musicals. Nearly 80 percent of the registrants are female; 75 percent are from outside the state of New York; and 50 percent are 30 or younger.\u201cThere is a generational divide in understanding what BroadwayCon is aiming to be,\u201d Mr. Bazadona said. \u201cSome think it is a bunch of theater nerds in a room, but some think this is the future of audience development.\u201dThe convention, at the New York Hilton Midtown, is not cheap \u2014 a full weekend pass costs $250 \u2014 but does not feature the pay-for-autographs-and-photographs experience that characterizes other fan cons. Instead, it is dominated by singalongs, workshops and a \u201cRent\u201d reunion.Especially since the advent of the rock musical, certain Broadway shows have had fervent fan bases. But the handful of \u201cRentheads\u201d who slept by the stage door overnight, seeking cheap tickets to that show two decades ago, have become the 50,000 people who tried to win a digital lottery for $10 \u201cHamilton\u201d tickets, causing a website crash that forced the show to return to drawing pieces of paper from a pail outside the theater.\u201cFans got Charles Dickens to change the ending of \u2018Great Expectations,\u2019 but, in general, the paradigm has been that producers produce, fans consume, and it all flows in one direction,\u201d said Katherine Larsen, principal editor of the Journal of Fandom Studies and a professor of writing at George Washington University. \u201cFans have more of a voice now than they did in the past.\u201c\u201cWe all do this not just for our own amusement, but to try to connect to an audience,\u201d Mr. Rapp said. \u201cWe\u2019re depending on fans, not just to pay our bills, but to have the communal experience of sharing our work.\u201dThey announced the plan a year ago, and the news spread online; they have since partnered with Playbill, which put out the word. Some fans who are coming are looking to meet their favorite actors; some to collect merchandise; some to get career tips, to make friends, or to cosplay (role-play in costume). The events include a \u201cFamily Feud\u201d-style game (with stars and fans), a panel on lighting design and a new musical number created for the opening night.\u201cI just look forward to spending a long weekend talking about Broadway with people that love it,\u201d said Meg Smith, 35, of Manhattan. \u201cI\u2019ll participate in the singalongs,\u201d she said, as well as the dancing in the workshops, \u201cand cry as I attend the \u2018Rent\u2019 Reunion workshop.\u201dMany of today\u2019s Broadway producers are particularly interested in fans because they started there themselves. Barbara Whitman, a producer of \u201cFun Home,\u201d saw the original production of \u201cPippin\u201d 135 times.

Trump, was never in contention for The Register\u00e2\u0080\u0099s embrace. Its editorial board last summer called for him to drop out of the race after he belittled the Vietnam War record of Senator John McCain, the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2008 nominee.Calling Mr. Rubio his \u00e2\u0080\u009cparty\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best hope\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the paper praised his attempt to welcome Hispanic voters and called him \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhip-smart\u00e2\u0080\u009d in meetings with editors.It praised Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief rival, Senator Bernie Sanders, for injecting the issue of income inequality into the races in both parties. But it hesitated over the near-impossibility Mr. Sanders would face in getting his revolutionary programs through Congress.\u201cI am very pleased. Obviously, it means a lot to me,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told reporters as she shook hands with voters on the rope line after a rally in Davenport.In a bit of mischief or at least good timing, the Sanders campaign had bought a \u201ctakeover ad\u201d that covered the home page of the Register\u2019s web site Saturday night, filling the frame with Mr. Sanders\u2019s photo even before a reader could see who the newspaper had endorsed.After nonstop candidate traffic in Iowa for most of full year, the endorsements were the like the gun sounding on the final lap, a ritual more symbolic than influential.Mr. Romney, who was leading by 2 percentage points in a Register poll released days before the 2012 caucuses, ended up losing by just a few votes to a surging Rick Santorum, illustrating the volatility of the race in the final days. The last time a candidate endorsed by The Register won a caucus was in 2000, when George W. Bush was victorious.In November, New Hampshire\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest newspaper, The Union Leader, endorsed Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey. Mr. Christie, already campaigning hard in the state, doubled his support in New Hampshire polls in the month following the endorsement, to about 11 percent, but he has since slipped as Mr. Trump has consolidated a double-digit lead over the entire field.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

But for me, and for his millions of fans, he was someone who simply made life less ordinary. Indeed, Bowie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s music made me feel alive for the first time. And if that sounds like overstatement, then perhaps you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get what music is about and what it can do.He spoke to the weirdos, the freaks, the outsiders and drew us in to an extraordinary intimacy.For the hundreds of thousands of ordinary working-class boys and girls in England in the early 1970s, including me, Bowie incarnated something glamorous, enticing, exciting and mysterious: a world of unknown pleasures and sparkling intelligence. He offered an escape route from the suburban hellholes that we inhabited. Bowie spoke most eloquently to the disaffected, to those who didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel right in their skin, the socially awkward, the alienated. He spoke to the weirdos, the freaks, the outsiders and drew us in to an extraordinary intimacy, although we knew this was total fantasy. But make no mistake, this was a love story. A love story that, in my case, has lasted about 44 years.After hearing the news of Bowie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m hearing him sing \u00e2\u0080\u009cnothing remains\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the opening words of \u00e2\u0080\u009cSunday,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the languid first track on the 2001 album \u00e2\u0080\u009cHeathen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The song seems now like a lamentation, a prayer or a psalm for the dead. Of course, it is extremely tempting to interpret these words in the light of Bowie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death in the obvious way: Nothing remains for us after his death. All is lost.This would be a mistake, but it would certainly be understandable.Does that mean that Bowie was some sort of nihilist? Does it mean that his music, from the cultural disintegration of \u00e2\u0080\u009cDiamond Dogs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d through the depressive languor of \u00e2\u0080\u009cLow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d on to apparent melancholia of \u00e2\u0080\u009cLazarus\u00e2\u0080\u009d is some sort of message of gloom and doom?On the contrary.Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s take \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlackstar,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the album that Bowie reportedly planned as a message to his fans from beyond the grave, which I and so many others have been listening to compulsively over the past few days. In the final track, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Give Everything Away,\u00e2\u0080\u009d whose title is a response to the demand for meaning Bowie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s listeners kept making over the decades, he sings,He spoke with Ben Ratliff about the artist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life and work \u00c2\u00bbAt the core of Bowie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s music and his apparent negativity is a profound yearning for connection and, most of all, for love.What was being negated by Bowie was all the nonsense, the falsity, the accrued social meanings, traditions and morass of identity that shackled us, especially in relation to gender identity and class. His songs revealed how fragile all these meanings were and gave us the capacity for reinvention. They gave us the belief that our capacity for changes, was, like his, seemingly limitless.Of course, there are limits, obviously mortal limits, to who we are how far we can reshape ourselves \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even for Bowie, who seemed eternal. But when I listen to Bowie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s songs I hear an extraordinary hope for transformation. And I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I am alone in this.This also has a political meaning. Bowie was often wrongly seen, particularly back in 1970s, as some kind of right-wing nationalist (I note, with some pleasure, that Bowie, unlike Mick Jagger and Paul McCartney, turned down the offer of a knighthood from the queen in 2003). There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another line from \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlackstar\u00e2\u0080\u009d that is particularly powerful. Bowie sings,An anthology of essays from The Times\u2019s philosophy series, published by Liveright.Bowie will now never see those evergreens. But this is not just wistful nostalgia on his part, for they are nothing to him and nothing to see. Concealed in Bowie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s often dystopian words is an appeal to utopia, to the possible transformation not just of who we are, but of where we are. Bowie, for me, belongs to the best of a utopian aesthetic tradition that longs for a \u00e2\u0080\u009cyes\u00e2\u0080\u009d within the cramped, petty relentless \u00e2\u0080\u009cno\u00e2\u0080\u009d of Englishness. What his music yearned for and allowed us to imagine were new forms of being together, new intensities of desire and love in keener visions and sharper sounds.More From Fixes \u00bbMore From Private Lives \u00bbMore From Couch \u00bbMore From The Stone \u00bbMore From Moviegoers \u00bbMore From The End \u00bbMore From Draft \u00bbMore From Anxiety \u00bbMore From Menagerie \u00bbMore From Disunion \u00bbMore From Bedside \u00bbMore From The Conversation \u00bbMore From The Great Divide \u00bbMore From Errol Morris \u00bbFollowAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bringing Out the Chef in Children", "Date": "2016-01-04", "News": "Jane Brody on health and aging.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI had no idea the world of food was so big. There are so many simple, tasty foods from all these cultures that are so easy to make. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to eat them in a restaurant or be a trained chef to prepare them.\u00e2\u0080\u009dYou might call it gracious dining: cloth napkins in rings, tea lights, flowers occasionally and, most important of all, no TV, mail or toys at the table.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe food industry keeps telling parents to go out to eat and order from the children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s menu for the kids,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Fredericks said. As an alternative to the ubiquitous burgers and fries, mac \u00e2\u0080\u0099n\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cheese and sodas, she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI began offering cooking workshops for young mothers, encouraging them to use some time each day to connect in a happy way with their children.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhat began as a personal mission grew into a nonprofit organization, now 20 years old, that teaches schoolchildren and their families the delights that can ensue from preparing affordable, fresh and tasty foods that benefit their health and well-being.With support from foundations and government agencies,  Ms. Fredericks and a number of professional collaborators created curriculums that teach nutrition through cooking for preschoolers through high schoolers.No elaborate equipment is needed. Classrooms can perform culinary miracles with just a sink, a portable induction stove and a good knife or two, Ms. Fredericks said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cParents initially looked at me as if I had six heads, and wondered why I was having the kids make Thai-inspired fish chowder and not mac \u00e2\u0080\u0099n\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cheese with broccoli,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. Despite parental protests that \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy kids would never eat that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the children really enjoyed the more exotic dishes they prepared, she added.The programs, which have been field-tested with great success, provide nutrition education through hands-on cooking in schools and community organizations, on farms and in other settings around the country. The organization estimates it has reached more than 200,000 families, some members of which have gone on to become health educators themselves.\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe how many kids lose weight in our program,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Fredericks said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo crash diets allowed. The kids know it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lifestyle change.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut good health is hardly the only goal of her programs. Cooking by the children in schools is coordinated with lessons in mathematics, science and culture. For example, young children learn both math and portion control when divvying up a recipe for six among themselves. They learn where food comes from and the importance of sustainability, as well as food science and safety.In preparing meals together, the children learn teamwork. And teens who participate in groups of six in the semester-long Teen Battle Chef program (fashioned like a TV show competition) hone their public speaking skills when describing the cultural background and nutritional value of the dishes they prepare.The program inspires insight into other cultures and tolerance. While learning about Japan, for example, elementary school students might prepare a Japanese tea ceremony. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe world of food is a much bigger place, and it can be fun to explore the cuisines of other cultures,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Fredericks said.The emphasis, too, is on simple ingredients that can produce tasty and colorful dishes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no need for special ingredients,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. In making a stir-fry dish, the children learn to use whatever is in the fridge.The 15 weeks of the elementary school curriculum are seasonally linked, and emphasize these nutritional priorities: breakfast, portion control, juices, avoiding fast food, understanding food marketing, restaurants and snacking. At \u00e2\u0080\u009cfamily night\u00e2\u0080\u009d sessions, parents help their young chefs prepare a meal at school.FamilyCook Productions uses a business model to train facilitators around the country. Some come from departments of public health, others from nonprofit organizations, as well as schools and community groups. Parents, too, can become facilitators. In addition to food preparation and teaching techniques, trainees learn how to store food and equipment, and must pass an assessment in food safety.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe now have the capacity to train anyone anywhere because everything is online,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Fredericks said.Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "Robust Hiring in December Caps Solid Year for U.S. Jobs", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "Supported byThe last time the American economy registered such a prolonged stretch of impressive job creation, Facebook didn\u2019t exist and Beyonc\u00e9 was still a member of Destiny\u2019s Child. \u201cI think this really is illustrative of the fact that economic momentum in the United States is still awfully strong,\u201d said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust. \u201cIn spite of the craziness we\u2019ve seen from Asian markets this week, the fundamentals here at home are still solid.\u201dThe year ended with a particularly strong sprint. In December, employers hired an additional 292,000 people, the Labor Department said, and October and November were revised up by a total of 50,000, pushing the average for the last three months to 284,000.At 5 percent, the jobless rate, which was unchanged from the previous month, has fallen by more than half since exceeding 10 percent in October 2009.Democrats, who are fighting to retain the White House and retake the Senate, would seem best poised to take advantage of the positive economic news. Republican presidential candidates have attacked President Obama and his party\u2019s economic policies, but such criticisms have been muted lately and could lose their sting if the employment picture keeps improving.Still, many voters continue to express widespread dissatisfaction with their own prospects and those of the larger economy. The main shadow darkening the latest monthly jobs report was further evidence that wage growth for the typical worker remains sluggish. Average hourly earnings fell slightly in December, leaving the overall yearly gain at a meager 2.5 percent.\u201cIf we take the rise of the outsider as a dominant theme in American politics now, clearly part of that is the general feeling that the recovery has been much slower than it should be, particularly for less educated workers and individuals with lower incomes,\u201d said Peter Ireland, an economist at Boston College. He called such trends something \u201cthe American people can be justifiably excited about.\u201dBased on the latest figures, which are still subject to revision, the average monthly gain in jobs last year of 221,000 was up from the 2013 average of 199,000, though short of the 260,000 reached in 2014.\u201cThe remarkable thing is how consistent employment growth has been over the past three or four years,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cThat\u2019s quite an achievement.\u201dPressure to raise pay at a faster pace will eventually mount, he said.Analysts noted that wages, which are measured in nominal terms, are better than they might seem at first glance, because inflation fell to such low levels last year. Adjusted for changes in prices, the real gain was roughly 2.1 percent, the highest since the recovery began more than six years ago.While that is not a bad showing, said Betsey Stevenson, an economist at the University of Michigan and a former member of President Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, most of those gains have occurred at the top end of the wage distribution.\u201cThe middle class has continued to get hammered, and what we\u2019ve seen is increasing inequality,\u201d Ms. Stevenson said. \u201cThat was true in the recovery, and also true prior to the recovery.\u201dDouglas Holtz-Eakin, a former adviser to President George W. Bush and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, said that disparity helped explain why many Americans are so discontented with their fortunes.\u201cMedian family income has fallen, not risen, so there\u2019s a great disgruntled-but-employed majority out there,\u201d Mr. Holtz-Eakin said. \u201dPeople want a raise,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think raising the minimum wage is the right way to solve this problem, but I understand why it might look appealing.\u201dMr. Holtz-Eakin blamed the anemic growth in productivity, which he said helps depress wages.Moreover, many Americans have no choice but to settle for part-time work or are too discouraged to keep looking for employment after years of fruitless searching. A broader measure of unemployment that includes these people stayed at 9.9 percent in December. And a relatively low labor participation rate, which barely ticked up to 62.6 percent last month from 62.5, continues to bedevil the recovery.The wage challenge long predates the recession, said Thomas E. Perez, the secretary of labor. \u201cWhen I look at the data over the last 40 years, the last stretch where we had respectable real wage growth was in the late \u201990s, and we had unemployment of 4 percent,\u201d Mr. Perez said. \u201cI think we still have slack in this labor market.\u201d\u201cThe picture is clear: Employment in nonroutine occupations \u2014 both cognitive and manual \u2014 has been increasing steadily for several decades,\u201d the report concluded. \u201cEmployment in routine occupations, however, has been mostly stagnant.\u201dMuch of Friday\u2019s report seemed to validate that decision.Unemployment among African-American men, whose jobless rate is typically twice as high as white\u2019s, fell to 8.7 percent from 10.9 percent, the lowest in more than seven years. The jobless rate for women dropped to 4.4 percent from 4.6 percent. Employment grew most vigorously in professional and business services, which added 73,000 workers, while the construction industry added an unexpectedly strong 45,000 jobs last month, with at least part of the gain because of unseasonably warm weather.Sitel, a customer care provider in Nashville, has been celebrating its biggest growth in years. Sean Erickson, an executive vice president, said that Sitel hired 7,500 people in the United States last year for sales, customer service, technical support and front-line management positions.\u201cWhere we saw the greatest growth was in financial services, retail, travel and transportation,\u201d Mr. Erickson said, with weaker demand in manufacturing and communications. He said the company, with 62,000 employees worldwide, had poured money into employee training.The company\u2019s success also highlights how much the job market has shifted. One of the biggest areas of growth has come from providing flexible, temporary or part-time employees who can work from home to help businesses quickly scale staff up, or down in response to demand, Mr. Erickson said.It is still scaling up.Gardiner Harris contributed reporting.

For the last three years, the duo dribbled out lush, satiny tracks influenced equally by dance music and \u201990s R&B in near anonymity, favoring a strategic build to the social media onslaught more fashionable for emerging artists.\u201cMaybe you shouldn\u2019t be available at the click of a button,\u201d said Mr. Ullman, 22, who produces the electronic tracks (soft synths, strong drums) that most separate the pair from the more commercial R&B of the moment. \u201cWe want to bring it back to really diving into a real LP, a real piece of work that has a theme and a mood and a setting.\u201dMajid Jordan\u2019s old-fashioned instincts and patience belie the manner and unlikely speed of its rise.They first met at Mr. Al Maskati\u2019s 21st birthday party in 2011, when they were both students at the University of Toronto. Mr. Ullman, still a teenager, was in his first year. They bonded over a shared taste in music \u2014 American pop, French house, Jamaican dub, U.K. garage \u2014 and their complementary skills, and made plans to collaborate before Mr. Al Maskati graduated (he was studying business) and returned to his native Bahrain.Mr. Ullman, an economics major and classically trained pianist turned bedroom producer, had set up a makeshift recording studio in his dorm room. In their first session, they recorded two songs, including one that sampled the disco-influenced dance group Change.Through writing together, \u201cwe were having this conversation, just exploring the music that we both love,\u201d Mr. Ullman said. Mr. Al Maskati added, \u201cAnd at the same time, getting to know each other.\u201dWhen the school year ended, taking their housing with it, they moved in with Mr. Ullman\u2019s parents, outside Toronto, and finished their first batch of songs. The duo first chose the name Good People \u2014 taken from Mr. Al Maskati\u2019s assurances to his family back in Bahrain about his Canadian hosts.After Mr. Al Maskati returned to the Middle East, Mr. Ullman spent about a month mixing and mastering the project \u2014 \u201cYou can learn anything on YouTube,\u201d he explained \u2014 before uploading it to the streaming service SoundCloud with the name \u201cafterhours\u201d and little additional information. Mr. Al Maskati said, \u201cI was trying to find a job, and I didn\u2019t know if employers would search for your Facebook.\u201dDrake\u2019s right hand, the producer and studio engineer Noah Shebib, known as 40, was among the first to hear the music. Mr. Shebib said that a friend \u201cbasically forced me to listen to it,\u201d but the distinctive sonic blend caught his ear.\u201cOnce I realized it was just these two kids locked inside of a dorm room, making all this music literally by themselves, I was intrigued,\u201d he said.The day after the songs went live, Mr. Al Maskati received a message from Mr. Shebib. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing about Toronto,\u201d Mr. Al Maskati said. \u201cThe degrees of separation to someone as accomplished as Drake are not very far.\u201dWith the blessing of his parents, Mr. Al Maskati soon returned to Toronto to meet with the city\u2019s new music royalty. Mr. Al Maskati and Mr. Ullman were promptly signed to Drake\u2019s budding imprint, OVO Sound, and tasked with collaborating on ideas for his third album, \u201cNothing Was the Same.\u201dAfter about six months, Mr. Al Maskati and Mr. Ullman hit upon the demo that would become \u201cHold On, We\u2019re Going Home.\u201d\u201cI gave it on a USB to Drake, and he drove home to it that night,\u201d Mr. Al Maskati said. \u201cWhen I showed up at the studio the next day, it was tracked. 40 threw his arms up like: \u2018We got it! We got the hit!\u2019\u201dMr. Shebib recalled, \u201cThey didn\u2019t even realize the impact of what they had just done.\u201d He added that the smash single was a \u201cmotivating experience \u2014 the first thing they wanted to do was run back to the studio and try to do it on their own.\u201d (Majid Jordan found early success again with work on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cMine,\u201d also featuring Drake.)As Majid Jordan shifted focus to its own music, Mr. Shebib took on a mentorship role.\u201cI\u2019m pretty good at whipping people into shape,\u201d he said of the inexperienced pair. \u201cI just sent them on their path.\u201dMr. Ullman was more effusive. \u201cHe changed the way I look at music.\u201dIn January 2015, they went to Los Angeles, where they spent a month writing the new album, collaborating with the producer Illangelo, best known for his work with the Weeknd, who is now a Grammy-nominated star. But despite the time in California, the two men point to their home base of Toronto to explain the group\u2019s organic melding of cultures and genres.\u201cThat\u2019s what Toronto is about \u2014 sharing ideas, communicating, passing on your tricks and knowledge,\u201d Mr. Al Maskati said.The OVO connection doesn\u2019t hurt when it comes to opening doors for local musicians. Because of Drake\u2019s reign, \u201cthere\u2019s a spotlight on the city unlike any other time,\u201d Mr. Ullman said.When it came time for Majid Jordan\u2019s first official single, the Middle Eastern-tinged \u201cMy Love,\u201d to make its premiere, not only did Drake provide a verse, but the track also made its debut on his OVO Sound radio show for Apple Music\u2019s Beats 1.\u201cThis time,\u201d Mr. Al Maskati said, \u201cDrake is on our song.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Some glossy magazines give celebrities the right to approve photographs or cover images as part of negotiations, he noted.And even in Times interviews, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere are all kinds of negotiations.\u00e2\u0080\u009d For example, in some cases, The Times will agree to an embargo on an article that governs when it may be published.Mr. Corbett agreed that the interview was \u00e2\u0080\u009ca great get.\u201d \u00c2\u00a0(And there is no doubt that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s generated extraordinary readership for Rolling Stone.)

A number of people in the news business responded. Here are some samples.The Times is one of the first major news organizations to take a firm stand against a growing and disliked practice.  \nThe Times has dismantled its environmental pod and discontinued the Green blog.\nThe public editor looks into a test drive of an electric car that caused a storm. The statistical wizard's offer to wager on the outcome of the presidential race is a bad choice. How does The Times decide which comments to post on NYTimes.com? The public editor gets answers from The Times's online commenting managers. \nReaders complained to the public editor over The Times's decision to display a photograph of the unconscious ambassador in Libya.  \nThose who reveal classified material are being punished like never before.When the government asks newspapers to keep quiet, the bar should be very high for saying yes. Editors were asked by the C.I.A. to withhold information and did so for months before publishing it online Tuesday night. Scott Shane, a Times national security reporter, was referred to in the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prosecution of a former C.I.A. official.Bradley Manning and WikiLeaks are a major story for The Times, so why was the paper so late to cover the soldier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretrial hearing? Just who is it that the United States is killing with strikes by unmanned aircraft in Yemen and Pakistan? The First Amendment matters for many reasons, some of them not on the world stage. The public editor travels to Harvard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Shorenstein Center. With audio.Is the concept outdated or even more important in the new media era?The journalistic ideal of impartiality is coming under attack. My column for this week.The public editor speaks with Times editors about how they plan to fact-check the first presidential debate. When opinion appears in news pages, it needs to be labeled and displayed as just that. Whatever the conclusions, whatever the effectiveness, of challenging facts, the idea that we have to debate the necessity of the media doing so strikes me as absurd.The Times is reconsidering the use of the term \"illegal immigrant.\"An article coyly wrote around a business name that used an unprintable word according to The Times's standards.A crisis in North Africa and a reader\u00e2\u0080\u0099s query bring up crucial distinctions in usage.Families are rightfully upset by some of the early reporting done on the Newtown, Conn., shootings.The research and development team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Chronicle tool may distract you while you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re waiting for the returns to come in.Unidentified sources make it difficult for readers to know what to believe regarding negotiations between the United States and Iran. The public editor's judgment is not about immigration reform; it's about clarity and accuracy.  An activist wants The Times to stop using the term \"illegal immigrant\" in its reporting.  After criticism on Twitter and elsewhere, the first sentence of an obituary for Yvonne Brill was changed.A front-page article involving the New York Police Department's internal communication could have provided greater context.A headline ignites a discussion about its \"undermining\" question.

The critic Pete Wells gave his first \u00e2\u0080\u009cpoor\u00e2\u0080\u009d restaurant rating in The Times -- and he did it memorably.

Those who are illiterate \u2014 still 20 percent of the world\u2019s population \u2014 cannot take advantage of the Internet at all; and in the developing world, the technology industry employs barely 1 percent of the work force. In rich countries, technology employs 3 to 5 percent of the work force, still a small fraction of total employment.According to the bank\u2019s survey, more than half of all countries had privacy laws on the books, but only 51 of them were in the developing world.The bank, which says it has itself invested $12.6 billion in information technology projects, calls on countries to make the Internet \u201cuniversal, affordable, open and safe.\u201d Yet it also takes pains to say that expanding access will not be enough for citizens to take advantage of the benefits.

{"Headline": "What Advice Would You Give to Your Mom, Dad or Guardian on How to Be a Better Parent?", "Date": "2016-01-07", "News": "Questions about issues in the news for students 13 and older.Imagine if your mother, father or guardian made his or her own resolutions at the start of the year on how to be a better parent.  What advice would you give?\n\u2026 Do I make specific resolutions as a parent at the end of every year? Yes, but in large part they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the same resolutions I make every year. In January 2012, in this space, I vowed to \u00e2\u0080\u009cclean it, own it and enjoy it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d organize our home to make living there easier, I resolved (clean it); I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d make affirmative choices about how we spend our time, knowing that a \u00e2\u0080\u009cyes\u00e2\u0080\u009d to even a fun thing is a \u00e2\u0080\u009cno\u00e2\u0080\u009d to hanging out together at home (own it) and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d appreciate all the journeys rather than straining toward the destination (enjoy it). In 2013, I graded myself and renewed the same resolutions. In 2014, I focused on \u00e2\u0080\u009cenjoy it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d writing in \u201cResolved: The Best Moment of 2014? This One\u201d:A few days ago, a Facebook friend shared a conversation she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d had with one of her children, in which she asked for \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe best moment of 2013.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Her child, at a moment that rather distinctly didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stand out in any particular way, enthusiastically declared \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis one!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nI still love that \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis one!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Because, as I wrote then, when things are going badly it really is the ordinary moments we miss. This moment, right now, 15 minutes from leaving to pick up a child at hockey, with another downstairs re-reading Harry Potter in the newly illustrated edition he got for Christmas, a third playing Playmobil horses with a friend all over the floor in a way that I know she won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to ever clean up and the last child making Rice Krispie Treats to mail her grandfather \u00e2\u0080\u0094 this moment is the best.But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really less the larger resolutions that count than the little daily ones, just as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the grand speeches and lectures that my children will remember as adults but rather, the way we are together, every hour, every day. My inner monologue of daily resolution is less an evaluation than a narrative. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the story of my life as a parent as it spins out behind me, and an emotional playlist for how I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to meet the challenges ahead.So my resolution for 2016, along with my beloved fresh start home organization plans and a new calendar filled with professional goals, is simply more following the smaller resolutions. I hope for gentle course corrections, not grand change. Things are good here for now. And, as always, I resolve anew to enjoy that.\n\u2014 What advice would you give to your mother, father or guardian on how to be a better parent? Why?\u2014 What would you tell them about what they do well as a parent \u2014 that they should keep doing?\u2014 What about you? Are there any resolutions you want to make on how to be a better child? What advice would you give yourself?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Wildlife Refuge Occupied in Protest of Oregon Ranchers\u2019 Prison Terms", "Date": "2016-01-02", "News": "Supported byFederal officials said Sunday that no federal wildlife employees were in danger after a group of armed activists and militiamen protesting the prosecution of two ranchers took over a remote federal wildlife refuge in the rural southeastern corner of Oregon over the weekend.A building at the refuge seized on Saturday afternoon by the group houses the offices of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, and is operated by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, about 30 miles southeast of Burns, in Harney County. A representative of the Fish and Wildlife Service said the agency was monitoring the situation. \u201cWhile the situation is ongoing, the main concern is employee safety and we can confirm that no federal staff were in the building at the time of the initial incident,\u201d the press officer said.The occupation began after a demonstration on Saturday in support of Dwight Hammond, 73, and his son Steven Hammond, 46, who were to report to California prison after a federal judge ruled that the sentences they had served for arson were not long enough under federal law.\u201cWe\u2019re planning on staying here for years, absolutely,\u201d Ammon Bundy told The Oregonian in a telephone interview. \u201cThis is not a decision we\u2019ve made at the last minute.\u201d The two men refused to provide details on how many people were taking part in the occupation, but militia members claim there are as many as 150 people at the refuge.In a telephone interview Sunday morning with CNN, Mr. Bundy said his group wanted the federal government to restore the \u201cpeople\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d\u201cPeople need to be aware that we\u2019ve become a system where government is actually claiming and using and defending people\u2019s rights, and they are doing that against the people,\u201d he said.A lawyer for the Hammonds said, however, they did not welcome the Bundys\u2019 help, according to The Associated Press.\u201cNeither Ammon Bundy nor anyone within his group/organization speak for the Hammond family,\u201d the lawyer, W. Alan Schroeder, wrote to David Ward, the Harney County sheriff.An email to the sheriff seeking comment was not immediately returned.\u201cThis is not a time to stand down,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a time to stand up and come to Harney County. We need your help and we are asking for it.\u201dThe Hammonds admitted they lit fires in 2001 and 2006, but said it had been to protect their property from wildfires and invasive plant species, The A.P. said. They were convicted three years ago, and the father served three months in prison, while the son served one year.The Harney County Sheriff\u2019s Department said the Oregon State Police was handling the incident. Beth Anne Steele, a spokeswoman for the F.B.I. in Portland, said the agency was aware of the situation, but declined to comment further.The Bundys have been organizing opposition to the government case against the Hammonds on social media in recent weeks, which they described as a tyrannical use of federal authority.He called the prosecution of the Hammonds \u201ca symptom of a very huge, egregious problem\u201d that he described as a battle over land and resources between the federal government and \u201cthe American people.\u201d\u201cThe people cannot survive without their land and resources,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot have the government restricting the use of that to the point that it puts us in poverty.\u201dMr. Bundy described the federal building as \u201cthe people\u2019s facility, owned by the people\u201d and said his group was occupying it to take \u201ca hard stand against this overreach, this taking of the people\u2019s land and resources.\u201dHe said the group would remain there indefinitely and told an interviewer that he hoped more supporters would join them. \u201cWe have a facility that we can house them in,\u201d he said, referring to the occupied building.\u201cWe pose no threat to anybody,\u201d Mr. Bundy said. \u201cThere is no person that is physically harmed by what we are doing.\u201d He added that if law enforcement officials \u201cbring physical harm to us, they will be doing it only for a facility or a building.\u201d\u201cThe facility has been the tool to do all the tyranny that has been placed upon the Hammonds,\u201d Ammon Bundy told the newspaper. He said he planned to remain in the building for \u201cyears.\u201dCliven Bundy previously galvanized conservative critics of the federal government after a standoff with agents from the Bureau of Land Management, who attempted to confiscate cattle he had illegally grazed on federal land since 1993.Nicholas Fandos contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Touring Can\u2019t Save Musicians in the Age of Spotify", "Date": "2016-01-25", "News": "Supported byNotebookEvery couple of months, I see another post in my Facebook feed about a band that was cut off by an 18-wheeler or skidded on a patch of black ice and rolled their van into a ditch. Some members are injured, and they\u2019re launching a Kickstarter campaign to pay for medical bills and to get back on their feet.My heart (and often, money) goes out to them. But if you need to crowdfund your hospital costs, you were never on your feet to begin with. After many years as a touring artist myself, I\u2019m honestly surprised that the person in that ditch has never been me.Touring is, of course, the most ancient business model available to artists \u2014 and in many ways, it remains a vital part of their livelihood, even while the surrounding industry undergoes major upheaval to accommodate the new paradigm of streaming music. In response to the shift in revenue sources, standard recording contracts now intrude into the numerous nonrecording aspects of an artist\u2019s career. But the advice given to the creative generators of this multibillion dollar industry is still one that would be recognizable to a medieval troubadour: Go on tour.And yet from a business standpoint, it\u2019s hard to find a model more unsustainable than one that relies on a single human body. This is why we have vice presidents, relief pitchers and sixth men. When applied to music\u2019s seemingly limitless streaming future, the only scarce resource left is the artists themselves. You would think the industry would protect such an important piece of its business model, but in fact, the opposite is true.Record labels have followed the money and addressed these changes in the contracts they offer to recording artists. In the predigital era, labels profited only from the physical recordings they funded, but as that income began dwindling, a new logic was applied to the artist-label relationship. Labels argued that by promoting the recordings they owned, they were also promoting the artist\u2019s career as a whole, and were entitled to profit from the full spectrum of artist\u2019s revenue streams \u2014 the \u201c360 deal,\u201d named for the totality of its coverage.But labels do not take on the additional risks associated with their additional profits. Instead of protecting the health of their revenue-generating engine, they simply point to an artist\u2019s independent-contractor status, which releases them from any liability they would be on the hook for if artists were labeled employees. Rather than sparking a labor dispute, these 360 deals quickly became the new normal. As a result, administrators, support staff and office spaces are insured against the risks of doing business, while the company\u2019s income generators \u2014 the creators of their master recordings \u2014 are on their own.From royalty rates to basic safeguards against the standard hazards of doing business, recording artists begin the negotiating process with a deck that is stacked against them. This lopsided balance of power allows labels to treat all artists as replaceable until proven otherwise, and both sides know that there is always a long line of hopefuls outside auditions for \u201cThe Voice\u201d or \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent\u201d to undercut a young artist\u2019s bargaining power.The question of why recording artists have been unable to organize and collectively bargain the way other artists have \u2014 actors and screenwriters, for example \u2014 is one that has dogged them since the dawn of the record deal. Musicians do have a union, the American Federation of Musicians, but it\u2019s not a particularly strong one; it primarily represents members of symphonies, and it hasn\u2019t been on a national strike in 70 years. Recording artists are not really considered core members, because their tenures within the union tend to be shorter than those of lifelong pit musicians and orchestra members. Music is also a traditionally decentralized, live art form with an ingrained renegade spirit. Hollywood, by contrast, has a single dominant hub.Perhaps musicians\u2019 renegade spirit is what ultimately will save the next generation of recording artists, who are increasingly forgoing record deals altogether and going it alone. As true independents, they work the margin between the technology that makes recordings cheaper to create and a public that is steadily buying fewer of them. Without a label taking a bite out of multiple revenue sources, the numbers can actually work. Others are coming together in groups centered on advocacy and pressing for changes to the laws that dictate royalty payments in the new streaming economy \u2014 something that could mean all the difference when injury, accident or age brings a touring musician\u2019s career to a halt. But in the meantime, the vans and buses roll on.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Drop Dead? Not the Newly Relevant Daily News", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Supported byOn a recent afternoon, Jim Rich, the editor in chief of The Daily News, sat at his computer playing around with front-page headlines, a few well-chosen words that would capture the day\u2019s biggest news: Sarah Palin\u2019s endorsement of Donald Trump in the Republican presidential primary.In a few minutes, he had what he thought was a promising candidate: \u201cCRAZY, STUPID LOVE.\u201dMr. Rich walked it out into the newsroom for feedback. The paper\u2019s copy chief, Jon Blackwell, proposed an alternative: \u201cI\u2019M WITH STUPID!\u201d\u201cI said, \u2018Yes, that\u2019s much better,\u2019\u201d Mr. Rich recalled recently at the paper\u2019s offices in Lower Manhattan. \u201cThat\u2019s a winner.\u201dA designer set the phrase over a pair of photographs of Mr. Trump and Ms. Palin, pointing at each other. The image was soon rolling off the presses in New Jersey and going viral on Facebook and Twitter.It was the latest in a series of attention-grabbing covers that have shifted the conversation around the struggling paper. Just a few months ago, after an aborted sale and sweeping layoffs, The News seemed to have completed its devolution from the model of a big-city tabloid to a battered symbol of the diminished state of America\u2019s newspapers. But the recent string of covers, which were all widely shared on social media, have sent a very different message \u2014 if not about the paper\u2019s long-term financial prospects, then at least about its continuing cultural relevance.Put another way, Mr. Rich, a News veteran who took over the paper in October, seems determined to make sure that the tabloid that famously shamed President Ford for abandoning New York in its time of need will at least go down swinging.\u201cI think that\u2019s fair,\u201d said Mr. Rich, 44, of the characterization. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t put the accent on \u2018going down,\u2019 but we\u2019re swinging.\u201dWilliam Holiber, the chief executive, who was seated nearby, said, \u201cThe mentality is that we definitely have nothing to lose, so let\u2019s just go for it.\u201dThe News has certainly been going for it, most notably with its provocative front page after December\u2019s mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. \u201cGOD ISN\u2019T FIXING THIS,\u201d read the headline, accompanied by screen-grabs of tweets from a variety of conservative politicians offering \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d to the families of the victims. The next day, the cover of The News identified the head of the National Rifle Association, Wayne LaPierre, as a terrorist.8 PhotosGun control has been an important issue for The News since the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, and the paper, which has long identified itself as the voice of New York City\u2019s working class, has a rich history of championing particular causes. But even by tabloid standards, this was unusually pointed rhetoric.\u201cAs someone who\u2019s been at this in one form or another for quite a while, it\u2019s surreal to think that 99 percent of the millions of people who will look at our Page 1 on a given day will actually never hold the paper in their hands,\u201d said Mr. Rich.These covers can now reach more people than they ever did on the newsstand. The problem is that readers don\u2019t have to pay to see them. For all of the attention The News\u2019s recent front pages have drawn, it\u2019s unlikely that they \u2014 or perhaps anything \u2014 can rescue the paper from its precarious financial position. It\u2019s a familiar story. The News\u2019s circulation has been plummeting for years; it sits at about 241,000 on weekdays. It seems far-fetched to imagine that the paper will ever capture enough digital advertising to offset the declining revenue from its shrinking print base.Newsroom morale seems to have improved somewhat since those dark days. This is partly a credit to Mr. Rich, whom colleagues describe as easygoing and accessible. In contrast to the series of British-style tabloid editors who preceded him, Mr. Rich grew up in a working-class suburb of New York, reading The News and The Post. He came to the newspaper business late, after dropping out of Westchester Community College and working his way through a series of odd jobs, including installing home alarm systems. He landed at The News as the deputy Sunday sports editor in 2004 and rose steadily through the paper\u2019s ranks.Mr. Rich\u2019s predecessor, Colin Myler, the Fleet Street-trained former editor of News of the World, increased the tabloid\u2019s focus on celebrities, which succeeded in generating more web traffic but struck many as a betrayal of the paper\u2019s more high-minded, if populist, legacy. \u201cWe felt we lost who we were to some extent,\u201d said Mr. Holiber, adding that The News had come too closely to resemble The Post.Under Mr. Rich, the paper is showing some signs of moving in a new direction, or rather an old one, returning to its roots as a crusading tabloid. In October, The News created a new \u201clong-form\u201d reporting and editing unit largely dedicated to exploring social issues.And, of course, there are those covers. Whether they represent a fleeting gift from an unusually generous news cycle, a great tabloid\u2019s final bloom, or, just maybe, the beginning of a rebirth is anyone\u2019s guess.\u201cWho knows what\u2019s going to happen in three years,\u201d said Mr. Rich. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting like hell to succeed, and I believe in my heart that we will, but whether that\u2019s the case or not, we are going to go at this with everything we\u2019ve got.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ex-Associate of Pharmacists in Al Jazeera Report Assists Doping Inquiry", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Supported byDr. Ramogida, in an extensive interview with The New York Times, emphatically denied any involvement with performance-enhancing drugs. He said that he was not aware that some business associates were involved in doping and that he learned of their activities only when Al Jazeera brought it to his attention.The business associates \u2014 Charles Sly and Chad Robertson, both pharmacists, and Brandon Spletzer, a naturopath \u2014 were shown in the documentary talking openly about providing illicit drugs to athletes. Mr. Robertson told an undercover reporter for Al Jazeera that they were developing a telemedicine clinic with Dr. Ramogida called ProMed that would provide athletes with second opinions after they have been treated by team doctors. Dr. Ramogida was recruited to participate in that venture, but he said that he backed out before the Al Jazeera report was broadcast in December and that he never invested in the fledgling business.Dr. Ramogida said he was an unwitting pawn unaware of the ulterior motives of his businesses partners, who he believes recruited him as a conduit to top athletes.\u201cI can\u2019t emphasize strongly enough that at no point was there ever any discussions \u2014 nor even the slightest hint \u2014 of anything to do with banned substances,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cHence, my utter shock at seeing the Al Jazeera documentary.\u201dThe Seahawks, the Vancouver Canucks of the N.H.L. and Fortius Sport & Health, a sports medicine and training center in the Vancouver suburb of Burnaby, confirmed that Dr. Ramogida stepped forward to tell them about his connection to Mr. Robertson, Mr. Spletzer and ProMed before the Al Jazeera report was broadcast.Dr. Ramogida remains with Fortius, the Canucks and the Seahawks, who have employed him as a chiropractor since 2002, and he traveled with the team for the playoffs.\u201cSuffice to say, we stand by Gerry 100%,\u201d Craig Thompson, president and chief executive of Fortius, wrote in an email. \u201cThere is no evidence or even the slightest suggestion linking him to PEDs, which are of course the complete antithesis of everything Gerry has stood for throughout his career.\u201dThe Canadian antidoping group is looking into the allegations made in the Al Jazeera report but declined to discuss specifics. Paul Melia, the chief executive, said that his group was increasingly focused on the \u201csupply chain\u201d and the people who provide athletes with performance-enhancing drugs.\u201cIt is always disturbing to hear of these kinds of allegations to the extent that the documentary suggests that it is going on,\u201d Mr. Melia said, without confirming that an investigation was underway.Major League Baseball and the N.F.L. have said they are cooperating with the United States Anti-Doping Agency, which is looking into the allegations made in the Al Jazeera report.Dr. Ramogida, who has said he was determined to ensure that his reputation is not tarnished by the documentary, contacted the antidoping group about two weeks ago, answered questions about the Al Jazeera documentary and offered to cooperate further as needed, a lawyer for the group said.The Al Jazeera report described a labyrinth of therapists and healers that athletes seek out to recover from injuries and gain an edge. It suggested that pharmacists find athletes looking for illicit services by teaming up with trainers and doctors who work for teams and in sports clubs.Mr. Robertson\u2019s and Mr. Spletzer\u2019s effort to start ProMed in Vancouver may not have been coincidental. Over the past several years, British Columbia and Ontario loosened regulations so that naturopathic doctors could prescribe a wide range of drugs, including hormones and amino peptides that are known performance-enhancers and banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency.WADA, though, has focused its efforts primarily on educating athletes, coaches, doctors and trainers, not naturopaths, according to Sarah Teetzel, an associate professor of kinesiology at the University of Manitoba. This has provided an avenue for those distributing banned substances to reach athletes, she said.\u201cNaturopaths haven\u2019t really been part of the conversation of doping development,\u201d she said. \u201cA team doctor knows if they are found to have supplied an athlete, there are consequences. Traditionally, naturopaths haven\u2019t been part of it.\u201dDr. Bob McCormack, professor of orthopedics at the University of British Columbia and the chief medical officer of the Canadian Olympic team, said he was not surprised by the allegations, only that a naturopath in Vancouver was involved.It was indicative of the \u201cnever-ending battle against performance enhancing drugs,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little like tax law: you close a loophole and some smart accountant finds a run around it.\u201dDr. Ramogida, 44, grew up in the Vancouver area, played high school football and has degrees from the University of British Columbia and the University of Western States, a chiropractic college in Portland, Ore. His connection with Mr. Robertson dates back about six years.In 2009, Dr. Ramogida was introduced through email to Mr. Robertson, who was promoting Ignite and Accelerate, creams that were designed to warm muscles and aid recovery. Dr. Ramogida began offering them to patients.Later that year, Mr. Robertson, Dr. Ramogida and another Vancouver-based pharmacist formed a company called Advance Nutrascience to market similar creams.Not long after, Dr. Ramogida moved to England to work for the British track and field team, a three-year stint that ended after the 2012 London Olympics. Advance Nutrascience was shut down in November 2013 because of inactivity, according to Canadian business records.Dr. Ramogida said that Mr. Robertson approached him about joining ProMed last year. The premise of the business was that many N.F.L. players do not trust their team physicians and would seek doctors who could offer them unbiased second opinions.Because the athletes travel frequently, the consultations would be done via secure Internet video connections. ProMed would have a roster of specialists, including medical doctors, who could answer questions. Dr. Ramogida said that he was familiar with this telemedicine model because it is used to provide medical advice to people living in remote towns in Canada.Dr. Ramogida, whose Facebook page includes a photo of him working on a Seahawks player on the sideline during a game, said discussions never advanced further and he never invested in the ProMed venture. In fact, he said, he backed out of the project in the fall after he realized that he was being used as a frontman.What tipped him off, he said, was a prospectus that Mr. Robertson had created to promote ProMed to N.F.L. players. Several N.F.L. players were featured on the cover. Inside, players were told that teams do not have their best interests in mind and that experts at ProMed are \u201cindependent and insulated from the pressures of the club.\u201d ProMed, it said, is \u201ccommitted to redefining the limits of human performance by providing you the most effective technological advancements through the go-to experts in their respective industry.\u201dDr. Ramogida, though, said he was irked that Mr. Robertson had used a photo of him without his permission. The picture showed Dr. Ramogida holding the Vince Lombardi Trophy after the Seahawks won the Super Bowl in 2014. The brochure and photo, he said, \u201ctraded on my personal credentials and professional relationships without my knowledge.\u201dAuthorities in British Columbia have said they are looking into the allegations Mr. Robertson and Mr. Spletzer made in the Al Jazeera documentary. \u201cWe were kind of disturbed as pharmacists,\u201d Bob Nakagawa, the registrar of the College of Pharmacists of British Columbia, said of the report. \u201cLooking at it, it makes you wonder.\u201dThe college is likely to launch a formal investigation to determine whether Mr. Robertson\u2019s license, which he received in 2013, should be suspended or revoked.The College of Naturopathic Physicians of British Columbia, which regulates naturopathic doctors in the province, is looking into whether Mr. Spletzer should be allowed to keep his license.The Department of Health in Washington State, where Mr. Spletzer is also registered as a naturopath, is investigating the allegations he made to Al Jazeera.A spokesman for Athletics Canada said that Dr. Ramogida treated a few track and field athletes based in Edmonton and provided therapy services to a few national teams in 2005 and 2006, but it had no comment about his association with Mr. Robertson. A spokesman for the British national track and field team did not respond to a request for comment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "British Tax Deal With Google Puts Government on Defensive", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 When it was announced last Friday, Google\u2019s agreement to pay 130 million pounds in back taxes was welcomed by the country\u2019s chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, as a \u201cmajor success.\u201dLess than a week later, few are saying that of the deal, which has put Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s government on the defensive.Mr. Baker said the tax accord, while lawful and involving a substantial sum, was still \u201cderisory\u201d and \u201ccompletely unacceptable to the public.\u201dOn Wednesday in Parliament, the agreement was criticized by the opposition leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who pressed Mr. Cameron over claims from some analysts that the payment represented an effective tax rate of around 3 percent. That has not been confirmed either by the tax authorities or by Google.Lack of transparency over how the amount was calculated has prompted additional complaints and led to fresh calls for companies to publish their tax returns to allow the public to judge for themselves. Mr. Corbyn noted that, unlike Google, ordinary taxpayers \u201cdo not get the option of 25 meetings with 17 ministers to decide what their rate of tax is.\u201dMr. Cameron countered that part of the tax recovered was based on revenue Google had generated in years which the Labour Party was in power under prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.If Mr. Corbyn is angry, Mr. Cameron said, \u201cmaybe he should start by calling Tony Blair.\u201d He continued: \u201cYou can get him at JPMorgan. Call Gordon Brown. Apparently, you can get him at a Californian bond dealer called Pimco.\u201dWith public spending restrained following the financial crisis of 2008, and amid a growing debate over wealth inequality, the amount of taxes paid by corporations like Google, Facebook and Amazon remains a highly sensitive issue. The ability of big multinational corporations to limit their tax liabilities has stirred resentment in many countries.\u201cIt has never seemed fair that some of these companies \u2014 no matter how wonderful the service they provide \u2014 should be paying so much less in tax than the high street tearooms and bookshops they have pulverized,\u201d Mr. Johnson wrote.The British news media have contrasted their government\u2019s approach to that of France and Italy, which, they have reported, are seeking to extract more in taxes from Google.In a statement, Google said that it would \u201cnow pay tax based on revenue from U.K.-based advertisers, which reflects the size and scope of our U.K. business.\u201d It added, \u201cThe way multinational companies are taxed has been debated for many years, and the international tax system is changing as a result.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Part of the reason for that approach is the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s instinct to hit broad themes; part of it is the reality that there is little chance for Mr. Obama to push many of his favorite initiatives through the Republican-controlled Congress in his remaining months. The president is also expected to present a more optimistic view of the state of the nation than the one being heard on the Republican presidential campaign trail.As is the tradition, the two parties are inviting guests to highlight political points, with Michelle Obama, the first lady, leaving an empty seat in her box in recognition of victims of gun violence, and Speaker Paul D. Ryan inviting two members of an order of Roman Catholic nuns challenging the Affordable Care Act.The speech will no doubt quickly become fodder for the two sides in the presidential primary campaign, and one of the Obama administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goals is to help establish the argument for electing a Democratic successor.The speech can become a ritualistic chore, and Mr. Obama will no doubt be gratified to be finished with the annual rite.

Mr. Kirby said that Mr. Riddering was killed during the course of the attack on two hotels, the Splendid and the Yibi, and a restaurant, Cappuccino Cafe, that sparked a 15-hour standoff in the heart of Ouagadougou, the capital.\u201cOur thoughts and prayers are with his family at this difficult time, as they are with all those affected by this brutality,\u201d Mr. Kirby said.Mr. Riddering, 45, was a missionary who worked at the Les Ailes de Refuge Orphanage in the town of Yako, 70 miles from the capital, according to a statement from the organization that runs the orphanage, Sheltering Wings.It said that he moved to Burkina Faso from Florida, where he sold boats, in 2011 with his wife, Amy, and daughter Delaney to do missionary work.\u201cMy heart is so heavy and I am having trouble believing he is gone,\u201d she added. \u201cMike was an example in the way he lived and loved.

{"Headline": "Donald Trump Finally Buys TV Ads, and Lots of Them", "Date": "2016-01-04", "News": "After months of waiting, Donald J. Trump has followed through on his promise to advertise, and advertise big, in early voting states in January. Mr. Trump, the front-runner in many polls for the Republican presidential nomination, had promised to spend at least $2 million a week on advertising; he has already reserved $1,996,165 in ads through Jan. 12, according to Elizabeth Wilner, a senior vice president at Kantar Media/CMAG, which tracks TV advertising. Several media buyers, some with rival campaigns and some independent contractors, called the television airtime substantial. Mr. Trump is not at saturation levels in many of the markets, but his level of ad buys are competitive with the other candidates.And he is acting on his own; while other candidates such as Jeb Bush and Senator Marco Rubio are supported by \u201csuper PACs\u201d advertising on their behalf, Mr. Trump has scorned help from outside groups after controversy surrounded a super PAC with ties to his campaign.  He reserved more than $1 million worth of air time in Iowa, with roughly $750,000 placed across seven broadcast markets and an additional $310,000 on 10 cable networks across the state. In New Hampshire, Mr. Trump has reserved about $550,000 worth of air time on broadcast television, with the majority in the Boston market. Additionally, he reserved more than $300,000 on cable in New Hampshire, across more than 10 networks. And he is currently in the process of reserving more radio ads in the state as well. Cable spending tends to be more targeted than broadcast spots and requires a level of sophistication. Dave Neal, the main strategist with Strategic Media Services, which placed Mr. Trump\u2019s spending, has been described by colleagues as a veteran of political niche buying. Mr. Trump\u2019s team appears to be buying week to week. He has placed ads on Fox News, the obvious target for his main audience, but also on ESPN, the Food Network and the History Channel.Either way, he faced skepticism about whether he would devote significant financial resources to advertising, and the $2 million in airtime buys could dispel those doubts for now. He said in an interview on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday that he felt \u201calmost guilty\u201d about how little had spent so far. According to the most recently available filings, as of the end of September, Mr. Trump had lent his campaign roughly $2 million, but it took in $4 million in donations. Political ads serve as repetitive reinforcement of a campaign\u2019s message. And for all the focus on Mr. Trump\u2019s free time on cable television, it isn\u2019t the same as a controlled, 30-second spot delivered into people\u2019s homes. \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

The day after her speech, she made clear that she was referring to Mr. Trump, who is leading most polls of Republicans both nationally and in early primary states.Mr. Trump is popular with many voters who align themselves with the Tea Party and Ms. Haley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slight was seen as an affront to a group that helped her get elected in 2010.Marlajean Hamby, of Pawleys Island, said that Ms. Haley had become \u00e2\u0080\u009ctotally establishment\u00e2\u0080\u009d and had forgotten the voters who had put her in office.\u00e2\u0080\u009cOur governor used the Tea Party to get elected, and now she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to endorse Rubio or Bush,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Hamby said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe would never get elected here again.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMs. Haley, who is in her second term as governor, said last week that she was open to discussing the possibility of joining a ticket as a vice-presidential nominee.

And for even the longest-legged among us, some puddles are too wide to be jumped successfully.Especially in a large pile of nasty snow-dirt, you wouldn\u2019t want to ruin your Sunday (or Wednesday) best.But most snow boots, even attractive ones, don\u2019t exactly go with a power suit.So we headed to Chelsea yesterday, where we discussed how to best adapt to the current conditions with some stylish New Yorkers.Joe Brownell took a shoes-in-hand approach for a job interview.

So is he still a \u00e2\u0080\u009cnatural-born citizen\u00e2\u0080\u009d and therefore eligible to be president?When questions arose in 2008 about whether Senator John McCain was a \u201cnatural born citizen\u201d qualified to be president because he was born in the Panama Canal Zone, where his father was stationed, his Senate colleagues were outraged. They bristled at the very thought that there could be any doubt whatsoever that the respected Republican lawmaker and war hero from Arizona was eligible under the Constitution.Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, was so worked up at the idea that on the day The New York Times published the article examining the issue, she arrived at the Capitol with corrective legislation written in longhand on a yellow legal pad. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn America, so many parents say to their young children, \u2018If you work hard and you play by the rules, in America someday you can be president of the United States,\u2019 \u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. McCaskill said at the time. \u201cOur brave and respected military should never have to spend a minute worrying whether or not that saying is true for their child.\u201dThe Senate passed a nonbinding resolution declaring that \u201cJohn Sidney McCain, III, is a \u00e2\u0080\u0098natural born citizen\u00e2\u0080\u0099 under Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution of the United States.\u201dWhether that bipartisan resolution would have carried the day legally was never tested, and Mr. McCain lost the presidency to Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, who was a co-sponsor of the McCain resolution. The natural born citizen issue is back as Donald J. Trump raises questions about Senator Ted Cruz, who has overtaken Mr. Trump in several polls in Iowa and who was born in Canada, though his mother was a United States citizen. The 2008 Senate resolution was specific to Mr. McCain, and his status as the offspring of a member of the military serving abroad. Now the question is, will the Senate again weigh in to clarify the constitutional status of another one of its members and declare Mr. Cruz eligible to be president? Somehow, given Mr. Cruz\u2019s strained relations with those on both sides of the aisle, it seems unlikely. For most of them, assisting Mr. Cruz would amount to a foreign concept.Mr. Trump raised questions about whether Ted Cruz was eligible to be president because he was born in Canada.

{"Headline": "Why Is It So Difficult for Syrian Refugees to Get Into the U.S.?", "Date": "2016-01-20", "News": "FeatureOf the 4.5 million people who have fled the Syrian war, only 2,647 have been taken in by the United States.Supported by\u2018\u2018We didn\u2019t expect it to be so expensive,\u2019\u2019 he said of life in Aurora, an industrial river town 41 miles from Chicago, where the al-Haj Alis arrived in March. \u2018\u2018What can we do?\u2019\u2019 The federal government and the nine nongovernmental agencies that help to relocate refugees in the United States select cities like Aurora because housing and jobs are readily available and the cost of living is relatively low. The al-Haj Alis also receive help with the rent from a local organization, the Syrian Community Network. Still, it isn\u2019t enough. Mahmoud and his wife, Azizeh, had been counting on their son Waseem, who is 27 and trained as a psychologist, to help support the family. His wife, Noorhan, and their two young sons were supposed to be in Aurora, too. But, at the last minute, something went wrong with their application to resettle in America. Now they were stuck in Jordan.Mahmoud flipped through the spiral notebook in which he calculates monthly expenses: Internet, $52; garbage collection, $40; rent, $1,125; repayments on the United States government loan for the plane tickets from Amman to America, $172. Mahmoud went into his and Azizeh\u2019s bedroom and found the bill for the family\u2019s airfare: $6,130. \u2018\u2018Since I used to own a business, I like to record everything,\u2019\u2019 he said.Most nights, Mahmoud works at the warehouse until 11 before returning home with Sham. The al-Haj Alis\u2019 sons Ahmad and Mohamed arrive home around then, too, from six-hour after-school shifts at a local supermarket. Although they\u2019re twins, the boys, 17, dress and act as if they weren\u2019t. Mohamed, curls stiffened with gel, favors a tie. Ahmad, an artist, is often bed-headed and prefers sweatsuits. Every day he tucks a Syrian flag into his waistband before heading to West Aurora High School, despite the occasional trouble the flag invites. At the supermarket, he mans the cash register; he likes to interact with customers, in part to show off the Syrian identity to which he clings. Mohamed, who is shyer and speaks far less about Syria, prefers to herd the stray carts in the parking lot.The al-Haj Ali twins were only 13 at the time. They had nothing to do with the protests. Nor did anyone else in the immediate family. Although they listened to news reports of the Assad government\u2019s ferocious attacks on civilians, they saw little indication, at first, of the violence around them. There was the odd black helicopter in the sky. And once, when Waseem was taking Azizeh to driving school, they watched a group of protesters carrying olive branches stream out of Daraa. Only later did they realize these were people fleeing a massacre by Assad\u2019s forces.The war scattered the al-Haj Alis across the globe. Mahmoud, his wife, the twins and Sham made it to Aurora after a 30-month stay in Amman, Jordan. Two elder daughters, Rasha and Ruba, are in the Netherlands. Rasha arrived with her husband two years ago, and this fall Ruba followed. She and her three boys fled first to Morocco, then to Spain by boat, making their way on foot to an asylum center in the Nether\u00adlands, sharing a single room with two other families. (Ruba would like to bring her sons to America, but now that they are in a safe country, there is little chance of resettlement in the United States.) A third daughter, Rana, recently gave birth in Egypt; her 1-month-old is officially stateless. Another, Fatimah, is in Jordan. Yet the child of greatest concern to the family is their adult son, Waseem.Azizeh wondered if she had brought her sons from Syria only to put them at risk in America, and if Waseem would ever join them now.\u2018\u2018It\u2019s extremely difficult to get into the United States as a refugee \u2014 the odds of winning the Powerball are probably better,\u2019\u2019 says David Miliband, head of the International Rescue Committee, which helps place refugees from 40 countries in American cities. And Syrians are subject to an extra degree of vetting. Although all refugees are screened by the National Counterterrorism Center, the F.B.I., the Defense Department, the State Department and United States Customs and Border Protection, among other intelligence agencies, Syrians must complete what is known as the Enhanced Syrian Review. This is an added screening by caseworkers at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in Washington, which assesses each Syrian case and selects some for processing through the Fraud Detection and National Security Directorate office. This extra step was put in place because of the difficulty of assessing the allegiances of the various rebel groups in Syria\u2019s continuing war \u2014 what Barbara Strack, chief of the Refugee Affairs Division at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, describes as \u2018\u2018the myriad actors and dynamic nature of the conflict.\u2019\u2019Until recently, Syria\u2019s refugees were not a pressing domestic political concern. To many Americans, the war in Syria seemed remote, a problem for Syria\u2019s neighbors. Of greater import were the 11 million immigrants who had entered the United States illegally. Then last summer, images of the Syrian toddler Alan Kurdi lying dead on the Turkish shore mobilized American sympathies in favor of refugees, and the Obama administration found itself faulted for admitting so few. Quietly, President Obama directed Denis McDonough, the White House chief of staff, to work with the State Department to find out why vetting for Syrian refugees required 18 to 24 months.McDonough, known for urging Obama to be cautious in engaging militarily in Syria, took the issue of refugees personally. As a Catholic growing up in Stillwater, Minn., the 10th of 11 children, he worked with his church to help arriving Vietnamese refugees. Now, carrying a stack of charts and graphs, he met with refugee advocates and members of Congress to learn about the pitfalls and procedural bottlenecks within the resettlement program and to study potential means of bringing Syrians more quickly to the United States without compromising on security. In closed-door National Security Council meetings last year, he advised State Department officials to lift bureaucratic hurdles. As a result, the United States has opened up refugee-processing centers in new locations that refugees can actually reach, including one in Erbil, in northern Iraq. By streamlining the process of resettling Syrian refugees, the Obama administration also hoped to demonstrate support for its European allies. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s important to the president\u2019s view to show our allies overseas, who are taking a considerable influx of Syrians, that we support them and we\u2019re doing our part,\u2019\u2019 McDonough told me recently.Paris threatened to change everything. The Syrian passport found near the body of one mili\u00adtant turned out to be a fake, but at least two of the attackers had exploited the refugee routes from the Middle East to Europe. Overnight, the global good will toward refugees that had been building all but vanished. Suddenly, the images of hundreds of thousands of refugees heading north inspired not empathy but alarm. According to the Soufan Group, a New York-based company that provides security-intelligence services, between 27,000 and 31,000 foreign fighters have gone to Iraq or Syria since the start of Syria\u2019s civil war, the vast majority to fight alongside ISIS. At least 10 percent have headed back home. What once seemed like a trickle of vulnerable civilians now looked, to some, like a potentially dangerous flood.In November, Republicans and some Democrats rallied behind House Bill 4038, the American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act, introduced by Representative Michael T. McCaul of Texas to slow the arrival of Syrian and Iraqi refugees in the United States. Days before the House vote, McDonough and Jeh Johnson, secretary of homeland security, briefed members of Congress on the Syrian-refugee-resettlement program and its screening process, in an attempt to reassure them that such a measure was unnecessary. The House nonetheless voted in favor of the bill, and as 2015 drew to a close, the Syrian refugee issue was at risk of becoming part of the year-end omnibus bill amid discussions of a government shutdown.In the face of mounting political opposition, the president, in a choreographed Trudeau-esque gesture at the National Archives in Washington, welcomed 31 people from 25 countries at their citizenship ceremony. In private, McDonough rang up supporters and opponents alike. \u2018\u2018Every phone call I\u2019ve had with my friends on Capitol Hill, Republican and Democrat, and with governors around the country, I\u2019ve underscored that we recognize the fear,\u2019\u2019 McDonough told me. He spoke of the need to \u2018\u2018send a message\u2019\u2019 to \u2018\u2018the Assad regime and to ISIL that the United States will continue to play the role that it has, that the world has become accustomed to it playing \u2014 mainly the role of alleviating suffering at the source and of being a refuge for the most vulnerable people.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018It\u2019s not a zero-sum choice,\u2019\u2019 Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. Blinken, who served as Obama\u2019s national security adviser before returning to the State Department, where he began his career, has been asked by the White House to handle the thorny refugee issue. \u2018\u2018We\u2019re working 36 hours a day to solve the war in Syria,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018but meanwhile, what do you do about the huge immediate challenge of more than four million people displaced from their country?\u2019\u2019For millions of Syrians, Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan have become vast waiting rooms. \u2018\u2018The two biggest drivers of onward migration are lack of access to education and lack of access to work,\u2019\u2019 Blinken told me recently, at the United States Embassy in Amman. The United States frequently trumpets the fact that of the countries donating to the United Nations in support of Syrian refugees, it gives the most aid, much of it going to front-line countries. But this is in part a self-serving strategy. The United States supports Syria\u2019s neighbors so that they can withstand the pressures of millions of additional people. Refugees place a large burden on natural resources and social services. As a result, relations between Syrians and their hosts are souring. (Jordanians, groaning under the burden of 633,000 refugees, joke darkly that they live \u2018\u2018between Iraq and a hard place.\u2019\u2019) Part of American strategy in the region has been to ease tensions between Syrians and their hosts. The United States provides services (schools and hospitals) for the refugees as well as for the citizens of host countries. They also allocate money for development to keep the host country happy. In Jordan, Blinken had just attended a falafel lunch with Jordanian venture capitalists who started a fund, with United States government support, to incubate technology start-ups.Resettlement in the United States, however, remains a political challenge. \u2018\u2018This is where ISIL neatly joins the problem,\u2019\u2019 Blinken said. \u2018\u2018Very few of the refugees we admit are young males without families \u2014 we focus on women, children, the sick and those vulnerable to violence. But you now have this new concern that these refugee populations will somehow be infiltrated by terrorists.\u2019\u2019 In the aftermath of the Paris attacks, European countries hardened their stance on refugees, making illegal migration more difficult by closing borders. (For the first time in 50 years, for instance, those crossing between Denmark and Sweden have to show photo ID.) Turkey is under pressure to do the same. Recently, after receiving promises of $3.25 billion in aid from the E.U., Turkey reportedly arrested 1,300 asylum seekers trying to cross the sea to Greece.The refugees already in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan are more likely to be stuck there, which means that a humanitarian crisis is becoming an economic-development problem. Syrians, many of whom lived sophisticated lives, are often unable to access even the most basic services. \u2018\u2018These are people who had microwaves and cars, and now they\u2019re in tin boxes in the desert,\u2019\u2019 says Jonathan Campbell of the World Food Program. The key factor in their migration is hopelessness. This past fall, the W.F.P. sent text messages to 230,000 Syrians living in Jordan to tell them that their food benefits were going to be substantially reduced because of lack of funding and donor fatigue. (They were later restored.) Although the United States made a large pledge, other countries, facing financial crises at home, did not. As a result, 64 percent of the refugees told the W.F.P. they were going to be forced to leave the country. One family out of every four took a child out of school to work. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s not a pull factor that makes them move, it\u2019s a push factor,\u2019\u2019 says Myriam Baele, head of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees\u2019 refugee-resettlement unit in Jordan. \u2018\u2018If there isn\u2019t a means to survive here, they will go,\u2019\u2019 she went on. \u2018\u2018Either to Europe or back to Syria, where they will die.\u2019\u2019Early last spring in Amman, when the al-Haj Alis were all still together, Waseem, Noorhan and their sons, who are 4 and 2, cleared the Enhanced Syrian Review and completed four days of cul\u00adtural-orientation classes \u2014 which include everything from pictures of what to pack (warm clothing and money) and what not to (weapons and illegal drugs) to the importance Americans place on such concepts as punctuality and pri\u00advacy. These courses are offered only to those who are in the process of resettling in the United States. Noorhan, who had been studying in Syria to become a teacher and whose dark eyes glitter with an easy intelligence, paid special attention to the weather. \u2018\u2018Arizona is like the gulf,\u2019\u2019 she recalled learning. \u2018\u2018Hot, dry and full of snakes.\u2019\u2019Ten days before Waseem and his family were scheduled to leave, they had completed everything but their medical exams. Then they received a call from the Americans: They couldn\u2019t go just yet. Something had come up in their security clearance, Waseem recalled being told. In retrospect, Waseem\u2019s parents wonder if they should have waited for him. The plan had always been for Waseem to support the family: Azizeh had three ruptured disks and needed back surgery; Mahmoud had an old leg injury. But if the al-Haj Alis had delayed and lost their place in line, they might never have gotten to America. Waseem now feels guilty that he encouraged them to go ahead. He wasn\u2019t sure his parents could make it without him. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m trying to be patient for my parents,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018If it weren\u2019t for them, I would\u2019ve already left.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018If we don\u2019t get a call from the Americans before smuggling season begins in the spring, we\u2019ll leave for Europe,\u2019\u2019 he went on. The last thing he and his wife wanted to do was take two toddlers over the sea. Like everyone else, they had seen the photos of Alan on the beach. Their children couldn\u2019t swim, and neither could Noorhan. But what choice did they have?\u2018\u2018We think only about traveling,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018All we want is to go the United States.\u2019\u2019 Day after day, he checked the news on Facebook and chatted with his mother in Aurora. \u2018\u2018We hope to live in a simple house, with a car outside, and just to watch our kids grow up,\u2019\u2019 Noorhan said. \u2018\u2018That\u2019s it. We don\u2019t want a palace or some luxury life.\u2019\u2019When the rest of his family left in March, Waseem thought he would have to wait for about a month at the most. One month was now eight. As it grew colder, he stopped walking along the highway looking for illegal construction jobs. The market for day laborers was drying up. He didn\u2019t dare ask for work in the strip of neon-lit shawarma stands downtown, even though many were staffed by fellow refu\u00adgees. If he was caught working, Waseem could be imprisoned, transferred to the refugee camps, where only the poorest of the poor live, or sent back to Syria. Still, he had to find a way to pay the $247 rent on the apartment he once shared with his parents. He and Noorhan relied increasingly on whatever Mahmoud could send back from America. Instead of helping to support his parents, he was taking from them. \u2018\u2018My father used to be a wealthy man,\u2019\u2019 Waseem said, recalling Mahmoud\u2019s locksmith business in Abu Dhabi. Once the war began, Mahmoud sold the business for $120,000. For nearly five years, that money supported more than a dozen family members in five different countries. Now the money was gone.Among Syrian refugees, \u2018\u2018on hold\u2019\u2019 is the most dreaded category. It is extremely difficult to get clear answers about why the hold has been applied or when it will be lifted. To try to learn more, Waseem designated The New York Times as a third party with the legal right to inquire about his case. In response to an email from The Times in November, the International Organization for Migration would say only that Waseem\u2019s case \u2018\u2018is currently on hold pending further review by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\u2019\u2019Officials cannot comment on individual cases, but when briefed on the case as a hypothetical, immigration officers and resettlement experts offered several possible explanations: It could be as simple as an applicant\u2019s security clearance having expired while a family member waited to be vetted. Or maybe Waseem\u2019s name sounds like a name on a terrorist watch-list. Or maybe, at the very last minute, \u2018\u2018recurrent vetting\u2019\u2019 raised a red flag. Recurrent vetting, which began in 2015, checks names through a series of databases right up to when the flight lands in the United States. As a senior intelligence officer with the National Counterterrorism Center described it: \u2018\u2018If you have an 800 credit score and you\u2019re good for a new Visa card, and two weeks from now they find out that, hey, two years ago, you changed your name to cover up a prior bankruptcy, then they can take away that card.\u2019\u2019Or maybe it was Azizeh\u2019s brother. As a former military member of the Assad regime, he might still count as a black mark. Even though he defected early on, he could, by some bureaucratic oversight, still be designated a security risk to the United States. When reached in Qatar this fall, via Skype, he expressed relief that all of his family had made it out of Syria alive. He, too, was searching for a new country. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m not looking for beauty or history,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m looking for a country with human rights and freedom.\u2019\u2019 Other family members described specific questions regarding Azizeh\u2019s brother posed to them by American immigration officers in Jordan. For example, did they serve him coffee or tea when he was in their homes? This was most likely a question to determine whether the family had provided material support \u2014 which could include a cup of coffee, a glass of water, a ride \u2014 to someone designated to be an enemy of the United States.Resettling refugees isn\u2019t a perfect process. \u2018\u2018No immigration program is completely without risk,\u2019\u2019 a senior intelligence officer says. Yet over more than a decade, the United States agencies involved in the program have learned to communicate more effectively. \u2018\u2018We got a lot smarter and developed additional relationships with the intelligence community beginning with the large-scale Iraqi processing in 2007,\u2019\u2019 Strack, of U.S.C.I.S., says. She adds, \u2018\u2018We are the opposite of stove-piped \u2014 we\u2019re incredibly networked.\u2019\u2019One common misconception about how a Syrian refugee comes to America is that she simply approaches the United States Embassy in Jordan or Turkey or wherever she first lands. This is not how resettlement works. To be legally designated a refugee, she must first apply to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. U.N.H.C.R. takes a photograph and scans her iris. Verification can take anywhere from a couple of months to a few years before she\u2019s interviewed in person. Although these interviews aren\u2019t considered security vetting, caseworkers are trained to eliminate those who may be lying, as well as those who have persecuted others or may be war criminals.In addition to collecting biometric data like iris scans and photographs, U.N.H.C.R. case officers are trained in basic facial recognition and have 2-D screening capabilities to detect fake passports. The goal is to make sure people meet the criteria of the refugee convention, established after World War II. They\u2019re also experts in country-of-origin information. \u2018\u2018Listen, I know where your school is, I know the colors of its walls,\u2019\u2019 one U.N.H.C.R. officer says. \u2018\u2018We detect lies based on what\u2019s happened in the country of origin. It\u2019s not just hour-by-hour events; it\u2019s ethnicity, region, family. We know the custom \u2014 we know what their dresses look like.\u2019\u2019U.N.H.C.R. then advocates for the most vulnerable 10 percent; the other 90 percent will have to make a new life as best they can. Of the 20 million refugees worldwide, less than 1 percent will be officially resettled, and of those, the United States takes about half. Resettlement is only one of three options. The others are returning home (which, for most Syrians, is impossible) or remaining in the host country (which, given the pressures Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon are under, is becoming increasingly difficult). Those either barred or \u2018\u2018deprioritized\u2019\u2019 include individuals with certain military ties, as well as families with missing members. This is to guard against the possibility that the missing member may be fighting alongside an anti-American group like ISIS and later try to rejoin his family.Syrians, like other refugees, don\u2019t choose the country they end up in. U.N.H.C.R. selects the best option based on various criteria specified by host countries, like those from the most vulnerable groups or victims of torture. But there are limits to the requests countries can make. \u2018\u2018We\u2019re not a labor department,\u2019\u2019 a senior U.N.H.C.R. official said. \u2018\u2018If countries come to us asking for a particular religion, we don\u2019t encourage that.\u2019\u2019All of this takes place before U.N.H.C.R. refers the case to any one country. Once U.N.H.C.R. provides a complete file to the United States, then the applicant\u2019s entire family visits the State Department\u2019s Resettlement Support Center for a prescreening interview. At this point, each individual is run through several databases, including ones at the Department of Homeland Security, the National Counterterrorism Center, the F.B.I. and the Department of Defense, and entered into the Worldwide Refugee Admissions Processing System, which warehouses the data and facilitates interagency screening checks. A pilot program will soon include iris scans, which are currently used by U.N.H.C.R. only for identification, not security purposes.This fall, in several closed-door classified briefings before Congress and in public hearings, Anne C. Richard, the assistant secretary of state for population, refugees and migration, defended the rigorous vetting process. Of the more than 784,000 refugees who have been admitted to the United States in the last 14 years, five have been arrested on terrorism-related charges: One was an Uzbek man arrested in Idaho; the other four were refugees from Iraq. Such mistakes have provided fodder for those who worry that the country is exposing itself to needless risk. \u2018\u2018ISIS has vowed to send its operatives into the West posing as refugees,\u2019\u2019 says McCaul, chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. \u2018\u2018The threat is real.\u2019\u2019 Advocates say that the threat of a refugee being a terrorist is statistically negligible. \u2018\u2018We don\u2019t leave holes, and we don\u2019t take chances,\u2019\u2019 Richard told me. \u2018\u2018If there\u2019s any doubt about someone, they don\u2019t come.\u2019\u2019 Indeed, as Le\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez, director of U.S.C.I.S., recently testified in Congress, the United States has barred 30 individuals from entering \u2018\u2018based on their showing up in the databases.\u2019\u2019 (When queried, a senior intelligence official would say only that there were individuals of \u2018\u2018national security concern.\u2019\u2019) Emily Gray, the executive director in Aurora of World Relief, a branch of the agency assigned by the United States government to help resettle the al-Haj Ali family, says, \u2018\u2018You\u2019d have to be a really stupid terrorist to come this way.\u2019\u2019After the U.S.C.I.S. officers in Washington conduct the enhanced review, the entire family is scheduled for another interview with a member of the Refugee Affairs Division, a team of 10 to 14 immigration officers from U.S.C.I.S. who spend six weeks on \u2018\u2018circuit rides\u2019\u2019 \u2014 traveling up to four times a year to Turkey, Egypt, Jordan and other locations in the region, interviewing refugees being considered for resettlement in the United States.\u2018\u2018Just having an interview doesn\u2019t sound so secure, but this is one heck of an interview,\u2019\u2019 Richard says. \u2018\u2018First off, refugees are people fleeing tyrannical governments, so they may not trust people in positions of authority. They may be used to lying. They have to be prepared to have this interview, and if they\u2019re caught lying, then they\u2019re not going to make it, no matter how worthy.\u2019\u2019 At the end of this process, there are four possible outcomes: immediate acceptance, which is rare and can still involve waiting another 18 months, especially if there is a new marriage or birth; acceptance pending verification; denial; and the limbo into which Waseem al-Haj Ali and his family have now fallen, \u2018\u2018on hold.\u2019\u2019From Jordan, one afternoon late this fall, Waseem called his mother in Chicago. \u2018\u2018How are you?\u2019\u2019 he asked. He hadn\u2019t anticipated her reply. She was fine, thank God, she said, but there was something wrong at the twins\u2019 school. The night before, she received a call from the school saying there would be police there the next day and it was fine if the boys stayed home. She wasn\u2019t sure what that meant or if other Syrians had received the same call. Azizeh sent the boys anyway. They survived airstrikes and house-to-house raids by Assad\u2019s security forces; they could face American high school. \u2018\u2018Oh,\u2019\u2019 Waseem said, and hung up. He and Noorhan were taken aback. What if, after all they had endured, his parents or Sham or the twins were hurt in America? Waseem was the one who was supposed to protect them, and all he could do was sit on the couch in Amman and accept handouts from his father.\u2018\u2018The worst thing is this game of waiting,\u2019\u2019 Issam Smeir, a psychologist in Aurora with World Relief who has counseled the al-Haj Alis, says. \u2018\u2018It kills your soul.\u2019\u2019The issue was immigration, not Islam, Murphy said. The school district models diversity remarkably; the twins were enrolled alongside Iraqis, Nepalis, Bangladeshis and immigrants from 57 countries in a curriculum for students learning English. Ahmad and Mohamed grumbled about it; these kids were uncool, and they only saw regular Americans during gym class.Outside school, the opposition to Syrian refugees wore on: In nearby Indiana, a Syrian family had to be rerouted to Connecticut because of the governor\u2019s opposition. In an attempt to block the arrival of another Syrian family, Texas sued the International Rescue Committee, the resettlement agency working with that family, as well as the federal government.In Congress, as the year drew to a close, House Bill 4038, which would have barred Syr\u00adian refugees, at least for a time, never came to the floor of the Senate, nor was it part of the omnibus \u2014 a pair of victories for McDonough and the White House. Instead, the mass shooting in San Bernardino refocused national security concerns on the visa-waiver program, which the administration had long seen as a problem.In January 2016, even as rising tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia, key players in the war in Syria, imperiled upcoming cease-fire negotiations at the U.N. The Senate stood poised to consider new legislation that would halt the arrival of Syrian refugees. \u2018\u2018We cannot stand by while jihadists try to exploit humanitarian programs to reach our shores undetected,\u2019\u2019 Michael McCaul, who sponsored 4038, said, citing serious screening gaps. Senator Mark Kirk, a Republican from Illinois, who recently introduced a similar bill in the Senate, also supports such legislation. \u2018\u2018Reputable media outlets are uncovering examples of how terrorists infiltrate the Iraq and Syria refugee programs in an effort to commit acts of violence against the American people and our allies,\u2019\u2019 Kirk said. \u2018\u2018Common sense requires thoughtful measures to keep Americans safe.\u2019\u2019She also worried about herself and Sham. The long coats and hijabs they wore when they went out might attract the wrong kind of attention. Sham had come to America at the worst age possible. At 19, she wasn\u2019t eligible to attend high school, and her English was too poor to pursue her dreams of becoming a lawyer. \u2018\u2018That\u2019s too expensive,\u2019\u2019 Sham said. \u2018\u2018It would take too many years.\u2019\u2019To secure a future for her, her parents had accepted the marriage proposal of an Iraqi used-car salesman named Layth Alali, Azizeh told me. Fifteen years older than Sham, Alali came to the country on a much-coveted Special Immigrant Visa in 2010, as part of the group of Iraqis who had worked with the United States military. (In Baghdad, he was the head of a checkpoint set up by the Americans.) The whole thing was rushed; he had asked just two weeks earlier, and the engagement ceremony was taking place immediately.After picking Sham and Azizeh up in a BMW S.U.V., Alali drove them to a prom-dress shop in Aurora, and they had less than an hour to find a dress. Sham picked out a spangled strapless confection, but Azizeh worried it exposed too much flesh. \u2018\u2018Problem, problem, problem,\u2019\u2019 she said, pointing to her daughter\u2019s bare neck, arms and shoulders. In the end, she snapped a picture and sent it via WhatsApp to her daughter-in-law, Noorhan, who was, as usual, sitting idle in the apartment in Jordan. A few seconds later, Noorhan sent back a smiley-face emoji with hearts for eyes. The dress, however flawed, was a yes.In a life marked by disappointment and compromise, Azizeh remarked, what did the dress really matter? As a married woman, Sham would be more secure, and so would her family. At least, Azizeh said, Sham would no longer have to work in the office-supply warehouse.The family had other concerns. The boys needed hundreds of dollars of dental work that Medicaid didn\u2019t cover. The al-Haj Alis were struggling to make the rent, and winter was coming, which meant a new bill for heating. Azizeh was trying to figure out what kind of program might help pay the gas bill. As the temperature dropped and it grew dark at 4:30 in the afternoon, Ahmad and Mohamed seemed to be slowing down; Azizeh had to prod them off the couch to get them to work at the market.School was still a challenge. After nearly a year, neither spoke enough English to hold a conversation. Unlike their fellow refugees, who learned English by watching television and American movies, the boys preferred to spend their downtime watching Arabic-language news about Syria or YouTube videos from home.For a long time, when they looked on Google Earth, they could see the debris of their family\u2019s homes, which had been either burned or bombed. Now a mysterious white film obscured satellite images of the town. Was it a glitch, or a security measure on the part of the Assad regime to protect this strategic town, which now serves as a military base?If Ahmad and Mohamed had stayed in Syria, they might be dead by now \u2014 either killed by the Assad government\u2019s barrel bombs or fallen among the young men who have joined up with the Free Syrian Army. When one of their friends or cousins fighting with the F.S.A. is killed, the boys study the photographs of his death, often posted on Facebook in tribute, with a mixture of envy and guilt.Issam Smeir, the World Relief counselor, met with the al-Haj Ali family to help them handle the psychological stress of Waseem\u2019s unexpected absence. He was watching for signs of depression in the boys. \u2018\u2018Depression in kids doesn\u2019t look like sadness,\u2019\u2019 Smeir said. \u2018\u2018It looks like restlessness and anger.\u2019\u2019 The biggest argument that Ahmad has had at school involved fellow Syrians who support the Assad regime. The two sides got into a fight over which flag was the true Syrian flag \u2014 the one belonging to the Assad regime, or the revolutionary flag that Ahmad tucks into his waistband.Three days later, a text came in from Noorhan. More American politicians were opposing Syrians, and what she and Waseem had been reading on Facebook made them think the United States was shutting its borders tighter than ever. It looked as if they were going to have to take their boys over the sea. \u2018\u2018After all the news,\u2019\u2019 she wrote, \u2018\u2018we have no hope to travel to America.\u2019\u2019An article on Jan. 24 about Syrian refugees and United States policy referred incorrectly to the type of visa with which one of the San Bernardino attackers legally entered the United States. It was a K-1 fianc\u00e9e visa; the attacker did not enter through the visa-waiver program.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Building a Network for Virtual Reality", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "MENLO PARK, Calif. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 When Facebook releases its fourth-quarter earnings results on Wednesday, it is likely to announce it shows well over eight billion videos a day. It is certainly a big number, but video is most likely a means to an end for Facebook.Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, says he believes virtual reality will become a widespread computing platform that includes communications, artificial intelligence and voice-activated interactions. He bought Oculus Rift, the maker of virtual reality goggles, for $2 billion to capitalize on that potential.Video is a building block toward that virtual reality work.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a shift happening in the business,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jay Parikh, vice president of engineering. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFacebook started with text, then photos showed up. Now there are phones always with you with good cameras. People can capture more of their lives in a real times way, much more expressively than a photo and a caption.\u00e2\u0080\u009dPresumably, these immersive videos will also hold the attention of high-value advertisers.Building out a network that can handle this load of dense video costs billions of dollars, however. And that is before running a big virtual reality system.But Mr. Zuckerberg faced a similar challenge when he built Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s global computer network and is now following a similar playbook.Facebook is adept at open sourcing, or donating for public use, technologies like computer hardware. Much the way open-source software sped development of so-called cloud computing, open-source hardware meant more engineers tackling problems like computer server design.It is now video\u00e2\u0080\u0099s turn. Last Thursday, Facebook held at its headquarters an all-day event for about 300 engineers from video-related companies like Netflix, Yahoo, Akamai and even YouTube. Facebook talked about technologies in virtual reality, streaming and artificial intelligence related to video.\u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom our experience, innovation happens faster in the open,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Parikh said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEverything we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing in video, live-streaming, 360, all the technology we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing in our network, our data centers \u2014 that is all heading towards having these experiences in virtual reality.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFacebook is also looking at ways to make its 360 technology cheaper and more accessible, possibly even within a smartphone. Mr. Parikh declined to comment on these moves.Facebook also wants to get an even bigger global audience by lowering the cost of connecting to the Internet. While computers run lots of open source hardware and software, related gear in telecommunications has tended to be proprietary and expensive.On Wednesday, the Open Compute Project, the hardware design sharing group, announced it would move into open sourcing telecommunications gear. AT&T, Verizon and Deutsche Telekom were among the companies signing up.\u00e2\u0080\u009cA lot of Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story going forward will be making hardware and software work together with greater efficiency,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jason Taylor, who is Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vice president of infrastructure and the president of the Open Compute Project. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not interested in being a telecom operator, but in our mission to connect the world we need everyone to come together.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFollowAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Charged Blend of Law and Politics in a Texas Planned Parenthood Case", "Date": "2016-01-26", "News": "Supported byTexas Republican leaders issued defiant statements in response to the Houston indictment, vowing to continue the state\u2019s investigation into the videos recorded in Houston in April at Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast. But Ms. Anderson has a far tougher role to play. She took the case to the grand jurors, presented them with evidence from a monthslong investigation and appeared to have allowed them to come to their own conclusions, however politically unpalatable it may have turned out for conservatives. The grand jury cleared Planned Parenthood of any wrongdoing.\u201cI respect their decision on this difficult case,\u201d Ms. Anderson said of the grand jury in a statement. A spokesman for Ms. Anderson said Tuesday that she was not commenting on the case beyond the statement.In such an environment, Ms. Anderson\u2019s handling of the case won her praise from Houston lawyers and elected officials on both sides of the aisle.Ms. Anderson was asked by one of the most powerful Republican elected officials in Texas, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, to open a criminal investigation into Planned Parenthood in August after the release of an undercover video made in Houston purporting to show Planned Parenthood officials trying to illegally profit from the sale of fetal tissue.Ms. Anderson agreed, although some Democrats raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest. In a Facebook posting in 2014, Ms. Anderson wrote of receiving an endorsement from an anti-abortion group.\u201cAs a proud, pro-life Texan and mother of two, I am honored to be endorsed by Texas Right to Life PAC,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI will always take a stand for those who cannot yet defend themselves.\u201dKim Ogg, a Houston lawyer and former prosecutor who was Ms. Anderson\u2019s Democratic opponent in 2014, said it was impossible to know, because of the secrecy of grand juries, how Ms. Anderson handled the case.\u201cI\u2019m not dinging her or giving her credit,\u201d Ms. Ogg said. \u201cI\u2019m saying the grand jury in this instance did its job.\u201dThe indicted abortion opponents, David R. Daleiden, 27, and Sandra S. Merritt, 62, were charged with making and presenting fake ID cards with the intent to defraud for their meeting at Planned Parenthood in Houston. The IDs resembled California driver\u2019s licenses, and included their real photographs but fake names and addresses, and many of the same markings and data on a real license.Mr. Daleiden and Ms. Merritt each face a charge of tampering with a governmental record, a felony in this case. Mr. Daleiden was indicted on an additional misdemeanor charge related to purchasing human organs, a charge that appeared to be tied to an email he sent Planned Parenthood offering to buy fetal tissue for $1,600 per sample. Arrest warrants have been issued for Mr. Daleiden and Ms. Merritt.Josh Schaffer, a Houston lawyer who represents Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, said he was skeptical when Ms. Anderson began her investigation that it would be fair in \u201cthe toxic political landscape in Texas regarding Planned Parenthood.\u201d But he said that she assembled a team that included impartial prosecutors and Texas Rangers, and exhibited courage and independence.\u201cWe should all hope that her fortitude in the eye of this political storm is a harbinger of her intent to conduct business the right way, instead of being a political pawn for politicians,\u201d Mr. Schaffer said.Shortly after announcing the criminal investigation in August, Ms. Anderson said that one of her assistant district attorneys disclosed that she was a member of Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast\u2019s board of directors. Ms. Anderson said the prosecutor would not be involved in the investigation, and said she would consider having an independent prosecutor take over the case if any information came to light suggesting the prosecutor\u2019s board membership compromised the investigation.Ms. Anderson has been carrying on the legacy of her husband, Mike Anderson. Mr. Anderson was elected district attorney in November 2012 but he died 10 months later in August 2013 from cancer. Mr. Perry, the governor at the time, appointed Ms. Anderson to succeed her husband, and she was later elected in 2014.Ms. Anderson, who grew up in Waco, has been known as a tough, focused prosecutor. She personally handled the first court appearance of Shannon J. Miles, the man charged with murdering the sheriff\u2019s deputy, Darren H. Goforth, in August.She spent more than a decade in the district attorney\u2019s office, including five years as chief felony prosecutor, and later served as a state judge in a criminal district court, presiding over 50 jury trials a year. She left the bench and became a criminal defense lawyer in private practice, but eventually left her practice in 2012 after her husband\u2019s election.Advertisement"}

In the case of Electrolux, its Webster City washing machine factory was replaced by a new plant in Juarez, Mexico, conveniently at the Texas border.Mr. Hoffman arrived in Webster City a few months after the plant closed. He spent time getting to know people and hung out whenever he could between campaign assignments. He \u00e2\u0080\u009csort of adopted\u00e2\u0080\u009d Webster City, he said.

Many of the people he met in Webster City have known each other their whole lives and have very close connections to their hometown and their friends.Some people in Webster City have taken advantage of training and found new jobs after the factory left town, but he said many were in lower-paying jobs or unemployed. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cglobal\u00e2\u0080\u009d economy is more than just a political buzzword for them.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like death by a thousand cuts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Hoffman said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe town has not shriveled up, which is amazing.

Fox Business Network said that it used 17 polls to determine its final lineup. Being left off the main stage is a huge blow for Mr. Paul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign. Once seen as the rising star in the Republican Party, Mr. Paul has struggled in the polls as his noninterventionist stance on foreign policy became a liability after the terrorist attacks in Paris in November.

Iran released five American prisoners, including a reporter for The Washington Post, in exchange for the release of seven Iranians.Republicans were quick to portray the exchange as a sign of weakness, a sentiment they continued to express Sunday in television interviews, while the Democratic candidates took a tone of cautious optimism about the developments.Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, appearing on CBS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cFace the Nation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said that the freed Americans were not prisoners, saying they had violated no laws and instead were being held as \u00e2\u0080\u009chostages.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He also expressed concern that the exchange created a bad precedent.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe President has pardoned them in exchange for a release of hostages,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt proves once again that now nations and enemies of America around the world know there\u2019s a price for Americans.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Rubio also criticized the way Iran had handled an incident involving American sailors whose boats had drifted into Iranian territorial waters in the Persian Gulf, leading to the crafts\u2019 seizure by Iran.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not our allies,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Rubio said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not our friends.\u00e2\u0080\u009dOn the same program, Gov.

{"Headline": "The Age of Protest", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported byWe sure are. This week alone Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany faced huge protests after her justice minister declared that Arab immigrants \u2014 let in under Merkel\u2019s liberal refugee policy \u2014 were largely responsible for the mass sexual assaults on women in Cologne on New Year\u2019s Eve and used social networks to coordinate their attacks. President Obama actually cried \u2014 that was his unique protest \u2014 while trying to channel his outrage, and many other people\u2019s, into fixing our nation\u2019s crazy gun laws.In my view, this age of protest is driven, in part, by the fact that the three largest forces on the planet \u2014 globalization, Moore\u2019s law and Mother Nature \u2014 are all in acceleration, creating an engine of disruption that is stressing strong countries and middle classes and blowing up weak ones, while superempowering individuals and transforming the nature of work, leadership and government all at once.When you get that much agitation in a world where everyone with a smartphone is now a reporter, news photographer and documentary filmmaker, it\u2019s a wonder that every newspaper doesn\u2019t have a \u201cProtest\u201d section.\u201cPeople everywhere seem to be morally aroused,\u201d said Seidman. \u201cThe philosopher David Hume argued that \u2018the moral imagination diminishes with distance.\u2019 It would follow that the opposite is also true: As distance decreases, the moral imagination increases. Now that we have no distance \u2014 it\u2019s like we\u2019re all in a crowded theater, making everything personal \u2014 we are experiencing the aspirations, hopes, frustrations, plights of others in direct and visceral ways.\u201dIndeed, we\u2019re being intimately exposed to footage of outrageous police brutality, terrorism victims jumping from the windows of a Paris theater and racially biased/sexist corporate emails revealed by hackers. Who wouldn\u2019t be aroused?\u201cThink about this,\u201d said Seidman: \u201cA dentist from Minnesota shoots a cherished lion in Zimbabwe named Cecil, and days later everyone in the world knows about it, triggering a tsunami of moral outrage on Twitter and Facebook. As a result, some people try to shut down his dental practice by posting negative reviews on Yelp and spray paint \u2018Lion Killer\u2019 on his Florida vacation home. Almost 400,000 people then sign a petition in one day on Change.org demanding that Delta Air Lines change their policy of transporting trophy kills. Delta does so and other airlines follow. And then hunters who contribute to Zimbabwe\u2019s tourism industry protest the protest, claiming that they were being discriminated against.\u201dThat we are becoming more morally aroused \u201cis generally a good thing,\u201d argued Seidman. Institutionalized racism in police departments, or in college fraternities, is real and had been tolerated for way too long. That it\u2019s being called out is a sign of a society\u2019s health \u201cand re-engagement.\u201dBut when moral arousal manifests as moral outrage, he added, \u201cit can either inspire or repress a serious conversation or the truth.\u201d There is surely a connection between the explosion of political correctness on college campuses \u2014 including Yale students demanding the resignation of an administrator whose wife defended free speech norms that might make some students uncomfortable \u2014 and the ovations Donald Trump is getting for being crudely politically incorrect.\u201cIf moral outrage, as justified as it may be, is followed immediately by demands for firings or resignations,\u201d argued Seidman, \u201cit can result in a vicious cycle of moral outrage being met with equal outrage, as opposed to a virtuous cycle of dialogue and the hard work of forging real understanding and enduring agreements.\u201dFurthermore, \u201cwhen moral outrage skips over moral conversation, then the outcome is likely going to be acquiescence, not inspired solutions,\u201d Seidman added. It can also feed the current epidemic of inauthentic apologies, \u201csince apologies extracted under pressure are like telling a child, `Just say you\u2019re sorry,\u2019 to move past the issue without ever making amends.\u201dWith all of this moral arousal, it\u2019s as if \u201cwe\u2019re living in a never-ending storm,\u201d he said. Alas, though, resolving moral disputes \u201crequires perspective, fuller context and the ability to make meaningful distinctions.\u201dThat requires leaders with the courage and empathy \u201cto inspire people to pause to reflect, so that instead of reacting by yelling in 140 characters they can channel all this moral outrage into deep and honest conversations.\u201d If we can do that \u2014 a big if \u2014 Seidman concluded, \u201cwe can be truly great again because we\u2019ll be back on our journey towards a more perfect union.\u201dFrank Bruni is off today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Founders Fund Leads a Financing Round for Nubank, a Brazilian Start-Up", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The billionaire and prominent Silicon Valley financier Peter Thiel has returned to investing in Brazil, even as the country remains mired in recession and faces almost weekly political upheavals.A Nubank spokeswoman, Mariana Netto, responded to an email inquiry seeking information on the new financing and a request for an interview with a company executive by saying, \u201cAt the moment, we do not have any information.\u201dThe new investment values Nubank at approximately $500 million, according to two individuals, significant for a company less than three years old.The Founders Fund backing of Nubank appears to be its first investment in Brazil and South America, at least based on disclosed and known investments. The firm, just over 10 years old, raised its first fund back in 2005.On the surface, backing Nubank may seem to be a counterintuitive move as many institutional investors have fled Latin America\u2019s largest economy in recent years, and its gross domestic product has decreased for three straight quarters.Mr. Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook, has a reputation for going against the grain. But Founders Funds notes on its website that being contrarian \u201cdoes not mean simply doing the opposite of what the majority does.\u201d Rather, the company says, \u201cThe most contrarian thing to do is to think independently.\u201d Taking on Brazil\u2019s financial establishment is certainly that.They have been neither vulnerable to the moribund economy the rest of the country has grappled with over the last several years nor the policies enacted by leftist governments that have led the country since 2003. That is partly because Brazil has long had extremely high interest rates. Its current benchmark Selic rate stands at 14.25 percent.The current deepening recession and rising inflation are increasing pressure on the Central Bank to raise the rate even further. While the Central Bank kept the rate unchanged at its last meeting, economists expect an increase when it meets later this month and continued pressure for more increases throughout this year. That is in part because, \u201cInflation will remain a key macro issue in 2016,\u201d according to a research note published on Dec. 30 by Alberto Ramos, Head of Latin America Economic Research for Goldman Sachs.That also means higher credit card interest rates. Many Brazilians already pay annual rates as high as 415.3 percent as of the end of November, up from 327.8 percent one year earlier, according to Central Bank data. Average annual credit card interest rates in Brazil have risen in 10 of the last 11 months, reaching 99 percent in November, up significantly from 74.5 percent in the same month in 2014, according to that same Central Bank report.In contrast, Nubank has not changed its 7.75 monthly interest rate in over a year. It also hopes that being digital both reduces overhead and results in better customer service. Banks, after telecommunications companies, usually generate the most customer complaints in Brazil. That has helped its popularity here grow.More than one million Brazilians have applied for the card and approximately 300,000 are on a waiting list while their credit history is examined, Nubank said in the fourth quarter of last year.An earlier version of this article misstated the role of Peter Thiel at PayPal. He was a co-founder, not the founder.Advertisement"}

The company whose products were at the center of that outbreak, USPlabs, is among 117 companies and individuals that the Justice Department filed criminal and civil enforcement actions against last year.The \u201cFrontline\u201d program follows doctors, patients, industry experts and regulators to uncover the root of these outbreaks. It looks at whether the widespread use of vitamin D and other popular vitamins that are commonly sold and taken in high doses can do more harm than good. One that it focuses on is fish oil, the third most popular supplement in America, which is used by at least one in 10 adults.  Despite their popularity, some studies have found that roughly three-quarters of fish oil supplements on the market do not contain the amount of omega-3 fatty acids advertised on their labels. Some have also found that fish oil supplements are prone to becoming rancid. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think for cardiovascular disease, one has to say that there is no compelling evidence that taking fish oils protects against a first heart attack or a second heart attack,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Andrew Grey, the author of the JAMA study and an associate professor of medicine at the University of Auckland, says in the \u201cFrontline\u201d report. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo people who are advised to do that or are doing it are wasting their time and their money.\u201dProponents of fish oil supplements argue that omega-3 fatty acids are essential for heart function and promote overall health. Experts say there is no doubt about that. But there is no clinical evidence that taking high doses in supplement form is beneficial for most people.To learn more about the debate over fish oil, vitamins and herbal supplements, watch \u201cSupplements and Safety\u201d at 10 p.m. Eastern on PBS stations on Tuesday, Jan. 19.

{"Headline": "Apple Sets Its Sights on Virtual Reality", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Supported byApple recently acquired an augmented reality start-up called Flyby Media and hired Doug Bowman, who ran the Center for Human-Computer Interaction at Virginia Tech and who has researched topics such as immersion in virtual environments.Virtual and augmented reality are growing fields in the technology industry. Supporters like Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, have said virtual reality is the next big platform after mobile. The technology, which can make users feel transported by immersing them in different environments, has the potential to transform games, movies, social networks and work. Almost $4 billion has been invested in virtual reality start-ups since 2010, according to PitchBook, a research firm.Developing virtual and augmented reality technology is about creating \u201cthe next operating system,\u201d said Linc Gasking, co-founder and chief executive of 8i, a company that creates virtual reality software. \u201cApple currently owns the computer in your pocket, and it needs to be part of the next big user interface if it wants to retain that ownership.\u201dApple has not, until recently, been publicly enthusiastic about virtual reality. While it has made tiny acquisitions in the field, it has not made a deal as large as Facebook\u2019s Oculus purchase and has not brought any hardware to market.Apple has filed dozens of virtual reality-related patents in the past, including one in 2008 for a head-mounted display apparatus. The patent illustration shows a large pair of glasses that can hold an iPhone, and it looks much like Google\u2019s Cardboard.Matt Miesnieks, who is setting up an augmented reality-focused venture capital fund, said Apple had also been meeting with \u201cadvanced optics\u201d start-ups, referring to the lens that a viewer looks through. Apple currently lacks such technology, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s really cool,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cIt has some interesting applications.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Transcript of Republican Presidential Debate", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byFollowing is a transcript of the main Republican presidential debate, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.NEIL CAVUTO: It is 9:00 p.m. here at the North Charleston Coliseum and Performing Arts Center in South Carolina. Welcome to the sixth Republican presidential debate of the 2016 campaign, here on the Fox Business Network.I\u2019m Neil Cavuto, alongside my friend and co-moderator Maria Bartiromo.MARIA BARTIROMO: Tonight we are working with Facebook to ask the candidates the questions voters want answered. And according to Facebook, the U.S. election has dominated the global conversation, with 131 million people talking about the 2016 race. That makes it the number one issue talked about on Facebook last year worldwide.CAVUTO: Now, the seven candidates on the stage tonight were selected based on their standing in six national polls, as well as polls in the early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire, those standings determining the position on the stage of the candidates tonight. And here they are.Businessman Donald Trump.(APPLAUSE)Texas senator Ted Cruz.(APPLAUSE)Florida senator Marco Rubio.(APPLAUSE)Neurosurgeon Ben Carson.(APPLAUSE)New Jersey governor Chris Christie.(APPLAUSE)Former Florida governor Jeb Bush.And Ohio governor John Kasich.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Tonight\u2019s rules are simple: up to 90 seconds for each answer, one minute for each follow-up response. And if a candidate goes over the allotted time, you\u2019ll hear this.(BELL RINGS) So let\u2019s get started. Candidates, jobs and growth \u2014 two of the biggest issues facing the country right now. In his State of the Union address earlier this week, the president said, quote, \u201cwe have the strongest, most durable economy in the world.\u201dAnd according to our Facebook research, jobs is one of the biggest issues resonating across the country, including here in South Carolina. The president is touting 14 million new jobs and an unemployment rate cut in half.The president said that anyone who claims America\u2019s economy is in decline is peddling fiction. Senator Cruz, what do you see that he doesn\u2019t?CRUZ: Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.Let me start \u2014 I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something. Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.In that State of the Union, President Obama didn\u2019t so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran. President Obama\u2019s preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei. And I\u2019ll tell you, it was heartbreaking.But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage. (APPLAUSE)And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)Now, on to your substantive question. The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs. And you know, he\u2019s right. If you\u2019re a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great. The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama. But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977. Median wages have stagnated. And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Governor Kasich, we are not even two weeks into this stock trading year, but (inaudible) investors already lost $1.6 trillion in market value. That makes it the worst start to a new year ever. Many worry that things will get even worse, and that banks and financial stocks are particularly vulnerable.Now, if this escalates, like it did back when Barack Obama first assumed the presidency, what actions would you take if this same thing happens all over again just as, in this example, you are taking over the presidency?KASICH: Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs. And I\u2019ve done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt. And our economy was growing like crazy. It\u2019s the same thing that I did in Ohio. It\u2019s a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety. It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way. And if you tax cuts \u2014 if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you\u2019re going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the \u2014 in the world.But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline. We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget. And when you do that, when you\u2019re in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.Right now, you don\u2019t have the \u2014 you have taxes that are too high. You have regulations \u2014 I mean, come on, they\u2019re affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses. They are \u2014 they\u2019re in a position where they\u2019re smothering people. And I mean, are you kidding me? We\u2019re nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise. You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy. And how do I know it? Because I\u2019ve done it. I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici. And I\u2019ve done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.Our wages are growing faster than the national average. We\u2019re running surpluses. And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: We know that recent global events have many people worried \u2014 Iran detaining American sailors, forcing them to apologize; North Korea and its nuclear ambitions; an aggressive China; and a Middle East that continues to deteriorate, not to mention ISIS is getting stronger.Governor Christie, sometimes it seems the world is on fire. Where and when should a president use military action to restore order?CHRISTIE: Well, Maria, I\u2019m glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what\u2019s going on in the world. Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama. And I\u2019ve got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?(APPLAUSE)The fact is, there\u2019s a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess. The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world. And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they\u2019ve never said about me is that I\u2019m misunderstood. And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we\u2019re going to keep it.Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience. And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he\u2019s absolutely right. It\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what\u2019s going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.The president doesn\u2019t understand \u2014 and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton \u2014 and here\u2019s my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight. If you\u2019re worried about the world being on fire, you\u2019re worried about how we\u2019re going to use our military, you\u2019re worried about strengthening our military and you\u2019re worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama\u2019s leadership.I will not do that. If I\u2019m the nominee, she won\u2019t get within 10 miles of the White House.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Just to be clear Governor, where and when would you use military action?CHRISTIE: MIlitary action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world. We are not the world\u2019s policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either. We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships. It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Governor Bush, the president just told the nation two nights ago that America is back and that the idea that our enemies are getting stronger or that this country is getting weaker, well, it\u2019s just rhetoric and hot air. Now other Democrats go even further, sir, saying Republicans even suggesting such comments actually embolden our enemies. I guess they would include you. What do you say?BUSH: Well first of all, the idea that somehow we\u2019re better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe. The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.Think about it. With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists. He\u2019s missing the whole point, that America\u2019s leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who\u2019s the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.(APPLAUSE)I\u2019ve learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military. In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can\u2019t even project force. Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we\u2019re in a much difficult \u2014 we\u2019re in a much different position than we should be.And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well. Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military. We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world\u2019s policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: So I take it from that you do not agree with the president.BUSH: No. And worse \u2014 worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.Think about it. She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have \u2014 that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess. And that is wrong.And you know what? Here\u2019s the problem. If she gets elected, she\u2019s under investigation with the FBI right now. If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse. We need to stop that. (LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Senator Rubio, the president says that ISIS doesn\u2019t threaten our national existence like a Germany or a Japan back in World War II, that the terror group is nothing more than twisted souls plotting attacks in their garages.But House Homeland Security Committee recently said that over 1,000 ongoing investigations of homegrown extremism in 50 states. So how do you define the threat? Germany then or dangerous nut cases now?RUBIO: Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton. She wouldn\u2019t just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.(APPLAUSE)Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States. Ever.(APPLAUSE)On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power. Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size. And that\u2019s how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.He doesn\u2019t understand the threat in ISIS. He consistently underestimates it but I do not. There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.When I\u2019m president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS. The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them. And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Thank you, Senator.BARTIROMO: Dr. Carson, the president says he does not want to treat ISIS as a foreign army, but ISIS is neither a country nor a government. How do you attack a network that does not respect national borders?CARSON: Well, I\u2019m very happy to get a question this early on. I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.(LAUGHTER)You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president\u2019s proclamations. The fact of the matter is he doesn\u2019t realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before. Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid. And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously. And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.I mean, just think about a scenario like that. They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse. They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs. Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point? He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.But here\u2019s the real key. We have the world\u2019s best military, even though he\u2019s done everything he can to diminish it. And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don\u2019t tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Mr. Trump, at the State of the Union, the president pointed to a guest who was a Syrian refugee you might recall whose wife and daughter and other family members were killed in an air attack. Now he fled that country seeking asylum here, ultimately ended up in Detroit where he\u2019s now trying to start a new life.The president says that that doctor is the real face of these refugees and not the one that you and some of your colleagues on this stage are painting; that you prefer the face of fear and terror and that you would refuse to let in anyone into this country seeking legitimate asylum. How do you answer that?TRUMP: It\u2019s not fear and terror, it\u2019s reality. You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.(APPLAUSE)You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there\u2019s a \u2014 the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow. They\u2019re very, very badly wounded. They will \u2014 some will follow. And you look around, and you see what\u2019s happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor \u2014 very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.That could be the great Trojan Horse. It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction. When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women? It looked like very few women. Very few children. Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they\u2019re saying what\u2019s going on?You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized \u2014 they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 \u2014 going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look \u2014 a good strong look and that\u2019s what we have. We are nineteen trillion dollars \u2014 our country\u2019s a mess and we can\u2019t let all these people come into our country and break our borders. We can\u2019t do it.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Senator Cruz, the New York Times is reporting that you failed to properly disclose a million dollars in loans from Goldman Sachs and CitiBank. During your senate race, your campaign said, \u201cit was inadvertent.\u201d A million dollars is inadvertent?CRUZ: Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times. You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don\u2019t hide their views. The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, \u201cAnybody But Cruz.\u201d Had that actually \u2014 that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, \u201cIt Follows\u201d that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.So you know the New York Times and I don\u2019t have exactly have the warmest of relationships. Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate \u2014 unlike Hillary Clinton, I don\u2019t have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars. When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars. He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks. And the entire New York times attack \u2014 is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing. But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other. But if that\u2019s the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well. BARTIROMO: Thank you.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO: All right. Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate, right here in North Charleston, South Carolina. Let\u2019s get right back to the questions. And I\u2019ll start with you, Senator Cruz.Now you are, of course, a strict constitutionalist \u2014 no one would doubt that. And as you know, the U.S. Constitution says only natural-born citizens are eligible for the office of president of the United States. Stop me if you\u2019ve heard this before. Now, you were born...(LAUGHTER)... you were born in Canada to an American mother. So you were and are considered an American citizen. But that fellow next to you, Donald Trump \u2014 and others \u2014 have said that being born in Canada means you are not natural-born, and that has raised questions about your eligibility.Do you want to try to close this topic once and for all tonight?CRUZ: Well, Neil, I\u2019m glad we\u2019re focusing on the important topics of the evening.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there. There was nothing to this birther issue.(LAUGHTER)Now, since September, the Constitution hasn\u2019t changed.(LAUGHTER)But the poll numbers have.(APPLAUSE)And I recognize \u2014 I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa. But the facts and the law here are really quite clear. Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen. That\u2019s why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen. That\u2019s why George Romney, Mitt\u2019s dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on \u2014 some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.(APPLAUSE)(UNKNOWN): Not me.CRUZ: Because \u2014 because Donald\u2019s mother was born in Scotland. She was naturalized. Now, Donald...TRUMP: But I was born here.CRUZ: ... on the issue \u2014 on the issue of citizenship, Donald...TRUMP: (inaudible). Big difference.CRUZ: ... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I\u2019m not going to use your mother\u2019s birth against you.TRUMP: OK, good. Because it wouldn\u2019t work.CRUZ: You\u2019re an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who\u2019s best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that\u2019s the most important question facing the country.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Mr. Trump...(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: ... that you raised it because of his rising poll numbers.TRUMP: ... first of all, let me just tell you something \u2014 and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself \u2014 NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll \u2014 headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down. I mean, so don\u2019t \u2014 so you can\u2019t \u2014 you can\u2019t...(BOOING)... they don\u2019t like the Wall Street Journal. They don\u2019t like NBC, but I like the poll.(LAUGHTER)And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I\u2019m beating you. So \u2014 you know, you shouldn\u2019t misrepresent how well you\u2019re doing with the polls.(APPLAUSE)You don\u2019t have to say that. In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that\u2019s a misrepresentation, number one.Number two, this isn\u2019t me saying it. I don\u2019t care. I think I\u2019m going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way. Thank you.Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard \u2014 of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this. OK? There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.Here\u2019s the problem. We\u2019re running. We\u2019re running. He does great. I win. I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can\u2019t take him along for the ride. I don\u2019t like that. OK?(LAUGHTER)The fact is \u2014 and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible). See, they don\u2019t like that. They don\u2019t like that.(AUDIENCE BOOING)No, they don\u2019t like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.(LAUGHTER)But \u2014 if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit. You have a big lawsuit over your head while you\u2019re running. And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office? So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide. And you shouldn\u2019t have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: Why are you saying this now \u2014 right now? Why are you raising this issue now?TRUMP: Because now he\u2019s going a little bit better. No, I didn\u2019t care (inaudible). It\u2019s true. No, it\u2019s true. Hey look, he never had a chance. Now, he\u2019s doing better. He\u2019s got probably a four or five percent chance.(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: Neil...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: The fact is, there is a big overhang. There\u2019s a big question mark on your head. And you can\u2019t do that to the party. You really can\u2019t. You can\u2019t do that to the party. You have to have certainty. Even if it was a one percent chance, and it\u2019s far greater than one percent because (inaudible).I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can\u2019t run. If there was a \u2014 and you know I\u2019m not bringing a suit. I promise. But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty. You can\u2019t have a question. I can agree with you or not, but you can\u2019t have a question over your head.CAVUTO: Senator, do you want to respond?CRUZ: Well, listen, I\u2019ve spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court. And I\u2019ll tell you, I\u2019m not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.TRUMP: You don\u2019t have to. Take it from Lawrence Tribe.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Take it from your professors...(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero. And Mr. Trump is very focused...TRUMP: He\u2019s wrong. He\u2019s wrong.CRUZ: ... on Larry Tribe. Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is. He\u2019s a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore\u2019s lawyer in Bush versus Gore. He\u2019s a major Hillary Clinton supporter. And there\u2019s a reason why Hillary\u2019s supporters are echoing Donald\u2019s attacks on me, because Hillary...TRUMP: He is not the only one.CRUZ: ... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.TRUMP: There are many lawyers.CRUZ: And I\u2019ll tell you what, Donald, you \u2014 you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P. slot.(LAUGHTER) I\u2019ll tell you what. If this all works out, I\u2019m happy to consider naming you as V.P. So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.TRUMP: No \u2014 no...(LAUGHTER)... I think if it doesn\u2019t...(APPLAUSE)I like that. I like it. I\u2019d consider it. But I think I\u2019ll go back to building buildings if it doesn\u2019t work out.CRUZ: Actually, I\u2019d love to get you to build a wall.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: I have a feeling it\u2019s going to work out, actually.(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: Let me (inaudible). I was invoked in that question, so let me just say \u2014 in that answer \u2014 let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.(LAUGHTER)But the real \u2014 but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about. OK? Listen, we \u2014 this is the greatest country in the history of mankind. But in 2008, we elected a president that didn\u2019t want to fix America. He wants to change America. We elected a president that doesn\u2019t believe in the Constitution. He undermines it. We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage. We elected a president that doesn\u2019t believe in the free enterprise system.This election has to be about reversing all of that damage. That\u2019s why I\u2019m running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders. When I\u2019m president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military. And when I\u2019m president, we\u2019re not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world. When I\u2019m president, we\u2019re going to have a president that acts like it.BARTIROMO: Thank you, senator.BARTIROMO: Mr. Trump, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley in her response to the State of the Union address(APPLAUSE)BARITROMO: appeared to choose sides within the party, saying Republicans should resist, quote, \u201cthe siren call of the angriest voices\u201d. She confirmed, she was referring to you among others. Was she out of line? And, how would a President Trump unite the party?TRUMP: Okay. First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I\u2019m a friend of hers. Actually a close friend. And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I\u2019m a friend. We\u2019re friends. That\u2019s good.(LAUGHTER)But she did say there was anger. And I could say, oh, I\u2019m not angry. I\u2019m very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger. Our military is a disaster.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Our healthcare is a horror show. Obamacare, we\u2019re going to repeal it and replace it. We have no borders. Our vets are being treated horribly. Illegal immigration is beyond belief. Our country is being run by incompetent people. And yes, I am angry.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: And I won\u2019t be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I\u2019m very, very angry. And I say that to Nikki. So when Nikki said that, I wasn\u2019t offended. She said the truth.One of your colleagues interviewed me. And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she\u2019s right. I\u2019m not fighting that. I didn\u2019t find it offensive at all. I\u2019m angry because our country is a mess.(APPLAUSE)BARITROMO: But what are you going to do about it?CAVUTO: Marco Rubio. I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s the time constraints. You and Governor Christie have been exchanging some fairly nasty words of late, and I will allow the governor to respond as well.The governor went so far to say, you won\u2019t be able to slime your way to the White House. He\u2019s referring to a series of ads done by a PAC, speaking on your behalf, that say quote,\u201dOne high tax, Common Core, liberal, energy-loving, Obamacare, Medicaid-expanding president is enough. You think you went too far on that and do you want to apologize to the governor?RUBIO: You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country\u2019s security and expanding the role of...CAVUTO: That is not my question.RUBIO: Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil. He is \u2014 this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government. This president is undermining our military. He is undermining our standing in the world. I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control. This president, this president is more interested in funding \u2014 less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned \u2014 he\u2019s more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood. All I\u2019m saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country. It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary. Let me tell you, if we don\u2019t get this election right, there may be no turning back for America. We\u2019re on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage. No one is a socialist. No one here is under FBI investigation. So we have a good group of people.CAVUTO: Is he a liberal?RUBIO: Our next president...CAVUTO: Is he a liberal?RUBIO: Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood. Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.CAVUTO: Governor?(APPLAUSE)CHRISTIE: I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we\u2019re running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco\u2019s ear too.(LAUGHTER)So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then. So let\u2019s set the facts straight. First of all, I didn\u2019t support Sonia Sotomayor. Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban. I have vetoed a reduction this clip size. I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey. So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator. See when you\u2019re a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk. And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you\u2019re saying is accurate or not.When you\u2019re a governor, you\u2019re held accountable for everything you do. And the people of New Jersey, I\u2019ve seen it.(APPLAUSE)And the last piece is this. I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed. That was before he was running against me. Now that he is, he\u2019s changed his tune.I\u2019m never going to change my tune. I like Marco Rubio. He\u2019s a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: Neil, my name was mentioned here. Neil, my name was mentioned as well.Here\u2019s the deal, Chris is totally right. He\u2019s been a good governor, and he\u2019s a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton. And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it\u2019s going to be \u2014 this is not being bad.These attack ads are going to be part of life. Everybody just needs to get used to it. Everybody\u2019s record\u2019s going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.(APPLAUSE)Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn\u2019t disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you\u2019re going to hear in these ads, and discount the \u2014 the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.CARSON: Neil, I was mentioned too.CAVUTO: You were?CARSON: Yeah, he said everybody. (LAUGHTER)And \u2014 and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we \u2014 and when I say we, Republicans \u2014 tore themselves apart.You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it. And we got to look at the big picture here.BARTIROMO: Governor Kasich...(APPLAUSE)... Governor Kasich, Hillary Clinton is getting some serious competition from Senator Bernie Sanders. He\u2019s now at 41 percent in the latest CBS/New York Times poll. Vice President Biden sang his praises, saying Bernie is speaking to a yearning that is deep and real, and he has credibility on it.So what does it say about our country that a candidate who is a self-avowed socialist and who doesn\u2019t think a 90 percent tax rate is too high could be the Democratic nominee?KASICH: Well, if that\u2019s the case, we\u2019re going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee. That\u2019s not even an issue. But look...(APPLAUSE)... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he\u2019s not going to be president of the United States. So here\u2019s this \u2014 the situation, I think, Maria.And this is what we have to \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2019ve got to tell you, when wages don\u2019t rise \u2014 and they haven\u2019t for a lot of families for a number of years \u2014 it\u2019s very, very difficult for them.Part of the reason why it hasn\u2019t risen because sometimes we\u2019re not giving people the skills they need. Sometimes it\u2019s because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in \u2014 in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.People are upset about it. I\u2019ll tell you what else they\u2019re upset about: you\u2019re 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you\u2019re out of work, and you don\u2019t know where to go and where to turn. Do we have answer for that? We do. There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they\u2019ve got great value.I\u2019ll tell you what else people are concerned about. Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can\u2019t get a good job. We got to do a lot about the high cost of high \u2014 higher education, but we\u2019ve got to make sure we\u2019re training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.(APPLAUSE)Let me tell you that, in this country \u2014 in this country, people are concerned about their economic future. They\u2019re very concerned about it. And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to \u2014 keeping them from getting it.That\u2019s not the America that I\u2019ve ever known. My father used to say, \u201cJohnny, we never \u2014 we don\u2019t hate the rich. We just want to be the rich.\u201d And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America \u2014 and I mean everybody in America \u2014 having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.I\u2019m president \u2014 look, I\u2019ve done it once. I\u2019ve done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes. The economy was really booming.And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the \u2014 than the national average. A growth of 385,000 jobs.(BELL RINGS)It\u2019s not that hard. Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts. Get it done, because our \u2014 our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done. And, folks, we will. You count on it.BARTIROMO: Dr. Carson, one of the other candidates on this stage has brought Bill Clinton\u2019s past indiscretions. Is that a legitimate topic in this election? And what do you think of the notion that Hillary Clinton is an enabler of sexual misconduct?CARSON: Well, there\u2019s not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they\u2019re married to somebody who\u2019s running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means. But you know, here\u2019s the real issue, is this America anymore? Do we still have standards? Do we still have values and principles?You know, you look at what\u2019s going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society. You know, we have a war on virtual everything \u2014 race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars. Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other\u2019s throat and our strength is actually in our unity.You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section \u2014 you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names. Where did that spirit come from in America? It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that. And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong. And let\u2019s not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great. They\u2019ve been beaten into submission. It\u2019s time for us to stand up for what we believe in.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Well, we are not done. Coming up, one of the top things people are talking about on Facebook, guns. And you can join us live us on this stage in the conversation during this commercial break right from home. You can go to Facebook.com/(inaudible). We will be streaming live and talking about how we think the debate is going so far.We\u2019re back in a moment in Charleston, South Carolina.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debates, right here in North Charleston. Let\u2019s get right back to the questions.Governor Bush, gun rights, one of the top issues seen on Facebook with close to 3 million people talking about it in the past month. Right here in Charleston, Dylann Roof, who has been accused of killing nine people in a nearby church, reportedly had not passed his background check when he got his gun. What is the harm in tightening standards for not only who buys guns, but those who sell them?BUSH: First of all, I\u2019d like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the \u2014(APPLAUSE)BUSH: The Emanuel AME church killings. And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: I don\u2019t know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place. Look, here\u2019s the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake. The law itself requires a background check, but that didn\u2019t fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.We don\u2019t need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job. Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not \u2014 would not have passed a background check. The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.That\u2019s what they do, whether it\u2019s the San Bernardino attack or if it\u2019s these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is. It isn\u2019t law-abiding gun owners.Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you\u2019re going away. You\u2019re going away for a long, long while.And that\u2019s what we should focus on is the violence in our communities. Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you\u2019re going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there\u2019s a big divide.The other issue is mental health. That\u2019s a serious issue that we could work on. Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: The president\u2019s first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn\u2019t have. Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don\u2019t have access to guns.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.Mr. Trump, are there any circumstances that you think we should be limiting gun sales of any kind in America?TRUMP: No. I am a 2nd amendment person. If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn\u2019t have 14 or 15 people dead right now.If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn\u2019t have 130 people plus dead. So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.We have a huge mental health problem in this country. We\u2019re closing hospitals, we\u2019re closing wards, we\u2019re closing so many because the states want to save money. We have to get back into looking at what\u2019s causing it. The guns don\u2019t pull the trigger. It\u2019s the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order. He doesn\u2019t want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress. You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation. He just writes out an executive order. Not supposed to happen that way.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you sir.XXX where you get Congress.TRUMP: You get the Congress. You get the Senate. You get together. You do legislation. He just writes out an order, executive order. It\u2019s not supposed to happen that way.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Senator Rubio, you said that President Obama wants to take people\u2019s guns away. Yet under his presidency, gun sales have more than doubled. That doesn\u2019t sound like a White House unfriendly to gun owners.RUBIO: That sounds like people are afraid the president\u2019s going to take their guns away.(APPLAUSE)Look, the Second Amendment is not an option. It is not a suggestion. It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families. I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would. I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would. I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.Here\u2019s my second problem. None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he\u2019s doing these things would have been preventive. You know why? Because criminals don\u2019t buy their guns from a gun show. They don\u2019t buy their guns from a collector. And they don\u2019t buy their guns from a gun store. They get \u2014 they steal them. They get them on the black market.And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show. These...(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)... his answer \u2014 you name it. If there\u2019s an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control. Here\u2019s a fact. We are in a war against ISIS. They are trying to attack us here in America. They attacked us in Philadelphia last week. They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago. And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.When I\u2019m president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: But what fact can you point to, Senator \u2014 what fact can you point to that the president would take away everyone\u2019s gun? You don\u2019t think that\u2019s (inaudible)?RUBIO: About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can\u2019t wait to restrict people\u2019s access to guns. He has never defended...(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: I\u2019ll give you a fact. Well, let me tell you this. Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, \u201cThese Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion.\u201d That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.(APPLAUSE)He doesn\u2019t meet \u2014 here\u2019s the difference. When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it\u2019s not \u201chow can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans.\u201d It\u2019s \u201cgive me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns.\u201d That will never happen when I am president of the United States.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Governor Christie, you, too, have criticized the president\u2019s recent executive action on gun control, saying it\u2019s unconstitutional, another step to bypass Congress. But hasn\u2019t your own position on guns evolved, sir? The New Jersey Star-Ledger reports that you signed several laws to regulate the possession of firearms, and that you argued back in August 2013, and I quote, \u201cThese common sense measures will strengthen New Jersey\u2019s already tough gun laws.\u201dSo isn\u2019t that kind of what the president wants to do now?CHRISTIE: No, absolutely not. The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people. And the fact is that that\u2019s not a democracy. That\u2019s a dictatorship. And we need to very, very concerned about that.See, here\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident. I don\u2019t think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat. I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit. We have made it easier to do that, not harder. And the way we\u2019ve done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders. This guy is a petulant child. That\u2019s what he is. I mean, you know...(APPLAUSE)... the fact is, Neil, let\u2019s think about \u2014 let\u2019s think about \u2014 and I want to maybe \u2014 I hope the president is watching tonight, because here\u2019s what I\u2019d like to tell him.Mr. President, we\u2019re not against you. We\u2019re against your policies. When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate. You had only 21 Republican governors in this country. And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we\u2019ve had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.The American people have rejected your agenda and now you\u2019re trying to go around it. That\u2019s not right. It\u2019s not constitutional. And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: So what is the answer, Senator Cruz, to stop mass shootings and violent crime, up in 30 cities across the country?CRUZ: The answer is simple. Your prosecute criminals. You target the bad guys. You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do \u2014 done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general. Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns. He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials. And I\u2019ll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters \u2014 the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president\u2019s going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.And I\u2019ll note that California senator \u2014 Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, \u201cgive me your guns, I\u2019m rounding them up,\u201d she would.And let me make a final point on this. Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment. Unless you are clinically insane...(LAUGHTER)... that\u2019s what you say in a primary. But the voters are savvier than that. They recognize that people\u2019s actions don\u2019t always match their words. I\u2019ve got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.There\u2019s a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race. There\u2019s a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...(BELL RINGS) ... and there\u2019s a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans \u2014 we defeated that gun control legislation.And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.BARTIROMO: Senator...(APPLAUSE)... let me follow up and switch gears.Senator Cruz, you suggested Mr. Trump, quote, \u201cembodies New York values.\u201d Could you explain what you mean by that?CRUZ: You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: I am from New York. I don\u2019t.CRUZ: What \u2014 what \u2014 you\u2019re from New York? So you might not.(LAUGHTER)But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.(APPLAUSE)And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York. But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.And \u2014 and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked \u2014 my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen\u2019s \u201cBorn in the USA\u201d, and I was asked what I thought of that.And I said, \u201cwell, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, \u2018New York, New York\u2019?\u201d And \u2014 and \u2014 you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.The New York Times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign.Not too many years ago, Donald did a long interview with Tim Russert. And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he\u2019s describing now.And his explanation \u2014 he said, \u201clook, I\u2019m from New York, that\u2019s what we believe in New York. Those aren\u2019t Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York.\u201d And so that was his explanation.And \u2014 and I guess I can \u2014 can frame it another way. Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan. I\u2019m just saying.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: Are you sure about that?CAVUTO: Maria...TRUMP: So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.(APPLAUSE)And just so \u2014 if I could, because he insulted a lot of people. I\u2019ve had more calls on that statement that Ted made \u2014 New York is a great place. It\u2019s got great people, it\u2019s got loving people, wonderful people.When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York. You had two one hundred...(APPLAUSE)... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down. I saw them come down. Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction. I was down there, and I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death \u2014 nobody understood it. And it was with us for months, the smell, the air. And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers. And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Governor bush, for the third time in as many months, the Iranians have provoked us, detaining us, as we\u2019ve been discussing, with these 10 Navy sailors Tehran had said strayed into their waters. The sailors were released, but only after shown on video apologizing for the incident. This occurring only weeks after Iran fired multiple rockets within 1,500 yards of a U.S. aircraft carrier and then continued to test medium range missiles.Now you\u2019ve claimed that such actions indicate Tehran has little to fear from a President Obama. I wonder, sir, what would change if they continued doing this sort of thing under a President Jeb Bush?BUSH: Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military. Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy\u2019s going to be cut again. It\u2019s now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.The deployments are too high for the military personnel. We don\u2019t have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment. The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman. The planes are older than the pilots. We\u2019re gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we\u2019re back in the game.Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board. We should reimpose sanctions, they\u2019ve already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we\u2019re back in the game with Israel \u2014(APPLAUSE)... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations. The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak. This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran. We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Thank you, Governor. Governor Kasich, while everyone has been focusing on Iran\u2019s provocations, I\u2019m wondering what you make of what Saudi Arabia has been doing and its recent moves in the region, including its execution of a well-known Shi\u2019ite cleric and its move to dramatically increase oil production, some say in an effort to drive down oil prices and force a lot of U.S. oil producers out of business.Sure enough, oil prices have tumbled. One brokerage house is predicting a third or more of American oil producers and those heavily invested in fracking will go bankrupt, and soon Saudi Arabia and OPEC will be back in the driver\u2019s seat.U.S. energy player Harold Hamrie similarly told me with friends like these, who needs enemies? Do you agree?KASICH: Well, let me \u2014 let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience. I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina. Let em also tell you...(APPLAUSE)... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense. And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems. So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it\u2019s so critical for us to be energy independent, and we\u2019re getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.We\u2019re seeing it in my state and we\u2019ll see it in this country. And that\u2019s why we must make sure we continue to frack.In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they\u2019re funding radical clerics through their madrasses. That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way. And I was going to tell you, whether I\u2019m president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we\u2019re going to support you, we\u2019re in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you\u2019ve got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.(APPLAUSE)So look, in foreign policy \u2014 in foreign policy, it\u2019s strength, but you\u2019ve got to be cool. You\u2019ve got to have a clear vision of where you want to go. And I\u2019m going to tell you, that it \u2014 I\u2019m going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can\u2019t do on the job training.I\u2019ve seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War. You see what the Saudi\u2019s \u2014 deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they\u2019re going right with us. And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.Thank you.CAVUTO: Thank you John.BARTIROMO: There\u2019s much more ahead including the fight against ISIS. More from Charleston, South Carolina when we come right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: We welcome back to the Republican Presidential Debate, right back to the questions.Candidates, the man who made fighting ISIS the cornerstone of his campaign, South Carolina Senator, Lindsey Graham is out the race but he joins us tonight in the audience.(APPLAUSE)He says, \u201cthe air-strike now in their 16th month have been ineffective.\u201d Dr. Carson ...CARSON: Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?BARTIROMO: The air-strikes.CARSON: OK.BARTIROMO: Now in their 16th month are ineffective. Dr. Carson, do you think Senator Graham is right in wanting to send 20,000 troops \u2014 ground troops to Iraq and Syria to take out ISIS?CARSON: Well, there\u2019s no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don\u2019t believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.I think we need to do a lot more than we\u2019re doing. Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, \u201cwhat do you need in order to accomplish this goal?\u201dOur decision is, then, do we give them what we need. I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don\u2019t tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.In addition to that...(APPLAUSE)... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue. You know, some of these \u2014 these engagement rules that the administration has \u2014 \u201cwe\u2019re not going to bomb a tanker that\u2019s coming out of there because there might be a person in it\u201d \u2014 give me a break.Just tell them that, you put people in there, we\u2019re going to bomb them. So don\u2019t put people in there if you don\u2019t want them bombed. You know, that\u2019s so simple.(APPLAUSE)And then we need to shut down \u2014 we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers. Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go. They should be running all the time, then they won\u2019t have time to plan attacks against us.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir. Senator Graham has also said that the U.S. will find Arab support for its coalition if it removes Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. And I quote, \u201cThe now king of Saudi Arabia told us, \u2018you can have our army, you just got to deal with Assad.\u2019\u201cThe emir of Qatar said, \u2018I\u2019ll pay for the operation, but they are not going to fight ISIS and let Damascus fall into the hands of the Iranians. Assad has to go.\u2019\u201dGovernor Christie, how important is it to remove Assad from power and how would you do it?CHRISTIE: Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot. You think about it \u2014 this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state \u2014 drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we\u2019re going to attack.He used chemical weapons, he\u2019s killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing. In fact, he\u2019s done worse than nothing.This president \u2014 and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer \u2014 she called Assad a reformer. Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad. The fact of the matter is we\u2019re not going to have peace \u2014 we are not going to have peace in Syria. We\u2019re not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don\u2019t have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.The Syrians should stay in Syria. They shouldn\u2019t be going to Europe. And here\u2019s the last piece...(APPLAUSE)... you\u2019re not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge. You\u2019re simply not. And so Senator Graham is right about this.And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.And believe me, Assad is not worth it. And if you\u2019re going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you\u2019re going to give her another four years, that\u2019s why I\u2019m speaking out as strongly as I am about that.Hillary Clinton cannot be president. It will lead to even greater war in this world. And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.That makes the world less peaceful, less safe. In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.(APPLAUSE)Mr. Trump \u2014 Mr. Trump, your comments about banning Muslims from entering the country created a firestorm. According to Facebook, it was the most-talked-about moment online of your entire campaign, with more than 10 million people talking about the issue.Is there anything you\u2019ve heard that makes you want to rethink this position?TRUMP: No.(LAUGHTER)No.(APPLAUSE)Look, we have to stop with political correctness. We have to get down to creating a country that\u2019s not going to have the kind of problems that we\u2019ve had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the \u2014 with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world. I just left Indonesia \u2014 bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.We have to find out what\u2019s going on. I said temporarily. I didn\u2019t say permanently. I said temporarily. And I have many great Muslim friends. And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, \u201cDonald, thank you very much; you\u2019re exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it.\u201dAnd unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what\u2019s going on, he can\u2019t use the term for whatever reason. And if you can\u2019t use the term, you\u2019re never going to solve the problem. My Muslim friends, some, said, \u201cthank you very much; we\u2019ll get to the bottom of it.\u201dBut we have a serious problem. And we can\u2019t be the stupid country any more. We\u2019re laughed at all over the world.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: Donald, Donald \u2014 can I \u2014 I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS. The Kurds are our strongest allies. They\u2019re Muslim. You\u2019re not going to even allow them to come to our country?The other Arab countries have a role to play in this. We cannot be the world\u2019s policeman. We can\u2019t do this unilaterally. We have to do this in unison with the Arab world. And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.(APPLAUSE)So I hope you\u2019ll reconsider. I hope you\u2019ll reconsider. The better way of dealing with this \u2014 the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the \u2014 Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it\u2019s harder if they\u2019ve been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder \u2014 make the screening take place.We don\u2019t have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously? What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?CAVUTO: But you said \u2014 you said that he made those comments and they represented him being unhinged after he made them.BUSH: Yeah, they are unhinged.CAVUTO: Well \u2014 well, after he made them...(APPLAUSE)... his poll numbers went up eight points in South Carolina. Now \u2014 now, wait...TRUMP: Eleven points, to be exact.CAVUTO: Are you \u2014 are you saying \u2014 are you saying that all those people who agree with Mr. Trump are unhinged?BUSH: No, not at all, absolutely not. I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically. I totally get that. But we\u2019re running for the presidency of the United States here. This isn\u2019t \u2014 this isn\u2019t, you know, a different kind of job. You have to lead. You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it\u2019s just politics.Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength. And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I\u2019m asking him to consider changing his views.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: I want security for this country. OK?(APPLAUSE)I want security. I\u2019m tired of seeing what\u2019s going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot. I want security for this country. We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam. We have a tremendous problem. It\u2019s not only a problem here. It\u2019s a problem all over the world.I want to find out why those two young people \u2014 those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them \u2014 people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them. I want to find out \u2014 many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment. Why weren\u2019t they vigilant? Why didn\u2019t they call? Why didn\u2019t they call the police?According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.And by the way, the police are the most mistreated people in this country. I will tell you that.(APPLAUSE)The most mistreated people. In fact, we need to \u2014 wait a minute \u2014 we need vigilance. We have to find out \u2014 many people knew about what was going on. Why didn\u2019t they turn those two people in so that you wouldn\u2019t have had all the death?There\u2019s something going on and it\u2019s bad. And I\u2019m saying we have to get to the bottom of it. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying. We need security.BARTIROMO: We \u2014 we want to hear from all of you on this. According to Pew Research, the U.S. admits more than 100,000 Muslim immigrants every single year on a permanent lifetime basis. I want to ask the rest of you to comment on this. Do you agree that we should pause Muslim immigration until we get a better handle on our homeland security situation, as Mr. Trump has said?Beginning with you, Governor Kasich.KASICH: I \u2014 I\u2019ve been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees. And the reasons why I\u2019ve done is I don\u2019t believe we have a good process of being able to vet them. But you know, we don\u2019t want to put everybody in the same category. And I\u2019ll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago. If we\u2019re going to have a coalition, we\u2019re going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states. We need Jordan.We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.(BELL RINGS)It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we\u2019re going to need it again. And if we try to put everybody in the same \u2014 call everybody the same thing, we can\u2019t do it. And that\u2019s just not acceptable.But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir, we want to hear from the rest of you,Governor Christie, your take.CHRISTIE: Now Maria, listen. I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind. And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe. That\u2019s the end of the conversation.I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue. Here\u2019s the way you need to deal with it. You can\u2019t just ban all Muslims. You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists. You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.(BELL RINGS)And this summer, we didn\u2019t do that. We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president. Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I\u2019m president, we\u2019ll make our intelligence community strong, and won\u2019t have to keep everybody out, we\u2019re just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don\u2019t harm us.BARTIROMO: Senator Rubio, where do you stand?RUBIO: Well, first of all, let\u2019s understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that\u2019s out there about this whole issue. Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck. They are much more than that. This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region. This is not some small scale group.They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world. So you know what needs to happen, it\u2019s a very simple equation, and it\u2019s going to happen when I\u2019m president. If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Senator Cruz, where do you stand? Senator Cruz?CRUZ: You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism. What should we do? First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I\u2019ve introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I\u2019ve introduced...(BELL RINGS)... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory. Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.If I\u2019m elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida. When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS(APPLAUSE).BARTIROMO: Dr. Carson, where do you stand? Do you agree with Mr. Trump?CARSON: Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem. But like all of our problems, there isn\u2019t a single one that can\u2019t be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics. And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that. And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place. They have infrastructure. All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November. Let\u2019s listen to them and let\u2019s not listen to our politicians.BARTIROMO: So, to be clear, the both of you do not agree with Mr. Trump?BUSH: So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies \u2014 that we need to build better relationships with? Of course not. What we need to do is destroy ISIS.I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a \u201cNo Fly Zone\u201d and \u201cSafe Zones\u201d to make sure refugees are there. We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria. We need to embed with \u2014 with the Iraqi military. We need to arm the Kurds the directly. We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters. That\u2019s how you solve the problem. You don\u2019t solve it by big talk where you\u2019re banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.BARTIROMO: Thank you governor.CAVUTO: Mr. Trump, sometimes maybe in the heat of the campaign, you say things and you have to dial them back. Last week, the New York Times editorial board quoted as saying that you would oppose, \u201cup to 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods.\u201dTRUMP: That\u2019s wrong. They were wrong. It\u2019s the New York Times, they are always wrong.CAVUTO: Well...TRUMP: They were wrong.CAVUTO: You never said because they provided that...TRUMP: No, I said, \u201c I would use \u2014 \u201c they were asking me what to do about North Korea. China, they don\u2019t like to tell us but they have total control \u2014 just about, of North Korea. They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.They say, \u201c well, we don\u2019t really have control.\u201d Without China, North Korea doesn\u2019t even eat. China is ripping us on trade. They\u2019re devaluing their currency and they\u2019re killing our companies. Thousands of thousands \u2014 you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we\u2019ve lost \u2014 50,000 because of China.(CROSSTALK) CAVUTO: So they\u2019ve never said to put a tariff on their...TRUMP: We\u2019ve lost anywhere between four and seven million jobs because of China. What I said then was, \u201cwe have very unfair trade with China. We\u2019re going to have a trade deficit of 505 billion dollars this year with China.\u201d A lot of that is because they devalue their currency.What I said to the New York Times, is that, \u201cwe have great power, economic power over China and if we wanted to use that and the amount \u2014 where the 45 percent comes in, that would be the amount they saw their devaluations that we should get.\u201d That we should get.What I\u2019m saying is this, I\u2019m saying that we do it but if they don\u2019t start treating us fairly and stop devaluing and let their currency rise so that our companies can compete and we don\u2019t lose all of these millions of jobs that we\u2019re losing, I would certainly start taxing goods that come in from China. Who the hell has to lose 505 billion dollars a year?CAVUTO: I\u2019m sorry, you lost me.TRUMP: It\u2019s not that complicated actually.CAVUTO: Then I apologize. Then I want to understand, if you don\u2019t want a 45 percent tariff, say that wasn\u2019t the figure, would you be open \u2014 are you open to slapping a higher tariff on Chinese goods of any sort to go back at them?TRUMP: OK, just so you understand \u2014 I know so much about trading about with China. Carl Icahn today as you know endorsed. Many businessmen want to endorse me.CAVUTO: I know...TRUMP: Carl said, \u201cno, no \u2014 \u201c but he\u2019s somebody \u2014 these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing and we have problems like this. If these are the kinds of people \u2014 we should use our best and our finest.Now, on that tariff \u2014 here\u2019s what I\u2019m saying, China \u2014 they send their goods and we don\u2019t tax it \u2014 they do whatever they want to do. They do whatever what they do, OK. When we do business with China, they tax us. You don\u2019t know it, they tax us.I have many friends that deal with China. They can\u2019t \u2014 when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed. If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal \u2014 so we don\u2019t have an equal playing field. I\u2019m saying, absolutely, we don\u2019t have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.I\u2019m a free trader. I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate. I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine. I sell tens\u2019 of millions of (inaudible).I love China. I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can\u2019t believe how stupid the American leadership is.CAVUTO: So you\u2019re open to a tariff?TRUMP: I\u2019m totally open to a tariff. If they don\u2019t treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed. You can\u2019t deal in China without tariffs. They do it to us, we don\u2019t it. It\u2019s not fair trade.KASICH: Neil, Neil \u2014 can I say one thing about this. I\u2019m a free trader. I support NAFTA. I believe in the PTT because it\u2019s important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China. And we do need China \u2014 Donald\u2019s right about North Korea.I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don\u2019t proliferate all these dangerous materials. But what he\u2019s touching \u2014 talking about, I think has got merit. And I\u2019ll allow putting that tariff or whatever he\u2019s saying here...TRUMP: I\u2019m happy to have him tonight...(LAUGHTER)KASICH: For too long \u2014 no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people\u2019s jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us. And guess what? The worker\u2019s out of a job.So when they \u2014 be found against that country that\u2019s selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker? Oh, well, you know, it just didn\u2019t work out for you.I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade. And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need \u2014 we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.And I want to just suggest to you. How do I know this? Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn\u2019t work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar. And the fact is those jobs are critical, they\u2019re hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they\u2019re Americans and they carry the load. So let\u2019s demand open trade but fair trade in this country. That\u2019s what I think we need to do.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: All right.RUBIO: But on this point, if I may add something on this point. We are all frustrated with what China is doing. I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here\u2019s why.China doesn\u2019t pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff. If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there\u2019s a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.It begins with tax reform. Let\u2019s not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world. Let\u2019s allow companies to immediately expense.(APPLAUSE)It continues with regulatory reform. Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.How about Obamacare, a certified job killer? It needs to be repealed and replaced. And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger. That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.TRUMP: Neil, the problem \u2014BARTIROMO: We\u2019re getting \u2014TRUMP: \u2014 with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they\u2019re sucking us dry and it takes too long. It would just \u2014 you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money. We just can\u2019t do it any longer.CAVUTO: He is right. If you put a tariff on a good, it\u2019s Americans who pay.BUSH: Absolutely.TRUMP: You looking at me?BUSH: Yeah.BARTIROMO: Prices go higher for \u2014TRUMP: Can I tell you what? It will never happen because they\u2019ll let their currency go up. They\u2019re never going to let it happen.Japan, the same thing. They are devaluing \u2014 it\u2019s so impossible for \u2014 you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what\u2019s happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph). Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan. Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they\u2019ve de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can\u2019t buy a Caterpillar tractor. And we\u2019re letting them get away with it and we can\u2019t let them get away with it.And that\u2019s why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: Here\u2019s \u2014 apart from the \u2014 apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.BARTIROMO: Yeah.BUSH: So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes \u2014 the equivalent of it goes to China. Or how about Boeing right here within a mile? Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn\u2019t retaliate and start buying Airbus? Of course, they would. This would be devastating for the economy. We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.BARTIROMO: Real quick, Senator \u2014 go ahead, Senator Cruz.(APPLAUSE)And then we have to get to tax reform.TRUMP: And we don\u2019t need a weak person being president of the United State, OK? Because that\u2019s what we\u2019d get if it were Jeb \u2014 I tell you what, we don\u2019t need that.AUDIENCE: Boo.TRUMP: We don\u2019t need that. That\u2019s essentially what we have now, and we don\u2019t need that. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re in the trouble that we\u2019re in now. And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look. They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China. They don\u2019t want them made here. They want those planes made in China.BUSH: They\u2019re a mile away from here.TRUMP: That\u2019s not the way the game is supposed to be played.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Governor Bush. Thank you, Mr. Trump. Very briefly.BUSH: My name was mentioned. My name was mentioned here. The simple fact is that the plane that\u2019s being build here is being sold to China. You can \u2014 if you \u2014 you flew in with your 767, didn\u2019t you? Right there, right next to the plant.TRUMP: No, the new planes. I\u2019m not talking about now, I\u2019m talking about in the future they\u2019re building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Mr. Trump.BUSH: When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the \u2014BARTIROMO: Thank you, Mr. Trmup. Thank you, Governor.TRUMP: I\u2019ll check for you.BUSH: Check it out.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: Senator briefly.CRUZ: Thanks for coming back to me, Maria. Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground. Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere. They discussed how \u2014 how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers. They\u2019re protectionist.History suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they\u2019ll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I\u2019ve introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...(APPLAUSE)... and here\u2019s the critical point, Maria \u2014 the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they\u2019re border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.It\u2019s tax-free \u2014 a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers \u2014 and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax. It\u2019s like a tariff, but here\u2019s the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there\u2019s no reciprocal...(BELL RINGS)... tariffs that come against us. It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...(UNKNOWN): Maria...CRUZ: ... and as president, I\u2019m going to fight for the working men and women.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: We\u2019ve got to get to tax reform, gentlemen. We\u2019ve got to get to tax reform, and we\u2019ve got to get to the...(UNKNOWN): Yeah, but I want to talk about taxes.BARTIROMO: ... we\u2019ve got to get to the national debt as well. Coming up next, the growing national debt, the war on crime, tax reform. More from North Charleston, South Carolina, when we come right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate here in North Charleston. Right back to the questions.(APPLAUSE)Governor Christie, we have spoken much about cutting spending, given the $19 trillion debt. But according to one report, America needs $3.6 trillion in infrastructure spending by 2020.Here in South Carolina, 11 percent of bridges are considered structurally deficient, costing drivers a billion dollars a year in auto repairs. What is your plan to fix the ailing roads and bridges without breaking the bank?CHRISTIE: Well, I\u2019m glad you asked that, Maria. Here\u2019s \u2014 here\u2019s our plan. We\u2019ve all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world \u2014 and we double tax, as you know.And what that\u2019s led to over $2 trillion of American companies\u2019 monies that are being kept offshore, because they don\u2019t want to pay the second tax. And who can blame them? They pay tax once overseas. They don\u2019t want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given \u2014 bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.Bring the money \u2014 the $2 trillion \u2014 back to the United States. We\u2019ll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money. And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.It would not necessitate us raising any taxes. It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about. And \u2014 and \u2014 and the last piece of this, Maria, is this. You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America. He\u2019s penalized \u2014 and doesn\u2019t understand. In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.You\u2019ve seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration. That\u2019s wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country. We\u2019d rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we\u2019d work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.And remember this \u2014 I\u2019m credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I\u2019ve vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history. We don\u2019t need to raise taxes to get this done.We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir. Dr. Carson...(APPLAUSE)... it is true U.S. companies have $2 trillion in cash sitting overseas right now. That could be used for investment and jobs in America.Also, several companies right now are pursuing mergers to move their corporate headquarters abroad, and take advantage of much lower taxes. What will you do to stop the flow of companies building cash away from America, and those leaving America altogether?CARSON: Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that\u2019s what we have proposed. A flat tax for everybody \u2014 no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money. You know, I \u2014 my \u2014 my mother taught me this. You know, she only had a third-grade education, but \u2014 you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn\u2019t make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car. In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation. But...(LAUGHTER)... you know, the \u2014 the \u2014 the fact of the matter is \u2014 you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations \u2014 because every regulation is a tax, it\u2019s a \u2014 on goods and services. And it\u2019s the most regressive tax there is.You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up \u2014 you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that. A rich person does not. Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our \u2014 our \u2014 our people like this. And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it\u2019s those evil rich people.It\u2019s not the evil rich people. It\u2019s the evil government that is \u2014 that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can\u2019t survive.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.Senator Rubio...TRUMP: Maria \u2014 Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion. It\u2019s one of the biggest problems our country has. Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs \u2014 leave them behind. They\u2019re leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can\u2019t get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in. But they can\u2019t get along. They can\u2019t even make a deal.Here is the case, they both agree, they can\u2019t make a deal. We have to do something. Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have. So many companies are going to leave our country.BARTIROMO: Which is why we raised it.Senator Rubio?Thank you, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: Thank you.BARTIROMO: One of the biggest fiscal challenges is our entitlement programs, particularly Social Security and Medicare. What policies will you put forward to make sure these programs are more financially secure?RUBIO: Well, first let me address the tax issue because it\u2019s related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: Here is the one thing I\u2019m not going to do. I\u2019m not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan. It\u2019s called the value added tax. And it\u2019s a tax you find in many companies in Europe.Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.And that\u2019s why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that\u2019s what Ronald Reagan said. Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.Now, you can support one now that\u2019s very low. But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors. Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job. And therefore, they don\u2019t get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.When I am president of the United States, I\u2019m going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you senator.CRUZ: Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.BARTIROMO: Senator Cruz, yes. You were meant to. Yes, of course.CRUZ: Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat. A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.This is a business flat tax. It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax. It goes away. It enables us to eliminate the death tax.If you\u2019re a farmer, if you\u2019re a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone. We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes. And listen, there is a real difference between Marco\u2019s tax plan and mine.Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent. Marco\u2019s top tax rate is 35 percent. My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS. Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity. We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...(BELL RINGS)... the mandates and have a simple flat tax. The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan. I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan\u2019s chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.BARTIROMO: Thank you senator.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: But that\u2019s not an accurate description of the plan. Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that\u2019s going to collect your vat tax. Someone\u2019s going to be collecting this tax.In fact, Ronald Reagan\u2019s treasury, when Ronald Reagan\u2019s treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found? That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax. Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make. They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.So there are people watching tonight in business. If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from? You\u2019re going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don\u2019t see it on the bill.And that\u2019s why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold. You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government. Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at. But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...(BELL RINGS)and they decide, we\u2019re going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we\u2019re going to raise the income tax to 30 percent. Now, you\u2019ve got Europe.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Thank you senator. I have to get to a question for Mr. Trump.CRUZ: Maria...BARTIROMO: Yes.CRUZ: Maria, I\u2019d just like to say...(CROSSTALK)CHRISTIE: Maria, I\u2019d like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements. Do you remember that, everybody? This was a question on entitlements.And the reason \u2014 and the reason...(CROSSTALK)CHRISTIE: ... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it. Here\u2019s the thing.(CROSSTALK)CHRISTIE: The fact is, the reason why...RUBIO: If you\u2019ll answer the (inaudible) core question.CHRISTIE: ... the fact is \u2014 the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s a hard problem. And I\u2019m the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this \u2014 avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes. Bernie Sanders has already said it. And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she\u2019s moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress \u2014 this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund. A Republican Congress did that.And the fact is it was wrong. And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security. We need to reform Social Security. Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that\u2019s why I\u2019m answering your question.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Governor. Thank you, Governor.(APPLAUSE) CARSON: Can I just add one very quick thing? And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan. And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best. Just want to get that out there, just saying.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Dr. Carson.Coming up, how would the candidates protect America, and another terror attack, if we were to see it. But first, you can join us live on stage during the commercial break right from home. Go to facebook.com/foxbusiness. We\u2019ll be streaming live and answering your questions during this break next.More from South Carolina coming up. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Mr. Trump, your net worth is in the multi-billions of dollars and have an ongoing thriving hotel and real estate business. Are you planning on putting your assets in a blind trust should you become president? With such vast wealth, how difficult will it be for you to disentangle yourself from your business and your money and prioritize America\u2019s interest first?TRUMP: Well, it\u2019s an interesting question because I\u2019m very proud of my company. As you too know, I know I built a very great company. But if I become president, I couldn\u2019t care less about my company. It\u2019s peanuts.I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again. I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there. Run the company kids, have a good time. I\u2019m going to do it for America.So I would \u2014 I would be willing to do that.BARTIROMO: So you\u2019ll put your assets in a blind trust?TRUMP: I would put it in a blind trust. Well, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it. If that\u2019s a blind trust, I don\u2019t know. But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn\u2019t ever be involved because I wouldn\u2019t care about anything but our country, anything.BARTIROMO: Thank you sir.TRUMP: Thank you.CAVUTO: Governor Christie, going back to your U.S. Attorney days, you had been praised by both parties as certainly a tough law and order guy. So I wonder what you make of recent statistics that showed violent crimes that have been spiking sometimes by double digit ratings in 30 cities across the country. Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn said, \u201cmost local law enforcement officials feel abandoned by Washington.\u201d Former NYC Police Chief Ray Kelly, says that, \u201cpolice are being less proactive because they\u2019re being overly scrutinized and second guessed and they\u2019re afraid of being sued or thrown in jail.\u201dWhat would you do as president to address this?CHRISTIE: Well, first off, let\u2019s face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey. He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan. He said, \u201cthere\u2019s a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country.\u201d Here\u2019s why, the president of the United States and both his attorney\u2019s general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.That\u2019s the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president. Every time he\u2019s got a chance, going all the way back to \u2014 remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time. This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey. I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here\u2019s the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country. That\u2019s where crime is happening in these cities where they don\u2019t enforce the immigration laws. And this president turns his back \u2014 this president doesn\u2019t enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn\u2019t agree with them.And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that\u2019s illegal. This president allows lawlessness throughout this country. Here\u2019s what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General. I\u2019d say, \u201cGeneral, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively. Make our streets safe again. Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them.\u201dWe do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well. I\u2019m the only person on this stage who\u2019s done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.CAVUTO: Thank you governor.Governor Kasich, as someone has to deal with controversial police shootings in your own state, what do you make of Chicago\u2019s move recently to sort of retrain police? Maybe make them not so quick to use their guns?KASICH: Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat. She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety. KASICH: And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.KASICH: And they came back with 23 recommendations. One of them is a statewide use of deadly force. And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio. Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for \u2014 for training.But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police. Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not \u2014 not to lose their life. Their family is waiting for them.At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn\u2019t work for them, but works against them.See, in Ohio, we\u2019ve had some controversial decisions. But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong. And it has been a remarkable situation in our state. And as president of the United States, it\u2019s all about communication, folks. It\u2019s all about getting people to listen to one another\u2019s problems.And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have. Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed. I\u2019ve heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I\u2019ve got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can\u2019t do it alone. You\u2019ve got to bring people together. You\u2019ve got to give people hope.And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America. And that is what\u2019s so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Thank you, Governor.BARTIROMO: Senator Rubio?(APPLAUSE)Under current law, the U.S. is on track to issue more new permanent immigrants on green cards over the next five years than the entire population of South Carolina. The CBO says your 2013 immigration bill would have increased green cardholders by another 10 million over 10 years.Why are you so interested in opening up borders to foreigners when American workers have a hard enough time finding work?RUBIO: Well, first of all, this is an issue that\u2019s been debated now for 30 years. And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who\u2019s in this country, maybe they\u2019re here illegally, but they\u2019re looking for a job. This issue is not about that anymore.First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe. And here\u2019s why. There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system. And not just green cards. They\u2019re looking \u2014 they\u2019re recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances. They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.They\u2019re looking \u2014 they\u2019re looking to manipulate our \u2014 the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States. So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States. So whether it\u2019s green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I\u2019m president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.BARTIROMO: So your thinking has changed?RUBIO: The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago. Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally. They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS. Because they\u2019re recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees. We know this for a fact. They\u2019ve contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border. And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I\u2019m president we will.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Senator.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida. We had Boko Haram. We had Hamas. We had Hezbollah. We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America. It\u2019s the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it\u2019s clear now, that border security is national security.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you, Senator.CRUZ: It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama\u2019s power to let in Syrian refugees. It enabled him \u2014 the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.I think that\u2019s a mistake. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been leading the fight to stop it. And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries. I voted yes to suspend that. Marco voted on the other side. So you don\u2019t get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.RUBIO: Maria, let me clear something up here. This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration. RUBIO: Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you\u2019re against it. You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you\u2019re against it. You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you\u2019re against it. You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.And by the way, it\u2019s not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you\u2019re against it. I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.(APPLAUSE)That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation. When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant. Edward Snowden is a traitor. And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.(APPLAUSE)And one more point, one more point. Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it. Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz. In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.Here\u2019s the bottom line, and I\u2019ll close with this. If I\u2019m president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: There\u2019s \u2014 look, there\u2019s \u2014CAVUTO: Gentlemen, gentlemen \u2014CRUZ: I\u2019m going to get a response to that, Neil. There\u2019s no way he launches 11 attack \u2014CAVUTO: Very quick, very quick. CRUZ: I\u2019m going to \u2014 he had no fewer than 11 attacks there. I appreciate your dumping your (inaudible) research folder on the debate stage.RUBIO: No, it\u2019s your record.CRUZL But I will say \u2014CAVUTO: Do you think they like each other?CRUZ: \u2014 at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false. They\u2019re absolutely false.AUDIENCE: Boo.CRUZ: So let\u2019s start \u2014 let\u2019s start with immigration. Let\u2019s start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity. Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty. I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King. Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals. I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion. What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it\u2019s simply not true. And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.CAVUTO: All right, gentlemen, we\u2019ve got to stop. I know you are very passionate about that.(APPLAUSE)Governor Bush, fears have gripped this country obviously, and you touched on it earlier since the San Bernardino attacks. Since our last debate, the national conversation has changed, according to Facebook data as well.Now this first graphic shows the issues that were most talked about right before those attacks and now after: the issues of Islam, homeland security and ISIS now loom very large. The FBI says Islamic radicals are using social media to communicate and that it needs better access to communication. Now the CEO of Apple, Governor, Tim Cook said unless served with a warrant private communication is private, period. Do you agree, or would you try to convince him otherwise?BUSH: I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators \u2014 back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country. We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff \u2014CAVUTO: Would you answer this question?BUSH: Oh, I\u2019ll talk about that, too. But you haven\u2019t asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I\u2019d get that off my chest if you don\u2019t mind.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO: Fair enough. So Tim Cook \u2014 so Tim Cook says he\u2019s going to keep it private.BUSH: I got that. And the problem today is there\u2019s no confidence in Washington, D.C. There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies. They understand that there\u2019s a national security risk. We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they\u2019re not fearful of a lawsuit.We need to make sure that we keep the country safe. This is the first priority. The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely. Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is \u2014 that is just shameful. 23 million files in the hands of the Chinese? So it\u2019s not just the government \u2014 the private sector companies, it\u2019s also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well. That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.CAVUTO: But if Tim cook is telling you no, Mr. President.BUSH: You\u2019ve got to keep asking. You\u2019ve got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue. If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship \u2014CAVUTO: Do you ask or do you order? BUSH: Well, if the law would change, yeah. But I think there has to be recognition that if we \u2014 if we are too punitive, then you\u2019ll go to other \u2014 other technology companies outside the United States. And what we want to do is to control this.We also want to dominate this from a commercial side. So there\u2019s a lot of balanced interests. But the president leads in this regard. That\u2019s what we need. We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you\u2019re talking about amendments that don\u2019t even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.CAVUTO: Governor, thank you.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: When we come right back, closing statements. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Candidates, it is time for your closing statements. You get 60 seconds each.Governor John Kasich, we begin with you.KASICH: You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don\u2019t have the power. You know, they feel like if they don\u2019t have a lobbyist, if they\u2019re not wealthy, that somehow they don\u2019t get to play.But all of my career, you know, having been raised in \u2014 by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English. You see, all of my career, I\u2019ve fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.Whether it\u2019s welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it\u2019s engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it\u2019s taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.Look, that\u2019s who I stand up for. That\u2019s who\u2019s in my mind(BELL RINGS)And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you\u2019re the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Governor Bush?BUSH: Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer? Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I\u2019ve laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.Credibility counts. There\u2019ll be people here that will talk about what they\u2019re going to do. I\u2019ve done it. I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Governor Chris Christie?CHRISTIE: Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week \u2014 the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they\u2019re feeling.They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore. They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn\u2019t understand their pain, and doesn\u2019t have any plan for getting away from it.I love this country. It\u2019s the most exceptional country the world has ever known. We need someone to fight for the people. We need a fighter for this country again.I\u2019ve lived my whole life fighting \u2014 fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.But here\u2019s the best way that we\u2019re going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Dr. Ben Carson?CARSON: You know, in recent travels around this country, I\u2019ve encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.We\u2019re not going to solve this problem with traditional politics. The only way we\u2019re going to solve this problem is with we, the people. And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity. Bencarson.com \u2014 we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Senator Marco Rubio?RUBIO: You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don\u2019t come from government. Our rights come from God.That\u2019s why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world. That\u2019s why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel. This country is changing. It feels different. We feel like we\u2019re being left behind and left out.And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn\u2019t interested in fixing America. We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military. And that\u2019s why 2016 is a turning point in our history. If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.But if we elect the right person \u2014 if you elect me \u2014 we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Senator Ted Cruz?CRUZ: \u201c13 Hours\u201d \u2014 tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them. I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who\u2019s responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter. This will end. It will end on January 2017.And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Mr. Donald Trump?TRUMP: I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers. They\u2019re tough, they\u2019re strong, they\u2019re great people. Half of them had tears pouring down their face. They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads. It was a terrible sight. A terrible sight. And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion. If I\u2019m president, there won\u2019t be stupid deals anymore.We will make America great again. We will win on everything we do. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Candidates, thank you.CAVUTO: Gentlemen, thank you all. All of you. That wraps up our debate. We went a little bit over here. But we wanted to make sure everyone was able to say their due. He\u2019s upset. All right. Thank you for joining us. Much more to come in the Spin Room ahead.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Popularity Hits New Heights in Latest National Poll", "Date": "2016-01-14", "News": "Donald J. Trump\u2019s popularity has climbed to its highest level to date less than a month before the first Republican votes will be cast, according to a national NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released Thursday that shows Republicans becoming increasingly comfortable with the idea of the billionaire businessman being their presidential nominee.The survey found that 33 percent of likely Republican primary voters support Mr. Trump, with Senator Ted Cruz of Texas trailing him in second place at 20 percent. Mr. Trump\u2019s lead has more than doubled from a month ago, when he was beating Mr. Cruz by 27 percent to 22 percent.In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has been attacking Mr. Cruz more directly, raising questions about the senator\u2019s Cuban heritage and his Canadian roots to create doubt over whether he is even eligible to run for president. Mr. Cruz was born in Calgary, Alberta, and his mother is an American citizen.Trailing Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz are Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, at 13 percent, and Ben Carson,at 12 percent. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Jeb Bush are further behind, each with\u00c2\u00a05 percent.The crowded field appears to be helping Mr. Trump, according to the poll, which shows him winning a hypothetical three-way race against Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio. However, in a head-to-head match-up he trails Mr. Cruz by eight percentage points.Mr. Trump has also made significant headway when it comes to voters being comfortable with the idea of backing him.In March, just 23 percent of Republican primary voters said they could envision themselves supporting his candidacy. Now, 65 percent say they could see themselves supporting him. Mr. Bush\u2019s fortunes have faded almost as drastically as Mr. Trump\u2019s have risen, as just 42 percent can see themselves supporting the former Florida governor, down from 75 percent in June.The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Finding a Common Thread\u00a0in the Al Jazeera Doping Report", "Date": "2016-01-05", "News": "Supported bySports of The Times\u201cTo be clear,\u201d Sly said, \u201cI am recanting any such statements, and there is no truth to any statement of mine.\u201dManning denounced Sly as a liar, as did the quarterback\u2019s spokesman, Ari Fleischer, who accused Al Jazeera of deeply irresponsible journalism.\u201cAl Jazeera is backtracking and retreating,\u201d said Fleischer, a former press secretary for President George W. Bush.Maybe they are right. Maybe Sly is a truth-challenged, unmade bed of a man who spins slanderous tales. Or maybe, as Sly claimed, he intentionally fed misleading information to Al Jazeera\u2019s undercover reporter.I listened, and I read the transcripts of the Al Jazeera video recordings as Sly spoke with great detail and expertise about doping and tossed out several athletes\u2019 names: Howard and another baseball player, Ryan Zimmerman, and Manning and his fellow football players Mike Neal and Dustin Keller.As I turned over the possibility that Sly had lied to the undercover reporter, I kept coming back to the names. Why these specific athletes?With the help of my New York Times colleagues Ken Belson and Doris Burke, I scrutinized the list of names, and it soon appeared less random than at first blush. Nearly all of the athletes Sly named are clients of Jason Riley, a fitness trainer based in Sarasota, Fla.Here is where Sly\u2019s story becomes more intriguing.Sly is a business partner of Riley\u2019s. When Sly applied for a pharmacist\u2019s license in Florida, he used Riley\u2019s home address.Riley and Sly founded Elementz Nutrition, a nutritional supplement company whose website and Facebook page feature many of the athletes Sly mentioned on camera. Zimmerman was featured on the website; Howard, Neal and Keller (who is also featured on the website) appeared on the Facebook page. In one photograph on Facebook, Riley poses at his gym, the Compound, between the mountainous Howard and the no less imposing Neal.Riley\u2019s work as a trainer is so celebrated that he was called \u201cbaseball\u2019s M.V.P. of the post-steroids era\u201d by Men\u2019s Fitness magazine. Significant caveats are in order here: No evidence has emerged linking Jeter to performance-enhancing drugs, and Sly did not connect him to banned substances, although he boasted of helping other athletes obtain them. And a connection to Sly, Riley or anyone else is hardly proof of any wrongdoing.Sly and Riley did not respond to several interview requests. An email sent to Elementz\u2019s angel investor, Janis Krums, went unanswered. Jeter\u2019s agent, Casey Close, did not respond.Mum\u2019s the word on the west coast of Florida.Howard and Zimmerman let their lawyer, William Burck, address the Al Jazeera documentary: He called it reckless, wholly false and unsubstantiated. On Tuesday, both players filed suit against Al Jazeera.Manning, too, has rumbled about filing a lawsuit. Zimmerman\u2019s photo disappeared from the Elementz website last week.As for Neal, the Green Bay Packers linebacker, Sly described him as a close friend. Neal went to Merrillville High School in Indiana, about a 90-minute drive from where Sly went to high school. In the documentary, Sly said that he had spent about six weeks in Green Bay and that Neal, who served a four-game suspension for doping in 2012, had introduced him to about half the team.None of this amused Neal.\u201cI\u2019m sure you saw how pissed off Peyton Manning was about somebody coming out with false accusations,\u201d he told reporters last week. \u201cSo if you want to piss me off, that\u2019s one thing. But please don\u2019t.\u201dThe Elementz Facebook site features several photos of Neal: \u201cMike Neal dedicated to Nutrition programs to maximize his career longevity.\u201dIt\u2019s difficult to get worked up over the possible doping of football players. N.F.L. players are the closest approximation we have to gladiators, and some ingest or shoot up whatever is needed to get them through another bloody and bruised Sunday, Monday or Thursday. Pain, and the specter of brain trauma, will be their lifelong companions.But what to make of Sly? In the end, this story hinges on his credibility. A man who operates in the athletic shadows, he was confronted with his hours of undercover interviews and recanted. He proclaimed himself an idle boaster.What was he supposed to do, if what he had said was true? Acknowledge it and allow his words to become his manacles?The Al Jazeera documentary was only the latest report to reveal sports doping as a spider\u2019s web that stretches across continents and oceans. You wonder if the pro league chieftains, Rob Manfred in baseball and the N.F.L. sachem Roger Goodell, have paid attention, and have the stomach to pursue these strands.They might want to hurry. Last week, Elementz Nutrition voluntarily dissolved and closed its doors.Because of an editing error, a picture caption on Wednesday with the Sports of The Times column, about a common thread linking some of the key figures in an Al Jazeera documentary on doping in professional sports, misstated, in some editions, the origin of the picture of Charles Sly, a pharmacist featured in the documentary. It was from the YouTube video in which Sly retracted his assertions in the documentary, not from the documentary itself.Email: powellm@nytimes.com Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fake Online Locksmiths May Be Out to Pick Your Pocket, Too", "Date": "2016-01-30", "News": "Supported byMaybe this has happened to you.Locked out of your car or home, you pull out your phone and type \u201clocksmith\u201d into Google. Up pops a list of names, the most promising of which appear beneath the paid ads, in space reserved for local service companies.You might assume that the search engine\u2019s algorithm has instantly sifted through the possibilities and presented those that are near you and that have earned good customer reviews. Some listings will certainly fit that description. But odds are good that your results include locksmiths that are not locksmiths at all.They are call centers \u2014 often out of state, sometimes in a different country \u2014 that use a high-tech ruse to trick Google into presenting them as physical stores in your neighborhood. These operations, known as lead generators, or lead gens for short, keep a group of poorly trained subcontractors on call. After your details are forwarded, usually via text, one of those subcontractors jumps in a car and heads to your vehicle or home. That is when the trouble starts.The goal of lead gens is to wrest as much money as possible from every customer, according to lawsuits. The typical approach is for a phone representative to offer an estimate in the range of $35 to $90. On site, the subcontractor demands three or four times that sum, often claiming that the work was more complicated than expected. Most consumers simply blanch and pay up, in part because they are eager to get into their homes or cars.\u201cIt was very late, and it was very cold,\u201d said Anna Pietro, recalling an evening last January when she called Allen Emergency, the nearest locksmith to her home in a Dallas suburb, according to a Google Maps search on her iPhone. \u201cThis guy shows up and says he needs to drill my door lock, which will cost $350, about seven times the estimate I\u2019d been given on the phone. And he demanded cash.\u201dThe phone number at Allen Emergency is now disconnected.Lead gens have their deepest roots in locksmithing, but the model has migrated to an array of services, including garage door repair, carpet cleaning, moving and home security. Basically, they surface in any business where consumers need someone in the vicinity to swing by and clean, fix, relocate or install something.\u201cI\u2019m not exaggerating when I say these guys have people in every large and midsize city in the United States,\u201d said John Ware, an assistant United States attorney in St. Louis, speaking of lead-gen locksmiths.A Google spokesman said that the company worked hard to check bad actors and quickly removed listings that violate its policies.But the company is still too easily tricked into listing lead gens, high up, even after years of redesigns and algorithm adjustments, critics say. Local service results have improved of late, but too many consumers are still getting ripped off because Google, the world\u2019s biggest search engine, is perennially a step behind a group of sophisticated swindlers, according to experts in the field.The flaws in the Google machine are well known to Avi, an Israeli-born locksmith, who asked that his last name be omitted from this story, citing threats by competitors. (\u201cOne told me there is a bounty on my head,\u201d he said.) Avi has been at war with lead-gen operators for eight years. It\u2019s like guerrilla combat, because the companies are forever expanding and always innovating, he said.The company\u2019s website at the time listed six physical locations, including a pinkish, two-story building at 10275 West Santa Fe Drive, Sun City, Ariz. When Avi looked up that address in Google Maps, he saw in the bottom left-hand corner a street-view image of the same pinkish building at the end of a retail strip.There seemed no reason to doubt that a pinkish building stood at 10275 West Santa Fe Drive.Avi was skeptical. \u201cThat\u2019s about a five-minute drive from here,\u201d he said.We jumped in his car. It wasn\u2019t long before the voice in his GPS announced, \u201cYou have arrived.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the address,\u201d he said. He was pointing to a low white-brick wall that ran beside a highway. There was no pinkish building and no stores. Other than a large, featureless warehouse on the other side of the street, there was little in sight.\u201cThis is what I\u2019m dealing with,\u201d Avi said. \u201cGhosts.\u201d(Yes, Google makes money every time a person clicks on an AdWords ad, and yes, in the case of locksmiths, the cost can be $30 for every click \u2014 even more in some cities. If you\u2019ve ever wondered how Google gives away services and is still among the most profitable companies in the world, wonder no more. People clicking AdWords generated $60 billion last year.)In a search for locksmiths in Mountain View, Calif., home to Google\u2019s headquarters, the first AdWords listing was 24hourlocksmithsanjose.net, which offered $19 service. Research into the company\u2019s domain name revealed that it is owned by Yossi Assraf of Locksmith Advertising, in Portland, Ore.Those have all the trappings of a lead gen. And, 247 Locksmith Advertising has an F rating from the Better Business Bureau, along with a list of nearly identical complaints.\u201cOver all the cost was $200!!\u201d wrote one unhappy customer, who had been expecting to pay $19. \u201cThis was a complete bait and switch!\u201dMessages left for Yossi Assraf were not returned.Recently, I sent Google the ad for 24hourlocksmithsanjose, as well as a screen shot of the fake Locksmith Force building and the names of about 20 other locksmiths that appeared to be lead gens. The company asked for a few days to look into the matter.National data that could capture the scale of the lead-gen problem does not exist, largely because most of the complaints occur at the state level, by way of attorneys general, Better Business Bureaus and Yelp. Also, the sums involved are usually modest, so many people have no idea they have been swindled, or they know but don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth anyone\u2019s while to contact the authorities.\u201cTalk to anyone in the business and they\u2019ll tell you that revenue is down 30 to 40 percent,\u201d said Mark Baldino, who owns a handful of locksmith stores in the Washington area. \u201cThere are 10 fake locations around me, and consumers have no idea which of us is real and which is going to rip them off.\u201dThe difference between people like Mr. Baldino and locksmiths sent by lead gens is not just a physical storefront; excellent locksmiths work out of cars and vans, too. Lead-gen locksmiths are essentially short-term hires, and their priority is not repeat customers. It\u2019s quick cash.Many of the locksmith lead gens are run by Israelis, and Avi learned their modus operandi by working for them. When he landed at La Guardia Airport in 2008, he wanted to work with computers, the field he had trained for in Israel. But it was the height of the recession, and he did not have many options.\u201cAt the time, if you were an Israeli, it was either carpet cleaning or locksmithing,\u201d he said. \u201cI tried carpet cleaning for a week and hurt my back so badly, I said this is not for me.\u201dA company in New Jersey, owned by an Israeli, hired him, gave him a week of training and told him he could keep 40 percent of every job. His instructions were to size up each customer and ask for as much money as possible. He quit, found an honest shop, eventually earned enough to open his own company and relocated to Phoenix.Many of the recruits later establish their own lead-gen operations, which then recruit more talent. This has increased competition and made deceiving Google an ever more esoteric pursuit. That was evident during a conversation with Roy Alverado, the owner of Locksmith Force, the company that created the fake pink building in Sun City. He insisted that he ran an authentic local business, with trained and courteous locksmiths.As for that fake building: \u201cWe wanted to have a store in that area, but the rents were too high,\u201d he said. He told a web design firm to create a building using Photoshop. Actually, all but one of the buildings are Photoshop creations, since Locksmith Force\u2019s sole physical location is in Phoenix, Mr. Alverado said. The more buildings on the site, he candidly stated, the more people would believe they were calling someone who could show up at a car or house quickly.Mr. Alverado said those fake buildings were necessary because getting to the first page in Google results now took ingenuity and cunning.\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d he said, sounding a little weary when asked about competition. Israelis were his toughest rivals, he said, and they had instilled a kind of awe in him. \u201cI can tell you point-blank, they are freaking smart,\u201d he said. \u201cI really admire them.\u201dA few months ago, he decided that he needed some help with search engine optimization. A company called Over the Top SEO showed up on the first page of an \u201cSEO company\u201d search, so he figured it was very good. Then he saw that the company was based in Israel. Mr. Alverado was sold. If he couldn\u2019t beat the Israelis, he would hire them.\u201cWe\u2019re already seeing great results,\u201d he said.Even with the rise of Facebook and improvements to Apple Maps, Google is still the essential source of revenue for local businesses \u2014 85 percent of all local search traffic reaches local businesses through Google, according to Mike Blumenthal, who writes a definitive blog on the topic.To understand how lead gens game Google\u2019s algorithm, you need to know a bit about how a company\u2019s address winds up in Google\u2019s results, and how those results can be fraudulently altered. Few know the particulars better than Bryan Seely, who worked for a lead-gen outfit in the automotive glass repair field, based in Southern California, from 2008 to 2010. During that time, he produced about 3,000 fake auto glass repair listings across the country. Eventually appalled by his handiwork, he became what he calls a reformed hacker and explained his techniques in a self-published book, \u201cCyber Fraud: The Web of Lies.\u201d\u201cMy hope was that the book would cause Google to patch up these holes,\u201d he said on the phone recently. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work.\u201dBoth Google My Business and Map Maker are a bit like Wikipedia, insofar as they are largely built and maintained by millions of contributors. Keeping the system open, with verification, gives countless businesses an invaluable online presence. Google officials say that the system is so good that many local companies do not bother building their own websites. Anyone who has ever navigated using Google Maps knows the service is a technological wonder.But the very quality that makes Google\u2019s systems accessible to companies that want to be listed makes them vulnerable to pernicious meddling.\u201cThis is what you get when you rely on crowdsourcing for all your \u2018up to date\u2019 and \u2018relevant\u2019 local business content,\u201d Mr. Seely said. \u201cYou get people who contribute meaningful content, and you get people who abuse the system.\u201dThe most obvious symptom of abuse is a wild proliferation of lead-gen listings. Charles Eastwood, a locksmith in Phoenix, subpoenaed Acxiom, a data brokerage firm, as part of a lawsuit he filed against a group of purported lead gens in 2010. He wanted to know how many locksmiths were listed in Arizona.\u201cThere were 9,600 of them in the list I got from Acxiom,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s about 9,000 more than anyone believes actually work in the state.\u201dTo fight lead gens, Google deploys a little-known army of volunteers, called Mappers, many of whom are engaged in a contest that takes wit and stamina. These are people around the world who propose and approve edits to Google Maps, with an assist from Google employees, all in the interest of refining the product and fighting spam \u2014 a term that in this context means anything fake and misleading.It may seem bizarre that people would work gratis for one of the world\u2019s richest companies. But many Mappers turn the job into a calling. For Dan Austin, who lives in Olympia, Wash., it was more like an addiction.A former truck driver for DHL, he became a Mapper after he was laid off from his job and started fixing mistakes he had noticed on Maps while on the road. By the fall of 2011, Mr. Austin had discovered locksmith spam and was soon spending 10 hours a day, seven days a week, deleting it from Maps.\u201cIt was like a video game except it had a moral element to it,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, I\u2019d have wiped out 1,000 locations and I would think, that\u2019s 1,000 phone calls that didn\u2019t get made, 1,000 consumers who didn\u2019t get scammed. I felt like Superman.\u201dMr. Austin became a Regional Lead, the highest rank in Google\u2019s Boy Scout-like badge system of incentives, a job \u2014 still unpaid \u2014 that required him to sign a nondisclosure agreement.He was quickly locked in a struggle that seemed inspired by Cold War spycraft. Some lead-gen owners became Mappers themselves, hoping to stealthily protect their listings. They were essentially moles. One of them, who called himself Baton Sason, contacted Mr. Austin through a private detective.\u201cAt first, he thought I was another spammer,\u201d Mr. Austin recalled. When Mr. Sason realized that Mr. Austin was truly on Google\u2019s side, he tried to win amnesty for his sites in exchange for help informing on his competitors. Mr. Austin played along for a few months, then deleted Mr. Sason\u2019s sites too.Initially, Mr. Austin regarded Google as a benign Goliath that cared about consumers and small businesses. But about 18 months after his campaign began, pessimism crept in. He realized, he said, that spammers were changing tactics much faster than Google was adopting countermeasures.\u201cFor me, it was always like I was looking at a five-alarm fire,\u201d he said. \u201cTo them, it was smoldering.\u201dBy the fall of 2012, Mr. Austin was disillusioned. He decided that the subtle approach to getting attention wasn\u2019t working. So he did something obnoxious. In the middle of the Google Map of Los Angeles, he placed a marijuana grow house. Not a dispensary, which is legal. A grow house, which is a place where plants are harvested. Those are illegal. Then he highlighted the stunt on a Map Maker forum.The plan was to demonstrate that it was too easy to hoodwink Google. The plan failed. Google fired him from his unpaid job. (A Google spokesman declined to comment.)Today, Mr. Austin has the faintly bitter tone of a man who has left a cult, but he is cleareyed about why Google never seemed to respond quickly enough to spammers. It wasn\u2019t a priority, he said. The company is dominated by software coders, and they want to solve the most interesting problems, or create the coolest products.\u201cFighting spam is boring,\u201d Mr. Austin said. \u201cThe employees who cared didn\u2019t have the political clout in the company. I\u2019d hear Googlers say, \u2018Maps is a mess. It\u2019s known at the highest levels, but we don\u2019t talk about it publicly.\u2019\u201dLittle, it seems, went right after that. One defendant fled the country, according to prosecutors. In 2013, a federal magistrate judge recommended dismissing the case because the government had deported four witnesses, all of them former Dependable employees who might have helped the defendants. The judge also suggested that the case would be difficult for the prosecution to win because Dependable phone representatives usually added the phrase \u201cand up\u201d when quoting prices.One of the prosecutors, Mr. Ware, the assistant United States attorney in St. Louis, respectfully disagreed with those findings.\u201cNinety percent of people were charged more than the estimate,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had locksmiths tell us that they would take whatever they could get from customers.\u201dOne lesson of the Dependable case, which took years from inception to dismissal, is that the criminal courts are a terrible way to fight purported lead-gen locksmiths. Civil cases have fared no better. Mr. Baldino, the locksmith in Washington area, lost a case against Google and other directories in which he said the companies commingled legitimate and illegitimate players in listings. Last February, a Virginia state court found that Google had immunity under the Communications Decency Act, which extends to all information that does not originate with Google \u2014 \u201ceven when given notice that it has published false information,\u201d the court concluded.Only Google, it seems, can fix Google. The company is trying, its representatives say, by, among other things, removing fake information quickly and providing a \u201cReport a Problem\u201d tool on the maps. After looking over the fake Locksmith Force building, a bunch of other lead-gen advertisers in Phoenix and that Mountain View operation with more than 800 websites, Google took action.Not only has the fake Locksmith Force building vanished from Google Maps, but the company no longer turns up in a \u201clocksmith Phoenix\u201d search. At least not in the first 20 pages. Nearly all the other spammy locksmiths pointed out to Google have disappeared from results, too.\u201cWe\u2019re in a constant arms race with local business spammers who, unfortunately, use all sorts of tricks to try to game our system and who\u2019ve been a thorn in the Internet\u2019s side for over a decade,\u201d a Google spokesman wrote in an email. \u201cAs spammers change their techniques, we\u2019re continually working on new, better ways to keep them off Google Search and Maps. There\u2019s work to do, and we want to keep doing better.\u201dThere was no mention of a stronger verification system or a beefed-up spam team at Google. Without such systemic solutions, Google\u2019s critics say, the change to local results will not rise even to the level of superficial.Apprised that Locksmith Force had been relegated to the Internet\u2019s version of oblivion, Avi was in no mood to celebrate.\u201cOne down,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cFifty thousand to go.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "David Bowie Dies at 69; Star Transcended Music, Art and Fashion", "Date": "2016-01-11", "News": "Supported by16 PhotosDavid Bowie, the infinitely changeable, fiercely forward-looking songwriter who taught generations of musicians about the power of drama, images and personas, died on Sunday, two days after his 69th birthday.His death was confirmed by his publicist, Steve Martin, on Monday morning. No other details were provided.Mr. Bowie had been treated for cancer for the last 18 months, according to a statement on his social-media accounts. \u201cDavid Bowie died peacefully today surrounded by his family,\u201d a post on his Facebook page read.Mr. Bowie wrote songs, above all, about being an outsider: an alien, a misfit, a sexual adventurer, a faraway astronaut. His music was always a mutable blend \u2014 rock, cabaret, jazz and what he called \u201cplastic soul\u201d \u2014 but it was suffused with genuine soul. He also captured the drama and longing of everyday life, enough to give him No. 1 pop hits like \u201cLet\u2019s Dance.\u201dIn concerts and videos, Mr. Bowie\u2019s costumes and imagery traversed styles, eras and continents, from German Expressionism to commedia dell\u2019arte to Japanese kimonos to spacesuits. He set an example, and a challenge, for every arena spectacle in his wake.If he had an anthem, it was \u201cChanges,\u201d from his 1971 album \u201cHunky Dory,\u201d which proclaimed:Turn and face the strange, Ch-ch-changes,Oh look out now you rock and rollers,Pretty soon now you\u2019re gonna get older.Mr. Bowie\u2019s constantly morphing persona was a touchstone for performers like Madonna and Lady Gaga; his determination to stay contemporary introduced his fans to Philadelphia funk, Japanese fashion, German electronica and drum-and-bass dance music.Yet throughout Mr. Bowie\u2019s metamorphoses, he was always recognizable. His voice was widely imitated but always his own; his message was that there was always empathy beyond difference.Angst and apocalypse, media and paranoia, distance and yearning were among Mr. Bowie\u2019s lifelong themes. So was a penchant for transgression coupled with a determination to push cult tastes toward the mainstream.Mr. Bowie produced albums and wrote songs for some of his idols \u2014 Lou Reed, Iggy Pop, Mott the Hoople \u2014 that gave them pop hits without causing them to abandon their individuality. And he collaborated with musicians like Brian Eno during the late-1970s period that would become known as his Berlin years and, in his final recordings, with the jazz musicians Maria Schneider and Donny McCaslin, introducing them to many new listeners.Mr. Bowie was a person of relentless reinvention. He emerged in the late 1960s with the voice of a rock belter but with the sensibility of a cabaret singer, steeped in the dynamics of stage musicals.He was Major Tom, the lost astronaut in his career-making 1969 hit \u201cSpace Oddity.\u201d He was Ziggy Stardust, the otherworldly pop star at the center of his 1972 album, \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars.\u201dHe was the self-destructive Thin White Duke and the minimalist but heartfelt voice of the three albums he recorded in Berlin in the \u201970s.Mr. Bowie was his generation\u2019s standard-bearer for rock as theater: something constructed and inflated yet sincere in its artifice, saying more than naturalism could. With a voice that dipped down to baritone and leapt into falsetto, he was complexly androgynous, an explorer of human impulses that could not be quantified.He also pushed the limits of \u201cFashion\u201d and \u201cFame,\u201d writing songs with those titles and also thinking deeply about the possibilities and strictures of pop renown.Mr. Bowie was married for more than 20 years to the international model Iman, with whom he had a daughter, Alexandria Zahra Jones. They survive him, as does his son from his marriage to the former Mary Angela Barnett, Duncan Jones, a director best known for the 2009 film \u201cMoon.\u201d In the late 1960s, Lindsay Kemp, a dancer, actor and mime, became a lasting influence on Mr. Bowie, focusing his interest in movement and artifice. Mr. Bowie\u2019s music turned toward folk-rock and psychedelia. The release of \u201cSpace Oddity,\u201d shortly before the Apollo 11 mission put men on the moon in 1969, gained him a British pop audience and, when it was rereleased in 1973 in the United States, an American one.By then, with the albums \u201cHunky Dory,\u201d \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars\u201d and \u201cAladdin Sane,\u201d Mr. Bowie had become a pioneer of glam rock and a major star in Britain, playing up an androgynous image. But he also had difficulties separating his onstage personas from real life and succumbed to drug problems, particularly cocaine use. In 1973, he abruptly announced his retirement \u2014 though it was the retirement of Ziggy Stardust, not of Mr. Bowie.He moved to the United States in 1974 and made \u201cDiamond Dogs,\u201d which included the hit \u201cRebel Rebel.\u201d In 1975, he turned toward funk with the album \u201cYoung Americans,\u201d recorded primarily in Philadelphia with collaborators, including a young Luther Vandross. John Lennon joined Mr. Bowie in writing and singing the hit \u201cFame.\u201d Mr. Bowie\u2019s 1976 album \u201cStation to Station\u201d yielded more hits, but drug problems were making Mr. Bowie increasingly unstable; in interviews, he made pro-fascist pronouncements that he would soon disown.For a far-reaching change of environment, and to get away from drugs, Mr. Bowie moved in 1976 to Switzerland and then to West Berlin, part of a divided city with a sound that fascinated him: the Krautrock of Kraftwerk, Can, Neu! and other groups. Mr. Bowie shared a Berlin apartment with Iggy Pop, and he helped produce and write songs for two Iggy Pop albums, \u201cThe Idiot\u201d and \u201cLust for Life.\u201dHe also made what is usually called his Berlin trilogy \u2014 \u201cLow,\u201d \u201cHeroes\u201d and \u201cLodger\u201d \u2014 working with Mr. Eno and Mr. Bowie\u2019s collaborator over decades, the producer Tony Visconti. They used electronics and experimental methods, like having musicians play unfamiliar instruments, yet songs like \u201c\u2018Heroes\u2019\u201d conveyed romance against the bleakest odds.As the 1980s began, Mr. Bowie turned to live theater, performing in multiple cities (including a Broadway run) in the demanding title role of \u201cThe Elephant Man.\u201d Yet he would also reach his peak as a mainstream pop musician in that decade \u2014 particularly with his 1983 album \u201cLet\u2019s Dance,\u201d which he produced with Nile Rodgers of Chic; the Texas blues guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan also performed on the album. By 1989 Mr. Bowie was determined to change again; he recorded, without top billing, as a member of the rock band Tin Machine.His experiments continued in the 1990s. In 1995, he reconnected with Mr. Eno on an album, \u201c1. Outside,\u201d \u2014 influenced by science fiction and film noir \u2014 that was intended to be the start of a trilogy. Mr. Bowie toured with Nine Inch Nails in an innovative concert that had his band and Nine Inch Nails merging partway through. Mr. Bowie\u2019s 1997 album, \u201cEarthling,\u201d turned toward the era\u2019s electronic dance music.By the 21st century, Mr. Bowie was an elder statesman. He had been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. In 2001, he sang \u201cHeroes\u201d at the Concert for New York City after the Sept. 11 attacks.His last tour, after the release of his album \u201cReality,\u201d ended when he experienced heart problems in 2004. But he continued to lend his imprimatur to newer bands like Arcade Fire, joining them onstage, and TV on the Radio, adding backup vocals in the studio.His final albums were a glance back and a new excursion. \u201cThe Next Day,\u201d released in 2013, returned to something like the glam-rock sound of his 1970s guitar bands, for new songs suffused with bitter thoughts of mortality. And \u201cBlackstar,\u201d released two days before his death, had him backed by a volatile jazz-based quartet, in songs that contemplated fame, spirituality, lust, death and, as always, startling transformations.An earlier version of this obituary referred incorrectly to the group Mr. Bowie collaborated with on \u201cBlackstar.\u201d It is a jazz quartet, not quintet.Caryn Ganz and Juston Jones contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ex-Marine Can Wear Medals He Didn\u2019t Earn. A Court Calls It Free Speech.", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported byA federal court in California has ruled that a former Marine can wear service medals he did not earn, saying that displaying them was a form of free speech.The case involving Elven Joe Swisher, an Idaho man who enlisted in the Marines after the Korean War, touched on a sensitive issue that has wound through Congress and the courts, and has been scrutinized by groups dedicated to confirming when people, either motivated by profit or status, claim to be military heroes but are not.On Monday, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco ruled that Mr. Swisher, who was honorably discharged from the Marines in 1957, had the right to wear the medals, including the Purple Heart and the Silver Star, even though he had not been awarded them.It tossed out a previous conviction of Mr. Swisher, saying that iconic symbols, such as flags or other emblems, were intended as a \u201cshort cut from mind to mind\u201d when conveying ideas, and that \u201cwearing a medal has no purpose other than to communicate a message.\u201dLarry C. Kinard, the national president of the Korean War Veterans Association, refers to himself as \u201clucky\u201d he did not get the Purple Heart, which is awarded to the wounded or dead. He said it was increasingly important to veterans organizations to confirm the claims of those who say they served or were decorated.He said bogus claims were an affront to those like his friend, a former Korean War Marine who lost a leg and an eye.\u201cIt is very important that those who wear any kind of decoration earned what they wear,\u201d said Mr. Kinard, who was deployed in an infantry division north of Seoul in 1952. \u201cAll the organizations do the best they can within the realm of the privacy act to verify that.\u201dThis week it included portions of a narrative that Mr. Swisher had filed in 2001 when seeking disability payments, in which he wrote that he and about 130 other Marines \u201ccame under heavy enemy gunfire\u201d on a hill during a combat mission.The California court\u2019s judgment this week referred to that narrative, saying that in 2001, more than 40 years after his 1957 discharge, Mr. Swisher filed the disability claim saying he had post-traumatic stress syndrome from serving in the secret combat mission in North Korea.His narrative as quoted in the court document described a hospital bedside visit from a captain who presented him with a Purple Heart and who said he had earned several other medals and ribbons, the court document said.In 2004, the government began paying Mr. Swisher\u2019s benefits for post-traumatic stress. But the next year, in an unrelated twist, he wore a Purple Heart during a trial of a man accused of soliciting a murder, apparently to use it to bolster his credibility as a witness.In 2006, the government stopped making his disability payments after it received information that Mr. Swisher\u2019s claims about earning the medals were fraudulent. In 2007, Mr. Swisher was convicted of violating the Stolen Valor Act, which made it a misdemeanor to falsely claim military accomplishments.Monday\u2019s court decision set aside Mr. Swisher\u2019s 2007 conviction, which had gone through several motions and appeals, his lawyer, Joseph T. Horras, said. \u201cHis conviction could not be overturned just because the statute was amended,\u201d he said.Mr. Swisher, now in his late 70s, lives in northern Idaho, retired from work that Mr. Horras said made him a \u201cjack-of-all-trades.\u201dAsked why Mr. Swisher wore medals he did not earn, Mr. Horras said, \u201cThere is a narrative that he wrote and that is essentially his position.\u201d\u201cIt was a constitutional matter rather than a factual matter,\u201d Mr. Horras said, referring to the case. \u201cIt was regardless of what he was saying, whether someone has the right to wear the medal, whether they earned it or not.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "On Display at CES, Tech Ideas in Their Awkward Adolescence", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtBut if news from CES feels especially desultory this year, it might not be the show that\u2019s at fault. Instead, blame the tech cycle. We\u2019re at a weird moment in the industry: The best new stuff is not all that cool, and the coolest stuff isn\u2019t quite ready.It\u2019s not that today\u2019s tech is terrible \u2014 lots of potentially groundbreaking ideas are just around the corner. In product labs across the world, engineers and designers are working to turn a collection of annoying buzzwords \u2014 artificial intelligence, virtual reality, wearables, the \u201cInternet of things,\u201d autonomous cars and drones \u2014 into products that we find irresistible. They are all pushing the limits of what machines can currently accomplish, and working to come up with business models that customers will stomach. In time, after years of experimentation and incremental advances, many of these technologies might become mainstays.But that future will take a few years to pan out. In the meantime, you can expect to be bombarded with early versions of tomorrow\u2019s tech that are bound to feel janky and incomplete. Welcome to Prototype World, a brief intermission in your regularly scheduled program of disruption, during which everything new will more or less stink.\u201cIt\u2019s like the junior high years in technology,\u201d said Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies. \u201cWe\u2019re in those awkward teenage years where everything looks and feels funky.\u201dOver the next couple of CESes, there\u2019s a good chance we will see a lot of devices that will feel not quite ready. Virtual reality will underwhelm, artificial intelligence will feel annoyingly unintelligent, and cars and drones that navigate themselves will seem safer when parked. There will be wearables you won\u2019t want to wear and home devices that will make you want to buy a new place.\u201cIt will eventually cross that hump and become mature, but it\u2019s not there right now,\u201d Mr. Bajarin said.It\u2019s unsurprising that early versions of new tech will be a bit flawed. But what\u2019s unusual about the current moment is how many new, interdependent technologies are coming about at the same time. We\u2019re in the middle of a grand cycle in technology \u2014 the revolution pushed by smartphones, social networks and ubiquitous online servers (that is, the cloud everyone talks about). Over the last decade, these three technologies have altered wide swaths of the business world, destroying and creating hundreds of billions of dollars in wealth in sectors as varied as media and transportation.Venture capitalists are eager to see these trends continue. Fred Wilson, a co-founder of Union Square Ventures, told me he was paying close attention to opportunities for mobile devices and social networks to alter health care, finance and education.Hunter Walk, of the firm Homebrew, echoed this idea. \u201cIt may be true that there\u2019s not a consumer-tech phenomenon that breaks through this year, but the cascading wave of tech goodness from mobile isn\u2019t close to being done when we look at this other part of your life called work,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I\u2019m not bored.\u201dI take his point; we in the press are often quick to become bored and demand the next great thing. And yet, what can I say? I am kind of bored. Even if smartphones and social networks have lots of room to grow before conquering the world, they feel like old, mature tech. This is an industry that moves on anticipation of the next great thing. Artificial intelligence, virtual reality, autonomous vehicles and wearable computers are the building blocks of tomorrow\u2019s great tech cycle. The trouble is, the cycle is just getting started.But how will Apple get there from here? Improving the watch will require lots of fundamental advances over a period of years \u2014 smaller, faster processors and radios; better batteries; better artificial intelligence and voice recognition, among other things. Can Apple provide all that? Probably, and if it doesn\u2019t, some other smartwatch maker will most likely do it. But it won\u2019t happen this year. It might not even happen next year. You\u2019ll just have to wait.Similar advances will also be required to perfect self-driving cars and self-flying drones. Advances in A.I. will also power a set of intelligent assistants far smarter than Siri, some that don\u2019t make you tear your hair out.All this could be grand: A few years from now, if you believe the boosters in Vegas this week, many of us will be shuttling around in self-driving cars, regularly plugging into reality-defying virtual worlds, and adorning ourselves with smart jewelry that will seamlessly integrate our bodies with the Internet. Our homes will be connected, our drones will be autonomous and our phones will sizzle with artificial intelligence.That\u2019s a good vision to keep in mind as you struggle, over the next few years, to get anything to work as it should.Email: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjoo Advertisement"}

But the classmate described Mr. Warmbier as neither actively religious nor political, though a picture on Facebook shows him attending a climate protest in New York in 2014.Other photos on Mr. Warbier\u2019s Facebook page include one of him behind the wheel of a classic American convertible taken in Havana last year. Another, in which he poses beside a cow, includes the caption: \u201cOne picture that captures my compassion for animals, worldly travels, and designer sunglasses.\u201dMark Toner, a deputy spokesman at the State Department, said Friday: \u201cWe are aware of media reports that a U.S. citizen was detained in North Korea. The welfare of U.S. citizens is one of the Department\u2019s highest priorities. In cases where U.S. citizens are reported detained in North Korea, we work closely with the Swedish Embassy, which serves as the United States\u2019 Protecting Power in North Korea.\u201dGov. John Kasich of Ohio, a Republican running for president, issued a statement saying, \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s arrest of an Ohio college student is inexcusable and he should be released and returned immediately.\u201dNorth Korea is holding at least two other Westerners.After North Korea held several Americans in recent years, accusing them of illegal entry, spying, spreading Christian beliefs and other \u201cantistate\u201d crimes, the State Department has strongly recommended against all travel by Americans to the country. Still, thousands of Westerners visit there annually.Tour agencies advise their clients not to preach religion or engage in political debates while in the North. One American was arrested for leaving a Bible behind in his hotel. North Korean customs officials inspect the visitors\u2019 laptops, DVDs and computer memory sticks. They treat the possession of pornography or publications criticizing their government as criminal acts.Analysts have said that North Korea\u2019s occasional arrests of outside visitors are driven by the government\u2019s need to guard its isolated people from foreign influences, as well as its desire to increase its leverage against Washington at times of tensions. It has often released American detainees only after prominent Americans visited its capital.Kenneth Bae, a Korean-American missionary held in North Korea on charges of trying to establish a secret proselytizing network, was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor in the spring of 2013, amid rising tensions with Washington following its third nuclear test. North Korea freed him in late 2014 after Washington sent the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., there.The American student\u2019s arrest was disclosed as the United States and its allies were mustering international support for a new round of tougher sanctions against the North after its fourth nuclear test on Jan. 6.Russell Goldman contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

Mr. Clinton\u2019s first solo outing on the campaign trail on his wife\u2019s behalf comes as the Republican Donald J. Trump has intensified his attacks against the 42nd president. As Mr. Clinton talks up the economic successes of his administration at events in Nashua and Exeter, Mr. Trump will be campaigning near New Hampshire.\u201cI\u2019m the only one that\u2019s willing to talk about his problems,\u201d Mr. Trump told CBS News on Sunday. \u201cI mean, what he did and what he has gone through I think is frankly terrible, especially if she wants to play the woman card.\u201dSo far, Mrs. Clinton has avoided responding directly to Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks, instead putting the emphasis on his policy proposals like barring all Muslims from entering the United States. But that could change on Tuesday when she sits down for her first interview of the year, with MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews, who will no doubt bring up Mr. Trump and Mr. Clinton\u2019s past. Despite drawing attention to the scandals of the 1990s, Mrs. Clinton needs her husband\u2019s help in New Hampshire, where he remains widely popular and where she has trailed Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in many recent polls. Before beginning a two-day \u201criver to river\u201d whirlwind tour of Iowa, Mrs. Clinton held three town-hall-style meeting in New Hampshire on Sunday, her first events of 2016.

Do you want a president that disparages women, Muslims of all kinds, people with disabilities, Hispanics?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cI mean, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting down to about 90 percent of all people here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt what point do we say enough of this?\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Bush also used the question to underscore one of the core arguments of his candidacy \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that the nation faces serious times that require a serious candidate, and he is that man. He said that Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seeming unfamiliarity with the nuclear triad \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the United States\u00e2\u0080\u0099s three ways of firing nuclear weapons \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in a recent debate is all the more troubling amid North Korea\u2019s disputed claims  Tuesday that it had set off a hydrogen bomb.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re running for president of the United States, you better have a pretty good answer, because at the heart of it, you ask the president to do one thing, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to keep us safe, and the nuclear triad is a means by which we have been kept safe since the post-World War II era\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Bush said.He urged voters to re-watch the video from that debate: \u00e2\u0080\u009cTell me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Bush said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s qualified right now to be president of the United States.\u201d\u201cIs he a smart guy? Yeah. Will he be able to learn about this? I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know. Maybe if he takes the time to do it,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut he sure as heck better if he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be president, because we all want a president that has a steady hand as it relates to something as serious as that.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Bush concluded by telling the questioner, Tom Emanuel of Laconia, N.H., that he hoped to earn his vote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to track you down and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to get you to support me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Bush said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on my list now, brother.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSo did he win Mr. Emanuel over? \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot tonight anyway, \u00e2\u0080\u009c Mr. Emanuel said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTime will tell, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a long race.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut, he added, he was impressed with Mr. Bush\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI like Jeb Bush, and before Trump was in the race, I would say I was probably going to vote for Bush, because I like the family, I like the old time values and those types of things,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut then when Donald Trump came on \u00e2\u0080\u0094 he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very aggressive, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dynamic, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good salesman, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve read his book, so I have a lot of respect for Donald Trump as well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Review: In \u2018City of Thorns,\u2019 Ben Rawlence Tells a Refugee Camp\u2019s Story", "Date": "2016-01-11", "News": "Supported byBooks of The TimesIn English, Dadaab means \u201cthe rocky hard place,\u201d a translation of such freakish metaphorical precision that Ben Rawlence, the author of \u201cCity of Thorns: Nine Lives in the World\u2019s Largest Refugee Camp,\u201d has the sense to use it with great restraint. Stamped on a dusty desert plain in Kenya, Dadaab \u2014 the camp of the book\u2019s title \u2014 is home to a half million inhabitants. Most are Somalis who have fled famine or terror in their home country (sometimes both), but others come from Sudan, Rwanda, Uganda, Ethiopia. What unites them all is that they live in a state of suspension seemingly interminable and intolerable.\u201cOn one side was the Kenyan state that harassed and ransomed the refugees with impunity,\u201d Mr. Rawlence writes, when he finally indulges the metaphor in full. \u201cOn the other was al-Shabaab\u201d \u2014 the militant Islamist group that\u2019s made a thorough ruin of Somalia \u2014 \u201cfrom which many had already fled at least once. The refugees were, literally, between the rock and the hard place that the name, Dadaab, embodied.\u201d\u201cNo one wants to admit that the temporary camp of Dadaab has become permanent,\u201d Mr. Rawlence writes. The camp was originally founded in 1992 to serve the 90,000 refugees fleeing Somalia\u2019s civil war. No one imagined that an entire generation of children would be raised there, or that so many more refugees would rush in, as the political chaos in Somalia moved from the third circle of hell to the ninth. \u201cNeither the past, nor the present, nor the future is a safe place for a mind to linger for long,\u201d he continues. \u201cTo live in this city of thorns is to be trapped mentally, as well as physically.\u201dAnd yet, from this harsh and unforgiving place, an unlikely metropolis has bloomed and today pounds with life. (Mr. Rawlence calls it \u201ccity of thorns\u201d because of the brittle thorn trees freckling the landscape, which make up the stuff of the refugees\u2019 daily lives \u2014 fences, huts, mosques.) Dadaab has its own radio station. It has its own markets, which sell everything from cellphones to books to camel intestines. It has its own hospitals and schools, its own makeshift cinemas and soccer leagues. It even has an unofficial red-light district.I do not, however, want to minimize the scope of Mr. Rawlence\u2019s efforts or achievements. Dadaab pops in three dimensions in \u201cCity of Thorns.\u201d Readers will get a sharp sense of its folkways; its unwritten rules and adhocracies; its hardy but mostly parasitical economy, based on smuggled goods and the resale of United Nations rations. They\u2019ll start to grasp the limits of relief agencies and the United Nations, and what kinds of unsavory compromises are required to care for the world\u2019s neediest.Mr. Rawlence\u2019s passages about Kenyan corruption fill the nostrils with a smell so rank that you can hardly breathe. The police rape for sport and bribe Somalis for all they\u2019re worth; after Kenya seized control of the Somali port city of Kismayo, Kenya\u2019s army and political class formed an unofficial alliance with Al Shabaab instead of destroying it, sharing profits from its illegal sugar and charcoal trafficking.And while I may have pined for richer portraits of some characters, there are others I won\u2019t soon forget, especially Tawane, the camp\u2019s valiant youth leader, who organizes a volunteer army to provide services \u2014 garbage collection, security, food distribution \u2014 after international agencies flee the camp, spooked by kidnappings and a spate of well-placed bombs. Essential to the community and educated in the camp\u2019s schools, Tawane has \u201creached Dadaab\u2019s glass ceiling\u201d and is now \u201ceager for a bigger life elsewhere.\u201d Yet the resettlement lottery has not been kind to him. He looks daily at Facebook posts of friends in the United States and elsewhere who\u2019ve had better luck.Once I finished \u201cCity of Thorns,\u201d I returned to its prologue, set in the White House, where Mr. Rawlence manages to convince the National Security Council that the refugees of Dadaab are not easily seduced by terror; on the contrary, they are fleeing it, and it has followed them there. \u201cI had fallen into the liberal lobbyist\u2019s trap,\u201d he writes. \u201cIf the youth were not at risk of being radicalized, then perhaps the N.S.C. didn\u2019t need to worry about Dadaab after all; the refugees could be safely forgotten.\u201dYet the refugees are still there, waiting and half-starving, their rations now at record lows. There\u2019s Isha, who still believes that her children\u2019s education in the camp will be worth something one day. There\u2019s Kheyro, an educated single woman who fears she will be slaughtered if she walks out of Dadaab, unaccompanied by a man. There\u2019s Guled, terrified he\u2019ll be kidnapped once again by Al Shabaab, just as he was in his youth.Is there really nothing to be done?City of ThornsNine Lives in the World\u2019s Largest Refugee CampBy Ben Rawlence384 pages.

Most legal experts agree that satisfies the requirement to be a \u00e2\u0080\u009cnatural-born citizen,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 a term that was not defined by the founders.Mr. Trump, who began raising questions about Mr. Cruz\u2019s ability to be president earlier in the week, said on Saturday that Mr. Cruz would have to go to court to get a \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeclaratory judgment\u00e2\u0080\u009d about his eligibility \u00e2\u0080\u009cor you have a candidate who just cannot run.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (Mr. Cruz could need a judgment if someone filed a lawsuit to challenge his candidacy and a court agreed to take up the question.)On Saturday night, before the final stop on a six-day bus tour of Iowa, Mr. Cruz said: \u201cUnder longstanding federal law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.\u201d\u201cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing candidates trying to throw whatever rocks they can,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fine, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s their prerogative. I like Donald Trump, I respect Donald Trump. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s welcome to toss whatever attacks he wants.\u201dMr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s criticism of his rival did not stop there. At an earlier rally in Ottumwa, Iowa, he accused Mr. Cruz of flip-flopping on his support of ethanol, a fuel that can be made from corn and a major industry in Iowa.\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs you know my primary opponent was totally opposed to ethanol and the ethanol industry,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Mr. Trump said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd all of a sudden he was getting clobbered. All of a sudden he said, uh, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m for ethanol. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do that. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do that with three weeks. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not allowed to do that.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099All year, Mr. Cruz has defied political convention by calling for the end of federal support for ethanol. He has been asked about it repeatedly by voters on his bus tour, all while being trailed by a pro-industry group in a recreational vehicle pressuring him to change his views.Mr. Cruz said this week that he favors a five-year period to phase out the federal mandate requiring fuel companies to incorporate a certain amount of biofuels, like ethanol, into gasoline. The pro-industry group following him, America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Renewable Future, claimed a victory. Its director, Eric Branstad, said in a statement: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe started the caucus process calling for immediate repeal. While not perfect, this is a big step forward by Sen. Cruz.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut the Cruz campaign said the group was misrepresenting the senator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s position, pointing to legislation Mr. Cruz sponsored that called for a five-year phase phase-out of the ethanol standard.Although ethanol is an important economic issue for farmers, its power in politics seems to be waning in Iowa. Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s well-publicized opposition has not kept him from leading in polls.While he did not criticize Mr. Trump explicitly, Mr. Cruz seemed to allude to him when he spoke of campaign strategy on Saturday night.\u201cThe only way to win Iowa is one voter at a time, showing the voters, the men and women of Iowa, the respect to look them in the eyes, to answer their questions,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe any candidate will win the state of Iowa, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe any candidate will win the state of New Hampshire from a TV studio in Washington, D.C., or in Manhattan.\u201dMr. Trump raised questions about whether Ted Cruz was eligible to be president because he was born in Canada. Mr. Trump, in interviews this week, suggested that Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s birthplace could invite legal challenges.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a problem for him, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a problem obviously for the Republicans,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said on MSNBC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cMorning Joe.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe Constitution, in Article II, requires the president to be a \u00e2\u0080\u009cnatural born citizen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But the Constitution does not define that term, which is why Mr. Cruz, and other presidential candidates before him, have faced questions about their eligibility.To understand the term \u00e2\u0080\u009cnatural born citizen\u00e2\u0080\u009d as written by the framers of the Constitution, they pointed to British common law and legislative action by the First Congress. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBoth confirm that the original meaning of the phrase \u00e2\u0080\u0098natural born Citizen\u00e2\u0080\u0099 includes persons born abroad who are citizens from birth based on the citizenship of a parent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they wrote. In Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case, they concluded that \u00e2\u0080\u009cdespite the happenstance of a birth across the border, there is no question that Senator Cruz has been a citizen from birth and is thus a \u00e2\u0080\u0098natural born Citizen\u00e2\u0080\u0099 within the meaning of the Constitution.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Thomas Kaplan\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "After a Tumultuous Year for Investors, the Experts Look Ahead", "Date": "2015-12-31", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseBut low gas prices and a strong dollar were good for United States consumers, who had more money to spend, lifting the American economy. Even though broad market averages were flat, United States stocks reached lofty valuations by historical measures.These are some of the big questions preoccupying investors as the new year gets underway. For answers, I turned to some of 2015\u2019s most successful investors and analysts for my annual look at the year ahead.\u25a0So much went wrong for investors in energy and other commodities this year that it\u2019s hard to imagine that 2016 could be any worse. This week, a barrel of Brent crude approached $36, the lowest since 2004, continuing what appears to be a record decline from over $100 a barrel in June 2014.The strong dollar added downward pressure on oil and commodities, which are priced in dollars, as the Federal Reserve pursued a tighter monetary policy. Global demand for oil grew in 2015, but not nearly fast enough to keep pace with supply. And China\u2019s economy, where rapid growth was supposed to drive demand for years, cooled noticeably.With oil prices so low, it\u2019s tempting to say the worst is over, as many hedge fund managers did earlier in 2015, only to get burned. But Damien Courvalin, senior strategist in the Global Investment Research Commodities team at Goldman Sachs, told me this week that it was too soon for the all-clear signal. While Goldman expects oil prices to recover eventually, even by late 2016, over the near term the same forces that drove prices to new lows in the last year, starting with oversupply, shadow the market. Goldman\u2019s three-month forecast for oil prices is $38, about where they are now, but they could go as low as $20, Mr. Courvalin suggested.\u201cWe\u2019re more concerned about the downside risks than the upside potential at this point,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople keep asking if it\u2019s time to get excited about energy, but we believe that conversation is premature.\u201dIn theory, slumping prices, and the resulting financial stress for marginal producers, should lead to cutbacks in production. There have been some, \u201cbut supply has proven surprisingly resilient,\u201d Mr. Courvalin said. After a long period of capital investment driven by high prices for oil and other commodities, many production facilities are only now coming on line, \u201cand they\u2019re going to produce, no matter what the price,\u201d Mr. Courvalin said.He compared recent oil price moves to the period from 1976 to 1989. After peaking in 1980, oil prices fell through much of the \u201880s, finally bottoming in 1988. So far, the current period, beginning in 2005, looks similar. If the pattern continues \u2014 a big if \u2014 a recovery should begin by 2018, which is still two years away. \u201cIt could even be another decade,\u201d Mr. Courvalin said, \u201cbefore prices sustainably return to the levels of the past few years.\u201d\u25a0Mr. Heugh, who is based in Hong Kong, manages the Morgan Stanley Institutional Fund Global Opportunity Portfolio, which gained over 20 percent in 2015. Mr. Nadel is senior portfolio manager in New York for Royce\u2019s International Premier Investment Fund, which gained over 17 percent in 2015, and the Royce European Small-Cap Fund, up nearly 14 percent. Both managers invest in relatively concentrated portfolios, by fund standards, that don\u2019t closely track broad indexes, which helped them outperform their respective indexes in the last year by a large margin. And both avoided the energy sector. Mr. Heugh\u2019s largest holdings as of November were Facebook, the software concern Epam Systems and Amazon. Mr. Nadel\u2019s were VZ Holding, a Swiss financial services company; Clarkson P.L.C., a shipping firm based in London, and Bajaj Finance in India.Several money managers are predicting another flat-to-down year for United States equities for the same reasons stocks were flat in 2015 \u2014 high valuations, expectations of rising interest rates, a strong dollar and continued weak oil and commodity prices.But both Mr. Heugh and Mr. Nadel see future opportunities in international stocks. \u201cThe U.S. has outperformed the rest of the world for quite a few years now, and the strong dollar has been exacerbating this trend,\u201d Mr. Heugh said. \u201cThese cycles tend to reverse themselves over time, sometimes violently.\u201dHe sees many opportunities in Asia, including China, which he notes is still growing, even if at a slower pace. \u201cAsia is trading at a discount to its historical multiples of free cash flow and earnings, while the U.S. and Europe are trading at premiums,\u201d he said.But Mr. Heugh focuses more on fundamental stock analysis and less on broad geographic or macroeconomic forces. He said he looked for high-quality companies with competitive advantages that deter potential competitors. Then, \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter which region outperforms in a given year or three- or five-year period, you will become partners in great businesses and have the potential to benefit as partners over time.\u201dMr. Nadel said he also looked for stocks of international companies that benefit from high barriers to entry. \u201cI\u2019m not big on predictions, but the stage is set nicely for investing internationally,\u201d he said. While the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has risen 75 percent over the last five years, international small-cap indexes have contracted slightly. \u201cDividend yields are over twice as generous outside the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cI think in 2016 we could see some catch-up.\u201dHe especially likes some companies based in India, a country with \u201csome of the best 10-year prospects in the world,\u201d and Brazil, whose market \u201chas to have hit rock bottom \u2014 at least, I hope so.\u201d He said he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about the prospects for emerging markets. He praised structural reforms in Japan and said a wave of immigration should eventually benefit developed European economies.\u25a0The long bull market in bonds sputtered in 2015, as the Fed finally raised its target federal funds rate by a quarter point for the first time since 2006. United States Treasuries and most investment-grade corporate bonds barely eked out positive returns, and junk bonds plunged in a panicky sell-off late in the year.Travis King, head of investment-grade credit at Voya Investment Management in New York, managed a 1.3 percent return for the Voya Investment Grade Credit Fund. While modest, that was better than most fixed-income funds, and Morningstar has ranked his fund the No. 1 corporate bond fund over the most recent three-year period. Mr. King said that even with the Fed expected to continue a slow but steady rise in interest rates, he anticipated modest positive returns again in 2016.\u201cOur market view is for a slow and gradual rise in the Fed funds rate, with Japanese and European rates staying very low,\u201d Mr. King said. \u201cIn that environment, we think corporate bonds will be a winning trade, but you have to be selective.\u201d In 2015, his fund rotated toward bonds from money center banks and other financial concerns, which helped it outperform its benchmark. He said he expected to continue that emphasis in 2016. \u201cWe think financials are still a good place to be overweight,\u201d Mr. King said.As for junk bonds, he said he thought that the worst of the sell-off might have run its course. \u201cYields are starting to push 9 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are still avoiding high-yield debt from the energy sector, but elsewhere you\u2019re seeing some stability. In a world where the 10-year Treasury is yielding 2.25 percent, 8 percent or 9 percent starts to look pretty interesting.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Denis McDonough, the White House chief of staff, also appeared to promote the president\u2019s agenda ahead of his final State of the Union address, which is scheduled for Tuesday.On CBS, Mrs. Clinton continued to knock Mr. Sanders for a past Senate vote to give gun manufacturers immunity from prosecution when a gun is used in a crime.

{"Headline": "Chris Christie Differentiates Black Lives Matter From 1960s Unrest", "Date": "2016-01-05", "News": "MANCHESTER, N.H. \u2014 Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey approached the presidential race after his re-election in 2013 with the notion that he would be a different kind of Republican, one who could broaden the party\u2019s appeal beyond its base of mostly white, older, working-class voters. On Tuesday, Mr. Christie showed that side of his candidacy once again. The matter came up at an event hosted by the New Hampshire Primary Student Convention, and the question itself was charged: How would a President Christie make sure that Black Lives Matter activists \u00e2\u0080\u009cstay peaceful\u00e2\u0080\u009d and not begin the sort of riots that \u00e2\u0080\u009cdestroyed cities\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the 1960s? And Mr. Christie was just as provocative in his answer: He began his answer in the same way that many liberal supporters of Black Lives Matter might have done, expressing skepticism with the premise of the question by noting that \u00e2\u0080\u009ccircumstances today are certainly different than in the 1960s.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He noted that the riots of that era were due in part to \u00e2\u0080\u009ca completely racist enforcement of the law, especially in our southern states,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as well as the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.Mr. Christie then expressed a sentiment shared by some Black Lives Matter activists: People don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just need to be treated fairly \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they need to feel that they will be treated fairly.\u00e2\u0080\u009cJustice has to be more than a word, everybody, justice has to become a way of life in our country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Christie said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe attorney general, law enforcement officers and elected officials across the country have to be reminded that the perception of justice is almost important as justice itself,\u201d he added. He went on to call for \u00e2\u0080\u009ca fair and even allocation of the law, and the perception that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being done that way as well.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe pointed to the lack of rioting in the predominantly black city of Camden, N.J., as evidence that people there \u00e2\u0080\u009cfeel\u00e2\u0080\u009d that the police department is working with them to keep the city safe. This was the result, he said, of \u00e2\u0080\u009chard work and opening your ears and listening to people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.The city of Camden has been a reference point for Mr. Christie in the past \u00e2\u0080\u0094 he has cited the city as a model for how to combat drug addiction. Earlier, at the event at the Radisson Hotel in Manchester, Mr. Christie was asked if he believed he could beat Donald J. Trump, who continues to lead polls in the state. With his trademark bravura, Mr. Christie said that he wouldn\u2019t be running if he didn\u2019t think he could beat him. But, turning more serious, Mr. Christie cautioned that polls \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which, he noted, Mr. Trump talks about frequently \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are not the ultimate measure of support. Until actual votes are cast, he suggested, it\u2019s all up in the air. \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.Cornel West, a prominent scholar; Killer Mike, an Atlanta rapper; and the former Ohio state senator, Nina Turner, praised Mr. Sanders during a 50-minute conversation with him on Sunday that was streamed live and filmed at a Marriott Hotel here. They spoke about King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last days organizing with union workers and planning a venture he called the Poor People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Campaign. The four went on to say that Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed ideas to protect the working class, break up large commercial banks, raise the minimum wage to $15 and reform police departments illustrated an extension of King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vision.Mr. West said that Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bid for the presidency illustrated a focus on the well being of working class people that had not been seen since the Rev. Jesse Jackson ran for president in the 1980s. He added that Mr. Sanders comes from what he called the \u00e2\u0080\u009cvanilla side of the country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d is sensitive to what he called \u00e2\u0080\u009cchocolate folk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and is willing to confront Wall Street in a way other longtime politicians will not.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a very unique moment and there is a real sense in which it could very well be America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last chance for the legacy of King to be addressed in a serious way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. West said of Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible ascendancy to the White House. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd it is a fascinating thing: It could be a brother from Brooklyn\u00e2\u0080\u009d who is leading the effort.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is not just a figure in a museum. He is part of a very rich tradition, a tradition of a people who have been terrorized, traumatized, and stigmatized for 400 years but still keep dishing out unbelievable courage and vision and most importantly, love and justice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. West said of King. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe were sitting at the church today in Mother Emmanuel Church and they were reading the words of Martin Luther King Jr. and it just made you shake and quiver. And I said to myself, this is what the Sanders campaign is about.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Sanders spoke briefly at Emanuel A.M.E. Church, where he sat in the first row, nodding and clapping.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think that while it is enormously important that we honor the life and work of Dr. King, it is even more important that we fulfill his vision and keep that struggle and that fight going until we have a nation in which we have broken down racism and a nation in which all of our people \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not just a few, but all of our people \u00e2\u0080\u0094 can enjoy dignity and a decent standard of living,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said to the packed church. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I would hope our mission together is about.\u00e2\u0080\u009dOn Sunday afternoon, Mr. Sanders also reminded those watching online that King was assassinated after he had started to talk about the Vietnam War and was in Tennessee to help workers at the time of his death. He also said that people too often forget that King was working on a march for poor people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rights that included organizing blacks, whites, Latinos and Native Americans.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe made this point all the time: Of course you want to break down segregation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said of King. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have the right to go to any school you want to go to.

{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Gets Personal on Christ and Her Faith", "Date": "2016-01-25", "News": "KNOXVILLE, Iowa \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Hillary Clinton is Methodist, but she rarely talks about her faith on the campaign trail.On Monday, at a town-hall-style event in a school gymnasium here, Jessica Manning, 36, a high school guidance counselor from Pella, Iowa, told Mrs. Clinton that as a Catholic and a Democrat, she felt conflicted. She explained that she had called into a Catholic radio show to discuss whom to support in the presidential race, and the host advised that she back a candidate based on faith, rather than blindly supporting any one political party.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would say I am a Democrat because of my Christian values, but many of my friends would say they are Republicans because of their Christian values,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Manning said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo in these next few months as I am supporting you and defending you to my Republican friends,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am just curious, how you would say your beliefs align with the Ten Commandments and is that something that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to you?\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe question gave Mrs. Clinton a rare opportunity to speak at length about her views on Christianity and the Bible. Below is her complete response:\u201cThank you for asking that. I am a person of faith. I am a Christian. I am a Methodist. I have been raised Methodist. I feel very grateful for the instructions and support I received starting in my family but through my church, and I think that any of us who are Christian have a constantly, constant, conversation in our own heads about what we are called to do and how we are asked to do it, and I think it is absolutely appropriate for people to have very strong convictions and also, though, to discuss those with other people of faith. Because different experiences can lead to different conclusions about what is consonant with our faith and how best to exercise it.The idea you heard on the radio of looking at individuals, I think, is absolutely fair. My study of the Bible, my many conversations with people of faith, has led me to believe the most important commandment is to love the Lord with all your might and to love your neighbor as yourself, and that is what I think we are commanded by Christ to do, and there is so much more in the Bible about taking care of the poor, visiting the prisoners, taking in the stranger, creating opportunities for others to be lifted up, to find faith themselves that I think there are many different ways of exercising your faith. But I do believe that in many areas judgment should be left to God, that being more open, tolerant and respectful is part of what makes me humble about my faith, and I am in awe of people who truly turn the other cheek all the time, who can go that extra mile that we are called to go, who keep finding ways to forgive and move on. Those are really hard things for human beings to do, and there is a lot, certainly in the New Testament, that calls us to do that.The famous discussion on the Sermon on the Mount should be something that you really pay attention to. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of great Bible studies: What does the Sermon on the Mount really mean? What is it calling us to do and to understand? Because it sure does seem to favor the poor and the merciful and those who in worldly terms don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a lot but who have the spirit that God recognizes as being at the core of love and salvation.So there is much to be learned and I have been very disappointed and sorry that Christianity, which has such great love at its core, is sometimes used to condemn so quickly and judge so harshly. When I think part of the message that I certainly have tried to understand and live with is to look at yourself first, to make sure you are being the kind of person you should be in how you are treating others, and I am by no means a perfect person, I will certainly confess that to one and all, but I feel the continuing urge to try to do better, to try to be kinder, to try to be more loving, even with people who are quite harsh.So, I think you have to keep asking yourself, if you are a person of faith, what is expected of me and am I actually acting the way that I should? And that starts in small ways and goes out in very large ones, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something that I take very seriously.

Mr. Sanders, meanwhile, told those gathered that Mrs. Aldrich\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story was emblematic of the struggles of many.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is not easy for people to stand up and say that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said in response to Ms. Aldrich\u2019s remarks. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the truth is, until millions of people who are experiencing exactly what you guys are experiencing do say that, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make change. So I thank you for saying that and for telling us what is going on in your life because the truth is you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make it on $12,000. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t live dignity on $10,000 or less.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAfter the event, Ms. Aldrich said she felt like Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response was a genuine one that illustrated that he cares for struggling Americans like herself.  She said she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t trust Hillary Clinton because she believed that Mrs. Clinton was too tied to big corporations and Wall Street.Ms. Aldrich said she had worked as a home health aide and a bartender, but stopped working six months ago. Four years ago, she started having health problems related to a joint disease and possibly multiple sclerosis. She has been trying to get on disability but said she had been denied the benefit and was appealing.Ms. Aldrich said she made only $5,000 last year but still managed to donate $15 to Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign. She used to make about $20,000 a year but now relies heavily on her parents, who are both 69, as well as on the $189 she receives each month in food stamps.Ms. Aldrich, who has now seen Mr. Sanders in person twice, said she had chosen to share her story because she believed that many others are also facing similar problems and that Mr. Sanders would help them.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI love Bernie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Aldrich said, her face still wet from tears. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is for the common person.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Pepsi Turns Restaurateur, to Serve Up Some Buzz", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byBehind black doors, what used to be a trendy restaurant in New York had been stripped to its concrete bones. Wires and cables snaked along the floor. Ceiling lights twinkled in the gloom.Known for its beverages, Pepsi is now moving into the restaurant business. The 5,000-square-foot space \u2014 on the same block as Milk Studios in Chelsea (Pepsi insists it resides in the ultrahip meatpacking district) \u2014 will become Kola House, a restaurant-bar-event space that the company hopes will be both social hub and testing ground for new products.\u201cThis isn\u2019t a pop-up,\u201d said Seth Kaufman, PepsiCo\u2019s chief marketing officer for beverages in North America. \u201cThis is something much bigger than that.\u201dMr. Kaufman said he wanted Kola House to offer visitors \u201ca premium experience,\u201d and to that end, it will not be plastered with the Pepsi logo or filled with Pepsi products. Everything at Kola House will be centered on the kola nut, a bitter fruit that contains caffeine and gives cola beverages their name. Essentially, Pepsi is trying to market its product without marketing its product.Mr. Kaufman\u2019s ambitions may seem outsize for a space still under construction. But his vision reflects how brands are trying to connect with consumers in ways beyond TV commercials and online ads.Kola House is designed for the social media age. However grandiose, Pepsi\u2019s goal is that visitors \u2014 particularly influential ones \u2014 will talk about Kola House on Facebook and Twitter and post pictures on Instagram.\u201cPeople consume content with a speed that we\u2019ve never experienced before,\u201d said Mauro Porcini, head of design for PepsiCo. \u201cThat\u2019s why, to be relevant online in these conversations, these companies need to activate offline in the best possible way.\u201dConsumer companies that set up shop in hip areas are trying to seem more on the edge and exclusive, said Allen Adamson, a branding expert and the former chairman for North America at Landor Associates, a global brand company.The danger for a big, mainstream brand like Pepsi, however, is that it will look more like a dad at a high school party than a member of the cool kids club.\u201cThis will continue to be something we learn from,\u201d he said. \u201cA year after it launches, there will be components of it that look different than when it launched because that\u2019s what marketers need to do these days.\u201dPepsi declined to say how much Kola House would cost to operate or for how long the company had rented the space. But Mr. Kaufman said it was a \u201csignificant undertaking\u201d that was being run by the marketing department.Pepsi is expected to introduce the Kola House concept in San Francisco in the days leading up to Super Bowl 50. Pepsi will also sponsor the Super Bowl halftime show and run a television commercial during the game that will focus on music and well-known songs.Before the game, Pepsi will set up what it is calling a modular Kola House (\u201crather than a pop-up,\u201d Mr. Kaufman said). There it plans to serve kola sliders, made with wagyu beef and caramelized onions, and beef tartare with caviar and kola truffle aioli. On the beverage menu is a drink called East Meets West, a pearlescent, vodka-based cocktail with kola bitters.The permanent Kola House in New York will include space for live entertainment.Mr. Kaufman and Mr. Porcini both emphasized that the Pepsi branding would be subtle \u2014 a logo here or there, but nothing too obvious.\u201cConsumers will love your brand because your brand enables you to have the experience, but they don\u2019t want to have the brand in their face,\u201d Mr. Porcini said. \u201cIt needs to be very subtle, elegant, sophisticated.\u201dTo that end, he said, there will be a small Pepsi logo on the sculpturelike bar fixture, but there will not be bottles of Pepsi and bags of Fritos lying around.\u201cWe are in a time where we have to transform how we connect with and engage consumers,\u201d Mr. Kaufman said. \u201cIf brands don\u2019t do that today, they will be irrelevant tomorrow, whatever tomorrow is.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Investment Strategy to Save the Planet", "Date": "2016-01-05", "News": "If one of your New Year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resolutions was to do your part against climate change, keep reading. Now you can \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with your investments.You\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be following New York State\u00e2\u0080\u0099s example. At the Paris climate change talks last month, the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comptroller, Thomas DiNapoli, announced that the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Common Retirement Fund, for public employee pensions, will put $2 billion into a new investment fund created by Goldman Sachs that prioritizes companies with smaller carbon footprints. If that goes well, the retirement fund will put in more.The Common Retirement Fund is the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s third-largest pension fund, so it often makes news in the world of institutional investing. But this announcement is also big news for climate change.That trade-off is vanishing. In the last year, investors have been able to put money into funds that mimic the risk and return on benchmark indexes, while slashing the amount of carbon emitted by the included companies. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe expect returns equal to \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or we think could be superior to \u00e2\u0080\u0094 what we get in the Russell 1000,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said DiNapoli, referring to an index of large American companies. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be assessing the returns, and make sure it keeps to the Russell 1000. Our goal is to put even more of our public equities into the fund.\u00e2\u0080\u009dGoldman created the investment fund only for New York State. But similar funds introduced in 2014 or 2015 are open to other investors, although they have not yet attracted the capital to match New York State\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investment. And more are likely to come \u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially after New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vote of confidence in a form of green investing that may become mainstream.\u00e2\u0080\u009cGreen investing\u00e2\u0080\u009d to most people still means divestment \u00e2\u0080\u0094 selling stock in companies that produce fossil fuels, especially coal, the worst for climate change.But even McKibben acknowledges that divestment doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t affect the stock prices of fossil-fuel companies \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and it might not matter even if it did. The companies are so big that divestment has next to no financial impact on them.A second form of green investment is putting money into companies making products or services that reduce climate change: for example, solar- or wind-power producers, manufacturers of emission-cutting devices and systems, and companies that do carbon trading or energy-efficiency management. DiNapoli also announced that New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fund would invest some $1.5 billion more in its Green Strategic Investment Program, which already has $500 million in such companies.New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investment in Goldman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fund is an example of a third way. The fund starts with the Russell 1000, excluding coal producers. Then it groups companies by sector, such as health care or information technology, and within each sector increases the shares of companies with the lowest emissions, and reduces those of companies with higher emissions. Goldman will periodically re-weight the fund to try to mimic the returns of the benchmark, but to do so in the lowest-carbon way possible. Goldman says the historical performance of the basket of stocks matches the performance of the Russell 1000 while reducing carbon emissions by 70 percent.This is called index or passive investing because there is no active money manager trying to beat the market by picking stocks. Passive funds seek only to match the market, but they outperform active funds for investors 75 percent of the time, largely because the passive funds\u00e2\u0080\u0099 fees are much lower.Why do these funds matter? First, because they could become very, very big.\u00c2\u00a0Second, all companies, not just energy producers, emit carbon, and burning carbon releases far more greenhouse gas than extraction of it does. So these funds use the market to encourage all companies to reduce their emissions. By putting money into the most environmentally responsible companies in each sector, they help those companies grow at the expense of less responsible ones, while creating an incentive for all to bring down emissions.Investors have long been able to choose indexes made of companies that are mid-sized, or companies located in Eastern Europe, or pharmaceutical manufacturers, or companies that are consistent with Islamic law. Now they can also choose low-carbon companies.Can these funds be sure they will match the benchmark index? Nope. As every prospectus says, past performance is not a guarantee of future returns. But matching is easier to do with a low-carbon fund than with many other types. The portfolio is still broadly diversified, with carbon-efficient companies in each category. (Some funds exclude fossil fuel companies, and some don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.)Read previous contributions to this series.There are other reasons for the current interest in low-carbon index funds.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Institutional investors are increasingly moving money into passive funds to reduce fees, and universities are under pressure from students to do more than divest.DiPerna worked with the oceanographer Jacques Cousteau in the 1970s. In 1979 she documented coral bleaching due to warming oceans; she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been working on climate change, then, for nearly 40 years. She helped to establish carbon trading markets in Chicago and in China. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I have never seen anything more important than the mainstreaming of environmental issues in the economy as we know it today,\u00e2\u0080\u009c she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not enough for the vanguard to act. And the mainstream has caught up to the vanguard. The financial services sector is ahead of the discussions in Paris.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe also said that New York State\u00e2\u0080\u0099s DiNapoli \u00e2\u0080\u009chasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t said he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s divested from coal. He still has a billion invested in ExxonMobil. He says he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doing shareholder engagement, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s O.K. We say: you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had two decades.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe green index funds, Henn said, are only a start. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking at which oil companies are better because they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t flare as much methane.

{"Headline": "U.S.-Iranian Swaps Pit Compassion Against Costs", "Date": "2016-01-18", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 When President Obama flew to Boise, Idaho, for a speech last winter, he met privately with the wife of an Iranian-American pastor held prisoner in Iran since 2012. Freeing her husband, he promised, was one of his top priorities.But the president\u2019s compassion came with a cost. To secure the release of Mr. Abedini and other Americans held by Iran, Mr. Obama freed seven Iranian and Iranian-American men charged with or convicted of violating sanctions against the Islamic republic. Mr. Obama again decided to trade for Americans in captivity despite concerns, even inside his own administration, that it might encourage others to target Americans.Several leading Republican presidential candidates, including Donald J. Trump and Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, criticized the trade. \u201cGovernments are taking Americans hostage because they believe they can gain concessions from this government under Barack Obama,\u201d Mr. Rubio said in Iowa. \u201cIt\u2019s created an incentive for more people to do this in the future.\u201dBut the families, supporters and administration officials said sometimes a trade is worthwhile. Aides said Mr. Obama was haunted by the possibility that Mr. Abedini and other Americans would spend years in Iran\u2019s notorious Evin Prison. While he refused to release violent criminals or terrorists, Mr. Obama deemed the release of a few sanctions-busters a reasonable trade-off, despite the complaints of critics.\u201cYou hear that a lot, and I understand the point,\u201d said Representative Dan Kildee, a Michigan Democrat who flew to Germany with the family of Amir Hekmati, another freed American. \u201cThis is a complicated world, and we can attempt to deny the way the world works, or we can deal with the reality that there are people out there that we don\u2019t like that we have to deal with.\u201dBut in recent decades, presidents have confronted civilians held by terrorists or hostile governments as geopolitical pawns. President Jimmy Carter agonized over embassy workers held hostage by Iran for 444 days and sent an ill-fated rescue mission. President Ronald Reagan was so consumed with American hostages held in the Middle East that he traded arms with Iran to secure their release.Reagan also freed a Soviet spy in 1986 in exchange for Nicholas Daniloff, a correspondent for U.S. News & World Report arrested in Moscow. Much like Mr. Obama, Reagan was criticized for trading a guilty person for an innocent one, even by conservatives like Representative Jack Kemp.\u201cIf Reagan had gone with Kemp, I would have been sitting in Siberia for a long time,\u201d Mr. Daniloff, now 81 and retired in Cambridge, Mass., said by telephone Monday. \u201cI\u2019ve got to tell you about being arrested and imprisoned \u2014 every minute is like a day, every hour is like a year.\u201dBut he agreed that a president should make clear such exchanges are not precedent to avoid inspiring more. \u201cSwaps are tricky,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this particular case, I\u2019m glad that it took place.\u201dMr. Obama made clear over the weekend that meeting relatives of prisoners has an impact. \u201cI\u2019ve seen their anguish, how they ache for their sons and husbands,\u201d he said. \u201cI gave these families my word \u2014 I made a vow \u2014 that we would do everything in our power to win the release of their loved ones.\u201dVeterans of President George W. Bush\u2019s administration said such swaps were inherently problematic. \u201cThese deals incentivize future hostage taking,\u201d said Eric S. Edelman, a former under secretary of defense, and suggest \u201cthat Iran can continue to engage in such behavior with impunity.\u201dStephen Yates, who was a national security aide to Vice President Dick Cheney, said his former boss would have fought such an exchange because swaps \u201ctend to boost the strategic position of our adversary and secure little or no progress in advancing American interests.\u201dIn the Iran case, the two countries were reaching closure on many disputes that had divided them for decades. In addition to releasing the seven, the administration withdrew notices seeking the arrest of 14 fugitives overseas. Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch rejected the release of several others.The deal came on the same weekend that Iran fulfilled the terms of last year\u2019s nuclear agreement and the United States lifted sanctions, giving it access to as much as $100 billion in frozen overseas funds. The United States also agreed to pay $1.7 billion to settle a 1981 claim over payments for military equipment that was never delivered.But the decks were not completely cleared. Robert A. Levinson, a C.I.A. contractor who disappeared in Iran in 2007, was not part of the swap; Iran insists it does not know his whereabouts. And Siamak Namazi, an Iranian-American consultant arrested in Tehran in October, was not part of the exchange.Former Representative Peter Hoekstra, a Michigan Republican who led the House Intelligence Committee, said that a swap involved difficult trade-offs but that if Mr. Obama made one, he should have insisted on getting all imprisoned Americans out.\u201cI\u2019m O.K. with negotiations and getting them back,\u201d Mr. Hoekstra said. \u201cBut how can you at this point go through all the negotiations and leave two behind? What\u2019s the calculus there? It should be let\u2019s get them all back or no deal.\u201dSecretary of State John Kerry said some Iranians released by the United States were close to completing their sentences, while the fugitives were beyond American reach. \u201cWhat we gave up, we believe, were people who were about to get out anyway and people that we couldn\u2019t get our hands on,\u201d he told Fox News.He denied that the exchange would encourage more Americans to be taken. But he acknowledged that there would probably be such situations again. \u201cThat, unfortunately,\u201d he said, \u201cis part of the reality of today\u2019s life on a global basis.\u201dAdvertisement"}

As an adult he learned he had irritable bowel syndrome, or I.B.S., a chronic gut disorder that affects up to 10 percent of Americans.Through the process of elimination, Dr. Pedre discovered that his diet was the source of many of his problems. Cutting out dairy and gluten reversed many of his symptoms. Replacing processed foods with organic meats, fresh vegetables and fermented foods gave him more energy and settled his sensitive stomach.Dr. Pedre, a clinical instructor in medicine at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, began to encourage many of his patients who were struggling with digestive disorders to do the same, helping them to identify food allergens and food sensitivities that could act as triggers. He also urged his patients to try yoga and meditation to alleviate chronic stress, which can worsen digestive problems.Recently, we caught up with Dr. Pedre to talk about what makes a \u201chappy gut,\u201d how you can avoid some common triggers of digestive problems, and why fermented foods like kombucha and kimchi should be part of your diet. Here are edited excerpts from our conversation. How did you end up focusing on the treatment of digestive disorders? It starts from having grown up with a sensitive digestive system, which was very challenging my entire life. But it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t until I went to medical school and then ultimately learned functional medicine that I really understood what was going on inside the gut. I experimented and changed my diet and tried probiotics and started to resolve my issues. At first I was just doing this because the gut was one of those places where you could make a big difference for patients. I was seeing rapid results. My patients started referring their friends and before I knew it that part of my practice had grown tremendously.You say that functional medicine informed your ideas about gut health. What is functional medicine? Functional medicine is a branch of medicine that looks at the body as a system. It is patient-centered rather than disease-focused. We spend more time with our patients listening to their histories to look for interactions between genetic, environmental, mental and other lifestyle factors that can influence the course of their diseases. I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best equipped to deal with the ever-increasing complexity of conditions that patients are going to their doctors for.  What is a \u201chappy gut\u201d? A happy gut is a gut that is able to do all of the work of digestion. It has a healthy microbiome, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s able to extract all the nutrients you need from your food without causing any pain, discomfort, bloating or distress, and it creates a bowel movement at least once a day. Why did you write this book? I wanted to be able to help more people than I could possibly reach through my practice. And as I was working with people on gut issues, I also came to realize what an essential role the gut plays in so many other aspects of health. How common are digestive issues in America? The estimate is that around 70 million Americans suffer from some sort of gut issue, including I.B.S. And I think if you broaden that out to people who suffer intermittently from some sort of gut distress, the number is much larger. There are also many people who maybe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t realize they have a gut issue but are experiencing other related health issues. What are the most common gut issues you see? The biggest one would be irritable bowel syndrome. Behind that there could be something called dysbiosis. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basically an imbalance between the good and the bad bugs in the gut. That includes bacteria, yeast and parasites. What are some of the more common causes of the gut problems you see? Can you elaborate on the diet aspect? What are some of the more common offenders? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a variety of things. A lot of people are sensitive to wheat, gluten, soy and dairy products. It could be individual dairy proteins like casein or whey. Humans lack a certain enzyme that breaks down the casein protein. Some people are more susceptible than others. And that can lead to food sensitivities. For some people it could be food additives, or things like preservatives, artificial sweeteners and food colorings. For some people it can be enzyme deficiencies. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the diet you advocate in general? I think that it should be individualized for every person. But in general I tell my patients to basically eat mostly plants. My approach is a combination of Paleo and vegan. I advocate eating a lot of vegetables, complemented by meat. You should try to choose meat that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s organic, hormone-free and grass-fed. I also believe in incorporating a healthy amount of fats like omega-3\u2019s from avocados, cold-water fatty fish, nuts and seeds. You also advocate cultured foods, correct? Yes. Cultured foods have a long tradition. If you go back in history, culturing was a way to extend the life of food and preserve it. But cultured foods also help nurture the good flora in our guts. Whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s through a yogurt or kefir or fermented vegetables like kimchi, or a fermented probiotic drink like kombucha, fermented foods are going to help promote a healthy, balanced gut flora. We know that the gut flora can shift very quickly depending on your diet. And I think it needs this continued support from cultured foods. What is your diet like?My diet is very similar to the \u201cHappy Gut\u201d diet that I write about in the book. I try to make the majority of my diet salads, greens and steamed vegetables. I bring in healthy fats through nuts and seeds, ideally sprouted. And I love kombucha, so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a regular part of my diet. I stay away from dairy and gluten, and during the season when the farmers\u2019 market is near my home, I like to buy my produce there so I can support the local farmers. I also try to minimize my exposure to pesticides. What do you expect people will take away from this book? I hope people who are suffering from gut issues and other conditions that may be related to gut health \u00e2\u0080\u0093 like fatigue, migraines, allergies and asthma \u00e2\u0080\u0093 will see that there is a way to achieve wellness by changing the way you eat and the way you approach your lifestyle. I hope people will learn that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more than just a diet. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a 360-degree approach to your lifestyle, and the way you balance your stress is just as important as the way that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re eating.Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "In Iowa, Jobs Are Plentiful but Workers Are Not", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byAMES, Iowa \u2014 Unlike the indoor basketball court, foosball tables or fireside lounge at Workiva\u2019s sprawling campus here, the oversize green prize wheel centered among a hive of work stations is not meant for break times.Only employees who refer new hires get a chance to spin it and win up to $2,500.\u201cThirty percent of our recruiting comes from that wheel,\u201d said Matthew M. Rizai, chief executive of Workiva, a cloud-based software firm. The hunt for workers is unrelenting, he said. \u201cWe always have openings.\u201dAt 3.4 percent, Iowa\u2019s unemployment rate is among the lowest in the country. With major metropolitan areas \u2014 crowded with hard-hat construction sites \u2014 painting an alluring picture of steady economic progress, business leaders here retain a sunny optimism that is rarely heard from the presidential candidates.But now that Iowa has achieved a tightening labor market that is the envy of most other states, many companies are confronted with a different set of challenges pushing them to rethink everything from recruiting to economic development.Some immigrants, particularly those without sought-after credentials in technology or science, say they have had trouble finding a job. Salih Salih, 34, who came to the United States as a refugee from Eritrea 10 years ago, said he believed his accent had been a handicap for him and many other people. \u201cThey\u2019re measuring their ability by how they speak English,\u201d said Mr. Salih, who has experience in maintenance and as an electrician.Mr. Salih has found temporary work through People360, an employment agency in Des Moines, but has struggled to find a permanent position despite a college degree and stellar evaluations.Immigrants can encounter difficulties, said Mr. Nelson, the Kemin chief executive, but he added that the acute labor shortage was nudging some skeptics in the business community to be more welcoming. \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s going to relieve us is getting immigrants into the state,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving babies is still a 20-year process.\u201dWith a growing number of retirees and stiff competition for young workers from surrounding Midwestern cities, getting people to resettle in Iowa is necessary for growth, said David A. Swenson, an economist at Iowa State. The state\u2019s important meatpacking, animal feed and dairy industries \u201chave been able to maintain profitability because of immigrant labor.\u201dBut even a relatively modest change in Iowa\u2019s demographics has helped foster a political backlash.Indeed, the state has a hard time attracting outsiders. For some employers, the recruitment strategy includes luring home people with an Iowa connection.\u201cAs a local business, we want people who are tied into the area,\u201d said David Kenworthy, chief executive of Storey Kenworthy, an office supply and furniture company. \u201cWe like to have people returning to Iowa, raise their family and put in roots.\u201dMark Core, an executive vice president at Vermeer, said that his customers say \u201cthe No. 1 thing holding back growth is labor \u2014 every time.\u201dSmall-town Iowans have a huge role in picking the next president. Their deep commitment to the process paints a distinct portrait of democracy.The shortage has a ripple effect. \u201cIt hurts a lot thinking we could add even more people if our end users could find more people to operate our machinery,\u201d Mr. Core said.How the lives of six residents intersected with the campaigns in the last week.Potential newcomers are given a detailed assessment of a particular area\u2019s labor market: how many people are unemployed or willing to switch jobs; how far they would commute; and a sampling of wages.When a company\u2019s representatives (Ms. Durham would prefer not to name names) recently came looking to pay below the $10 median wage that many Iowans now consider the minimum acceptable, Ms. Durham told them, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to find people at that wage.\u201dMany employers say they have raised wages to attract workers, particularly skilled ones, but the insistent complaints about labor shortages have put less pressure on wages in Iowa than expected, economists say.\u201cWage and salary earnings are very much less than the overall national average,\u201d said Mr. Swenson, of Iowa State, citing sectors that include finance, insurance and professional services. \u201cIf the labor supply is tight and you\u2019re not bidding up prices, you\u2019re just making noise.\u201dSome employers have an eye on the rearview mirror, where the last recession still looms large. Though Storey Kenworthy had a record year in 2015, Mr. Kenworthy, its chief, remembers seeing revenue drop more than a third in 2008 and being forced to cut staff. Since then, \u201cwe tried to look at things a little differently,\u201d he said, citing fixed costs like labor. A result is a trend around the country: more emphasis on nonwage benefits and bonuses that can be trimmed back if business dips. Since 2011, wages at the firm have risen to 2.5 from 2 percent annually, Mr. Kenworthy said, with employees now bringing home $48,000 on average. Yearly bonuses and profit sharing add 10 percent more.David Leto, executive vice president of the Palmer Group, an employment agency in Des Moines, said wages had steadily increased but \u201cemployees know not to ask for the moon here.\u201dEmployers are also conscious of keeping parity among existing workers and new hires, he said.He echoed a theme voiced by many Iowa employers: Here, someone can \u201clive big\u201d \u2014 find good schools for children and live in a comfortable house at a fraction of the cost on the coasts.\u201cNot everyone,\u201d Mr. Rizai said, \u201cwants to go to Silicon Valley.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Terry Branstad of Iowa on Tuesday harshly criticized Mr. Cruz for his opposition to federal ethanol mandates and saying that he hoped Mr. Cruz lost in the state.Mr. Dole, a backer of Mr. Bush, said on Wednesday that he thought Mr. Trump could be the only candidate capable of stopping Mr. Cruz from securing the nomination, thus preventing the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwholesale losses\u00e2\u0080\u009d the party would suffer if Mr. Cruz were on the ticket, he said.Saying he shares Mr. Dole\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concerns, Mr. Graham went further Thursday, speaking candidly about a campaign he called \u00e2\u0080\u009cbeyond strange.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He denounced Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump, whose grasp of foreign policy \u00e2\u0080\u009cscares the hell out of me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.Mr. Graham, who threw his support behind Mr. Bush after dropping out of the race, said he believes nominating either Mr. Cruz or Mr. Trump would make it easy for Mrs. Clinton to win the election.\u00e2\u0080\u009cDishonest \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which is Hillary Clinton in the eyes of the American people \u00e2\u0080\u0094 beats crazy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s domestic and foreign policy is gibberish.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Cruz, meanwhile, could prove too rigidly ideological to solve the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s problems, he said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you take those two off the table, dishonest loses to normal, so let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just pick somebody out of the phone book if we have to,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Graham said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can win this election unless we lose it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "No Need to Fret, Apple Is Doing Fine", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtLet\u2019s get this out of the way first: Despite what you may have heard, the iPhone is not dying. Neither, by extension, is Apple.But if Apple is now hitting a plateau, it\u2019s important to remember that it\u2019s one of the loftiest plateaus in the history of business. The $18.4 billion profit that Apple reported on Tuesday is the most ever earned by any company in a single quarter.So this column will try to do something tricky: explore what\u2019s ailing Apple without going off the deep end. Here\u2019s my ice-cold take: Apple is doing quite O.K.Could it be doing some things better? Sure. Are any of its problems urgent? Not particularly, and from what one can tell, it\u2019s working to address many of its shortcomings. Does it face existential threats? Yes, but no more than any other tech giant. Will it remain an outsize presence in the tech industry for years to come, generating profits on a scale that no other corporation can match? Almost certainly.I\u2019ll get to those long-run worries in a bit, but let\u2019s start with the present. At the moment, Apple\u2019s biggest problem is its own success. The iPhone turns nine this year. The iPad turns six. These devices have made Apple the world\u2019s most valuable company (until Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, overtakes it, which might happen soon).Yet the very dominance of Apple\u2019s aging mobile empire inspires doubts about its future. The bigger the iPhone gets, the harder Apple has to work to beat its previous milestones, and the more vulnerable it appears to some fatal technological surprise.But there\u2019s something worth keeping in mind about each of these criticisms. They\u2019re the gripes of a technophile, and they don\u2019t necessarily reflect mainstream consumer perceptions about Apple\u2019s products.But if continued growth sounds like wishful thinking, there\u2019s another path for Apple to prosper even if iPhone sales do hit a wall: Suck more money out of each phone. In a note to clients last fall, analysts at Goldman Sachs suggested that through a widening number of subscription services baked into the iPhone, Apple could begin to reap a huge monthly fee from its users, which it said constituted \u201cthe most lucrative installed base in the world.\u201dIt\u2019s an argument Apple executives are starting to vocalize loudly. On Tuesday\u2019s earnings call, Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said the popularity of the iPhone provided the company a \u201clong-lasting foundation.\u201dApple\u2019s ecosystem is so sticky that people tend to flock to its services even if there are better products out there. Even if I\u2019m not a fan, 10 million people have subscribed to Apple Music in its first six months.Given all these options for minting bullion from the iPhone, the most alarming worries for Apple aren\u2019t about the present. They are about the future beyond the horizon, and they are necessarily speculative.The basic question is this: In the future, will physical devices matter less than they do now? If computers are more like the machines in the movie \u201cHer\u201d \u2014 ethereal, ambient computers that exist in the cloud, that respond to our voices and our bodies, anticipating our desires \u2014 what will happen to Apple then? This is a company whose entire existence hinges on the cultural appreciation of physical things. Can it prosper in an age of ambient computing?These are interesting questions to pose. I had a long conversation with Mr. Thompson about these ideas, and Apple\u2019s apparent weaknesses \u2014 how it\u2019s not as good at artificial intelligence and voice recognition as Google, how it lacks the cloud infrastructure that Amazon has built, and how, most important, its entire corporate culture is geared toward making actual stuff, which could limit its capacity to create fantastic online services.But ultimately the discussion felt academic. It seems obvious that as the tech world changes around it, Apple, over the next decade, will need to reinvent itself. But so will everyone else. That is just what you do in this industry.An earlier version of a credit for an illustration with this article misspelled the illustrator\u2019s surname.

{"Headline": "Dov Charney Argues in Court for His Return to American Apparel", "Date": "2016-01-21", "News": "Supported by\u201cThere was a plan behind the scenes to steal the company from me,\u201d Mr. Charney testified in Bankruptcy Court in Delaware. \u201cSince then, it\u2019s been a constant hide-the-ball.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a merchant, I\u2019m a creative artist, I\u2019m a photographer, I\u2019m a marketer, I\u2019m an industrialist,\u201d Mr. Charney said, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t want to hand over my company. This is coercion.\u201dAfter two days of testimony from various witnesses and in the face of an impending snowstorm, Judge Brendan L. Shannon said that he would postpone his ruling on American Apparel\u2019s bankruptcy until Monday morning. But he could still decide to extend proceedings even longer or postpone the retailer\u2019s exit from bankruptcy.\u201cI recognize that there is not consensus in the room,\u201d the judge said, referring to the differing plans between the investors backing Mr. Charney, and the company and its creditors who oppose the Charney proposal.But a new alliance between Mr. Charney and the investment funds Hagan Capital Group and Silver Creek Capital \u2014 which have offered to buy American Apparel in a bid valued at $300 million and rehire its founder \u2014 has brought Mr. Charney back into the fray.American Apparel\u2019s senior bondholders are seeking approval of an opposing plan, backed by a majority of the company\u2019s creditors, which would cut about $200 million in debt. Under that plan, the retailer would be taken over by lenders, including Monarch Alternative Capital, Coliseum Capital and Goldman Sachs Asset Management.In animated testimony, Mr. Charney characterized the company\u2019s snub as the latest move in a plot by current and former directors at the company, as well as onetime investment fund allies, who were now blocking his return.Mr. Charney\u2019s account was disputed by American Apparel\u2019s lawyers, and his testimony was interrupted several times by Judge Shannon, who asked him to stop \u201cfree associating.\u201dMr. Charney testified that the board had tried to blackmail him in 2014 by threatening a campaign of \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d unless he surrendered his minority stake in the company and resigned.Mr. Hagan backed Mr. Charney\u2019s allegations.\u201cThere was a lack of dialogue and negotiation,\u201d Mr. Hagan said, calling the company\u2019s interaction with his firm \u201chostile.\u201d\u201cIn my opinion, there was a freeze-out of anyone involved with Dov,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they were trying to scare us away.\u201dThe dispute between Mr. Charney and his former company has been the latest messy chapter for a retail chain that Mr. Charney founded in 1989, and whose T-shirts and bodysuits came to define the alternative look of the 1990s and 2000s. The retailer\u2019s commitment to keeping local manufacturing jobs in Los Angeles, and its championing of progressive causes like immigration reform and marriage equality also earned American Apparel a following among young shoppers.Mr. Charney fueled the dizzying growth of those early years, and his kinetic lifestyle seemed to embody American Apparel\u2019s anti-establishment flair. But soon, the founder was accused of crossing boundaries, and of sexually harassing employees. Mr. Charney has steadfastly denied most accusations as unfounded.The two-day bankruptcy court hearing jumped from analyses of complex financial agreements to musings on the state of American manufacturing and retailing to a discussion of American Apparel\u2019s famous disco pants.Paula Schneider, who took over as American Apparel\u2019s chief executive in January 2015, painted a picture of a company that was in dire straits. \u201cWe were out of key sellers. We were out of disco pants. We were out of pleated skirts,\u201d she testified on Wednesday.\u201cDisco pants? You can\u2019t have a shortage of those,\u201d Judge Shannon remarked, to laughter from the court.\u201cNo, you really can\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Schneider said.American Apparel\u2019s counsel opted not to cross-examine Mr. Charney, saying his rambling testimony had shown he could not be expected to provide information relevant to the company\u2019s turnaround.\u201cAt the end of the day, the Hagan-Charney proposal that came forward is an inferior proposal,\u201d said Scott Greenberg, a lawyer representing American Apparel.\u201cThe proposal leaves the debtors with more leverage, with less liquidity and comes with uncertain and uncommitted financing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt requires by its own terms the consent of our bondholders, which is clearly not forthcoming.\u201dThe bid would therefore lead to \u201ca series of litigious and potentially ugly battles that would further damage the company,\u201d he said.Ms. Schneider said that American Apparel continued to reel from Mr. Charney\u2019s freewheeling management. She said that the company\u2019s hyper-sexualized advertising strategy had caused it to get kicked off Facebook, robbing the retailer of a big e-commerce sales vehicle, and had prompted several lawsuits in Europe.But she said the bankruptcy was the biggest drag on the company\u2019s business.\u201cMost people hear bankruptcy, and they think we\u2019re going out of business,\u201d Ms. Schneider said. \u201cBut they walk in the stores and are sorely disappointed that everything isn\u2019t on clearance.\u201cThe quicker we can get out of bankruptcy, the quicker we can get new product in the stores, the better off the company will be.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Not even \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens,\u201d which has packed movie theaters nationwide since it opened last month, drew much of a crowd at the Ziegfeld on Wednesday night.On the steps outside, by a plaza large enough for rolls of red carpet at movie premieres, was a ticket taker, standing, waiting. Inside the box office was a ticket seller, waiting. For about an hour before the 7 p.m. show, the one sold and the other collected only a handful of tickets.\u201cEveryone knows the Ziegfeld,\u201d said Marjorie Mu\u00f1oz, who had seen word of the closing on Facebook and stopped by to snap a photo. \u201cIt always seemed regal.\u201dBut it was perhaps not as regal as it seemed. The Ziegfeld \u2014 this Ziegfeld, anyway, on West 54th Street, near Avenue of the Americas \u2014 was not a movie palace from the golden age of movie palaces that had been modernized. No dazzling chandeliers were destroyed and no gold-and-red balconies were ripped out before it opened in December 1969.\u201cShow Girl\u201d starred Ruby Keeler and featured what should have been a can\u2019t-miss stunt. Night after night for the first few weeks of the run, Ms. Keeler\u2019s real-life husband, the performer Al Jolson, bounded out of a seat in the audience, ran to the front of the theater and joined the merrymaking on the stage.That Ziegfeld, which showed movies later in its life, was demolished in 1966. This Ziegfeld was all new, and so \u201960s. It was built with white bricks, like many apartment buildings of the day, and was never intended to accommodate live performances. The New York Times said when it opened that the theater was the first major new movie house in Midtown Manhattan since Radio City Music Hall opened in 1932.It came with \u201cspace age technology,\u201d The Times said \u2014 a computerized console and even a closed-circuit television system. \u201cThe console operator \u2014 who is at the rear of the orchestra and visible to patrons \u2014 can open and close the curtains, brighten and dim the lights, control the temperature and open and close doors.\u201d It sounded as if the console operator could do everything but pop the popcorn, because the console also controlled the theater\u2019s sound system. It could even change lenses in the projection booth.\u201cIt was like going to the Waldorf Astoria,\u201d she said. \u201cThis was glorious. It was huge. It was overwhelming. You had a screen that could cover the universe, it was so large.\u201dOutside, she said, the lines seemed to stretch across the universe. Perhaps that was inevitable at a theater with nearly 1,200 seats \u2014 smallish when compared with Radio City, but larger than many modern theaters.The d\u00e9cor was overseen by Dolly Martin Reade, the wife of Walter Reade Jr., the theater\u2019s initial operator. But Ziegfeld\u2019s daughter, Patricia Ziegfeld Stephenson, was on hand for the opening and gave the theater a thumbs up.\u201cI\u2019m sure Daddy would have approved of it,\u201d she told The Times in 1969, \u201csince everything is so Ziegfeldian.\u201d (She died in 2008 at age 91.)But the Ziegfeld was having money troubles. \u201cIt loses a lot of money,\u201d James L. Dolan, the chief executive of Cablevision, which runs the theater, told The Hollywood Reporter in April. \u201cThe theater business is a tough business.\u201dCablevision said this week that the building\u2019s owners had found a new occupant. \u201cWe will be exiting our lease in the coming weeks to accommodate the new tenant,\u201d the company said in a statement. The Ziegfeld will reopen next year as an event space, catering to galas and corporate functions.The change is sure to leave movie types nostalgic for red-carpet moments, like when the stars of the 2000 film \u201cCharlie\u2019s Angels,\u201d Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu, arrived late to its opening, not in a limousine, but in a bus. The Ziegfeld hosted dozens of other premieres, including those of \u201cCabaret,\u201d in 1972, \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind,\u201d in 1977, and Woody Allen\u2019s \u201cManhattan.\u201dLiam Stack and Alex Vadukul contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The deaths of those students, all women, led to the establishment of a national registry for rifles and other long guns. The Conservative government, which was defeated in October, dismantled that registry over the protests of many police forces and provincial governments.An article on Friday about a school shooting in northern Saskatchewan that killed four people misstated, in some editions, the number of people killed in Canada\u2019s deadliest school shooting, at \u00c9cole Polytechnique, an engineering school in Montreal, in 1989.

The $6 million-a-week spending pace is only likely to intensify in the final days \u2014 but the torrent of commercials from candidates and their allies may be turning off as many voters as it persuades.\u201cI see them all the time, everywhere I go,\u201d said Mike O\u2019Keefe, 27, an insurance company employee in Des Moines. \u201cIt\u2019s just one after another, and nothing really sticks.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an old habit, and old habits die hard,\u201d said Elizabeth Wilner, a senior vice president at Kantar Media/CMAG, which tracks political advertising. \u201cThe noise just gets deafening, and you wonder about people tuning you out.\u201dAll told, candidates have spent more than $40 million to date in Iowa on broadcast advertising \u2014 $6 million last week alone \u2014 airing more than 167 different political commercials, according to data provided by Kantar Media/CMAG. An additional $13 million has been spent on local cable channels in the state.The homestretch in Iowa always leads to a barrage of television appeals, and this year\u2019s volume is roughly on par with 2008\u2019s. But after months in which media consultants trumpeted their ability to pinpoint narrow categories of voters using sophisticated analysis, the ad glut is making a hash of those efforts.And what might make sense while targeting on a national scale or in bigger media markets, or over time, does not prove so effective when the effort concentrates on a small subset of voters in a small state over a few days, experts said.\u201cIn Iowa, you\u2019re talking about a fairly small universe of caucusgoers, compared to the general population or general voting public,\u201d said Carl Forti, a Republican strategist. \u201cYou\u2019re spending a lot of money to talk to very few.\u201dSo Saturday night\u2019s \u201cWheel of Fortune,\u201d for example, was blanketed by 11 political ads from nine candidates in its half-hour broadcast. The show\u2019s older audience, including many holdovers who watch the nightly news, was a high-value target for candidates in both parties.The weekend\u2019s major sports events allowed some ads to avoid being lost in a blizzard of others. Viewers of the United States Figure Skating Championships on NBC saw a 60-second advertisement from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign twice in 20 minutes.And during the A.F.C. championship game between the New England Patriots and the Denver Broncos, viewers saw Mr. Rubio make trick football catches in one ad and Mr. Cruz go duck hunting with Phil Robertson of the TV show \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d in another.\u201cCertainly with things like sporting events, and things like that, you have a better chance of it cutting through when it\u2019s a nontraditional messenger,\u201d said Jason Miller, a senior strategist on the Cruz campaign.Creativity can also help.The Ben Carson campaign, one of the biggest spenders in Iowa with more than $2.6 million on television, ran an ad without a single spoken word (except the required \u201cI approve\u201d statement). Accompanied by slow music, it showed Carson supporters with outstretched hands, as the written words \u201cOur Hands\u201d gave way to \u201cHeal,\u201d \u201cLearn,\u201d \u201cUnite\u201d and more.\u201cIt\u2019s essentially not only that you highlight different qualities, but that you take a different approach to creative,\u201d said Ed Brookover, Mr. Carson\u2019s campaign manager.Mr. Sanders team has also bought nine straight days of geo-filter advertising on Snapchat, the longest political ad campaign ever launched on the platform, as part of the campaign\u2019s effort to turn out young caucusgoers, according to Kenneth Pennington, the digital director for the Sanders campaign.Advertisement"}

Wildlife photographers and wildlife/bird watchers now number some 40 million people in the USA, and feed many rural western economies with our tourism dollars, and we will not stand for your sedition.Hey my post just went to number one on the DKOS rec list!! Take that you terrorists ;-) https://t.co/a5SxDV1UHYFollowAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democrats Hope to Turn Tables on Republicans Over Planned Parenthood Indictments", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Democrats who have found themselves on the defensive over their support for Planned Parenthood say they believe they can now turn the tables on Republicans after two anti-abortion activists who conducted a sting on the organization were indicted in Texas.House Democrats called on Republicans to disband a special committee investigating the organization in light of the criminal action. Political operatives pounded Republicans on Tuesday over their backing of the activists who filmed the organization undercover and accused staff members of illegally selling fetal tissue.\u201cHouse Republicans should admit they are wrong and move on,\u201d said one missive from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.In separate releases aimed at nearly 20 House Republicans, the campaign committee accused them of jumping to conclusions over Planned Parenthood and rushing to cut funds for the organization, which supporters say is a critical health resource for women. The Republican lawmakers represent districts in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania.Republicans were fairly quiet about the indictments issued by a Houston grand jury. But given the strong anti-abortion sentiment among House Republicans, it seems unlikely that they would quickly back down on their investigation of Planned Parenthood or their effort to cut funding for it.The issue has also been a common presence on the campaign trail, with Carly Fiorina making the videos an important component of her stump speeches.The two activists who posed as biomedical workers were accused of tampering with government documents \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a felony \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and one also faces a misdemeanor charge related to buying human organs. Planned Parenthood was cleared of wrongdoing.   \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.
