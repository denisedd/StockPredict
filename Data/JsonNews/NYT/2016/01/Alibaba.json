{"Headline": "Investment in Internet Start-Ups Appears to Slow in China", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s Internet companies, in recent years, have been the shining stars of growth, with Alibaba and Tencent rivaling in size some of their most formidable global competitors.Inspired by their success and driven by huge buyouts of smaller companies by China\u2019s Internet giants, investors have poured money into new start-ups.But new figures from the end of 2015 show that wave of investment may be coming to an end, or at least slowing.Among the contributors may be the Chinese Internet giants that have fueled the boom. Hiring freezes at Alibaba and Baidu have signaled recent caution about spending, according to Mark Natkin, founder of the research firm Marbridge Consulting in Beijing.\u201cA year or two ago, V.C.s felt they didn\u2019t have to drive a company all the way to I.P.O. for an exit because Baidu, Tencent and Alibaba were rolling down the aisles with their shopping carts,\u201d he said, referring to venture capital firms. He pointed out that now those firms are less focused on smaller companies, and instead are preoccupied with consolidating more mature sectors like group buying and ride-hailing apps.A looming question is how much recent market turmoil in China will affect private fund-raising in 2016. A major slowdown could dent Beijing\u2019s ambitions to continue the rapid growth of the Internet industry.In recent economic plans, the Chinese Communist Party has identified Internet-related businesses as fundamental to the transition of the Chinese economy from one centered on infrastructure investment to one based on consumer spending.Yet the drop-off in China and Asia comes amid a very different context than the drop-off in the United States. In Asia, the increase in venture capital funding rose much more sharply after 2013. Such investment in Asia jumped from just $2.8 billion in the first quarter of 2014 to $14.2 billion in the third quarter of 2015. In the fourth quarter it fell to $9.7 billion.Still, 2015 was a banner year for Asian venture capital investment, with deals totaling $39.7 billion in 2015, well above the $21.1 billion in 2014 and the meager $6.4 billion in 2013.The report said venture capital firms may be sitting out the latest investment rounds because they expect valuations to come back down to earth in the next year or two. In Asia, roughly one-third of investment in start-ups comes from large corporations, compared to just a quarter in North America.Lyndon Fung, an analyst with KPMG\u2019s U.S. capital markets group, wrote in the report that Chinese investors are also increasingly looking abroad.\u201cWe are seeing Chinese V.C. investors and V.C.-backed companies shifting their focus to invest in the international market, where things are a bit more stable, to acquire complementary technologies to strengthen their ecosystem,\u201d he wrote.Advertisement"}

Let\u2019s call it, Who\u2019s Losing?But don\u2019t expect it to shift much. Asking \u201cwho\u2019s losing?\u201d misses a larger truth about how thoroughly Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft now lord over all that happens in tech.Who\u2019s really losing? In the larger picture, none of them \u2014 not in comparison with the rest of the tech industry, the rest of the economy and certainly not in the influence each of them holds over our lives.But for much of the last half-decade, most of these five giants have enjoyed a remarkable reprieve from the bogeymen in the garage. And you can bet on them continuing to win. So I\u2019m coining the name the Frightful Five.Though competition between the five remains fierce \u2014 and each year, a few of them seem up and a few down \u2014 it\u2019s becoming harder to picture how any one of them, let alone two or three, may cede their growing clout in every aspect of American business and society.Indeed, the Frightful Five are so well protected against start-ups that in most situations, the rise of new companies only solidifies their lead.This gets to the core of the Frightful Five\u2019s indomitability. They have each built several enormous technologies that are central to just about everything we do with computers. In tech jargon, they own many of the world\u2019s most valuable \u201cplatforms\u201d \u2014 the basic building blocks on which every other business, even would-be competitors, depend.These platforms are inescapable; you may opt out of one or two of them, but together, they form a gilded mesh blanketing the entire economy.The Big Five\u2019s platforms span so-called old tech \u2014 Windows is still the king of desktops, Google rules web search \u2014 and new tech, with Google and Apple controlling mobile phone operating systems and the apps that run on them; Facebook and Google controlling the Internet advertising business; and Amazon, Microsoft and Google controlling the cloud infrastructure on which many start-ups run.Many of these platforms generate what economists call \u201cnetwork effects\u201d \u2014 as more people use them, they keep getting more indispensable. Why do you chat using Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp, also owned by Facebook? Because that\u2019s where everyone else is.Then there\u2019s the data buried in the platforms, also a rich source for new business. This can happen directly \u2014 for instance, Google can tap everything it learns about how we use our phones to create an artificial intelligence engine that improves our phones \u2014 and in more circuitous ways. By watching what\u2019s popular in its app store, Apple can get insight into what features to add to the iPhone.\u201cIn a way, a lot of the research and development costs are being borne by companies out of their four walls, which allows them to do better product development,\u201d Mr. Parker said.This explains why these companies\u2019 visions are so expansive. In various small and large ways, the Frightful Five are pushing into the news and entertainment industries; they\u2019re making waves in health care and finance; they\u2019re building cars, drones, robots and immersive virtual-reality worlds. Why do all this? Because their platforms \u2014 the users, the data and all the money they generate \u2014 make these far-flung realms seem within their grasp.Which isn\u2019t to say these companies can\u2019t die. Not long ago people thought IBM, Cisco Systems, Intel and Oracle were unbeatable in tech; they\u2019re all still large companies, but they\u2019re far less influential than they once were.Even with these difficulties, it\u2019s unclear if the larger dynamic may change much. Let\u2019s say that Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce company, eclipses Amazon\u2019s retail business in India \u2014 well, O.K., so then it satisfies itself with the rest of the world.So get used to these five. Based on their stock prices this month, the giants are among the top 10 most valuable American companies of any kind. Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft are the top three; Facebook is No. 7, and Amazon is No. 9. Wall Street gives each high marks for management; and three of them \u2014 Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook \u2014 are controlled by founders who don\u2019t have to bow to the whims of potential activist investors.So who\u2019s losing? Not one of them, not anytime soon.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fears About China\u2019s Economy Fester at Davos", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "Supported byDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 At the World Economic Forum here, chief executives and investors are blaming China for a slump in global markets.Fears about the country\u2019s downshift, as its official growth slowed to a quarter-century low, have dominated high-level discussions, both during public debates and in smaller, private meetings.The financier George Soros said at a dinner on Wednesday night that a \u201chard landing is practically unavoidable,\u201d adding that China is the root of the current financial crisis.But behind the gloom and doom a more complex picture is emerging among the global elite in this Alpine ski resort. Some of it is coming from those who have lived or worked in China.China\u2019s most influential executives could be seen this week in Davos, including Zhang Xin, the chief executive of the real estate developer SOHO China; Ya-qin Zhang, the president of the search engine giant Baidu; Jiang Jianqing, the chairman of the Industrial and Commercial Bank; and Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba. These leaders have stepped in to argue for a more nuanced view on China.Some have defended China\u2019s potential for growth as Western participants voiced concerns and doubts. Neil Shen, a veteran venture capitalist and one of China\u2019s most successful entrepreneurs, told one panel discussion about the evolution of Chinese industry, that Chinese companies were already competing in their own right in industries like smartphone manufacturing.Within the arena of financial markets, Chinese and Western leaders alike argued that the fears demonstrated in rocky markets were overstated. Last week, stocks moved into bear market territory \u2014 which occurs when stocks are down more than 20 percent from a high \u2014 in large part on the news of China\u2019s disappointing 2015 growth domestic product figures.Yet many cited the larger concerns that remained over China\u2019s slowing economy and whether its government will manage its transition from an economy focused on industry and exports to one that derives most of its growth from consumption. And many worried that an unintended consequence of President Xi Jinping\u2019s anticorruption campaign would be continued disruption of the financial markets.Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, touched on these points during a debate at the start of the conference. China\u2019s biggest problem today was how its government communicated with the rest of the world, Ms. Lagarde said.\u201cI would say also that given those massive transitions that are undertaken pretty much at the same time and accepted as such, there is a communication issue,\u201d Ms. Lagarde said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s something that markets do not like.\u201dLast summer, unexpected actions by the Chinese government started a global sell-off in the markets. Some of those measures nearly brought the market to a standstill. At one point in July, a third of the stock market was frozen. Investors with big stakes in stocks were prohibited from selling those stakes. Hedge funds were raided and short-sellers investigated for what the government called \u201cmalicious\u201d activity, according to state media reports. The government even organized large-scale purchases of stocks by government-linked brokerages and investment funds to prop up the plunging market.Many of these interventionist actions in the market were \u201cthe exact replicas that many other countries, including the United States, have done in certain parts of their modern history,\u201d Gary D. Cohn, president of Goldman Sachs, said.\u201cThe communication is really what\u2019s important here; communicating what the Chinese market is going to be and sticking with that theory no matter how painful it is in the transition,\u201d Mr. Cohn added.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.Speaking at the same event, Fang Xinghai, the vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, told a packed room, \u201cWe are learning. We are doing it.\u201dThis message, however, was still lost on some of the more cynical China watchers.Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard economist who has long warned of a potential financial crisis in China, remained skeptical. \u201cThere is a big propaganda push to say everything is good, everything is fine.\u201dEarlier in the week he told attendees at the forum that China\u2019s large accumulation of government debt would one day be a shock to a financial system that \u201camplifies shocks.\u201dOthers with bearish views on China have kept their claws out. Jim S. Chanos, who once said China was \u201con a treadmill to hell,\u201d said he remained deeply concerned. His hedge fund, Kynikos Associates, estimated that China\u2019s nominal gross domestic growth in 2015 was 5 percent compared with 15 percent just five years earlier.\u201cChina\u2019s debt problems still lie ahead of it,\u201d Mr. Chanos said on Thursday, referring to concerns about the extent to which China\u2019s seeming economic growth is actually fueled by borrowing.As for Mr. Soros, he told an audience at the Panorama Restaurant in the Seehof Hotel in Davos this year that the Chinese had waited too long to properly address the transition of its growth model. Asked by a Bloomberg reporter if there was a risk of repeating 2008, Mr. Soros said the market was in a similar time of financial crisis.\u201cBut the source of the disequilibrium is different,\u201d Mr. Soros said, adding that in 2008, the main cause was the United States subprime crisis. \u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201cthe root cause is basically China.\u201dMichael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "General Motors, Gazing at Future, Invests $500 Million in Lyft", "Date": "2016-01-04", "News": "Supported byG.M.\u2019s support includes more than financial backing. As part of the investment, G.M. and Lyft will work on developing an on-demand network of self-driving cars, an area of research that companies like Google, Tesla and Uber have all devoted enormous resources to in recent years.G.M. will also work with Lyft to set up a series of short-term car rental hubs across the United States, places where people who do not own cars can pick up a vehicle and drive for Lyft to earn money. Daniel Ammann, president of G.M., will join the board of Lyft, which is based in San Francisco.\u201cWe strongly believe that autonomous vehicle go-to-market strategy is through a network, not through individual car ownership,\u201d John Zimmer, president of Lyft, said in an interview.G.M.\u2019s $500 million interest in Lyft is the single largest direct investment by an auto manufacturer into a ride-hailing company in the United States, according to data from PitchBook, an alliance that pairs an auto stalwart with the kind of start-up trying to disrupt it. The investment reflects how much consumer automotive habits have been changed by technology over the last decade. With the rise of ride-sharing companies, car manufacturers have raced to adapt to how people can now use each other\u2019s vehicles for rides, which could potentially lead to a decline in car ownership.In an interview, Mr. Ammann said G.M. wanted to be part of the changing business models in transportation. \u201cWe think there\u2019s going to be more change in the world of mobility in the next five years than there has been in the last 50,\u201d he said.Mr. Ammann added that the core profit from G.M.\u2019s business comes from cars sold outside the urban environments where Lyft primarily operates, especially sales of sport utility vehicles in suburban areas.\u201cFrom a G.M. perspective, we view this as much more of an opportunity than a threat,\u201d he said.G.M.\u2019s investment is also a vote of confidence in Lyft, which faces a competitive ride-hailing field. Founded in 2012, Lyft helped promote the ride-sharing craze in the United States, positioning itself as a superior alternative to owning a car or using public transportation. Lyft users can summon a private or shared car with a few taps of an app.Lyft and G.M. did not give a specific timeline for when they expected their autonomous vehicle network to become publicly available, nor did the companies offer details on how the network is expected to function.A mix of Lyft\u2019s existing investors, including the Asian e-commerce giants Rakuten and Alibaba, also contributed to the most recent financing round, as did the Chinese ride-hailing start-up Didi Kuaidi.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of countries in which Uber operates.

{"Headline": "Global Tensions Threaten to Upstage World Economic Forum in Davos", "Date": "2016-01-18", "News": "Supported byTensions reminiscent of the Cold War keep flaring with Russia and in the Middle East \u2014 not to mention over the Korean Peninsula. Europe is struggling to cope with a refugee crisis that risks fracturing the European Union, even as the bloc tries to counter a rising security threat from the Islamic State. Britain may vote this year on whether to leave the European Union altogether. And China\u2019s growth slowdown could prompt the second global financial crisis within a decade.Given those strains, the official Davos theme this time \u2014 \u201cMastering the Fourth Industrial Revolution\u201d \u2014 may sound oddly out of tune, and the various panels on the topic could prove to be little more than sideshows.Klaus Schwab, the World Economic Forum\u2019s founder and one of the best-connected men on the planet, is nonetheless using the forum\u2019s website to urge the cadre of bankers, politicians, tech executives and trend makers to ponder \u201cthe fusion of technologies across the physical, digital and biological worlds, which is creating entirely new capabilities and dramatic impacts on political, social and economic systems.\u201dThe big-thought themes of Davos often billow above current events. Last year, the topic was \u201cThe New Global Context,\u201d a reference to shifting political, economic and social forces in the world. The year before focused on the \u201cReshaping of the World.\u201d If such banners are somewhat elusive, so, too, is the gathering\u2019s ability to map solutions to more immediate problems.But then, problem-solving is not really the point. More than anything, Davos, at about 5,120 feet, is about high-altitude networking.The forum is where hedge fund managers, central bankers, chief executives, social-media magnates, heads of state, self-help gurus, artists, celebrities, fashion models and even archbishops engage in the equivalent of intellectual or corporate speed dating. If all goes well, they may pry open a possible business deal, pad out a contact list or maybe receive enlightenment about affairs outside their professional expertise.Many deal makers retreat to hotel suites for much of the conference, forsaking the official program in favor of a whirl of meetings, emerging only to attend private parties in exclusive chalets on the Davos slopes or invitation-only power dinners.This year\u2019s tech luminaries are to include Jack Ma, the head of China\u2019s online retail giant Alibaba; John T. Chambers, the chief of Cisco Systems, the Internet hardware maker; Eric E. Schmidt, executive chairman of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company; and Sheryl K. Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook.And then there are the captains of the financial industry, including Jamie Dimon, the head of JPMorgan Chase; Gary D. Cohn, Goldman Sachs\u2019s chief operating officer; and top executives from most of the world\u2019s major banks.Also on hand will be a host of regulators who oversee the big banks, including Jacob J. Lew, the United States Treasury secretary, as well as an influential coterie of central bankers who determine monetary policy, including Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank.Foremost among their concerns this year may be whether problems in China, whose rapidly slowing economy has rattled stock and commodity markets around the world, could cause a relapse into global financial instability just as Europe and the United States are recovering from the last crisis. No clear remedies are likely to emerge from Davos, though, because top leaders from China, as in years past, will not be present.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France are conspicuously avoiding the gathering this year, judging it more effective to grapple with pressing problems back home.And then there is the controversy surrounding North Korea. Last fall, the conference organizers took the unusual step of inviting a delegation from Pyongyang. But shortly after North Korea trumpeted a nuclear bomb test on Jan. 5, the Davos organizers disinvited the delegates \u2014 prompting North Korean officials to declare the snub \u201cseriously unjust.\u201dAnd yet, in the honeycomb of private side rooms inside the old nuclear bunker where the main conference takes place, or on the leather couches of the nearby five-star Belvedere Hotel, a favorite place for private dinners and parties, there are always opportunities for key players to make progress on thorny subjects.This year, for instance, Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, is expected to meet on the sidelines with Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece, who defied the fund and Europe\u2019s political elite for many months last year over the terms of a multibillion-euro bailout, risking his country\u2019s exit from the eurozone. More recently, Mr. Tsipras, having turned from a defender of the poor to a mainstream leader eager to save Greece from further financial turmoil, is expected to try to persuade Ms. Lagarde to send more of the fund\u2019s money to Athens.And even if no big policy breakthroughs are achieved, at least there will be star power. Justin Trudeau, the youthful new Canadian prime minister, will give a keynote address aiming to sell a fresh image of Canada to the world.The stalwarts will continue to show up, including Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, who may be pressing his case that Britain should stay in the European Union if the bloc is willing to cut his country a new deal. From the United States, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is leading a delegation including Secretary of State John Kerry and Ashton Carter, the secretary of defense.As for the movers and shakers who have not had time to brush up on this year\u2019s official theme \u2014 how artificial intelligence and robotics are changing humanity \u2014 Mr. Schwab, the forum\u2019s founder, has conveniently published a new book, \u201cThe Fourth Industrial Revolution.\u201dA link on the World Economic Forum\u2019s website whisks readers to Amazon, where the 4,300-kilobyte e-book can be purchased for about $8 \u2014 a digital value that no billionaire should be able to resist.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Setting Up Fund for Its Electronics Industry", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 A Chinese technology regulator said on Friday that it would cooperate with a bank to set up a $30 billion fund to support the country\u2019s huge electronics supply chain.Official accounts of the fund did not make clear precisely how the money would be spent. But given the recent weakness in Chinese manufacturing and lower-end electronics manufacturers, it may be intended as a form of stimulus to the tech industry. The terminology used in media accounts signals China\u2019s bold technology ambitions. Reports about the new fund said it would be used to build a \u201cstrong manufacturing country\u201d and an \u201cInternet power.\u201dLocal shares have been hit hard this week by concerns about a depreciating currency and slowing growth. That volatility is most likely worsening an already difficult situation for lower-end electronics makers and component suppliers in China.While China\u2019s largest hardware brands and booming Internet companies tend to attract media attention, the country also has huge numbers of companies that support the electronics supply chain. With low margins and inconsistent orders, many are highly exposed to slowdowns in the worldwide demand for electronics.The headwinds were highlighted again on Friday, when the Taiwanese electronics manufacturing giant Foxconn said that December revenue was 20 percent lower than it was last December. The company operates a number of city-size production facilities in China.Still, Mr. Zhou said that the financing would be used to develop advanced technologies and support companies that are facing financing difficulties, an indication that it might not ultimately lead to a reduction in China\u2019s huge number of low-cost electronics manufacturers.Over the last year, the semiconductor fund has been used to finance a number of strategic investments and acquisitions in foreign chip companies. Foreign trade groups have said it gives unfair advantage to Chinese companies and is a tool of Beijing\u2019s industrial policies. It is unclear whether the new fund will be used to support acquisitions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Struggle to Quell Investor Fears Over Unsettled Emerging Markets", "Date": "2016-01-24", "News": "Supported byCurrency turmoil in China and fears of a global slowdown have led investors to abandon emerging markets in droves, rattling the large asset management firms that have long promoted such investments in their hunt for higher returns.For more than a decade, star managers at Franklin Templeton, Pimco, Aberdeen and Oppenheimer seemed more like Marco Polos than Warren Buffetts, beating a path to Internet companies in China, oil giants in Brazil and gold mines in South Africa.Investing in these high-risk markets came to be seen as a necessity for a diversified portfolio as well as an opportunity for these firms to levy some of the highest fees in the industry.Now, with investors fleeing in a fury, asset management firms are struggling to stanch the bleeding.Last year, a record $105 billion was pulled out of global mutual funds, with 26 percent of that figure coming from asset managers based in the United States, according to the fund tracker EPFR.It was the third consecutive year of bond and equity outflows and one would have go back to the Asian crisis era of the late 1990s to see a similar retreat, said Cameron Brandt, the head of research at the data provider.\u201cThis has become a chronic condition as opposed to the sudden onset of something,\u201d Mr. Brandt said. \u201cThere is almost no conviction out there right now.\u201dFor large fund companies whose assets under management ballooned on the back of these flows, the world has changed drastically, largely for the worse.Take the global bond manager Pimco. It has three bond funds that invest in developing markets that the research firm Morningstar tracks: a local currency sovereign bond fund worth $4.7 billion; a broader vehicle valued at $1.7 billion, and a corporate bond fund whose assets have eroded to $202 million from more than $1 billion.In total, investors pulled $6 billion last year from emerging market funds managed by Pimco, according to Morningstar.Pimco has had to steady itself after the explosive departure of a star manager, William H. Gross, in 2014. Yet the emerging market outflows, on top of the billions of dollars that followed Mr. Gross out the door, have only added to the firm\u2019s woes.Pimco, once the world\u2019s largest manager of emerging market bonds, has experienced industry- lagging returns from outsize bets in Brazil and Russia that have propelled an investor exodus that is getting worse by the month.Last December, investors pulled $619 million from the firm\u2019s local currency fund, which has lost 21 percent of its value over the past year, trailing every fund in the category except one, according to Morningstar.A $15 billion fund in 2013, it now languishes below $5 billion.While Pimco may be struggling, it is certainly not alone. A debt fund run by MFS investment management in Boston lost $1.4 billion last year, and Trust Company of the West in Los Angeles had outflows of $1.8 billion from its $2.6 billion bond offering last year.On the equity side, the $28 billion Oppenheimer Developing Markets fund suffered by far the largest exodus last year, with $5 billion departing the fund, according to Morningstar.And in Europe, Aberdeen Asset Management, which manages $403 billion and specializes in emerging markets, had $48 billion leave the firm. Aberdeen\u2019s stock price fell by half for the year.Traders and portfolio managers say that what worries them now is the sense that sophisticated institutional investors, who generally tend to take a longer-term view than their retail counterparts (and who might even be inclined to buy at these levels), have been the ones driving the selling over the last six months.Instead of taking advantage of bond and company valuations that are at historic lows, these investors are acting more like lemmings, unloading the good and the bad in their portfolios because that is what they see their peers doing. The panicky climate is also forcing managers to have a chunk of cash on hand to meet redemption requests.\u201cWe are seeing evidence that institutional investors are capitulating,\u201d said Charles Collyns, an economist at the Institute of International Finance, using an industry term to describe the practice of wholesale selling when all hope is lost.In a recent survey of more than 100 investment managers conducted by Northern Trust in Chicago, the No. 1 risk factor cited by respondents was that problems in China would continue to bring down growth rates in the developing world.Also of concern, regulators and economists say, is the fact that many emerging market securities, especially bonds, can be very hard to sell, especially when markets are declining.The surprise decision by Third Avenue Management last month to close down a junk bond fund because it could not meet investor demands for cash has heightened fears that an emerging market bond fund could find itself in a similar position.\u201cThere is definitely a liquidity concern out there,\u201d said Mr. Brandt, the research director at EPFR. \u201cPeople are asking: \u2018If I don\u2019t get my stuff out now, will I be able to get it out later?\u2019 \u201dThings would need to get much worse for that to happen. The bonds that trade in countries like Turkey, Mexico and Brazil are far more liquid than the deeply distressed corporate securities that Third Avenue\u2019s credit fund favored.That has not stopped the selling though \u2014 especially in recent months. For example, of the $2.5 billion that left Pimco\u2019s local currency fund last year, $1 billion came in the last two months of 2015, according to Morningstar.The emerging markets unit at Pimco is headed by Michael A. Gomez, a former debt trader at Goldman Sachs who has been at the firm overseeing these funds since 2003.The dismal performance of Pimco\u2019s emerging market funds has done little to lift morale at the firm since the departure of Mr. Gross. And while Mr. Gomez\u2019s difficult run \u2014 over the last three years his local currency fund trails 89 percent of its peers \u2014 and the sustained pace of outflows has put him under some pressure, his superiors continue to stand by him.\"Michael Gomez is the leader of the emerging market team and has our full trust and support,\" said Daniel J. Ivascyn, Pimco\u2019s chief investment officer.Last year, in an effort to better gauge employees\u2019 mood, the leadership of Pimco organized a companywide survey, according to people who were briefed on the initiative. It was the first time the company ever did such a thing, and while the 8,000 responses did vary, there were those who took the opportunity to vent \u2014 using strong language to complain about the company\u2019s culture.At an employee meeting last month at company headquarters in Newport Beach, Calif., Pimco\u2019s president, Jay Jacobs, discussed the survey results. And he said that if there were no improvements he would, at some point in the future, step down.Also addressing the staff at the meeting was Mr. Ivascyn, who acknowledged the performance problems in emerging markets and said that the firm would continue to hire more experts to help matters, with Mr. Gomez leading the recruiting effort.As is often the case in emerging markets, the most opportune time to buy is when everyone else is selling. In that regard, the rally in oil and emerging market currencies last week could well be a sign that the pessimism of late has been overdone.Mark Meisel, who conducted the survey at Northern Trust, said that while it is true that global investors fear emerging markets more than anything else, they also said that the stocks and bonds in these countries were among the most undervalued investments to be found anywhere.An article on Monday about investors\u2019 withdrawing money from emerging-market funds misidentified the MFS investment management fund that had investor outflows of $1.4 billion last year. It is the Emerging Markets Debt fund, not a local currency fund.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Argentina and Aramco Are Deals for Difficult Times", "Date": "2016-01-26", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsTwo big deals dominated the agenda in Davos, Switzerland, last week: Argentina\u2019s negotiations with holdout creditors and Saudi Arabia\u2019s potential sale of a piece of its national energy leviathan, Saudi Aramco.One would open up a robust democracy to global markets after years of feckless governance and isolation. The other would help a repressive regime retain its grip. That both would arguably leave the world better off underlines its fragile state.The plutocrats assembled in Davos at the World Economic Forum, which concluded on Saturday, spent most of their time reassuring each other that sliding stock markets represent no threat to their prosperity similar to the 2008 financial crisis. When their discussions ventured further afield \u2013 and beyond the surging poll numbers of Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidential bid \u2014 Argentina and Saudi Arabia were front and center. They represent starkly divergent developments that, while not suggestive of crisis at the doorstep, showcase the tenuous nature of global stability.Argentina\u2019s return to the economic mainstream is the happier of the two. The newly elected president, Mauricio Macri, hopes to reach a settlement with creditors led by Elliott Management who went unpaid when his predecessors defaulted. Though Mr. Macri said he had not met with Elliott\u2019s leader, Paul Singer, his delegation of cabinet members, including his finance minister and a former JPMorgan banker, Alfonso Prat-Gay, and even the leader of the opposition party, charmed the pants off the international bankers and world leaders in attendance.In addition, the Argentines used their Swiss visit to meet with bank chief executives to lay the groundwork for expanding the country\u2019s dollar reserves. By lending money to the central bank in return for as-yet-to-be-determined collateral \u2013 via a so-called repo operation \u2013 financial institutions can help bring Argentina back to the markets. That presumably entails support from the International Monetary Fund, with whom Mr. Macri and his entourage also tangoed in Davos.As Mr. Macri made a point of noting, that will benefit everyone. In an interview with Reuters, he boasted that Argentina\u2019s agricultural industry could feed 600 million people \u2013 but only if it could reach them.\u201cFor that we need infrastructure. We need roads, ports \u2014 for that we need financing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are near,\u201d he continued, to having \u201cthe worst logistics in Latin America. That\u2019s a great opportunity also for companies and investors.\u201dMr. Macri\u2019s performance should increase external pressure on the hedge fund holdouts headed by Elliott to accept any offer that looks objectively reasonable. Mr. Singer has a strong track record of holding fast to his legal convictions, but does he really want to be known as the man who deprived the world\u2019s hunger of prime Argentine beef?Contrast Argentina with the other big deal floating around Davos: a stock offering from the national petroleum company of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Bankers on Wall Street and in the City of London were feverishly preparing underwriting proposals last week for the share sale, which would probably be limited to a downstream division of Aramco to avoid shining the full spotlight of transparency on the parent\u2019s books and vast oil reserves.Top executives from banks working on the pitches professed little alacrity about the deal, for reasons that are both selfish and moral. On the first point, though an initial public offering of Aramco could be the biggest equity deal in history, the fees will be negligible. The last big Saudi Arabian I.P.O., a $6 billion offering for National Commercial Bank in November 2014, paid underwriting commissions of below 0.1 percent. By contrast, the Chinese e-commerce group Alibaba paid 12 times as much to the banks that took it public in a $25 billion deal two years ago.That might be tolerable to the banks if the deal were of a more philosophically palatable character, along the lines of, say, restoring Argentina\u2019s access to credit. Saudi Arabia last year summarily executed more than 150 people, the most in two decades, according to Amnesty International. Notwithstanding Deputy Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman\u2019s talk of transparency, the offering has to be seen as part of the Al Saud dynasty\u2019s coping mechanism for sliding oil prices and the damage this is doing to the finances of the kingdom.In an Aramco I.P.O., there\u2019s no money to be made and no pathway to moral redemption. So why participate? Though the idea of financing a regime that kicked off this year with 47 beheadings is troubling, the alternative would be worse for global stability: a chaotic, Libya-style breakdown.It\u2019s na\u00efve to think that financiers alone have the power to prevent Saudi Arabia from spreading geopolitical anxiety or to turn Argentina into a trustworthy, developed market. But given the delicate state of the global economy, World Economic Forum bankers should give it their best shot.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Yahoo\u2019s Brain Drain Shows a Loss of Faith Inside the Company", "Date": "2016-01-10", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Marissa Mayer, the glamorous, geeky Google executive hired to turn around Yahoo in 2012, used to inspire hope in Yahoo\u2019s work force just by visiting the cafeteria for ice cream and mingling.Now, morale has sunk so low that some employees refer to Ms. Mayer, Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, as \u201cEvita\u201d \u2014 an allusion to Eva Peron, the former first lady of Argentina whose outsize ego and climb to power and wealth were chronicled in the musical of that name.Ms. Mayer is about to make herself even less popular with Yahoo\u2019s nearly 11,000 employees. Faced with the failure of her efforts to reignite growth at the 22-year-old Silicon Valley company, she is now turning to the opposite strategy: cutting. As some investors press Yahoo to fire her, Ms. Mayer is crafting a last-ditch plan to streamline the company \u2014 including significant layoffs \u2014 that is expected to be announced before month\u2019s end.While many Yahoo workers are keeping their heads down, just doing their jobs, others have lost faith in Ms. Mayer\u2019s leadership, according to conversations with more than 15 current and former employees from all levels of the company, most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because of continuing ties to Yahoo and its strict policy against leaks.More than a third of the company\u2019s work force has left in the last year, say people familiar with the data. Worried about the brain drain, Ms. Mayer has been approving hefty retention packages \u2014 in some cases, millions of dollars \u2014 to persuade people to reject job offers from other companies. But those bonuses have had the side effect of creating resentment among other Yahoo employees who have stayed loyal and not sought jobs elsewhere.Only 34 percent of employees believe that Yahoo\u2019s prospects are improving, according to surveys conducted by Glassdoor, a firm that collects data on jobs and employers. That compares with 61 percent who are optimistic at Twitter, another troubled tech company, and 77 percent who see a bright future at Google, Ms. Mayer\u2019s former employer.\u201cBasically, it shows employees losing faith in Marissa Mayer and Yahoo,\u201d said Scott Dobroski, a spokesman for Glassdoor who analyzed the data.Yahoo declined to comment on employee morale but said that turnover is normal at Silicon Valley companies. While thousands of people have left, many others have been hired, offsetting some of the losses. \u201cWe\u2019re still hiring, and our application numbers are strong,\u201d Yahoo said in a statement.One Yahoo employee who was interviewed said she was praying to be laid off so she could collect a severance payment and move on with her life. Others said they were actively looking for their next jobs \u2014 a task made more difficult because of the taint of failure that potential employers sometimes associate with anyone at the struggling company.\u201cBrands are important out here for employers,\u201d said Nick Parham, a career coach in San Francisco who has had several Yahoo clients. \u201cThey are going to look harder at people from Facebook and Salesforce, companies that have winning strategies.\u201dEmployees\u2019 faith in Ms. Mayer began crumbling in earnest in August 2014, when Yahoo embarked on a series of stealth layoffs, current and former insiders said. For months, managers called in a handful of employees each week and fired them. No one knew who would be next, and the constant fear paralyzed the company, according to people who watched the process.Last March, Ms. Mayer told the staff at an all-hands meeting that the bloodletting was finally over. Shortly thereafter, she changed her mind and demanded more cuts. All told, about 1,100 people lost their jobs in the layoffs.Contributing to the employees\u2019 disenchantment were Ms. Mayer\u2019s protracted deliberations over a corporate reorganization last year that led to the departure of several key lieutenants and broke up the much-ballyhooed mobile team, prompting many mobile engineers to seek other jobs.As Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Ms. Mayer acquired more than 20 companies, but ultimately struggled to turn around the web pioneer.For all of Yahoo\u2019s problems, many of its employees still have a deep affection for the company, whose products were the gateway to the Internet for a generation of web users and still remain popular, with more than 1 billion monthly visitors.\u201cWe all want to make as much impact as we can and leverage Yahoo\u2019s existing strengths,\u201d said Austin Shoemaker, who now manages Yahoo\u2019s instant-messaging efforts after his start-up, Cooliris, was acquired by Yahoo in 2014.The company has long struggled to overcome two big challenges: the industrywide drop in display advertising that has traditionally been its primary revenue source and the distraction inherent in trying to excel at many different things, from news and fantasy sports to web searches and email.Jeff Bonforte, Yahoo\u2019s senior vice president for communications products, said that Ms. Mayer had always told people that it would take three to five years for the company\u2019s turnaround efforts to show results.\u201cIt would be nice to give Yahoo one thing to magically save the company overnight,\u201d Mr. Bonforte said in an interview last month, adding that the idea was unrealistic. Ms. Mayer has invested in technology, he said, \u201cto give Yahoo a chance to be incredibly integral to this next phase of where the Internet is going.\u201dHe said that Ms. Mayer was the best boss he had ever had, but acknowledged some truth in the common criticism that she was tightfisted with praise and sometimes displayed a harshness that could be demoralizing.\u201cMarissa is the type of boss that makes you feel like you\u2019re disappointing her at all times, so I always feel like I\u2019m on the verge of being fired,\u201d said Mr. Bonforte, who is widely respected for both his talent and his irreverence. \u201cIt\u2019s never, \u2018Way to go, Jeff!\u2019\u00a0\u201dThe latest loss was Prashant Fuloria, whose company, Flurry, was sold to Yahoo in 2014. Ms. Mayer put him in charge of Yahoo\u2019s critical advertising technology last January, but he quit in December to work on start-up ideas. Ms. Mayer has put on a brave face despite all the turmoil.Just before the party, Ms. Mayer and the company\u2019s other directors decided to stop pursuing the original Alibaba spinoff plan and instead slim down and spin off Yahoo\u2019s core business.Now, everyone is waiting for details of that plan, which Ms. Mayer has promised to outline by the time the company reports its fourth-quarter financial results this month.Mr. Bonforte said those outside forces were beyond his control.\u201cThat\u2019s the problem with a turnaround,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world gets to decide, \u2018Time\u2019s up.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Schwarzman Scholars Announces Inaugural Class to Study in China", "Date": "2016-01-10", "News": "Supported bySome of the recipients, selected from a pool of 3,000 applicants, already seem well on their way.Lt. Daniel Glenn, 28, is a graduate of the United States Naval Academy. He did his scholarship interview via Skype from a secret location in Iraq, where he is the officer in charge of a Navy special operations platoon that defuses bombs and underwater explosives. Lieutenant Glenn has also founded two philanthropic organizations, and he broke a Guinness World Record for running a mile in an 80-pound bomb suit (8 minutes and 30 seconds). He told his interviewers that he intended to eventually run for the Senate.At his Manhattan office on Thursday, Mr. Schwarzman said that he had modeled his fully funded master\u2019s program on the Rhodes scholarship, but that his was \u201cglobal with a bit of a U.S. twist.\u201dHis goal is to establish a $450 million endowment that would fund up to 200 students every year: 45 percent from the United States, 20 percent from China and 35 percent from other countries. Mr. Schwarzman, who according to Forbes is worth $9.6 billion, has personally contributed $100 million and has raised another $275 million from foundations and corporations including BP, Dow Chemical and Credit Suisse.As Mr. Schwarzman spoke, the Chinese stock market was closed after a free fall, and he waved away an assistant bearing phone messages, telling her, \u201cThat can wait.\u201dInterviews with 300 semifinalists for the scholarship were conducted in Beijing, Bangkok, London and New York, and Mr. Schwarzman said he had been involved in the interview process in London and New York. David Petraeus, the former director of the C.I.A., and Jared Cohen, the director of Google Ideas, were among the judges.Mr. Schwarzman described his role as a sort of warm-up act, greeting applicants in groups and assuring them that the interview would not be a test, but \u201cmore like an interview with Charlie Rose.\u201d The applicants were, however, asked to play with Legos \u2014 as part of a team competition to construct a model building better and faster than other applicants.Other, similar master\u2019s scholarship programs have a presence in China, notably Rhodes, which recently awarded its first round of scholarships to Oxford to students from China. Mr. Schwarzman, who has been building relationships with the Chinese ruling elite since China\u2019s government bought a $3 billion stake in Blackstone in 2007, said he created Schwarzman College to offer better networking opportunities. He said that Jack Ma, founder and chairman of Alibaba Group, had agreed to give internships to some Schwarzman scholars, and that Niall Ferguson, the historian, and Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary, would serve as visiting professors.Perhaps more significantly, Mr. Schwarzman said, his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s would have access to some of the most influential people in the Chinese power structure.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Fading Factories Weigh on an Already Slowing Economy", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported byDONGGUAN, China \u2014 Walking around an abandoned furniture factory, Fang Minghua pointed out the workshops where several hundred employees once toiled, transforming sheets of raw wood into TV stands or wardrobes for the aspiring middle class in China and other emerging economies.The factory is relocating to a new facility two hours away, priced out by rising costs and falling orders. Mr. Fang estimated that as many as a third of the furniture factories around town had gone out of business, while many others were struggling.\u201cThe economic slowdown is real,\u201d said Mr. Fang, 46, who over the last 22 years had worked his way up from $50-a-month laborer to production supervisor.The downturn in Dongguan, a once-thriving manufacturing hub, is part of the Chinese economic puzzle that global investors are trying to solve.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.While China has been moving away from the type of low-end manufacturing that has been Dongguan\u2019s specialty, the protracted slump in the country\u2019s vast industrial sector is a major threat to the nation\u2019s already slowing economy. As the government tries to manage the situation, the risk is that the Chinese economy is worse off than expected \u2014 a concern that has put markets around the world on edge.For the full year, China expanded at 6.9 percent, just below the government\u2019s target of 7 percent and the weakest performance since 1990 when foreign investment shriveled in the year after the deadly crackdown in Tiananmen Square.When it comes to the economy, Mr. Fang said, politicians and business leaders talk about industrial innovation and upgrading, \u201cbut I think that is just a slogan. It\u2019s really hard to carry out.\u201dDongguan is at the heart of south China\u2019s Pearl River Delta. For decades, the region drove the country\u2019s global ascent in exports, producing furniture, garments, shoes and other goods.But the world\u2019s workshop has been stumbling as cheaper production bases in Asia have gained ground. Last year, Chinese exports fell for the first time since the financial crisis \u2014 and for only the second time since the country\u2019s economy began reopening to the outside world in the late 1970s.That position is likely to be further eroded by the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The United States-led trade agreement deepens American ties with Asian countries like Vietnam and Malaysia, but it excludes China.The slump has created a tricky situation for the government.Officials have encouraged phasing out low-end exports in favor of promoting the service sector and high-tech manufacturing. While newer and more dynamic companies are on the rise in China, the risk is that they won\u2019t develop fast enough to offset the hollowing out of light manufacturing, which remains a shrinking but significant employer across the country.Some traditional manufacturers have responded to the downturn by relocating farther inland or overseas, where costs are generally lower. Others are trying to reduce their reliance on export orders by establishing their own branded products for domestic sale.\u201cThis is an unfortunate pain being felt in traditional, older sectors,\u201d said Louis Kuijs, the head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics. However, he added, the shift away from low-end, labor-intensive manufacturing \u201cis an unavoidable part of the structural change that the economy is undergoing.\u201dZhang Lin, 43, is trying to adapt to the shifting terrain.As a supervisor, Mr. Zhang, who left his home in western Sichuan Province 25 years ago to work in Dongguan shoe factories, once oversaw about 7,000 production-line workers at a Taiwanese-owned factory here. At their peak, before the financial crisis, factories in the city accounted for about one in every four pairs of athletic shoes sold globally, according to estimates from the Dongguan Shoe Industry Commerce Association.But rising costs have weighed heavily on the shoemaking business. The Taiwanese factory where Mr. Zhang worked closed in 2012. He and several partners went out on their own, setting up a plant making shoes and leather boots for brands like K-Swiss and Durango. Today, Mr. Zhang\u2019s factory employs about 700 people.While costs are rising, demand from overseas customers has also been declining. The company\u2019s orders slipped to about 1.2 million pairs of shoes last year, down about 15 percent from 2014.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say whether we can keep going for another five years \u2014 the outlook isn\u2019t very good,\u201d Mr. Zhang said.In response, the company has been reducing hours for its workers. It also considered moving.While the company plans to keep the existing factory here, it is making a future bet by expanding to a less-developed province, Guizhou. Labor costs there are as much as 40 percent less than those in Dongguan. Mr. Zhang also went on a scouting trip in August to Bangladesh, where some other large Dongguan shoe companies have shifted production.The factory has also started making its own line of leather casual shoes. It sells them online in China, for as much as $75 a pair, on Taobao, Alibaba\u2019s main online shopping platform.\u201cIn a situation where overseas orders are falling, you need to have a backup plan,\u201d Mr. Zhang said.Other sectors have similarly been struggling, including some electronics manufacturers. In October, Fu Chang Electronic Technology, a supplier to the telecommunications equipment makers Huawei and ZTE, shut its doors unexpectedly. The closing prompted a protest by thousands of workers in front of a government building in Shenzhen.While there are still many active factories in Dongguan, the main ones succeeding are increasingly high-tech and less reliant on large staffs.After working 15 years at an automotive plant in Alabama, Michael Recha moved to Dongguan in 2012 to set up a specialized factory for car parts, one of the first of its kind in China. Owned by Gestamp, a Spanish automotive component maker, the factory uses a technology called hot stamping to form metal sheets into precision parts like car bumpers and body panels for both local and foreign carmakers.But robots do an increasing share of the work. The factory employs just 400 workers working two shifts a day.\u201cChina is no longer a low-cost country, so we have the same robots and equipment here\u201d as in Europe, Mr. Recha said.Mr. Fang, of the furniture factory, estimates that by moving inland and consolidating three factories, the company saves about $150,000 a month in operating costs \u2014 including lower electricity and water bills, and also taxes. The biggest saving is on rent, because the owner of the company was able to buy low-cost land to build the new compound.The move, though, has extracted a different toll.The new factory is relatively remote, so there isn\u2019t much to do after work. Mr. Fang\u2019s wife, who stayed behind in Dongguan, \u201cdoesn\u2019t feel very happy about being apart,\u201d he said.Their current plan is for her to join him sometime after next month\u2019s Lunar New Year holiday.\u201cShe will get a new job, probably in the same factory with me,\u201d he said.Sarah Li contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alibaba Searching for New Revenue Sources", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsAlibaba is benefiting from China\u2019s shift toward a consumer economy. The e-commerce group\u2019s earnings in the last three months of 2015 offer another insight into China\u2019s economy as well. Both the company and the country need to find new ways to grow.Revenue surged 32 percent year-on-year to $5.3 billion in the quarter, beating expectations. Transactions on Alibaba\u2019s online marketplaces grew 23 percent, the slowest expansion in more than three years. But the $175 billion company\u2019s \u201ctake rate\u201d \u2014 how much, as a share of transaction value, the company captures from advertising fees and commissions \u2013 increased to 3 percent at the end of 2015, compared to 2.7 percent in the same period in 2014. Advertisers and sellers are paying more to Alibaba even as volume growth declines.The company, founded by Jack Ma, is benefiting as Chinese consumers get richer. China\u2019s gross domestic product expanded 6.9 percent in 2015, the slowest pace in 25 years. Growth in property investment, a major driver of the economy, dropped to an unimpressive 1 percent \u2013 a seven-year low. The country\u2019s retail sales of consumer goods were up 10.7 percent, though. Add the continuing trend from bricks-and-mortar to online retailing, and that\u2019s positive for Alibaba\u2019s top-line growth story.As with China\u2019s economy, however, Alibaba\u2019s sheer size makes growth harder to come by. After years of expanding at a breakneck pace, the e-commerce group commands 80 percent of its market and is now making a push for rural shoppers. Mr. Ma and his colleagues are also seeking new sources of revenue in areas like food delivery and cloud computing. Revenue for the latter accounted for just 2 percent of the company\u2019s total, but it more than doubled to $126 million in the three months to December.Shares of Alibaba have fallen more than 15 percent since the start of the year. Rivals like JD.com and Baidu have experienced worse slumps. Alibaba\u2019s fortunes may increasingly decouple from China\u2019s macroeconomy, but that gives investors an even more challenging task trying to look into the company\u2019s future.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Saudi Aramco I.P.O. Is Weighed by Kingdom", "Date": "2016-01-07", "News": "Supported byIt is difficult to understate just how big Saudi Aramco is believed to be. Its stated oil reserves amount to 261 billion barrels, or more than 10 times those of Exxon Mobil. As the world\u2019s biggest exporter of petroleum, it supplies roughly a tenth of the world\u2019s oil.Consider that Exxon Mobil, the world\u2019s biggest publicly traded oil producer, is valued at just over $320 billion. It\u2019s not hard to believe that Saudi Aramco would be valued at huge multiples of its American counterpart.In the interview with The Economist, Prince Mohammad agreed with the implication that an I.P.O. would be tantamount to a \u201cThatcher revolution\u201d for Saudi Arabia, referring to the 1980s privatization of a number of Britain\u2019s government enterprises under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.Saudi Aramco could be different, of course. It has unparalleled cheap access to the ocean of petroleum that floats beneath Saudi Arabia\u2019s sands.The kingdom could have fetched an even higher valuation for its crown jewel before oil began plunging in price. (Brent crude closed on Thursday just above $33 a barrel.)The kingdom would virtually certainly refuse to cede any control over the company if it is listed on a public exchange, which The Economist said would most likely be the Tadawul in Riyadh. While some companies with concentrated ownership have taken a hit on valuation, the biggest such market debutantes, like Alibaba and Facebook, have escaped such a fate.Discussions about Saudi Aramco\u2019s fate appear to be at an early stage. The Economist reports that Prince Mohammad has held two \u201chigh-level meetings\u201d to discuss a potential stock sale. And discussions about how such a stock sale would look \u2014 whether it would be for some of the producer\u2019s constituent businesses or for its parent company \u2014 are still going on.At the least, the world\u2019s biggest banks are undoubtedly salivating at the chance to work on such a big I.P.O., as much to claim credit for a prestigious assignment as it would be for the fees.Surely all of them, and Wall Street\u2019s other top institutions, would compete hard to gain an I.P.O. mandate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Starboard Value Calls for Shake-Up at Yahoo and Shift in Strategy", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byA prominent hedge fund that has long criticized Yahoo\u2019s management, Starboard Value, on Wednesday called for changes to the web pioneer\u2019s board and management to go along with a shift in the company\u2019s strategy. Otherwise, the investment firm wrote, it may try to run its own slate of directors.The challenge by Starboard, which has successfully ousted corporate boards in the past, adds yet more pressure on Yahoo as it explores ways to spin off its mainstay Internet businesses. The hedge fund has instead called on the company to sell that division outright.\u201cIf the board is unwilling to accept the need for significant change, then an election contest may very well be needed so that shareholders can replace a majority of the board with directors who will represent their best interests and approach the situation with an open mind and a fresh perspective,\u201d Jeffrey C. Smith, Starboard\u2019s managing member and chief executive, said in the letter.In a statement, a representative for Yahoo said that the company was \u201cin the midst of a multiyear transformation\u201d and that it would provide more information on its plans by the time it announces fourth-quarter earnings.Yahoo is once again trying to address its shareholders\u2019 complaints. Last month, Yahoo abandoned a plan to spin off its stake in the Alibaba Group, the Chinese e-commerce giant, into a separate company after the Internal Revenue Service declined to bless the move as tax-free.That could have left the company on the hook for a tax bill of more than $10 billion.Yet some activist investors \u2014 those who seek to change a company\u2019s strategic direction \u2014 have called for various alternatives.As Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Ms. Mayer acquired more than 20 companies, but ultimately struggled to turn around the web pioneer.The biggest by far is Starboard, which toppled the board of Darden Restaurants, the parent of the Olive Garden restaurant chain, and pushed Staples and Office Depot to merge.Starboard has argued that Yahoo\u2019s financial performance has continued to slide, which the activist shareholder has attributed to poor management.\u201cWe explained over and over again that we did not believe your actions, or lack thereof, would achieve the desired result of stabilizing the business,\u201d Mr. Smith wrote. \u201cUnfortunately, it appears we have been right, and each quarter is worse than the last.\u201dThe hedge fund\u2019s threat comes at the beginning of proxy season for corporate America, when shareholder activists can formally begin challenges for board control. According to Yahoo\u2019s shareholder materials, investors can nominate their own director candidates from Feb. 25 to March 26.Yahoo has faced challenges to its board before. Nearly four years ago, the hedge fund magnate Daniel S. Loeb fought for three director seats in a bitter public brawl \u2014 and engineered the ouster of Scott Thompson, the company\u2019s chief executive at the time, by highlighting apparent r\u00e9sum\u00e9-padding by Mr. Thompson.Mr. Loeb eventually won three seats in a settlement with Yahoo, and later helped bring in Ms. Mayer as chief executive.And in 2008, the veteran financier Carl C. Icahn took a run at the company\u2019s board, dismayed by its reluctance to sell itself to Microsoft. He eventually secured three seats in a compromise with Yahoo.It is unclear how Starboard, which reported owning less than 0.8 percent of Yahoo\u2019s shares as of Sept. 30, would fare. But the hedge fund is counting on widespread investor dissatisfaction with the failure of Ms. Mayer and the company\u2019s board to turn around Yahoo\u2019s fortunes.Still, the reaction of investors on Wednesday was muted, with shares of Yahoo closing slightly down, at $32.16.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dalian Wanda of China May Buy Majority Stake in Legendary Entertainment", "Date": "2016-01-05", "News": "Supported byInvestors in the production company, Legendary Entertainment, have agreed to sell Wanda their stakes in a deal that values Legendary at about $4 billion, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a transaction that was not yet public. The investors cashing out of Legendary own a little more than 50 percent of the company, these people said.Industry experts say the deal makes sense for both Wanda and Legendary, which tends to produce the type of big-budget, special-effects-driven movies that Chinese audiences like. In addition to owning AMC, Wanda controls the biggest cinema chain in China, where box-office receipts are set to eclipse the North American market in coming years. Wanda, a company owned by Wang Jianlin, China\u2019s richest man, can provide Mr. Tull with money, a growing audience and a champion in China that can get more of his films into the tightly controlled market.\u201cWanda represents a good source of funding for him,\u201d Peter Schloss, managing partner of CastleHill Partners, a merchant bank specializing in the media and sports industries, said by telephone from Beijing. \u201cWanda likes the deal because it segues into the approach that they are using to build themselves into a multifaceted entertainment conglomerate.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s basically putting himself in such an important position that makes it really difficult for the government to go after him, because he\u2019s actually carrying the water for the government in terms of making inroads into Hollywood,\u201d said Stanley Rosen, a professor of political science at the University of Southern California who studies China\u2019s film industry. \u201cThat\u2019s an important aspect of government policy.\u201dStill, Mr. Rosen said that the deal was best explained in business terms for Wanda, a private company, allowing it to leap over competitors like Alibaba, which is also expanding its presence in Hollywood. And since Legendary\u2019s primary focus is on American-style action movies, the opportunities for China to use the deal to increase its global \u201csoft power\u201d are limited. \u201cIf you\u2019re not promoting Chinese values and not promoting Chinese films overseas, how will this help Chinese power?\u201d Mr. Rosen asked by telephone.A spokeswoman for Legendary declined to comment. A spokesman for Wanda, David Connolly, did not respond to an email request for comment and did not answer his phone.Brooks Barnes reported from Los Angeles, and Michael Forsythe from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alibaba\u2019s Strong Earnings Are Seen as Good News for China\u2019s Economy", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Gu Minghui\u2019s sugar-cookie business is enjoying growing sales and continued profits. The big question, for China\u2019s Alibaba Group and the Chinese economy, is whether the country\u2019s appetite will last.Ms. Gu, a 37-year-old in Shanghai, worries that falling demand could hurt her business despite the current good times. \u201cI\u2019m not very confident\u201d on e-commerce, she said. \u201cThe economic situation is not good this year, and I don\u2019t expect it to be any better next year.\u201dGross merchandise volume, a closely followed measure of the total transactions on the company\u2019s websites, rose 23 percent from the same period a year earlier, to $149 billion.\u201cThe Chinese economy is going through a structural shift to more moderate, but more sustainable, growth,\u201d Joe Tsai, Alibaba\u2019s executive vice chairman, said in a conference call. He added, \u201cit\u2019s still one of the fastest-growing economies in the world and we have no reason to think anything different in the future.\u201dCiting the fact that retail sales in China grew more than 10 percent in 2015, and that Alibaba is taking business from traditional bricks-and-mortar shops, Mr. Tsai said he thought Alibaba was insulated from the deceleration of the Chinese economy.Nevertheless, shares of Alibaba fell in the United States on Thursday after opening higher.China\u2019s emerging buying class has grown in importance as the country\u2019s previous growth engines, like heavy manufacturing and exports slow, hurting global markets. Investors are using Alibaba\u2019s shares to make bets on the country\u2019s prospects.Beijing is hoping that consumer spending on sites like Alibaba\u2019s will counterbalance the slowdown in other parts of the economy. Many investors doubt that will happen. They argue that market volatility, along with China\u2019s slowing economy, will eventually leak into consumer sentiment and hit companies like Alibaba and another United States-traded rival, the search provider Baidu. Investors this year have punished Alibaba, pushing its shares down about 16 percent.\u201cIf you\u2019re sitting in Boston or New York and you want to trade China, the most liquid proxies are Alibaba and Baidu,\u201d said Chi Tsang, an analyst at HSBC.Alibaba on Thursday said it made continued progress in tapping the growing numbers of Chinese who use their smartphones to buy goods and services online. The company\u2019s sales on smartphones almost tripled from the same period last year, and its monthly active smartphone users rose to 393 million, a jump of 47 million from the previous quarter.In 2015, Alibaba captured about 35 percent of the $15.8 billion mobile ad market compared with just 29.2 percent in 2014, according to the research firm eMarketer.If the company wanted to, it could also do more to extract money from vendors like Ms. Gu. With the power to drive traffic, Alibaba is mostly in the business of selling ads and spots that get Internet traffic to vendors.Still, the company has been spending big to bolster growth in new sectors, including an expensive dive into online-to-offline services, which allow customers to use their smartphones to order a variety of goods and services, including meals and massages.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Viacom in Cross Hairs of Activist Investor", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported byTo Eric Jackson, an activist investor with SpringOwl Asset Management, Viacom appears to be a textbook-style target.The entertainment company, which owns Nickelodeon, MTV and Paramount Pictures, has a slumping stock price, a well-compensated management team and board and a decade of missed opportunities online, according to Mr. Jackson.Viacom sold half its stake in Vice Media \u2014 a company now reportedly valued at more than $4 billion \u2014 for just millions in 2007, according to Mr. Jackson. He also took issue with Viacom counting the host of a CBS-produced show as an independent director, even though Viacom shares its chairman with CBS.In a new, 99-page report, Mr. Jackson outlined a plan \u2014 including replacing Viacom\u2019s management and board, instituting a cost-cutting program and recruiting new leaders. He said these changes could increase the stock price by as much as 135 percent.But unlike Mr. Jackson\u2019s previous campaigns, most notably at Yahoo, Viacom comes with the hurdle of a dual-class share structure. Sumner M. Redstone, Viacom\u2019s 92-year-old chairman, holds a majority of the voting power through his holding company, National Amusements, meaning any changes would have to come at the will of the media mogul.Frustrated shareholders, who include Gamco Investors\u2019 chief executive, Mario Gabelli, have had no recourse other than to complain publicly.\u201cAt the end of the day, they can tell us to pound sand, and we\u2019re kind of stuck,\u201d Mr. Jackson, a managing director at SpringOwl, said in a phone interview. \u201cViacom made sense to own because even though we\u2019ve got some strong criticisms over the C.E.O., it\u2019s so lowly valued, in our view, there could be a number of things that become catalysts.\u201dMr. Jackson owns a relatively small amount of Viacom, well below the threshold of 5 percent required to file with regulators.\u201cViacom\u2019s board and management team are completely focused on delivering long-term value to shareholders,\u201d said a Viacom spokesman, Carl Folta. \u201cWe are looking to the future, and the opportunities ahead.\u201dThe company, which owns Nickelodeon, MTV and Paramount Pictures, has a slumping stock price, a well-compensated management team and board and a decade of missed opportunities online, says Eric Jackson.He added that the company was \u201cencouraged by the growth in our strong international business, the ratings upswings at most of our networks, Paramount\u2019s strong start in 2016, our leadership position in advertising technology and other positive recent developments.\u201dViacom\u2019s stock price has underperformed peers, currently trading at half the level of its July 2014 peak. The report estimates that replacing Viacom\u2019s chief executive, Philippe P. Dauman, could provide the most upside to the stock. Mr. Dauman, along with the chief operating officer, Thomas E. Dooley, were granted a combined $432 million in cash and stock over the five years through 2014, higher than comparable executives at CBS, Disney, Time Warner and Fox, according to SpringOwl figures.Mr. Jackson declined to specify who would be a fit replacement for Mr. Dauman, but suggested that someone would need to have a better understanding of digital strategies. Viacom, under Mr. Dauman\u2019s leadership, had sold the half of Vice Media it owned for $3 million in 2007, the report showed. He also suggested that the management team consider partnerships for Paramount Pictures with Alibaba or Amazon, as well as a merger with AMC.Mr. Jackson also notes how Mr. Redstone, facing a legal battle from a former companion questioning his mental capacity, has skipped earnings calls and shareholder meetings.Mr. Jackson criticizes the makeup of Viacom\u2019s board, saying that only 27 percent could truly be classified as independent. Viacom counts Deborah Norville, host of the CBS-produced program \u201cInside Edition,\u201d as an independent director, even though Mr. Redstone also owns a controlling stake in CBS.Mr. Jackson says he has had little luck reaching executives at Viacom.\u201cWe have reached out to the company to try and communicate these ideas, and it hasn\u2019t been a great experience getting a hold of them so far,\u201d Mr. Jackson said.Separately, a shareholder filed a lawsuit contending that board members of Viacom and CBS are conflicted and have put the interests of the Redstone family before that of those of the companies. The suit charges a breach of fiduciary duty and a waste of corporate assets.In the suit, E. F. Greenberg says that none of the directors are independent and that they are responsible for \u201csubstantial financial and reputational damages\u201d at the companies. One example is the \u201cmany millions of dollars\u201d paid to Mr. Redstone for serving as executive chairman of Viacom and CBS while \u201cphysically and mentally incapacitated.\u201dThe suit is based on the accusations made by Mr. Redstone\u2019s former companion, Manuela Herzer, in a separate court battle.Mr. Folta, the Viacom spokesman, called the shareholder suit \u201cwithout merit.\u201d Dana McClintock, a CBS spokesman, declined to comment.Viacom\u2019s chief executive has said that while Mr. Redstone has physical disabilities he is engaged and attentive. During the three-year period from 2012 to 2014, Mr. Redstone\u2019s total compensation from the two companies was more than $169 million.Advertisement"}
