On Wednesday, DeepMind, a research organization that operates under the umbrella of Alphabet, reported that a program combining two separate algorithms had soundly defeated a high-ranking professional Go player in a series of five matches.Go is seen as a good test for artificial intelligence researchers because it is more complex than chess, with a far larger range of possible positions. This makes strategy and reasoning in the game more challenging.The Alphabet approach relies on the newest so-called deep learning approach combined with a more traditional type of algorithm known as a Monte Carlo, which is designed to exhaustively explore large numbers of possible combinations of moves. The researchers said they had also trained their program using input from expert human Go players.The research and the game have created a rivalry among the public relations departments of companies like Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook.There will be a $1 million prize for the winner, and Mr. Hassabis said that Alphabet would donate the prize to charity if AlphaGo won. The match will be streamed live on YouTube.Mr. Hassabis, who is a skilled chess player and has been a professional gamer as well, said that Go was a beautiful game, but that \u00e2\u0080\u009cbuilding an A.I. is also a human endeavor and a kind of ingenious one, too.

Microsoft\u2019s cloud services include Azure, which allows organizations to host their own websites and online applications in Microsoft\u2019s data centers, as well as Power BI, Dynamics CRM Online and other Microsoft-made applications for running organizations. CRM Online, for instance, is a customer relationship management service that can be useful for nonprofits in accepting financial contributions from individual donors.   Microsoft has been giving away traditional software for years. Mr. Smith estimates the value of those software donations at about $750 million a year and said that they will continue even as Microsoft gives away cloud services. Microsoft hopes to give away its cloud services to 70,000 nonprofits in the next three years. The company plans to expand by 50 percent an existing program that donates Azure storage and computing resources to university projects. The company will also invest in low-cost Internet access technologies in developing countries. Microsoft says it will not take a tax deduction for the donated cloud services.Mr. Smith said that Microsoft decided against creating an independent foundation for its philanthropic efforts because it believed the effort would have more impact if it was part of the company. \u201cOur philosophy is that philanthropy, at its best, often combines doing well with doing good,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the defining characteristics of Microsoft in 2016 is the degree to which we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a mission-driven company.

{"Headline": "Activision Buys Major League Gaming to Broaden Role in E-Sports", "Date": "2016-01-04", "News": "Supported byThe deal, worth $46 million, is relatively small for a company the size of Activision, which has a market value of over $27 billion. But it could play a significant role in Activision\u2019s broader ambitions to become a bigger player in the media business.Robert A. Kotick, chief executive of Activision Blizzard, said he saw an opportunity to build a bigger mainstream audience for e-sports through more professionally produced events modeled on traditional athletic competitions and the broadcasts that bring them into homes.While most of its e-sports events are more likely to be watched over the Internet, as most professional e-sports competitions are today, Activision intends to bring them to viewers through a traditional television channel distributed by cable and satellite providers, Mr. Kotick said.\u201cI have a simple vision for this,\u201d Mr. Kotick said in a phone interview. \u201cI want to build the ESPN of video games.\u201dActivision has already begun bringing in people with extensive backgrounds in broadcasting and e-sports. In October, Activision hired Steve Bornstein, the former chief executive of ESPN and NFL Network, to run its new media division. It also hired Mike Sepso, a co-founder of Major League Gaming, to serve as a senior vice president of the division.As part of the acquisition, Sundance DiGiovanni, the other co-founder of Major League Gaming and its chief executive, will join Activision.Major League Gaming, founded 12 years ago, will continue to organize professional video game competitions featuring games made by Activision and other publishers.Other big publishers have begun increasing their investments in e-sports in recent months. In December, Electronic Arts, the publisher of the Madden and Battlefield franchises, formed an e-sports division and appointed Peter Moore, its former chief operating officer, to run it. Last year, Microsoft increased its investments in a professional tournament for players of Halo, its science-fiction shooter game.But no publisher has been more successful at fostering a large e-sports audience than Riot Games, whose October championship match for its arena battle game, League of Legends, was viewed by as many as 14 million people at one time, up from 11 million the prior year.For the most part, publishers like Riot have viewed e-sports as a way to energize their fan bases by showcasing the talents of the most highly skilled players. The competitions are not generally big sources of profits on their own but benefit publishers indirectly by improving sales and increasing the online purchases that occur within games.Mr. Kotick, of Activision, said that he saw similar benefits for his company\u2019s games, but that he believed organized competitions would become a big business in their own right, as corporate sponsors and advertisers become more familiar with the category.Activision is hardly the first company to consider the broadcasting of e-sports competitions as a crucial piece of the e-sports business. Twitch became a streaming powerhouse by allowing professionals and amateurs to broadcast matches, and it was eventually acquired by Amazon for nearly $1 billion. YouTube, which is owned by Google, has also turned itself into a popular destination to view gaming videos of all kinds.Much of the gaming content on Twitch and YouTube is contributed by users, though these platforms also broadcast professional competitions. Mr. Kotick thinks an e-sports network singularly focused on premium content \u2014 including slickly produced competitions and news shows akin to \u201cSportsCenter,\u201d on ESPN \u2014 will be able to attract more interest from advertisers.\u201cWe think user-generated-content networks are great and widely available,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is really focused on premium content.\u201dThe studios within Activision that make its games will be able to decide whether to team with Activision\u2019s own broadcasting arm to air their competitions or an outside company, Mr. Kotick said.In addition to Call of Duty, the digital card game Hearthstone, developed by the Blizzard side of the company, has developed a sizable e-sports following. Blizzard\u2019s StarCraft helped create the modern e-sports scene, which first emerged in South Korea over a decade ago.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rams Moving to Los Angeles Area, and Chargers Could Join Them", "Date": "2016-01-12", "News": "Supported byHOUSTON \u2014 After more than two decades, the N.F.L. has found its way back to Los Angeles.The St. Louis Rams will move to the Los Angeles area, where they intend to build a new, nearly $3 billion stadium in an entertainment complex in Inglewood, Calif., just over 10 miles from downtown. The San Diego Chargers will have the option to join them as soon as next season, and if they decline, the Oakland Raiders could make the move.The Rams, who played in the Los Angeles area for decades, will give the area its first N.F.L. team since 1995, when they moved to St. Louis, followed by the Raiders, who left Los Angeles a few months later that year for Oakland. Owners for both teams could not agree with civic leaders on new or refurbished stadiums.The announcement came on Tuesday after a series of private meetings spread over 12 hours here among some of the biggest titans of industry, including Robert A. Iger, the chairman of Disney; Paul Allen, the Microsoft co-founder and now owner of the Seattle Seahawks; and E. Stanley Kroenke, the owner of the Rams, whose fortune derives in part from the Walton family of Wal-Mart fame, hashed out the move that had eluded the league for two decades.\u201cWe have the return of the Los Angeles Rams to their home,\u201d the N.F.L. commissioner, Roger Goodell, said in a news conference, looking tired after a day of marathon meetings and deliberations. \u201cWe have a facility that is going to be absolutely extraordinary, and that is going to set a new bar.\u201dFlanked by the chairmen of the Los Angeles Opportunities committee, Bob McNair of the Houston Texans and Art Rooney of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Goodell said that the facility in Inglewood was \u201cmore than just a stadium\u201d and would be a \u201csignature product.\u201dMoving two N.F.L. teams at once to the same city is unprecedented, and if the Chargers join the Rams, they will be the second current pair to share a stadium, after the Jets and the Giants, who moved to MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., in 2010.The return to Los Angeles fills a void for the nation\u2019s most popular sport, which has enjoyed explosive growth over the past two decades even without a team there.Over the years, some of Los Angeles\u2019s biggest power brokers, including the entertainment mogul Michael Ovitz, the philanthropist and developer Eli Broad and the supermarket magnate Ron Burkle, had made overtures to the league for a team, to no avail. The decision, in a 30-2 vote among the league\u2019s 32 team owners, comes after more than a year of often acrimonious lobbying by the Chargers, the Raiders and the Rams, who each applied to move to the Los Angeles area last month because, they said, they were unable to get enough public support to build new stadiums in their markets.At least 24 owners had to vote in favor of the move for it to gain approval.St. Louis fans reacted with anger, and civic leaders said the N.F.L. disregarded their efforts to keep the team.\u201cIt is troubling that the league would allow for the relocation of a team when a home market has worked in good faith and presented a strong and viable proposal,\u201d Gov. Jay Nixon of Missouri said in a statement. \u201cThis sets a terrible precedent not only for St. Louis, but for all communities that have loyally supported their N.F.L. franchises.\u201dLos Angeles leaders exulted.\u201cThe water drought is still with us, but the Los Angeles football drought is over,\u201d Mayor Eric Garcetti said in an interview.He added, \u201cI think there is tremendous excitement in L.A. I can feel it in the streets.\u201dThat remains to be seen.With Los Angeles the nation\u2019s second-largest television market, the N.F.L. has longed for a return to the area, where several Super Bowls have been played. But taxpayers\u2019 apprehension on financing stadiums or difficulties acquiring suitable sites have stymied previous efforts to put a team there.Los Angeles football fans also have a reputation for being among the most blas\u00e9 about following their teams; although civic leaders have chafed at the absence of a team, there has never been a strong outcry from the populace, in part because games from every other N.F.L. city are readily available on television.Some owners favored letting only one team move to Los Angeles because they did not believe two teams could be successful there right away. Still, three teams were willing to bet the attraction was strong and applied to move to Los Angeles, with the teams\u2019 owners planning to foot all or most of the bill for stadiums.The Rams will build a glass-roofed stadium that could cost nearly $3 billion, easily the most expensive building in sports.If an agreement is reached between the Rams and the Chargers, the Rams will play temporarily at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum \u2014 previously the home to the Rams, the Chargers and the Raiders and the site of two Super Bowls, including the first, in 1967 \u2014 starting in August 2016.Where the Chargers would play temporarily is unclear.\u201cMy goal from the start of this process was to create the options necessary to safeguard the future of the Chargers franchise while respecting the will of my fellow N.F.L. owners,\u201d Dean Spanos, the chairman of the Chargers, said in a statement. \u201cI will be working over the next several weeks to explore the options that we have now created for ourselves to determine the best path forward for the Chargers.\u201dKroenke \u2014 who also owns the Colorado Avalanche of the N.H.L., the Denver Nuggets of the N.B.A. and Arsenal of the English Premier League \u2014 has already acquired the land and rights to build in Inglewood.The Rams are expected to pay the league a relocation fee of $650 million, stretched out over about 20 years.The Chargers originally teamed with the Raiders, but that partnership fell apart when the Rams\u2019 proposal won 20 votes at a ballot earlier Tuesday. At that point, the other owners pressured the Chargers to work out a deal with the Rams in Inglewood.In 2014, Kroenke bought a 60-acre tract in Inglewood, and he later added land where the old Hollywood Park Racetrack stood. Last January, he announced plans to build a domed stadium surrounded by an entertainment district.Weeks later, the Chargers, who say that a quarter of their fans come from Los Angeles and Orange County, said they would build an outdoor stadium in Carson with the Raiders.The Chargers and the Raiders also recruited Iger, the chairman of Disney, to serve as an honorary executive and help plan the stadium. In the end, Iger\u2019s expertise and connections in the entertainment business were not enough to reassure other owners that the stadium in Carson could outdo the proposal in Inglewood.The Raiders will presumably begin fresh negotiations with the city of Oakland over a new stadium. Libby Schaaf, the mayor, has said the city cannot afford to help build a stadium, but it could provide the land and infrastructure improvements needed for one. On Tuesday, she welcomed the chance to restart talks with the team.Los Angeles has had professional teams for decades, and the Chargers, the Raiders and the Rams have all played in the city at some point. The Chargers, a charter member of the A.F.L., left Los Angeles for San Diego after one season. Los Angeles has long been a favorite of the league, and the league has been eager to have such a marquee city again on its map.In 1996, the Seahawks toyed with moving to Southern California, but the team was sold to Allen, who helped build a new stadium for the team in Seattle. Three years later, the league wanted to add a 32nd team, but when Los Angeles and the N.F.L. could not agree on a stadium site, the owners awarded the franchise to Houston.In the years afterward, proposals were offered to build stadiums in downtown Los Angeles, in nearby City of Industry and elsewhere. But none of the investors were able to persuade an N.F.L. team to move into a stadium that it did not control.Nevertheless, the absence of a team in Los Angeles was used as a bargaining chip by teams trying to build stadiums in their home markets. The Minnesota Vikings, among other teams, have floated the idea of moving to Los Angeles as a way to win public funding for a stadium.Although the N.F.L. has not had a team in Los Angeles in recent years, it has kept a foothold in that region. NFL Network is headquartered in Culver City, the owners have held meetings in the area, and the Dallas Cowboys hold their training camp in Oxnard. Television ratings for N.F.L. games are also strong in the region.The N.F.L. has expanded rapidly in the two decades since the Raiders and the Rams left, which has led some to posit that the league did not need to return to Los Angeles. The city has two big college teams, and fans from all over the country have moved to the region and root for an array of teams from elsewhere. Some sports business experts have suggested that placing a team in Los Angeles does not guarantee success.Los Angeles is merely the latest return destination for the N.F.L.; the league has put a team back in every city it has left in the past few decades, including Baltimore, Cleveland, Houston, Oakland and St. Louis, and generally succeeded.Mark Leibovich contributed reporting from Houston, and Mike Tierney from Los Angeles.Advertisement"}

Let\u2019s call it, Who\u2019s Losing?But don\u2019t expect it to shift much. Asking \u201cwho\u2019s losing?\u201d misses a larger truth about how thoroughly Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft now lord over all that happens in tech.Who\u2019s really losing? In the larger picture, none of them \u2014 not in comparison with the rest of the tech industry, the rest of the economy and certainly not in the influence each of them holds over our lives.But for much of the last half-decade, most of these five giants have enjoyed a remarkable reprieve from the bogeymen in the garage. And you can bet on them continuing to win. So I\u2019m coining the name the Frightful Five.Though competition between the five remains fierce \u2014 and each year, a few of them seem up and a few down \u2014 it\u2019s becoming harder to picture how any one of them, let alone two or three, may cede their growing clout in every aspect of American business and society.Indeed, the Frightful Five are so well protected against start-ups that in most situations, the rise of new companies only solidifies their lead.This gets to the core of the Frightful Five\u2019s indomitability. They have each built several enormous technologies that are central to just about everything we do with computers. In tech jargon, they own many of the world\u2019s most valuable \u201cplatforms\u201d \u2014 the basic building blocks on which every other business, even would-be competitors, depend.These platforms are inescapable; you may opt out of one or two of them, but together, they form a gilded mesh blanketing the entire economy.The Big Five\u2019s platforms span so-called old tech \u2014 Windows is still the king of desktops, Google rules web search \u2014 and new tech, with Google and Apple controlling mobile phone operating systems and the apps that run on them; Facebook and Google controlling the Internet advertising business; and Amazon, Microsoft and Google controlling the cloud infrastructure on which many start-ups run.Many of these platforms generate what economists call \u201cnetwork effects\u201d \u2014 as more people use them, they keep getting more indispensable. Why do you chat using Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp, also owned by Facebook? Because that\u2019s where everyone else is.Then there\u2019s the data buried in the platforms, also a rich source for new business. This can happen directly \u2014 for instance, Google can tap everything it learns about how we use our phones to create an artificial intelligence engine that improves our phones \u2014 and in more circuitous ways. By watching what\u2019s popular in its app store, Apple can get insight into what features to add to the iPhone.\u201cIn a way, a lot of the research and development costs are being borne by companies out of their four walls, which allows them to do better product development,\u201d Mr. Parker said.This explains why these companies\u2019 visions are so expansive. In various small and large ways, the Frightful Five are pushing into the news and entertainment industries; they\u2019re making waves in health care and finance; they\u2019re building cars, drones, robots and immersive virtual-reality worlds. Why do all this? Because their platforms \u2014 the users, the data and all the money they generate \u2014 make these far-flung realms seem within their grasp.Which isn\u2019t to say these companies can\u2019t die. Not long ago people thought IBM, Cisco Systems, Intel and Oracle were unbeatable in tech; they\u2019re all still large companies, but they\u2019re far less influential than they once were.Even with these difficulties, it\u2019s unclear if the larger dynamic may change much. Let\u2019s say that Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce company, eclipses Amazon\u2019s retail business in India \u2014 well, O.K., so then it satisfies itself with the rest of the world.So get used to these five. Based on their stock prices this month, the giants are among the top 10 most valuable American companies of any kind. Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft are the top three; Facebook is No. 7, and Amazon is No. 9. Wall Street gives each high marks for management; and three of them \u2014 Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook \u2014 are controlled by founders who don\u2019t have to bow to the whims of potential activist investors.So who\u2019s losing? Not one of them, not anytime soon.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Looking for Signs That Apple\u2019s Runaway Growth Is Waning", "Date": "2016-01-24", "News": "Supported byAlready, some investors have begun to treat Apple in a new way: as a \u201cvalue\u201d stock, a label typically attached to companies that generate predictable business results or a reliable dividend, rather than ones that deliver runaway revenue growth. Value stocks often command much lower valuations than growth stocks.\u201cPeople were in love with Apple because hits like the iPod and iPhone created phenomenal growth,\u201d said Ernesto Ramos, a fund manager at BMO Global Asset Management, which manages $18 billion and counts Apple as its largest holding. \u201cAs investors shifted their minds around the fact that it\u2019s no longer going to deliver the same sort of huge growth over the next five years, the stock became a value play.\u201dMr. Ramos says his firm still owns Apple in some of its growth funds, but began including the stock in value funds in mid-2013.Switching from being a growth stock to being a value stock can also be a long and painful process. Growth investors need to sell a company\u2019s shares and drive down the price until it is low enough to tempt value investors, who buy stocks they think are cheap compared with the intrinsic value of the company. In the tech industry, a shift from growth to value also often signals to investors that a company is facing newer competitors with more innovative products, raising the question of how relevant the company can remain.\u201cInvestors don\u2019t like to see the words tech and value combined because when growth slows at a tech company, it usually means that something essentially is not working,\u201d said Angelo Zino, a senior analyst at the research firm S&P Capital IQ.A spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment.Any change would have repercussions beyond Apple because its soaring performance in recent years helped lift the broader market. If Apple shares were removed from the equation, the performance of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index in five of the last seven years would drop by about 1 percentage point, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices. In 2014, for instance, the index rose 13.7 percent with Apple and 12.9 percent without Apple.The Apple effect is even more pronounced when technology names are isolated. For tech stocks on the S.&P. 500 as a group, annual gain in 2009 declined by 6 percentage points when Apple shares were not included, dropping to 56 percent from 62 percent.The effect was more muted last year as Apple\u2019s growth decelerated, according to the data.Investors have turned to Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet, which owns Google \u2014 collectively referred to as the FANG stocks \u2014 for growth. Those companies are each expected to show annual revenue gains of 23 to 40 percent for the last three months of 2015, while Apple is projected to deliver 3 percent revenue growth, according to Bloomberg data.Mr. Ramos says companies like Amazon have bigger growth potential for his fund than Apple, though he plans to continue owning Apple shares. \u201cAmazon will see about 20 percent revenue growth, and earnings per share are expected to jump considerably,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a very strong growth story.\u201dApple shares have already been buffeted in recent months because of worries about the slowing economy in China, which the company counts as one of its largest markets. Half a dozen companies that provide parts for the iPhone also blamed weak demand from Apple for lower-than-expected earnings, causing worries about the company\u2019s sales trajectory.\u201cIf you wanted to outperform the market, the FANG stocks did better,\u201d said Jonathan Krinsky, an analyst at MKM Partners, though he added that Apple remained a must-watch stock because it composed such a large part of many stock indexes.Investors may still someday reanoint Apple as a growth stock, especially if the company can create a best-selling new product that drives up its sales rate. Wall Street analysts cite Microsoft as an example of a business that lost steam and then made the adjustments necessary to deliver strong revenue growth again.Apple has been reclassified as a value stock before. FTSE Russell, which makes several closely followed stock indexes, found in 2013 that Apple no longer met its criteria to be treated purely as a growth stock.

A year later, when the company\u2019s sales had risen strongly with the introduction of the iPhone 6, FTSE Russell placed Apple solely back in the growth index.Tom Goodwin, FTSE Russell\u2019s senior research director, said that stock price, sales growth and analyst expectations determine whether a company is placed in the growth or value index, or in both.

{"Headline": "Microsoft Profit and Revenue Fall, but Cloud Computing Grows", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byOn Thursday the company said its revenue and profit fell in the last quarter. But it mattered little, as Microsoft made more from cloud computing, and its stock jumped more than 5 percent immediately after the numbers were released.The success of Microsoft\u2019s cloud business under Mr. Nadella, its new chief executive, has put the company\u2019s stock back in favor with investors. Even with recent anxiety in the stock market, Microsoft\u2019s shares are up more than 28 percent for the last year, while shares in rivals like Apple, Oracle and IBM have declined by double digits.By most analysts\u2019 estimates, Microsoft is in second place in the most prominent segment of the cloud services market \u2014 in which computer storage and other services in data centers are rented to customers \u2014 after Amazon. IBM and Google are next.For its second fiscal quarter, which ended on Dec. 31, the company reported net income of nearly $5 billion, or 62 cents a share, compared with $5.86 billion, or 71 cents a share, during the same period a year earlier.Revenue fell to $23.8 billion, down from $26.47 billion a year ago.The figures in the recent quarter reflected a huge deferral of revenue, almost $1.9 billion, related to Windows 10, the company\u2019s latest operating system. Although it collects all the cash up front from selling the software to PC makers and others, accounting rules dictate that the company has to spread its recognition of the money over the life of the product.Without that deferral, Microsoft had $25.69 billion in revenue and 78 cents a share in earnings, better than the average forecast of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters of 71 cents a share in earnings and $25.26 billion in revenue.Even without the Windows deferral, Microsoft\u2019s numbers declined from the previous year, in large part because the company in July sharply scaled back the ambitions of its money-losing smartphone business, acquired from Nokia. The company\u2019s phone revenue plummeted 49 percent when excluding foreign currency fluctuations as a result of the changes, which included cutting the number of smartphones it sells.Microsoft\u2019s cloud business encouraged investors. The company\u2019s intelligent cloud group, which includes its Azure service, rose 5 percent to $6.3 billion. It now has 20.6 million consumer subscribers to Office 365, the cloud version of its productivity applications, up from 9.2 million a year earlier.Last July, Microsoft introduced Windows 10, raising some hope in the industry of a rebound in PC sales. That rebound has not materialized yet.Global shipments of new PCs declined 8.3 percent during the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier, the research firm Gartner recently reported.The revenue Microsoft gets from PC makers for Windows declined 5 percent in the quarter, excluding foreign currency impacts. Revenue from its own Surface line of computers and tablets rose to $1.35 billion from $1.1 billion a year earlier.The company no longer charges most customers to upgrade existing computers to Windows 10, hoping to get as many people as possible running the latest operating system and wooing developers back to Windows. The company has lost considerable influence among developers, who have gravitated to Apple\u2019s iOS and Google\u2019s Android operating systems.In a phone interview, Amy Hood, Microsoft\u2019s chief financial officer, said Microsoft was not yet predicting a turnaround in the PC market. \u201cOur expectation for the PC market is roughly in line with most analysts,\u201d Ms. Hood said. \u201cFor the next year, we understand the market is not likely to grow, but we can still grow.\u201dAdvertisement"}

To make it a bit easier, you can keep a digital journal or diary with you wherever you go, and many are set up to encourage people to keep typing away day after day.You can tag photos with people\u2019s names or a location, and then browse back through the diary entries to see all the posts associated with that person or place. You can also search entries to locate a keyword.Momento is easy to use and offers plenty of on-screen guidance to help manage its more complicated features (such as backing up diary entries to iCloud). The app can automatically prompt you to write a diary entry, and you can set up several reminders, each with its own prompt, like \u201cTake a daily photo.\u201dYou can share entries with family and friends by iMessage or in an email, or even share online with a bigger audience on Facebook or elsewhere.Writing an entry in Askt is straightforward: It has a large empty page where you can type and embed photographs. To look back through your writing, either swipe through the app\u2019s pages (which are animated to resemble real pages being turned in a paper diary) or tap on the date to choose a specific day in the past. There is no search feature.The bells and whistles in this app are limited to setting a daily reminder, choosing the color scheme and exporting entries to a PDF file. I like this simplicity, which keeps my mind focused on the journal-writing task. Although Amazon offers the app free for Android devices, that version is supported by ads, and some features, like photo embedding, are disabled. Enabling the full set of features requires an in-app purchase.Perhaps the best-known journal-writing app for iOS devices is Day One. Its many features and extras include weather data for your location when you write a journal entry, and the ability to add exercise data. When you have written about your day, you can choose to make the post available as a webpage. \u201cPublishing\u201d journal entries like this may be useful if, for example, you are keeping your family updated while traveling. Of course you can choose to keep your diary entries private and unpublished \u2014 even locked safely out of view behind a passcode if you prefer.Day One has a clean, minimalist interface and is relatively easy to use. However, I found the app\u2019s many features distracting as I tried to get my thoughts about the day out of my head and onto the page.But it has a few quirks, such as allowing only one photo per diary entry. And while the app is free, you have to make a $6 in-app purchase if you want to export your journal.

I\u2019ve got to say, I love earnings season. It\u2019s the one time we get a peek at some of the actual numbers that are often hidden in the murk of Silicon Valley puffery. And this week brought some big reversals.I wonder if we\u2019re witnessing what could be a long-term shift in Wall Street\u2019s attitude toward Jeff Bezos\u2019s shopping engine. For two decades, investors have been willing to let Bezos reinvest every penny Amazon makes into building out a bigger and bigger company. But last year, Amazon started to show investors some skimpy profits \u2014 which are, like, the actual point of running a business \u2014 and to everyone\u2019s surprise, people on Wall Street seemed to like the money, and now they seem to keep wanting more.So it will be interesting to watch Amazon\u2019s fortunes over the next year. Will investors continue to punish it for favoring growth over profits? And if they do, will Jeff Bezos care?But you covered the earnings, so I\u2019ll let you take it away.No one was ready for it, as we spent years just building out advertising for larger screens. Entire companies were destroyed. There were ripple effects in adjacent companies that were deeply connected to Facebook. (Go look at Zynga before and after its I.P.O.) It was a total mess.Facebook went heads down and figured out how to create ads that aren\u2019t terrible and conform to a screen the size of a smartphone. And lo and behold, the company did it in an amazingly fast amount of time. In 2012, Facebook\u2019s mobile advertising revenues represented roughly 20 percent of the company\u2019s overall ad revenue. As of last quarter, that number has quadrupled to 80 percent. It\u2019s astounding how fast it was able to do it.That\u2019s why I always try to keep people\u2019s expectations of me incredibly low.

It said that at the time, it notified its customers of suspicious activity on their accounts and forced them to reset passwords, without specifying where the attacks might have come from.\u201cWe weighed several factors in responding to this incident, including the fact that neither Microsoft nor the U.S. government were able to identify the source of the attacks, which did not come from any single country,\u201d Microsoft said in the statement. \u201cWe also considered the potential impact on any subsequent investigation and ongoing measures we were taking to prevent potential future attacks.\u201dIn a blog post describing their warnings, Google declined to say exactly how it knew the attacks were state-sponsored, but said its alerts were the result of detailed analysis and victim reports. Google advised users to take additional precautions, like using stronger passwords and turning on two-step verification, which provides users with secondary codes via text messages or phone calls for accessing their accounts.An earlier version of this article misstated the timing of a Reuters report on Microsoft\u2019s handling of a 2012 hacking incident.

{"Headline": "Microsoft Acquires Minecraft App for Schools", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported byNow Microsoft hopes Minecraft can help it in classrooms, another area where its once-mighty grip has been shaken by companies like Google and Apple.The modifications to the game were created by a start-up, TeacherGaming, that Microsoft is not acquiring. Microsoft declined to say how much it was paying for MinecraftEdu.While Minecraft is known as a game, it is more akin to a digital sandbox, inside which players can construct anything they want, much of it out of block-shaped materials. The creative, rather than destructive, possibilities of Minecraft have caught the eyes of educators, who see it as a supplemental learning tool for everything from anatomy and earth science to math and literature.In the Santa Ana Unified School District in Orange County, Calif., for example, elementary school students in social science classes have met up inside the game and recreated the features of local historical sites they have studied, such as the Mission of San Juan Capistrano. Students in science classes there have used it to demonstrate their understanding of building circuits.Most of Minecraft\u2019s appeal is as entertainment, though. There are more than 100 million registered Minecraft players. It is the top paid app, years after the game was introduced, on the two dominant mobile app stores from Apple and Google, and is the best-selling PC game of all time, according to Microsoft. More than 160 million people have watched over five billion hours of Minecraft videos on YouTube.In short, Minecraft continues to be a huge success a year and a half after Microsoft bought Mojang, the Swedish creator of the game, for $2 billion. But it has not yet buttressed other Microsoft businesses the way company executives had hoped.Some believed, for example, that making Minecraft available for Microsoft\u2019s smartphones could give the struggling devices a lift. They are still struggling.\u201cNow that we\u2019re a little way down the road from the acquisition, it still isn\u2019t clear to me what the synergies are between Microsoft\u2019s core business and Minecraft,\u201d said Jan Dawson, an analyst at Jackdaw Research.\u201cTo be sure, Minecraft itself continues to be a very successful and popular franchise,\u201d Mr. Dawson said, \u201cbut I\u2019m not seeing any evidence that Microsoft is somehow benefiting beyond the performance of Minecraft itself as a stand-alone entity.\u201dClassrooms could be a test of whether Microsoft can use Minecraft to achieve broader company objectives.Microsoft offers productivity tools \u2014 like Office 365 Education, which includes PowerPoint and OneNote, a digital notebook system \u2014 free to teachers and students. And some teachers say they are excited about using Microsoft apps like Skype, the videoconferencing platform, as educational tools with their students.But Google has made strong inroads in schools, reporting recently that its free software program for classrooms, called Google Apps for Education, was now used by more than 50 million students, teachers and administrators worldwide. In such a competitive landscape, the positioning of Minecraft for the classroom as Minecraft: Education Edition may help Microsoft gain more visibility in schools.\u201cObviously, we want to increase the connection Microsoft has to students and teachers,\u201d said Anthony Salcito, vice president for worldwide education at Microsoft. Of products like Skype and OneNote, he added: \u201cMany of these offerings are underused by education.\u201dMicrosoft plans to charge schools $5 per student annually for access to the education edition of Minecraft \u2014 a fee that could limit how widely it is adopted. MinecraftEdu charged a server license fee and a one-time fee based on the maximum number of students who would be using the service at any one time.Microsoft executives said the company would offer volume discounts for districts that want to make the game available to all students. And they said the new edition would offer features that MinecraftEdu does not.While the previous system required schools to run a separate server for multiplayer use of the game, the new system will let students log in with their school IDs from any school computer or personal device. The new version will also update at the same time as the consumer version, a new feature.Joel Levin, a former computer teacher in New York who co-founded TeacherGaming, the start-up that created MinecraftEdu, said the emphasis on creation was what made Minecraft a compelling tool for learning.\u201cI think it wouldn\u2019t work as well as it does in classrooms if it wasn\u2019t so fun to play,\u201d Mr. Levin said. \u201cThe term \u2018chocolate-covered broccoli\u2019 is often applied to bad learning games. It\u2019s fun, so kids are engaged. That gets them in their seats.\u201dThere is little research to date to demonstrate that using Minecraft in schools directly leads to improved academic results. Researchers at the University of Maine recently announced a $2 million grant to study how the game might affect students\u2019 interest in science, math and engineering.Teachers and researchers say they believe Minecraft and other games can improve important skills that students are likely to need later on in their working lives, such as creative problem-solving, collaboration and design thinking.Minecraft, for example, could help students learn to visualize and build solutions for multilayered open-ended problems like how to cross a river when there is no bridge or how to structure Greek architecture, said Eric Klopfer, a professor of science education at Massachusetts Institute of Technology who directs the university\u2019s teacher education program.\u201cIf it\u2019s a well-defined problem, a computer can solve that,\u201d Professor Klopfer said. \u201cWe need students to be able to answer undefined problems.\u201dNick Wingfield reported from Seattle, and Natasha Singer from New York.

And it directs the National Science Foundation and the Corporation for National and Community Service to spend more than $135 million in existing funds on teacher training over a five-year period beginning this year.White House officials say the need is critical, in part because other nations are doing a better job educating young people in computer sciences, a fast-growing part of the global economy.Only a quarter of the elementary, middle and high schools in the United States offer computer science classes, with 22 states not allowing such classes to count toward a diploma, officials said. Only 4,310 of 37,000 high schools in the country offer Advanced Placement computer science classes, they said, putting American children at a disadvantage.\u201cThat\u2019s what this is all about \u2014 each of us doing our part to make sure all our young people can compete in a high-tech, global economy,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones who will make sure America keeps growing, keeps innovating and keeps leading the world in the years ahead.\u201dIn addition to federal spending, Mr. Obama is urging private technology companies to do more to support computer science education.Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, praised that effort in a conference call with reporters that the White House organized on Friday. He said the company, which has already invested in efforts to encourage computer science education, was beginning a 50-state campaign to expand it further.He called the effort by Mr. Obama and the other companies a \u201csocial imperative\u201d for schoolchildren.\u201cMore than anything else, what we\u2019ve learned is that computing and computer science have become foundational for the future,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just a tech issue. This isn\u2019t just an economic issue.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Now, Self-Driving Cars Still Need Humans", "Date": "2016-01-17", "News": "Supported bySUNNYVALE, Calif. \u2014 Car enthusiasts, after hearing industry executives discussing the self-driving technology being built into their vehicles, might be forgiven for thinking robotic cars will soon drive themselves out of auto showrooms.Mr. Musk also said that within a year or two, it would be technically feasible to summon a Tesla from the opposite side of the country.But there is a growing gap between what these executives are saying and what most people think of when they hear executives or scientists describing autonomous or driverless cars.What Mr. Musk and Mr. Ghosn are describing \u2014 cross-country-driving hyperbole aside \u2014 are cars with advanced capabilities that can help drive or even take over in tricky situations like parallel parking on a busy street.Truly autonomous cars that do all the work, like the bubble-shaped vehicles Google has been testing near its Silicon Valley campus, are still at least a decade away from ferrying people around town, said Xavier Mosquet, a senior partner at the Boston Consulting Group and managing director of the firm\u2019s Detroit office.\u201cThis is going to be a journey, and a reasonably long one,\u201d he said.Cars are beginning to drive on their own in certain situations, and in the coming years, they will do increasingly more under computer control. They will follow curving roads, change lanes, pass through intersections, and stop and start.But they will require human supervision. Significantly, on many occasions, the cars will in effect still tell their human drivers, \u201cHere, you take the wheel,\u201d when they encounter complex driving situations or emergencies.In the automotive industry, this is referred to as the handoff problem, and automotive engineers acknowledge that there is no easy solution. Automotive designers have not yet found a way to make a driver who may be distracted by texting, reading email or watching a movie perk up and retake control of the car in the fraction of a second that is required in an emergency.The danger is that by inducing human drivers to pay even less attention to driving, the safety technology may be creating new hazards.Although Dr. Thrun left Google several years ago, he is still involved in the field of artificial intelligence. He describes himself as an enthusiastic Tesla owner. On a recent test drive, he cataloged the car\u2019s limitations and errors, including those he described as \u201ccritical interventions\u201d in which the driver must override the car\u2019s behavior.The Tesla Autopilot system permits drivers to remove their hands from the wheel, but it prompts them to regain control after a brief period. It will also warn a driver to retake control in certain situations.The Tesla performed well in freeway driving, and the company recently fixed a bug that had caused the car to unexpectedly veer off onto freeway exits. However, on city streets and country roads, Autopilot\u2019s performance could be described as hair-raising. The car, which uses only a camera to track the roadway by identifying lane markers, did not follow the curves smoothly. It also did not slow down when approaching turns.On a recent 220-mile drive to Lake Tahoe from Palo Alto, Calif., Dr. Thrun said he had to intervene more than a dozen times.The company said that on Jan. 9, it introduced a new version of the Autopilot software that offered both restrictions and improvements in handling.Like the Tesla, the new autonomous Nissan models will still require human oversight and will not drive autonomously in all conditions. Nissan\u2019s engineers acknowledged that even their most advanced models would not be autonomous in every situation, including snow, heavy rain and even some nighttime driving.\u201cThere are certain limitations depending on the condition of the weather. For example, if you are in heavy snow or rain, it is impossible to have autonomous driving,\u201d said Tsuyoshi Yamaguchi, Renault-Nissan\u2019s executive vice president for technology development. \u201cWe should make sure the vehicle recognizes it and gives a caution to the driver.\u201dThe situation is further complicated by laws and regulations that require cars to be controlled by humans. In Europe, the 1968 Vienna Convention required that \u201cevery moving vehicle or combination of vehicles shall have a driver,\u201d and \u201cevery driver shall at all times be able to control his vehicle.\u201d Although an amendment has been proposed, no new legislation is yet in place.None of that has discouraged some enthusiastic Tesla owners. Doug Carmean, a Microsoft computer designer who commutes daily between Seattle and Redmond, Wash., said he had encountered the Tesla Autopilot offramp bug and found it \u201cscary.\u201dYet as much as 45 minutes of his commute each day is in slow, stop-and-go traffic, and his car will effortlessly and predictably follow the car ahead, permitting him to surf the web on the Tesla\u2019s giant display.\u201cEven though it has these frightening movements, I\u2019ve come to enjoy it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sense of awe and pleasure.\u201dAdvertisement"}

You roll up your sleeves, you redouble your commitment to those ideals in a changing world, and you fight.\u201dHe put the magazine up for sale, throwing up his hands in frustration. \u201cI underestimated the difficulty of transitioning an old and traditional institution into a digital media company in today\u2019s quickly evolving climate,\u201d he wrote.Welcome to the age \u2014 and whimsy \u2014 of the new billionaire class and the precariousness of vanity projects. With so much money sloshing around, and more and more of the superwealthy pushing into areas beyond their expertise, it is likely we will see more headlines about the failure of some of these fanciful investments and philanthropic experiments.Just over the weekend, the Russian billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov completed a major shake-up of the Brooklyn Nets, a team he bought five years ago that has struggled both on and off the court. It lost a reported $144 million last season.Of course, there have been success stories. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, bought The Washington Post, which so far has had success under his stewardship and he appears to be a long-term investor in the business.Dov Seidman, the founder of LRN, a firm that advises companies on their cultures and how they can translate them into better performance, said that earning gobs of money could often give billionaires a false sense of omniscience.\u201cSometimes if you create wealth and value quickly in one domain with one set of skills, however gifted and talented you are, it can give you the sense that you can apply it to any domain,\u201d Mr. Seidman said.That\u2019s not to take away from some of the most successful philanthropists, like Bill Gates, a co-founder of Microsoft who has spent years devoting himself to learning everything about polio and malaria, for example, and working toward eradicating them. (Though, in truth, he has spent a lot of money on projects that didn\u2019t work along the way.)Still, as more billionaires are minted amid a ferocious debate about inequality, and the superwealthy continue to buy up trophy assets and seek to sway public policy, it has created a backlash and some are questioning whether they are amassing too much influence.\u201cThe megarich increasingly use their foundations and their celebrity as philanthropists to mold public policy to an extent not possible for other citizens,\u201d Joanne Barkan, who has long been a critic of big philanthropy, wrote in The Guardian.That could turn out to be true for new money coming out of Silicon Valley, which has created a generation of young, idealistic entrepreneurs who want to get involved in transforming businesses and institutions at early ages. There are about 40 men and women under the age of 40 who are worth at least a half-billion dollars, according to Forbes.\u201cA lot of young people aren\u2019t waiting their turn to lead,\u201d Mr. Seidman said, suggesting that successful executives used to wait until retirement to try their hand at new projects. He added: \u201cTheir intent is going to get revealed. Are you deeply committed? How will you act when the path isn\u2019t linear?\u201dAnd praying for a wealthy benefactor to save a business is also a flawed business model. John Henry, the billionaire owner of the Boston Red Sox, bought The Boston Globe in 2013 from The New York Times Company. He has invested in The Globe, though it continues to struggle in the challenging newspaper business. Last year, another round of layoffs hit the newsroom. Of course, Mr. Henry can afford to take a risk on a declining business that requires a turnaround.For Mr. Hughes and The New Republic, that may be what happened. He seemed well intentioned. He talked about reviving the publication and restoring its glory, and yes, even making it profitable. He sought to remake the magazine for a digital age. But in the process, much of his staff left the publication and today the business is worth less than when he started.\u201cI bought this company nearly four years ago to ensure its survival and give it the financial runway to experiment with new business models in a time of immense change in media,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAfter investing a great deal of time, energy, and over $20 million, I have come to the conclusion that it is time for new leadership and vision at The New Republic.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fund Managers Win With Tech Stalwarts and Burly Brand Names", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byBets on the biggest purveyors of technology \u2014 companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft \u2014 powered three of the top-performing funds of the fourth quarter.Mr. Baker, who has managed the fund since 2009, said he believed that the best companies combined top technology with burly brand names and large scale. Take Alphabet, he said. \u201cNot only does it have a great brand, but every day it does seven to eight times as many searches as all of its competitors combined. So every day its search accuracy is improving that much faster than competitors\u2019.\u201dAs befits a growth investor, Mr. Baker is a technophile. He will riff at length about the technological themes that undergird his picks, like the omnipresence of cloud computing, the maturation of solar power and the promise of artificial intelligence. Skeptics complain the information age isn\u2019t yielding benefits comparable to the industrial revolution, but that is humbug, he says.\u201cThe steam engine, to take advantage of that, you needed to dig canals and put in railroads. The peak change was 75 to 100 years after the invention.\u201d As far as the microchip goes, he said, \u201cAll of the infrastructure is in place, and we\u2019re entering the period of peak economic and social change.\u201dEven video game makers are benefiting, he said. Consider Activision Blizzard, another top holding and the producer of Call of Duty and Guitar Hero. A decade ago, its market comprised a few million game consoles and personal computers, Mr. Baker said. \u201cNow you have a billion smartphones, all of which you can play a video game on.\u201d And Activision Blizzard is trying to broaden its share of the mobile market with its pending acquisition of King Digital Entertainment, maker of the game Candy Crush.Mr. Baker\u2019s fund, with an expense ratio of 0.83 percent, returned 13.34 percent for the quarter, compared with 7.04 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.\u201cBrands hold their value, and a global brand isn\u2019t dependent on one geography,\u201d she said. Est\u00e9e Lauder, Starbucks and Nike were all among her fund\u2019s recent stakes. \u201cTheir markets are growing because they address the whole world,\u201d she said.Sturdy brands also drew her to Constellation Brands, which owns the United States rights to popular Mexican beers like Corona, Modelo and Pacifico, as well as a groaning cellar of wines. \u201cIn good times and bad, people still drink wine and beer,\u201d she said.Ms. Starke took over her fund about a year and a half ago. It then held more than 80 stocks. She set about paring that number, with an aim of keeping the portfolio at 30 to 50 holdings. \u201cIn large-cap growth, it\u2019s hard to outperform with a big portfolio,\u201d she said. \u201cA concentrated portfolio is the way to do it.\u201d With too many holdings, a fund can end up looking too much like the broader market and merely matching its return.She also plowed a greater portion of the fund\u2019s money into her top picks. Previously, the top 10 holdings accounted for about 14 percent of the portfolio, she said. Now they are more than 40 percent.The fund\u2019s biggest sector weightings are information technology, health care and consumer discretionary. Those tend to produce the best earnings growth, she said. \u201cI\u2019m looking for healthy earnings growth and healthy sales growth,\u201d she said.Ms. Starke\u2019s fund, with an expense ratio of 1.12, returned 9.92 percent in the fourth quarter.Like Mr. Baker\u2019s fund, it lately held shares of Microsoft. Mr. Kleinschmidt said the fund had owned the stock for about a decade, even as the company was seen as falling behind competitors like Apple and Google. But Microsoft kept putting up strong numbers, he said.\u201cForget the name,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I just gave you their market share, their cash flow, their return on equity, if I showed you all of that, would you be interested? Yes. Most people would be.\u201dFacebook, an overlap with both Mr. Baker\u2019s and Ms. Starke\u2019s top holdings, is a more recent purchase. Mr. Kleinschmidt said he was attracted to the social network\u2019s enormous customer base, about 600 million people when the company went public in 2012. Tocqueville bought shares in the months after Facebook\u2019s initial public offering, when the stock sagged. \u201cI reasoned a smart management team would be able to figure out how to make money on 600 million users,\u201d Mr. Kleinschmidt said. Facebook says its network has grown and estimates more than a billion people use its service daily.Mr. Kleinschmidt has patience. As he has with Microsoft, he will stick with a stock for years. His fund\u2019s annual turnover ratio is 15 percent. In contrast, the average actively managed stock fund tracked by Morningstar turns over about two-thirds of its portfolio annually.\u201cOne of the hardest things to do in this business \u2014 and yet one of the best things \u2014 can be to sit on your hands and not let the market\u2019s noise convince you that you have to do something,\u201d he said.Mr. Kleinschmidt cautioned that his turnover might increase in coming months. As a contrarian, he said he often finds buying opportunities when the market sags, as it has lately. \u201cThe essence of a contrarian thinker is to lean against the wind. You do that by looking into situations where the prevailing feeling is, \u2018Oh, my God.\u2019\u201dMr. Kleinschmidt\u2019s fund, with an expense ratio of 1.25 percent, returned 10.97 percent in the fourth quarter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Education Technology Graduates From the Classroom to the Boardroom", "Date": "2016-01-17", "News": "Supported byJudging by the number of learning apps available to classrooms around the country, the education technology market aimed at elementary through high schools is booming.The money pouring into ed tech tells a different story, however. Despite the volume of novel products aimed at schools, the biggest investments are largely going to start-ups focused on higher education or job-related skills \u2014 businesses that feed a market of colleges, companies and consumers willing to spend to promote career advancement.The financing trend highlights the difficulties facing the numerous young companies that develop apps for school use. Many of those tech start-ups have been able raise early-stage financing, often in comparatively small amounts; a subset of those, mimicking techniques established by popular consumer apps, have grown quickly by giving away their products.But industry analysts say school start-ups that have not yet figured out how to make money are likely to have a harder time raising mid-stage financing this year \u2014 which could lead to a bit of a shakeout in the industry.\u201cWe have yet to see that aha business model in the space,\u201d said Matthew Wong, a research analyst at CB Insights. \u201cThe pressure is now on those companies to show they can provide scalable revenue models.\u201dMany big companies also pay for corporate learning services to administer and track internal programs like sexual harassment training. That has already led some academic-focused start-ups to rethink their audiences.\u201cA very simple explanation is: In corporate, they have money,\u201d said Josh Coates, the chief executive of Instructure, an ed tech company that has broadened its strategy.In 2011, Instructure began marketing a learning management system, called Canvas, to universities and school districts. Last year, the company expanded its business into employee-training platforms for corporations. Mr. Coates said he expected that Instructure would eventually derive much of its revenue from companies, which pay higher fees than schools.\u201cIf they can make an employee 2 percent better by paying $50 for corporate training, they are going to do that in a heartbeat,\u201d Mr. Coates said. \u201cA school can\u2019t do that kind of calculation. It\u2019s not an obvious return on investment.\u201dInstructure went public in November and, as of the close of business on Friday, had a market capitalization of about $490 million.The increased availability of connected devices in turn has paved the way for a new generation of learning apps, websites and software services. Some have attracted large user bases by offering a free basic product to teachers while charging schools a site license fee to use a more premium product.Yet software start-ups hoping to sell to schools face particular challenges. The market is divided into about 13,500 districts, each with its own curriculum review and often monthslong purchasing processes. And while digital tools have great potential to make education more accessible and efficient, it is unclear whether the latest wave of technology will significantly improve learning and academic outcomes for the majority of students over the long term.Some ed tech start-ups are hedging their bets by expanding beyond schools to corporations, professionals and even parents.Because many school start-ups are so new, Mitch Kapor, a partner at Kapor Capital, a venture capital fund that has invested in more than 30 education start-ups, predicted that it would take seven to 10 years for the school ed tech market to become clearer.\u201cI think we will see some successes,\u201d said Mr. Kapor, creator of the software Lotus 1-2-3. \u201cBut we\u2019re also going to see lots of companies get off to a good start, falter, end up being acquired, or fail.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Actually, I just wanted to make sure I didn\u2019t miss the Seahawks game, mindful of Seattle\u2019s woeful offensive line.In the information blur of last year, you may have overlooked news of our incredibly shrinking attention span. A survey of Canadian media consumption by Microsoft concluded that the average attention span had fallen to eight seconds, down from 12 in the year 2000. We now have a shorter attention span than goldfish, the study found.Attention span was defined as \u201cthe amount of concentrated time on a task without becoming distracted.\u201d I tried to read the entire 54-page report, but well, you know. Still, a quote from Satya Nadella, the chief executive officer of Microsoft, jumped out at me. \u201cThe true scarce commodity\u201d of the near future, he said, will be \u201chuman attention.\u201dPutting aside Microsoft\u2019s self-interest in promoting quick-flash digital ads with what may be junk science, there seems little doubt that our devices have rewired our brains. We think in McNugget time. The trash flows, unfiltered, along with the relevant stuff, in an eternal stream. And the last hit of dopamine only accelerates the need for another one.I can no longer wait in a grocery store line, or linger for a traffic light, or even pause long enough to let a bagel pop from the toaster, without reflexively reaching for my smartphone. One of the joys of going to Europe was always the distance \u2014 nine hours in my case \u2014 from compulsive contemporaneous chatter. While I hiked the Cinque Terre, the West Coast was sleeping. No more. Somebody, somewhere is alerting me to something that can\u2019t wait.You see it in the press, the obsession with mindless listicles that have all the staying power of a Popsicle. You see it in our politics, with fear-mongering slogans replacing anything that requires sustained thought. And the collapse of a fact-based democracy, where, for example, 60 percent of Trump supporters believe Obama was born in another country, has to be a byproduct of the pick-and-choose news from the buffet line of our screens.Even \u201cDownton Abbey,\u201d supposedly an exemplar of popular taste for refined drama in the Digital Age, is in fact a very hyper-paced entertainment. The camera seldom holds a scene for long, cutting from Mrs. Patmore\u2019s sexual advice to the butler Barrow\u2019s latest plotting at a speed that is more Nascar than \u201cMasterpiece Theatre.\u201dA New York friend used to send me clever, well-thought-out emails, gems of sprightly prose. Then he switched to texting, which abbreviated his wit and style. Now all verbs and nouns have vanished; he sends emojis, the worst thing to happen to communication in our time.But all is not lost. I don\u2019t know what the neuroscience has to say about this, but I\u2019ve found a pair of antidotes, very old school, for my shrinking attention span.The first is gardening. You plant something in the cold, wet soil of the fall \u2014 tulip bulbs or garlic \u2014 and then you want to shout, \u201cGrow!\u201d Eight seconds later, nothing. Working the ground, there\u2019s no instant gratification. The planting itself forces you to think in half-year-increments, or longer for trees and perennials. The mind drifts, from the chill of a dark day to a springtime of color. Hope, goes the Emily Dickinson poem, is the thing with feathers. But it\u2019s also the thing that rises from a tiny seed, in its own sweet time.The second is deep reading, especially in the hibernation months of winter. I\u2019m nearly done with the second volume of William Manchester\u2019s masterly biography of Winston Churchill, \u201cThe Last Lion.\u201d (O.K., I\u2019m late to the book, Churchillians.) It\u2019s zipping by. Next up is a new history of the Roman Empire.Remember all those predictions that technology was going to kill book reading? It never happened. Paper books and stores that sell them are experiencing a revival of sorts. So, yes, I\u2019m as screen-scrolly as the next guy when I\u2019ve got the world in the palm of my hand. But put the thing aside, and kneel next to fresh-tilled earth, or curl up with an 800-page tome, and you find that the desire for sustained concentration is not lost.

Google is the runaway leader in online search. Facebook is the largest social network in the world by a wide margin. Amazon is far and away the biggest e-commerce site.But while market dominance is hard to break, that doesn\u2019t stop upstarts from trying. In the case of Uber, it is Lyft that is doing its best to keep up.\u201cWe\u2019re gaining share in the United States,\u201d said John Zimmer, Lyft\u2019s president and co-founder. \u201cThat\u2019s not what happens when one player has a complete monopoly.\u201d\u201cThe mere possession of monopoly power, and the concomitant charging of monopoly prices, is not only not unlawful; it is an important element of the free-market system,\u201d Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in that opinion. \u201cThe opportunity to charge monopoly prices \u2014 at least for a short period \u2014 is what attracts \u2018business acumen\u2019 in the first place; it induces risk-taking that produces innovation and economic growth.\u201dIn the book \u201cZero to One,\u201d which he wrote with Blake Masters, the investor and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel offers tips on how to create monopolies, arguing that once achieved, they lead to more innovation.\u201cMonopolies drive progress because the promise of years or even decades of monopoly profits provides a powerful incentive to innovate,\u201d he writes. \u201cThen monopolies can keep innovating because profits enable them to make the long-term plans and to finance the ambitious research projects that firms locked in competition can\u2019t dream of.\u201dAnd regulators have not been cracking down on Silicon Valley. Given how many big technology companies loom large in their respective markets, there have been relatively few big antitrust actions brought against tech giants.\u201cThis is different from the old monopolies of the industrial age,\u201d Robert Reich, the former labor secretary, said of technology companies.Unlike United States Steel or Standard Oil, two of corporate history\u2019s biggest brutes, today\u2019s tech monopolies are rarely the exclusive provider of an essential commodity. Instead, many achieve their initial dominance by distinguishing themselves in a crowded marketplace, then rapidly taking market share thanks to the power of network effects \u2014 that is, the more people use a service, the more valuable that service becomes to other people, who join in and make the service all the more popular.Network effects helped Google, Facebook and Amazon run away from their competitors, and are helping Uber today. Google wasn\u2019t the first search engine, Facebook wasn\u2019t the first social network, and Amazon wasn\u2019t the first to sell goods online. There are still many other sites for search, social and e-commerce. But despite an array of options, users keep coming back to the market leaders.Some argue, however, that the regulatory framework needs to adjust for a new kind of market dominance.Along with network effects, another hallmark of today\u2019s tech monopolies is that, perhaps fearing obsolescence, they diversify. While Microsoft still makes its Windows and Office software, it also owns Skype and has a big video gaming business. Google is now a subsidiary of Alphabet, a new parent company that is also home to a health care company, a self-driving-cars division and a venture capital firm. Amazon is expanding its cloud computing and streaming-media businesses. And Facebook has diversified into messaging with WhatsApp, photos with Instagram, and virtual reality with Oculus Rift.This, too, creates challenges for regulators. When mergers and acquisitions are part of the natural life cycle of start-ups and venture capital, it isn\u2019t easy to block deals that might hypothetically reduce competition down the road. As a result, regulators have blessed many acquisitions that, to critics, appear to be deeply anticompetitive.Gary Reback, a lawyer who helped prompt a landmark antitrust investigation into Microsoft and is now pursuing Google in Europe, makes the case that Google bought its way to dominance in online advertising through the acquisition of DoubleClick, bought its leadership in mobile by purchasing Android and bought its strong mapping franchise in the deal for Waze. Similarly, Facebook bought two of its nearest rivals, WhatsApp and Instagram. If any of those deals had been blocked, Mr. Reback argues, behemoths like Google and Facebook might today be facing more concerted competition.\u201cOnce one of these companies gets a monopoly, it\u2019s easy to spread the monopoly to adjacent markets by acquisition,\u201d Mr. Reback said. \u201cYou would think antitrust enforcers would know this by now.\u201dWhile monopolies in the tech industry are perhaps easier than ever to achieve, industry experts contend they are also more vulnerable than ever before. The advent of the smartphone and widespread access to broadband Internet connectivity have democratized access to creative new technologies.\u201cSun Microsystems. EMC. Cisco. All these were considered the dominant market players in their category at the time,\u201d said Rich Wong, a venture capitalist at Accel Partners. \u201cThen the vast majority of them got whacked by this thing called the cloud.\u201dAnd of course, billions of people browse the web without Google, use other social networking apps besides Facebook, and shop on websites besides Amazon. Though no upstarts have replaced them yet, none are immune to disruption.As for Uber, if it\u2019s not a monopoly already, it is the giant in the ride-hailing market, at least in the United States. One rival, Sidecar, shut down last month, and Lyft is its last meaningful competitor on a national scale. (Uber faces a tougher road abroad, where it is tangling with regulators in Europe, recently withdrew from Frankfurt and is fighting against entrenched rivals in China and other international markets.)As the underdog, Lyft is trying to put more drivers on the road and acquire new users. Like Uber, the company is private, and neither shares much information about performance. But Mr. Zimmer said the company was quickly increasing market share in the United States. He also sees the on-demand ride business as different from search or social media and more like telecommunications companies, where several big competitors can compete on service.\u201cJust like AT&T and Verizon need three bars of coverage,\u201d he said, \u201cwe get down to two to three minutes of wait time for a vehicle to arrive. Once it gets to that point, there\u2019s no difference in behavior between services. That\u2019s when you compete on experience.\u201dStill, Lyft will be hard pressed to unseat Uber.\u201cThe network effects hold competition at stiff arm\u2019s length,\u201d said Steve Cheney, an entrepreneur and co-founder of Estimote, a micro-location platform for mobile developers.Or perhaps the ride-hailing market is big enough for both Uber and Lyft. Monopolies don\u2019t necessarily mean there is no competition whatsoever. While a company like Uber may take a huge lead in market share, others, like Lyft, may still have room to profit and even prosper. Even Google has not managed to squash every other search engine.\u201cMicrosoft has a decent search business. A lot of Yahoo\u2019s profits still come from searches on Yahoo properties,\u201d said Roelof Botha, a partner at Sequoia Capital, which has investments in WhatsApp and Airbnb. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a \u2018winner takes most\u2019 than a \u2018winner takes all\u2019 phenomenon.\u201dShould that be the case in the ride-hailing industry, Uber and Lyft may become something truly competitive by Silicon Valley standards: a duopoly.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bill Gates: The Billionaire Book Critic", "Date": "2016-01-02", "News": "Supported byEvan Thomas, the best-selling biographer of Robert F. Kennedy and Dwight D. Eisenhower and the author of a half-dozen other books, has seen those books reviewed over the years by The New Yorker, The Washington Post and The Atlantic. But with the recent publication of his latest work, \u201cBeing Nixon: A Man Divided,\u201d he experienced for the first time a new phenomenon: the Bill Gates bump.Mr. Thomas was taken by surprise. \u201cI\u2019ve never met Bill Gates,\u201d he said. \u201cI had no idea he had a books blog.\u201d\u201cI was thrilled because he has a lot of reach,\u201d Mr. Thomas said, adding that sales of the book jumped soon after that review was posted. \u201cI can tell the blog is well read because I heard from all sorts of random people.\u201dThen he began to post these recommendations and critiques on the blog. \u201cA few years ago I started thinking it would be fun to share some of these notes with the public,\u201d Mr. Gates wrote in a recent email interview. \u201cI have always loved reading and learning, so it is great if people see a book review and feel encouraged to read and share what they think online or with their friends.\u201dMr. Gates says he reads about 50 books in a year, eschewing digital readers for old-fashioned books on paper. When he is busy with work, he reads about a book or two a week but will consume four or five in the same period while vacationing with family.He has loved reading since boyhood. \u201cI did things like reading the encyclopedia for fun,\u201d he said, \u201cand I was lucky in that my parents would buy me any book I wanted.\u201dMr. Munroe first learned that Mr. Gates had read and enjoyed his book when a relative sent him a screen shot of a photograph showing Mr. Gates reading his book. \u201cI stared at it for a while,\u201d Mr. Munroe said in a phone interview. \u201cIt didn\u2019t really register. I didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201dHe rarely posts negative reviews of books, explaining that he sees no need to waste anyone\u2019s time telling them why they shouldn\u2019t bother reading something. He doesn\u2019t spare himself, though. \u201cI have a habit, which I don\u2019t recommend, of finishing essentially every book I start,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if I disagree with a book I spend lots of time writing notes in the margins. Perversely, this means that the more I dislike a book, the longer I spend reading it.\u201dAs publishers have become more aware of Mr. Gates\u2019s reviews \u2014 missing the publicity they used to get from Oprah Winfrey\u2019s televised book club or from the regular author appearances on \u201cThe Colbert Report,\u201d which have been less frequent since Stephen Colbert moved to CBS from Comedy Central \u2014 they have tried to figure out how to get their new books in front of him.Stephanie Kim, a publicist for Mr. Munroe\u2019s publisher, hustled her way into a connection with someone on Mr. Gates\u2019s team only to be told, \u201c\u2018We don\u2019t have any say over what Bill chooses,\u2019\u201d she said \u201c\u2018We just leave it on his desk and he reads what he wants to read.\u2019\u201d Ms. Kim lucked out.Mr. Gates\u2019s reading selections are influenced by his wife, his work and the experiences that move him. \u201cSomeone at the foundation recently recommended \u2018The Vital Question,\u2019 by Nick Lane,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich is about mitochondria and the origins of life on Earth. It was so good that as soon as I finished it, I ordered all of Lane\u2019s other books.\u201d\u201cThis is one of the things I love about reading,\u201d Mr. Gates said. \u201cEach book opens up new avenues of knowledge to explore.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Happiness Code", "Date": "2016-01-14", "News": "FeatureA new approach to self-improvement is taking off in Silicon Valley: cold, hard rationality.Supported byThe goal of the \u2018\u2018CoZE\u2019\u2019 exercise, Smith explained, was to \u2018\u2018peek over the fence\u2019\u2019 to a new self; by doing something that makes you uncomfortable and then observing the result. There was an anticipatory hush, and then the room erupted. One person gave a toast. A product manager at Dropbox broke into song. In a corner, a programmer named Brent took off his shirt, revealing a milky chest and back, then sat with his head bowed. (He would later walk around wearing a handwritten sign that read, \u2018\u2018Please touch me.\u2019\u2019)The exercise went on for an hour, and afterward, participants giddily shared their stories. One person described going onto the patio and watching everyone else through the window, in order to experience a feeling of exclusion. Another submerged his hand in a pan of leftover chicken curry, to challenge his natural fastidiousness. Unexpectedly, he enjoyed the experience. \u2018\u2018It felt playful,\u2019\u2019 he said.Some of these problems are byproducts of our brain\u2019s reward system. We cash checks quickly but drag our feet paying credit-card bills, no matter the financial cost, because cashing a check generates a surge of dopamine but paying a bill makes us stressed. Other mistakes are glitchier. A person who owes back taxes might avoid talking to the I.R.S. because of a lingering monkey-brain belief that avoiding bad news keeps it from being true. While such logical errors may be easy to spot in others, the group says, they\u2019re often harder to see in ourselves. The workshop promised to give participants the tools to address these flaws, which, it hinted, are almost certainly worse than we realize. As the center\u2019s website warns, \u2018\u2018Careful thinking just isn\u2019t enough to understand our minds\u2019 hidden failures.\u2019\u2019Most self-help appeals to us because it promises real change without much real effort, a sort of fad diet for the psyche. (\u2018\u2018The Four-Hour Workweek,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up.\u2019\u2019) By the magical-thinking standards of the industry, then, CFAR\u2019s focus on science and on tiresome levels of practice can seem almost radical. It has also generated a rare level of interest among data-driven tech people and entrepreneurs who see personal development as just another optimization problem, if a uniquely central one. Yet, while CFAR\u2019s methods are unusual, its aspirational promise \u2014 that a better version of ourselves is within reach \u2014 is distinctly familiar. The center may emphasize the benefits that will come to those who master the techniques of rational thought, like improved motivation and a more organized inbox, but it also suggests that the real reward will be far greater, enabling users to be more intellectually dynamic and nimble. Or as Smith put it, \u2018\u2018We\u2019re trying to invent parkour for the mind.\u2019\u2019This is all the more surprising given that the workshops, which cost $3,900 per person, are run like a college-dorm cram session. Participants stay on-site for the entire time (typically four days and nights), often in bargain-basement conditions. In San Leandro, the organizers packed 48 people (36 participants, plus six staff members and six volunteers) into a single house, using twin mattresses scattered on the floor as extra beds. In the kitchen, I asked Matt O\u2019Brien, a 30-year-old product manager who develops brain-training software for Lumosity, whether he minded the close quarters. He looked briefly puzzled, then explained that he already lives with 20 housemates in a shared house in San Francisco. Looking around the chaotic kitchen, he shrugged and said, \u2018\u2018It\u2019s not really all that different.\u2019\u2019Those constraints produced a peculiar homogeneity. Nearly all the participants were in their early- to mid-20s, with quirky bios of the Bay Area variety. (\u2018\u2018Asher is a singing, freestyle rapping, former international Quidditch All-American turned software engineer.\u2019\u2019) Communication styles tended toward the formal. When I excused myself from one conversation, my interlocutor said, \u2018\u2018I will allow you to disengage,\u2019\u2019 then gave a courtly bow. The only older attendee, a man in his 50s who described himself as polyamorous and \u2018\u2018part Vulcan,\u2019\u2019 ghosted through the workshop, padding silently around the house in shorts and a polo shirt.If the demographics of the workshop were alarmingly narrow, there was no disputing the group\u2019s studiousness. Over the course of four days, I heard not a single scrap of chatter about anything unrelated to rationality. Nor, so far as I could discern, did anybody ever leave the house. Not for a quick trip to the Starbucks a mile down the road. Not for a walk in the sprawling park a half-mile away. One participant, Phoenix Eliot, had recently moved into a shared house where everyone was a \u2018\u2018practicing rationalist\u2019\u2019 and reported that the experience had been positive. \u2018\u2018We haven\u2019t really had any interpersonal problems,\u2019\u2019 Eliot told me. \u2018\u2018Whereas if this were a regular house, with people who just like each other, I think there would have been a lot more issues.\u2019\u2019When I first spoke to Galef, she told me that, while the group tends to attract analytical thinkers, a purely logical approach to problem-solving is not the goal. \u2018\u2018A lot of people think that rationality means acting like Spock and ignoring things like intuition and emotion,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018But we\u2019ve found that that approach doesn\u2019t actually work.\u2019\u2019 Instead, she said, the aim was to bring the emotional, instinctive parts of the brain (dubbed \u2018\u2018System One\u2019\u2019 by Kahneman) into harmony with the more intellectual, goal-setting parts of the brain (\u2018\u2018System Two\u2019\u2019).At the orientation, Galef emphasized this point. System One wasn\u2019t something to be overcome, she said, but a wise adviser, capable of sensing problems that our conscious minds hadn\u2019t yet registered. It also played a key role in motivation. \u2018\u2018The prefrontal cortex is like a monkey riding an elephant,\u2019\u2019 she told the group. \u2018\u2018System One is the elephant. And you\u2019re not going to steer an elephant by telling it where it should go.\u2019\u2019 The challenge, Galef said, was to recognize instances in which the two systems were at war, leading to a feeling of \u2018\u2018stuckness\u2019\u2019: \u2018\u2018Things like, \u2018I want to go to the gym more, but I don\u2019t go.\u2019 Or, \u2018I want my Ph.D., but I don\u2019t want to work on it.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 She sketched a picture of a duck facing one way and its legs and feet resolutely pointed in the opposite direction. She called these problems \u2018\u2018software bugs.\u2019\u2019Afterward, I chatted with O\u2019Brien and Mike Plotz, a circus juggler-turned-coder, about the program\u2019s appeal. When I asked Plotz why he thought the workshops attracted so many programmers, he glanced at O\u2019Brien. \u2018\u2018I think most of us are fairly analytical,\u2019\u2019 he began. \u2018\u2018We like to think about how complex systems work and how they can be optimized.\u2019\u2019 Because of this, Plotz added, he tends to notice patterns of behavior, in himself and in others. \u2018\u2018When you realize that people are complex systems \u2014 that we operate in complicated ways, but also sort of follow rules \u2014 you start to think about how you might tweak some of those variables.\u2019\u2019Deliberately or not, CFAR\u2019s application process also filters out many of the less committed. There is an extensive, in-person interview, conducted by an instructor. Afterward, participants are required to fill out an elaborate self-report, in which they\u2019re asked to assess their own personality traits and behaviors. (A friend or family member is given a similar questionnaire to confirm the accuracy of the applicant\u2019s self-assessment.) \u2018\u2018We get a fair number of people who say, \u2018I want to come to the workshop because everybody I work with is really irrational and I want to fix them,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Anna Salamon told me. \u2018\u2018Which is not what we are looking for.\u2019\u2019Despite this rigorous vetting, Salamon acknowledged that the center\u2019s aims are ultimately proselytic. CFAR began as a spinoff of MIRI, which Yudkowsky created in 2000, in part to study the impending threat posed by artificially intelligent machines, which, he argued, could eventually destroy humanity. (Yudkowsky\u2019s concern was that the machines could become sentient, hide this from their human operators and then decide to eliminate us.) Over the years, Yudkowsky found that people struggled to think clearly about A.I. risk and were often dismissive of it. In 2011, Salamon, who had been working at MIRI since 2008, volunteered to figure out how to overcome that problem.When I spoke with Salamon, she said that \u2018\u2018global catastrophic risks\u2019\u2019 like sentient A.I. were often difficult to assess. There wasn\u2019t much data from which to extrapolate; this not only made the threats harder to evaluate but also discouraged researchers from digging into the question. (Studies have shown that people are more likely to avoid thinking about problems that feel depressing or vague and are also more likely to engage in mental \u2018\u2018discounting\u2019\u2019 \u2014 assuming that the risk of something bad happening is lower than it actually is.) CFAR\u2019s original mandate was to give researchers the mental tools to overcome their unconscious assumptions. Or as Salamon put it, \u2018\u2018We were staring at the problem of staring at the problem.\u2019\u2019Like many in the community, Salamon believes that the skills of rational thought, as taught by CFAR, are important to humanity\u2019s long-term survival, in part because they can help us confront such seemingly remote catastrophic risks, as well as more familiar ones, like poverty and climate change. \u2018\u2018One thing that primates tend to do is to make up stories for why something we believe must be true,\u2019\u2019 Salamon told me. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s very rare that we genuinely evaluate the evidence for our beliefs.\u2019\u2019It was a point of view that nearly everyone at the workshop fervently shared. As one participant told me: \u2018\u2018Self-help is just the gateway. The real goal is: Save the world.\u2019\u2019As a lecturer, Smith had a messianic quality, gazing intensely at students and moving with taut deliberation, as though perpetually engaged in a tai-chi workout. Goal factoring, Smith explained, is essentially a structured thought exercise: a way to analyze an aspiration (\u2018\u2018I want to be promoted to manager\u2019\u2019) by identifying the subgoals that drive it. While some of these may be obvious, others (\u2018\u2018I want to impress my ex-girlfriend\u2019\u2019) might be more embarrassing or less conscious. The purpose of the exercise, Smith said, was to develop a process for seeing your own motivations honestly and for spotting when they might be leading you astray. \u2018\u2018These are blind spots,\u2019\u2019 Smith warned. \u2018\u2018Blind spots that can poison your ability to keep track of what\u2019s truly important to you.\u2019\u2019To begin the factoring process, Smith asked each of us to choose a goal, list all the things we believed would come from accomplishing it and then brainstorm ways to achieve each thing. If you wanted a promotion to make more money, was there another way to get a higher salary \u2014 say, by asking for a raise or changing jobs? Finally, Smith said, we should imagine having achieved each of those subgoals. Were we satisfied? If not, that indicated the presence of a hidden motive, one that we had either overlooked or didn\u2019t want to acknowledge.Though the exercise didn\u2019t strike me as especially penetrating \u2014 garden-variety introspection made punctilious \u2014 it was hugely popular. My group in the goal-factoring session included Ben Pace, a sweetly lumbering 18-year-old in a suit jacket and running shoes, who tended to balance his notepad on his knee like an old-timey newspaper reporter. Pace had flown over from Britain for the workshop, which he discovered at 15 by reading the LessWrong blog. He had applied to Oxford for the fall, and was hoping to attend. \u2018\u2018I was feeling very worried about it,\u2019\u2019 he confided, \u2018\u2018but then I goal-factored it and realized that I could get many of the same things I want from Oxford in other ways.\u2019\u2019While Pace said that he had come to the workshop to practice the techniques of rationality, others had more pressing worries. During one break, I chatted with Andrew, a software developer specializing in mobile platforms who asked to be identified only by his first name to protect his privacy. Andrew acknowledged that he tended to struggle in social situations and suffered from depression and anxiety. \u2018\u2018My brain has a lot of ridiculous social rules,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018I tend to be very closed off. And then there\u2019s a switch where I\u2019m almost completely open. It\u2019s this binary transition.\u2019\u2019Andrew said that he had initially been dubious of applied rationality, which he first heard about in a Reddit philosophy forum. Over time, though, he found that using the techniques made it easier to catch himself in the act of rationalizing a bad decision or avoiding an unpleasant task, like applying for a job. Initially, Andrew said, he assumed that he was simply afraid of rejection. But when he used aversion factoring \u2014 like goal factoring, but focused on what makes you avoid an unpleasant but important task \u2014 he made a surprising discovery. While visualizing how he would feel about applying for jobs if there were no chance of rejection, he realized that he still found the task aversive. In the end, he determined that his reluctance was rooted in a fear not of rejection but of making a bad career choice.It was a significant insight, the kind more typically won through hours of talk therapy. And indeed, some participants reported that the techniques had genuinely changed their lives, either by helping them with mental-health issues like attention deficit or obsessive-compulsive disorder or simply by allowing them to recognize unquestioned assumptions. For a few \u2014 especially a set of high achievers for whom success hadn\u2019t brought happiness \u2014 that process had been nearly tectonic. \u2018\u2018For most of my life, I believed \u2018If I do a good job, good things will happen,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 one person told me. \u2018\u2018Now I ask, \u2018If I do a good job, what does that mean?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019Others, though, seemed to see rationality less as a fundamental recalibration and more as a tool to be wielded. One participant, Michael Gao \u2014 who claimed that, before he turned 18, he made $10 million running a Bitcoin mine but then lost it all in the Mt. Gox collapse \u2014 seemed appalled when I suggested that the experience might have led him to value things besides accomplishment, like happiness and human connection. The problem, he clarified, was not that he had been too ambitious but that he hadn\u2019t been ambitious enough. \u2018\u2018I want to augment the race,\u2019\u2019 Gao told me earnestly, as we sat on the patio. \u2018\u2018I want humanity to achieve great things. I want us to conquer death.\u2019\u2019Given that I had already undergone a fair amount of talk therapy myself, I didn\u2019t expect the workshop to bring me much in the way of new insights. But then, at one point, Smith cited the example of a man with a potentially cancerous mole who refuses to go see the doctor. It was part, he said, of \u2018\u2018a broader class of mental errors\u2019\u2019 we\u2019re all prone to: the belief that avoiding bad news will keep it from becoming true. While this didn\u2019t strike me as particularly revelatory at the time, it turned out to be a stealthy insight. For an exercise the next day, I listed all the reasons I was avoiding talking with a financial planner, something I had intended to do for months. Many of them were pedestrian. Getting my financial records together would be tedious, and I was also mildly embarrassed by my income, which is on the low side. Working through the problem, though, I realized that the actual reason was humiliatingly simple: I was afraid of hearing that I needed to spend less and save more. Like mole man, I was afraid of what I might learn.But are such realizations alone enough to create change? Fears can be stubborn and not particularly easy to argue with. When I mentioned this to Smith, he shrugged. \u2018\u2018Hiding from the painful states of the world doesn\u2019t prevent them from happening,\u2019\u2019 he said. Then, like a strict parent telling a sniffling child to shape up, he added: \u2018\u2018The point isn\u2019t just \u2018How do I get myself to go to the doctor this time?\u2019 It\u2019s \u2018How do I make it so that I will never be susceptible to that type of thinking error again?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019Among other things, they found that people are typically both risk-averse and loss-averse: more likely to choose a guaranteed payout of $1,000 than to gamble on winning $1,400 when there\u2019s a 20 percent chance they could end up with nothing. They also discovered that people tend to underestimate the chance of a low-probability event occurring, thus inadvertently exposing themselves to terrible risks. (The 2011 tsunami, for example, caught the Japanese off guard and devastated parts of northeastern Japan.)In the past few decades, psychologists have identified dozens of cognitive biases, including \u2018\u2018gambler\u2019s fallacy\u2019\u2019 (believing that a coin toss is more likely to come up heads if the previous five flips were tails); \u2018\u2018anchoring\u2019\u2019 (the tendency to rely heavily on one piece of information \u2014 usually the first thing we learn \u2014 when making a decision); the \u2018\u2018Ikea effect\u2019\u2019 (disproportionately valuing things that you\u2019ve labored over); and \u2018\u2018unit bias\u2019\u2019 (assuming that a \u2018\u2018portion\u2019\u2019 is the right size, which accounts for our tendency to finish off an opened bag of cookies).What makes CFAR novel is its effort to use those same principles to fix personal problems: to break frustrating habits, recognize self-defeating cycles and relentlessly interrogate our own wishful inclinations and avoidant instincts. Galef described \u2018\u2018propagating urges\u2019\u2019 \u2014 a mental exercise designed to make long-term goals feel more viscerally rewarding \u2014 as an extension of operant conditioning, in which an experimenter who hopes to increase a certain behavior in an animal will reward incremental steps toward that behavior. Goal factoring and aversion factoring, she added, came out of behavioral economics, as well as research on a cognitive bias known as \u2018\u2018introspection illusion\u2019\u2019: thinking we understand our motives or fears when we actually don\u2019t. (That illusion is why the factoring process begins with listing every reason you\u2019re either avoiding something or pursuing a goal, and then uses a second round of thought experiments to ferret out hidden factors.)Figuring out how to translate behavioral-economics insights into a curriculum involved years of trial and error. Salamon recruited Galef, a former science journalist, in 2011, and later hired Smith, then a graduate student in math education at San Diego State. (Smith first met Yudkowsky at a conference dedicated to cryonics, in which a deceased person\u2019s body is stored in a supercooled vat, to be resuscitated in a more advanced future.) In early 2012, the group began offering free classes to test its approach and quickly learned that almost none of it worked. Participants complained that the lectures were abstract and confusing and that some points seemed obvious while others simply felt wrong. A session on Bayes\u2019s Theorem was especially unpopular, Salamon recalled, adding, \u2018\u2018People visibly suffered through it.\u2019\u2019The group also discovered a deeper problem: No one was very motivated to make his or her thinking more accurate. What people did want, Salamon recalled, was help with their personal problems. Some were constantly late to things. Others felt trapped by their own unproductive habits. Nearly everyone wanted help managing their email, eating better and improving their relationships. \u2018\u2018Relatively early on,\u2019\u2019 Salamon said, \u2018\u2018we realized that we had to disguise the epistemic rationality content as productivity advice or relationship advice.\u2019\u2019In the end, the group built a curriculum largely from existing research into human behavior, but the goal of Applied Rationality remained the same: to provide tools, not advice. \u2018\u2018Unlike a lot of self-help programs, we don\u2019t advocate particular things that people should do,\u2019\u2019 Galef told me. \u2018\u2018We just encourage them to look at the models that are driving their choices and try to examine those models rationally.\u2019\u2019 She shrugged. \u2018\u2018People are already making predictions, whether or not they\u2019re aware of it. They\u2019re already saying \u2018I\u2019ll be miserable if I leave this relationship\u2019 or \u2018I won\u2019t be able to make any difference in this big global problem because I\u2019m just one person.\u2019 So a lot of what we do is just trying to make people more aware of those predictions and to question whether they\u2019re actually accurate.\u2019\u2019The TAPs session was led by Salamon, a thin, muppety woman with a corona of brown hair. As a graduate student, Salamon studied the philosophy of science, and her lectures often seemed to take the wry view of humans as only marginally more evolved chimps. Involuntary TAPs already drive much of our behavior, she said \u2014 \u2018\u2018Like: See open bag of Cheetos. Put in hand\u2019\u2019 \u2014 but could also be made intentional and productive.My partner for the TAPs exercise, a soft-spoken engineer who works at Google, told me that he had tried TAPs before, but with limited success. \u2018\u2018For a while, I was trying to drink more water, so I set up a TAP to drink a glass of water the minute I got to work,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018It worked for a few weeks, but then I stopped. I started just wanting to get to work.\u2019\u2019 Now, he said, he was considering changing his TAP, to cue himself to drink water when he wanted a break. \u2018\u2018Maybe it\u2019ll help me stop reading Reddit,\u2019\u2019 he added.If TAPs felt slightly gimmicky, like rat-maze training for adults, other techniques seemed more profound. My favorite was propagating urges, the one that focused on motivating yourself to reach long-term goals. What makes things like weight loss or learning to play the violin difficult, Salamon said, is that they often conflict with System One-driven urges (wanting a nap, craving a cookie). And because long-term goals typically require sticking it out through a series of unpleasant intermediate steps (eating less, practicing the violin), it can be easy to lose the original motivation. \u2018\u2018Things we feel rewarded by, we do automatically,\u2019\u2019 Salamon added. \u2018\u2018When I want Thai food, I\u2019ll drive there, look at the menu, go inside, order. I don\u2019t have to convince myself to take those steps. But in other cases, the connection is lost.\u2019\u2019The solution, she said, is finding a way to make long-term goals feel more like short-term urges, especially because our brains are wired to associate actions and rewards that follow closely in time. (To discourage bad habits, conversely, you should stretch out the time between an action and its reward. \u2018\u2018If you want to stop reading stuff online instead of working, have the pages load more slowly,\u2019\u2019 Salamon advised.) Because of this powerful association, small but immediate negative experiences can have disproportionate impact: the aversive moment of getting into a cold swimming pool can overwhelm the delayed rewards of doing morning laps. To override that resistance, she said, you need to associate the activity with a powerful feeling of reward, one with a stronger neurochemical kick than the virtuous goals (\u2018\u2018being healthier\u2019\u2019) that we normally aspire to. The next step is to come up with a mental image that vividly captures that feeling and that you can summon in moments of weakness. \u2018\u2018It has to be a very sticky image,\u2019\u2019 Salamon said. \u2018\u2018If it isn\u2019t, you won\u2019t experience that gut-level surge of motivation.\u2019\u2019 She told a story about how Smith overcame his aversion to doing push-ups, which made him feel unpleasantly hot and sweaty, by tapping into his obsession with longevity: now he pictured the heat from the exercise as a fire that burned away cell-damaging free radicals.What made propagating urges so compelling, at least for me, was that it cut to the heart of a fundamental internal struggle: the clash between the shortsighted impulses that drive our daily behavior (checking email until it becomes \u2018\u2018too late\u2019\u2019 to go to the gym) and the long-term aspirations that might make us genuinely happier if we could only persuade the petulant toddler in our minds to get onboard.In a practice session, I paired up with Brian Raszap, a programmer at Amazon with a gentle smile and empathic manner. The aim of the exercise was to troubleshoot a long-term goal that we had each been struggling with and then create a new, sticky image to use as motivation. Raszap went first. He explained that he and some co-workers go to a Brazilian jujitsu class during lunch, usually once or twice a week. \u2018\u2018When I go, I love it,\u2019\u2019 Raszap told me. \u2018\u2018I feel so good. But half the time, I don\u2019t go.\u2019\u2019We talked through the problem for a while, then I asked Raszap to describe the feeling that he got from the class. He brightened. After working out, he told me, he is very relaxed, filled with a deeply pleasurable lassitude. When I asked if he could tap into that for motivation, Raszap nodded. \u2018\u2018Maybe that would work,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I usually think about wanting to get better at jujitsu. But maybe instead, I can think about feeling really good this afternoon.\u2019\u2019Many of CFAR\u2019s techniques resemble a kind of self-directed version of psychotherapy\u2019s holy trinity: learning to notice behaviors and assumptions that we\u2019re often barely conscious of; feeling around to understand the roots of those behaviors; and then using those insights to create change. But there was something unsettling about how CFAR focused on superficial fixes while overlooking potentially deeper issues. While talking with Raszap, I began by asking why, if he truly wanted to go, he often skipped the jujitsu class. Raszap listed practical obstacles: Sometimes he doesn\u2019t want the interruption; sometimes he just has a lot to do. But he also said that even the idea of attending the class more regularly makes him feel anxious. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s a feeling of not doing enough,\u2019\u2019 Raszap told me. Perversely, the workout only heightened his fear of failing, of missing the next class. This was coupled with a claustrophobic sense of obligation, what Raszap called \u2018\u2018a fear of foreverness\u2019\u2019 \u2014 \u2018\u2018Like, if I go today, I\u2019ll have to keep going forever.\u2019\u2019When I told Raszap that these last anxieties sounded like the sort of thing that might benefit more from psychotherapy than from behavior-modification techniques, he agreed. \u2018\u2018I do have a good therapist, and we do talk about this,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018But it\u2019s a different approach. Therapy is more about grand life narratives. Applied rationality is more practical, like, \u2018What if you went to jujitsu in the evening, rather than at lunch?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019Yet applied rationality doesn\u2019t typically acknowledge this gap. Proponents of rationality tend to talk about the brain as a kind of second-rate computer, jammed full of old legacy software but possible to reprogram if you can master the code. The reality, though, is almost certainly more complex. We often can\u2019t see our biggest blind spots clearly or recognize their influence without outside help.Several weeks after the workshop, I asked Salamon whether CFAR was intended to be a kind of D.I.Y. therapy, because that seemed to be how some participants were using it. She demurred, saying that the instructors have occasionally recommended counseling to participants who exhibit truly alarming behaviors and beliefs. But she considered therapy-grade problems to be relatively rare. \u2018\u2018Ninety percent of the time, when people aren\u2019t remembering to fill out their expense forms, there\u2019s nothing deep there,\u2019\u2019 Salamon said. Even when a participant does have a deep-seated issue, she added, the techniques can still be effective. \u2018\u2018You just have to give things a bit more space,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018And not expect that they\u2019ll yield to hacks.\u2019\u2019And while some exercises seemed useful, other parts of the workshop \u2014 the lack of privacy or downtime, the groupthink, the subtle insistence that behaving otherwise was both irrational and an affront to \u2018\u2018science\u2019\u2019 \u2014 felt creepy, even cultish. In the days before the workshop, I repeatedly asked whether I could sleep at home, because I lived just a 15-minute drive away. Galef was emphatic that I should not. \u2018\u2018People really get much more out of the workshop when they stay on-site,\u2019\u2019 she wrote. \u2018\u2018This is a strong trend ... and the size of the effect is quite marked.\u2019\u2019As it turns out, I wasn\u2019t the only one to find the workshop disorienting. One afternoon, I sat on the front steps with Richard Hua, a programmer at Microsoft who was also new to CFAR. Since the workshop began, Hua told me, he had sensed \u2018\u2018a lot of interesting manipulation going on.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018There\u2019s something about being in there that feels hypnotic to me,\u2019\u2019 he added. \u2018\u2018I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a social pressure, exactly, but you kind of feel obliged to think like the people around you.\u2019\u2019 Another woman, who recently left her software job in Portland, Ore., to volunteer with CFAR, said her commitment to rationality had already led to difficulties with her family and friends. (When she mentioned this, Smith proposed that she make new friends \u2014 ones from the rationalist community.)But there was also the fact that the vibe was just a little strange, what with the underlying interest in polyamory and cryonics, along with the widespread concern that the apocalypse, in the form of a civilization-destroying artificial intelligence, was imminent. When I asked why a group of rationalists would disproportionately share such views, people tended to cite the mind-expanding powers of rational thought. \u2018\u2018This community is much more open to actually evaluating weird ideas,\u2019\u2019 Andrew told me. \u2018\u2018They\u2019re willing to put in the effort to explore the question, rather than saying: \u2018Oh, this is outside my window. Bye.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 But the real reason, many acknowledged, was CFAR\u2019s connection to Yudkowsky. Compulsive and rather grandiose, Yudkowsky is known for proclaiming the imminence of the A.I. apocalypse (\u2018\u2018I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if tomorrow was the Final Dawn, the last sunrise before the earth and sun are reshaped into computing elements\u2019\u2019) and his own role as savior (\u2018\u2018I think my efforts could spell the difference between life and death for most of humanity\u2019\u2019).When I asked Galef and Smith whether they worried that the group\u2019s association with Yudkowsky might be off-putting, they seemed genuinely mystified. Galef said the group designed its own curriculum, without consulting Yudkowsky, and also worked hard to remain \u2018\u2018value neutral,\u2019\u2019 emphasizing the techniques of rational thought rather than focusing on MIRI. Smith was more direct. Yudkowsky, he said, is \u2018\u2018entangled in our origins.\u2019\u2019 Then he shrugged. Newton was a jerk, he pointed out, \u2018\u2018but that doesn\u2019t affect physics.\u2019\u2019To keep people on track, CFAR holds online practice sessions for 10 weeks after a workshop and also assigns \u2018\u2018accountability buddies\u2019\u2019 to encourage participation. The center is debating whether to develop an online version of its workshops that anyone can access. At the same time, it is also considering whether it would be \u2018\u2018higher impact\u2019\u2019 to focus on teaching rationality to a small group of influential people, like policy makers, scientists and tech titans. \u2018\u2018When I think about the things that have caused human society to advance, many of them seem to stem from new and better ways of thinking,\u2019\u2019 Galef added. \u2018\u2018And while the self-help function of the workshops is great, I wouldn\u2019t be devoting my life to this if that was all that I thought we were doing.\u2019\u2019I hadn\u2019t planned to practice the techniques myself, but in the weeks after the workshop ended, I found myself using them often. I began to notice when I was avoiding work \u2014 \u2018\u2018finishing\u2019\u2019 a section of the newspaper (unit bias!) or doing other unproductive foot-dragging \u2014 and then rationalizing the lost time as mental \u2018\u2018preparation.\u2019\u2019 I also found myself experimenting more and noting the results: working in a library rather than a coffee shop (more effective); signing up and paying for spin classes in advance (ditto); going to a museum on the weekend rather than doing something outdoors (so-so). Against all odds, the workshop had cracked open a mental window: Instead of merely muddling through, I began to consider how my habits might be changed. And while it was hard to tell whether this shift was because of the techniques themselves or simply because I had spent four days focusing intensely on those habits, the effect was the same. Instead of feeling stuck in familiar ruts, I felt productive, open and willing to try new things. I even felt a bit happier.When I emailed some of the other participants, most reported a similar experience. Mike Plotz, the juggler turned coder, told me that he had recently done \u2018\u2018a flurry of goal-factoring.\u2019\u2019 Among other things, he wanted to understand why he spent so much time checking Facebook every morning before work. Plotz said that he knew the Facebook habit wasn\u2019t helping him and that he often ended up running late and feeling harried. After goal-factoring the problem, Plotz said, he realized that what he really wanted was autonomy: the feeling of being able to choose what he did each morning. Now, he said, rather than passively resisting work through Facebook, he gets up an hour earlier and does whatever he wants. \u2018\u2018This morning I got up, made coffee and listened to \u2018Moby-Dick,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Plotz said when we spoke. \u2018\u2018So I\u2019d say that, so far, it\u2019s going well.\u2019\u2019I asked Plotz if he could tell whether the changes he made were due to the applied-rationality techniques or simply the product of a more active, problem-solving mind-set. \u2018\u2018In some ways, I think the techniques are that: a way to kick you into a more productive state of mind,\u2019\u2019 he told me. But he also noted that they supplied a framework, a strategy for working through the questions that such a mind-set might raise. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s one thing to notice your thoughts and behaviors,\u2019\u2019 Plotz said. \u2018\u2018Turning that into a technique that actually lets you accomplish stuff? That\u2019s hard.\u2019\u2019Jennifer Kahn is a contributing writer for the magazine.

{"Headline": "Intel\u2019s Earnings Fall in Fourth Quarter, but Beat Expectations", "Date": "2016-01-14", "News": "Supported byA lot has changed in recent years. The PC market has been in a long, slow decline, and Intel does not have the same clout with companies that build smartphones, which are today\u2019s hottest gadgets.But even if some of its financial clout has waned, Intel\u2019s spending continues to be a key indicator of the health of the tech world. Intel is still \u2014 by a good stretch \u2014 the world\u2019s biggest semiconductor maker and perhaps the only company of its kind with the resources to keep improving chip technology.If computer chips do not continue to improve, the entire tech industry stalls. Semiconductors have leapt from computers and mobile phones to all sorts of devices, including cars, appliances and toys. They are increasingly connected to the fast-growing computer \u201cclouds\u201d of companies like Amazon and Google, which are powered by vast data centers of computer servers that mostly use Intel chips.Intel\u2019s financial results are a sort of proxy for growth in cloud-based services, said Thomas Kurian, the president of product development at Oracle, one of the world\u2019s largest software companies. \u201cIf they ship a lot, it means a huge growth in new cloud projects,\u201d he said.In quarterly earnings reported by Intel on Thursday, the company\u2019s revenue was up slightly from the same period last year, but money from data center chips was up markedly.Intel reported that its net income in the fourth quarter of 2015 fell 1 percent to $3.6 billion, or 74 cents a share, from the year-earlier quarter. The company said revenue climbed 1 percent, to $14.9 billion.The net income was above the expectations of Wall Street analysts. They had anticipated 63 cents a share on revenue of $14.8 billion, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters.For all of 2015, Intel revenue was $55.4 billion, down 1 percent from 2014. Net income was $11.4 billion, down 2 percent.Intel\u2019s share price was down about 4 percent in after-hours trading Thursday evening.No doubt, Intel\u2019s influence has changed in recent years.Intel still gets 59 percent of its revenue from chip sales to PC makers like HP Inc. and Dell, just as Microsoft and other makers of PC software count on the demand for new PCs to sell their products. Now PCs are a tough business: On Tuesday, the market research firm IDC said 276 million PCs were shipped worldwide in 2015, a drop of 10.4 percent from 2014.\u201cPCs don\u2019t matter as much as they used to,\u201d said Jay Chou, an analyst with IDC. \u201cThey\u2019re only part of the story that includes mobile devices and cloud computing.\u201dOn Thursday, Intel said data center chip sales, not just to clouds but to older kinds of computing, rose 4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015. Along with Intel\u2019s much smaller businesses in memory and sensor chips for devices, data center chips accounted for than 60 percent of the company\u2019s operating profit margin.Since the PC industry is sliding, using Intel as an indicator of the health of the rest of tech is not as easy as it used to be. Analysts say the number to watch now is Intel\u2019s investment in Moore\u2019s Law. Named for an Intel co-founder, Gordon Moore, that is the observation that computing power, figured in the density of transistors on a chip, tends to double every 18 to 24 months. That effectively means that $2 of computing power today will cost $1 in 2018.Keeping up with Moore\u2019s Law is increasingly expensive. In 2001 research and development, along with marketing and sales, cost Intel about $8 billion. In 2015, Intel said Thursday, it cost $20.1 billion.As a percentage of revenue, the number has crept up too, and on both counts it is at a cost few companies could manage. Besides Intel, which develops new chips ahead of everyone, the last big semiconductor makers are GlobalFoundries, Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Each has to invest billions to stay in the game.\u201cIntel can decide if Moore\u2019s Law is 18 or 24 or 36 months long,\u201d said Amit Daryanani, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets.Last year, Intel scared many technologists when it announced that a critical next step in delivering on Moore\u2019s Law would happen about a year later than expected. The company has since released numerous charts showing this was a temporary blip.If it was more than a blip, developers of those self-driving cars, connected drones and other new devices will also struggle to make improvements.Relax, said Stacy Smith, the chief financial officer of Intel.\u201cMoore\u2019s Law is the heartbeat of our company,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the core of our competitive advantage.\u201dIndeed, Intel\u2019s corporate identity is wrapped up in this concept of ever-improving chips.\u201cThey can\u2019t risk not being seen as the leading engineering company,\u201d Mr. Daryanani said. \u201cThe beauty of this thing is that this way, they are in control of their own destiny, and not a lot of tech companies can say that.\u201dAnd if that costs billions, so be it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook to Shut Down Parse, Its Platform for Mobile Developers", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Most of what Parse does involves things most people will never see. Parse helps developers with support and tools, so that independent programmers can spend more time writing code and less time on keeping up the back end. Developers who use Parse include those at Quip, a productivity app, and Expedia\u2019s Orbitz, a travel website. Facebook would make money from Parse by storing data from developers and sending customers product notifications.Achieving that goal, however, would be no easy feat. Microsoft, Google and Amazon have similar developer offerings, along with a much richer set of other computing tools and services that developers need. Amazon Web Services, in particular, has in the past two years stressed both its developer tools and analytic services, so companies can think about what to build next. In every case, these companies can also benefit by selling other computing services, like complex commercial databases, which Facebook does not provide.Parse seemed like a good opportunity for expansion. At the time, Internet businesses were in the midst of a major industry change, as users were shifting away from desktop computing and increasingly relying on mobile devices. Parse, the thinking went, could provide Facebook the opportunity to be the foundation of a whole new generation of developers building mobile apps in the age of the smartphone.Facebook also would have had to invest untold millions of dollars in capital and, more importantly, engineering talent, to get the Parse business fully off the ground to have a better chance at making a dent in competitors like Amazon, Microsoft and Google.Moreover, Facebook has already made two big, risky bets in Oculus, the virtual reality platform, and WhatsApp, the messaging service. Neither service currently generates material revenue for Facebook.Parse may have touched millions of people through the apps that developers built there, but that mattered little against Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s size. With more than 1.5 billion registered users, a population of even 15 million customers is not 1 percent of Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s audience. Building up Parse, it seems, eventually became more of a distraction than it was worth.\u201cMoving forward we want to dedicate more resources to high-impact products and services in areas like analytics, monetization, discovery, and authentication,\u201d Michael Kirkland, a Facebook spokesman, said in a statement. \u201cAs a result, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made the difficult decision to wind down support for Parse.\u201dOther Silicon Valley companies have encountered similar difficulties. Inside Cisco Systems, in its heyday, there was pressure to build businesses that yielded $1 billion or more in revenue, since anything less could not affect the overall company. Facebook, which unlike other clouds has not sought to rent computing and software to businesses, must essentially find this from social networking.Developers who used Parse will have a set of tools and a year-long window to be able to migrate their data off of the platform to other services.\u201cWe\u2019re proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished together with the Parse community, and we thank them for their support,\u201d Mr. Kirkland said.FollowAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Looking Beyond the Internet of Things", "Date": "2016-01-01", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 If you have sent email on Google or used Microsoft\u2019s browser or databases, you have touched the technology handiwork of Adam Bosworth.Mr. Bosworth, a tall and grizzled but still trim 60-year-old, is a Johnny Appleseed of sorts in the tech industry, with a penchant for being intimately involved in the creation of generations of widely used technology.While it is never easy to predict what the next big thing will be, identifying what Mr. Bosworth is working on is always good for clues. Right now, along with competitors at companies like Amazon and Google, he is building what some call a \u201cdata singularity.\u201dAll those devices and sensors would also wirelessly connect to far-off data centers, where millions of computer servers manage and learn from all that information.Those servers would then send back commands to help whatever the sensors are connected to operate more effectively: A home automatically turns up the heat ahead of cold weather moving in, or streetlights behave differently when traffic gets bad. Or imagine an insurance company instantly resolving who has to pay for what an instant after a fender-bender because it has been automatically fed information about the accident.Think of it as one, enormous process in which machines gather information, learn and change based on what they learn. All in seconds.It is lofty language, no doubt, but he and others believe they are on the brink of one of the next big shifts in computing, perhaps as big as the web browser or the personal computer.But building an automated system that can react to all that data like a thoughtful person is fiendishly hard \u2014 and that may be Mr. Bosworth\u2019s last great challenge to solve.It is difficult to say just how big this business could be, but there are two good indicators: Analysts at Gartner estimate that by 2019 retail cloud computing \u2014 the data center side of the equation Mr. Bosworth is working on \u2014 will double in size, to $314 billion. The sensors on objects will be a $2.6 trillion business, an increase of 250 percent, Gartner estimates.Mr. Bosworth went to Harvard with Bill Gates, where he took just one class in computers while studying Asian history. He nonetheless landed a job on Wall Street, where he persuaded his bosses to give him $1 million for minicomputers \u2014 the cutting edge of computing before personal computers \u2014 that could deliver the first instant reports on how business was doing.He got interested in tech\u2019s next big thing, PCs, and wrote an early spreadsheet program. He joined Microsoft in 1989. His first years there were spent on databases, but as the Internet got big he helped turn browsers from software that looks up web pages to software that interacts with the web.He and Mr. Gates repeatedly argued over the importance of the Internet, according to people there at the time. Mr. Gates may also have goaded Mr. Bosworth, knowing he is the sort who does not like to be told something is not possible.\u201cHe sees out into the future, but not too far that you can\u2019t build something,\u201d said Brad Silverberg, a Seattle venture capitalist who has known Mr. Bosworth since 1981 and was his boss at Microsoft. \u201cIf you want to make sure something gets done, tell him not to do it.\u201dThe son of a demanding private school headmaster, Mr. Bosworth also clashed with Larry Page, Google\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, while working there on interactive software and a failed effort to build online health services.\u201cWe had styles that weren\u2019t synergistic,\u201d said Mr. Bosworth. \u201cHe looks intensively at massive amounts of data-gathering, and assumes he\u2019ll be able to do something with it using math. I was focused on getting people to communicate with other people.\u201dMarc Benioff, the chief executive at Salesforce and a friend of Mr. Bosworth, asked him to look at the technology being used at the San Francisco company, which was founded in 1999 and was one of the first to use cloud computing technology.Over lunch a few months later, Mr. Bosworth told Mr. Benioff that his once-revolutionary company was in peril.\u201cComputers are 50 times faster than when Salesforce started,\u201d he said. \u201cI told Marc, \u2018There is a whole new technology that is going to overtake you, the way the web overtook Microsoft.\u2019\u201dThat technology \u2014 the data singularity \u2014 is what Mr. Bosworth is now working on at Salesforce.If he is right, this new era in computing will have effects far beyond a little more efficiency. Consumers could see a vast increase in the number of services, ads and product upgrades that are sold alongside most goods. And products that respond to their owner\u2019s tastes \u2014 something already seen in smartphone upgrades, connected cars from BMW or Tesla, or entertainment devices like the Amazon Echo \u2014 could change product design.Analysts foresee a scramble to own and manage these systems and their data, and ever more power accruing to just a few companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft, which already have the global computing systems and reach to make it happen.Few outfits have the engineering talent to manage this sort of thing. One year after starting the business, for example, Microsoft\u2019s cloud handles a trillion sensor messages a week.Salesforce, which is worth $54 billion, is an underdog compared to that tiny group of tech behemoths. It lacks global data centers, but does control important data, like information about what customers are buying.Who will ultimately control that data, from the sensors to the cloud and back, is one of the most contentious questions in tech.\u201cYou\u2019ve got Amazon knowing everything about purchasing, Google knowing everything about what people do on the Internet, and Salesforce knowing everything about the revenue side of a business,\u201d said Scott Raney, a venture capitalist at Redpoint Ventures who invests in companies related to what Mr. Bosworth is working on.\u201cLay computer processing on all that, and it\u2019s powerful to a point where a little creepiness sets in; no one else will have the data,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m buying the stock of all the companies. I just hope they\u2019ll be benevolent dictators.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Microsoft Faces New Scrutiny in China", "Date": "2016-01-05", "News": "Supported byThe announcement, related to electronic data that the government collected in an antitrust inquiry, shows how a sustained effort by Microsoft to cozy up to China\u2019s leadership has done little to relieve the regulatory challenges that it faces in the country. At best, the company is getting mixed messages.Multinational companies have for years gone out of their way to curry favor with leaders in China, one of the world\u2019s largest technology and consumer markets, which are overseen by rival regulatory agencies eager to score wins against high-profile foreign companies. For Microsoft, its setbacks in the country are particularly galling because high rates of software piracy have sharply limited its sales there, even though products like Windows and Office are widely used.The Microsoft investigation raised eyebrows among some longtime Western critics who say China uses its regulatory agencies and court system to penalize foreign companies and give homegrown alternatives a hand.\u201cThis is about business \u2014 that\u2019s all it is,\u201d said Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonprofit research group in Washington. \u201cAll this other stuff about hosting and being nice doesn\u2019t fundamentally change the Chinese calculation. This is the strategy they have, and they\u2019re going forward pretty relentlessly.\u201dThe new scrutiny of Microsoft by the regulator, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce \u2014 known as SAIC \u2014 stems from antitrust investigations of major Western tech companies in 2014.With many Chinese companies and government offices running versions of old Microsoft software like XP, the move highlighted the country\u2019s reliance on the American company. Even though the bulk of Chinese users of Microsoft software acquired pirated versions without paying Microsoft, the company was nonetheless criticized for ending support in favor of its newer software.A Microsoft spokesman, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity as a matter of policy, said on Tuesday that the company was \u201cserious about complying with China\u2019s laws and committed to addressing SAIC\u2019s questions and concerns.\u201dMr. Atkinson of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation predicted Chinese regulators could use a case against Microsoft to force concessions, such as requiring the company to continue to provide support to Windows XP PCs.Longer term, he says Chinese leaders would like to see local alternatives to Windows to lead in the market; some popular local alternatives exist in other sectors of technology, like Internet search. One top PC maker, Dell, has begun shipping more machines in China that come with a Chinese-made operating system, NeoKylin, installed on them.It has been difficult to dethrone Windows from PCs in China, though, since so many of the world\u2019s most popular software, from games to business applications, run on it.\u201cI think the strategy is essentially what I term de-U.S.A.,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated part of Xi Jinping\u2019s itinerary when he visited the United States last year.

{"Headline": "Starboard Value Calls for Shake-Up at Yahoo and Shift in Strategy", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byA prominent hedge fund that has long criticized Yahoo\u2019s management, Starboard Value, on Wednesday called for changes to the web pioneer\u2019s board and management to go along with a shift in the company\u2019s strategy. Otherwise, the investment firm wrote, it may try to run its own slate of directors.The challenge by Starboard, which has successfully ousted corporate boards in the past, adds yet more pressure on Yahoo as it explores ways to spin off its mainstay Internet businesses. The hedge fund has instead called on the company to sell that division outright.\u201cIf the board is unwilling to accept the need for significant change, then an election contest may very well be needed so that shareholders can replace a majority of the board with directors who will represent their best interests and approach the situation with an open mind and a fresh perspective,\u201d Jeffrey C. Smith, Starboard\u2019s managing member and chief executive, said in the letter.In a statement, a representative for Yahoo said that the company was \u201cin the midst of a multiyear transformation\u201d and that it would provide more information on its plans by the time it announces fourth-quarter earnings.Yahoo is once again trying to address its shareholders\u2019 complaints. Last month, Yahoo abandoned a plan to spin off its stake in the Alibaba Group, the Chinese e-commerce giant, into a separate company after the Internal Revenue Service declined to bless the move as tax-free.That could have left the company on the hook for a tax bill of more than $10 billion.Yet some activist investors \u2014 those who seek to change a company\u2019s strategic direction \u2014 have called for various alternatives.As Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Ms. Mayer acquired more than 20 companies, but ultimately struggled to turn around the web pioneer.The biggest by far is Starboard, which toppled the board of Darden Restaurants, the parent of the Olive Garden restaurant chain, and pushed Staples and Office Depot to merge.Starboard has argued that Yahoo\u2019s financial performance has continued to slide, which the activist shareholder has attributed to poor management.\u201cWe explained over and over again that we did not believe your actions, or lack thereof, would achieve the desired result of stabilizing the business,\u201d Mr. Smith wrote. \u201cUnfortunately, it appears we have been right, and each quarter is worse than the last.\u201dThe hedge fund\u2019s threat comes at the beginning of proxy season for corporate America, when shareholder activists can formally begin challenges for board control. According to Yahoo\u2019s shareholder materials, investors can nominate their own director candidates from Feb. 25 to March 26.Yahoo has faced challenges to its board before. Nearly four years ago, the hedge fund magnate Daniel S. Loeb fought for three director seats in a bitter public brawl \u2014 and engineered the ouster of Scott Thompson, the company\u2019s chief executive at the time, by highlighting apparent r\u00e9sum\u00e9-padding by Mr. Thompson.Mr. Loeb eventually won three seats in a settlement with Yahoo, and later helped bring in Ms. Mayer as chief executive.And in 2008, the veteran financier Carl C. Icahn took a run at the company\u2019s board, dismayed by its reluctance to sell itself to Microsoft. He eventually secured three seats in a compromise with Yahoo.It is unclear how Starboard, which reported owning less than 0.8 percent of Yahoo\u2019s shares as of Sept. 30, would fare. But the hedge fund is counting on widespread investor dissatisfaction with the failure of Ms. Mayer and the company\u2019s board to turn around Yahoo\u2019s fortunes.Still, the reaction of investors on Wednesday was muted, with shares of Yahoo closing slightly down, at $32.16.Advertisement"}

Alexa excelled at music, and Cortana was mediocre across the board. Facebook was left out of the grading system because the company denied access to M, though I did hang out with her for two hours on a friend\u2019s account. More on that later.Apple said that Siri had \u201cbecome faster and smarter\u201d and spoke more languages than other assistants. Microsoft said it was \u201cjust scratching the surface\u201d on how Cortana could help people. Google said that it wanted smartphones to do more of the heavy lifting, and that users could do a host of things just by speaking to Google. Amazon did not respond to requests for comment.On the productivity front, Siri, summoned by pressing the home button on the iPhone or by saying, \u201cHey, Siri,\u201d was best able to schedule a meeting with a friend in Hawaii, check what was on my calendar for tomorrow, send an email and read my most recent email aloud. Others could complete only some of those tasks \u2014 Google could not read my last email out loud, and Alexa could not compose an email or create a calendar event.Siri also fared well in music-related tasks, but was bested by Alexa. Both assistants could play the song \u201cHey\u201d by the Pixies, put on the latest episode of the \u201cRadiolab\u201d podcast and play music in the instrumentals genre. But Alexa, summoned simply by saying \u201cAlexa,\u201d could play a specific music station on Pandora, whereas Siri could only open the Pandora app.Google, which builds its voice-controlled assistant into the Google mobile app, achieved the highest marks for completing travel and commuting-related tasks. It responded perfectly to the question \u201cWhat is the traffic like to 221 Main Street?\u201d by showing me how long it would take to drive there.When I said, \u201cTake me to the Dogpatch Boulders gym,\u201d it showed me a map and gave voice directions. When I said, \u201cFind me plane tickets to New York next week,\u201d it offered an impressive response: Flights from San Francisco to New York next week start at $435, and the shortest flight is five hours and 10 minutes long.On travel and commuting, Cortana could offer solutions for the questions about traffic and directions, but not the one about flights. Siri earned a C-minus in the category: She could not give traffic estimates, and in response to the question about flights to New York, she spat out an unhelpful list of web search results related to traveling to New York. And instead of taking me to a bouldering gym to hone my physique, she took me to a brewery.Alexa got a D \u2014 she could offer traffic estimates for only one fixed location that was set up inside the app, like your office, and she added the task of finding a flight to New York to my to-do list. (I gave Alexa a pass on failing to map me to the gym. It seemed too much to ask from a home audio speaker.)For food-related tasks, Google and Apple were even. Each of the assistants was able to find a list of nearby Indian restaurants. Only Google\u2019s voice assistant could order delivery food, but with an unintuitive process that required naming a specific restaurant that delivers food through one of the apps that Google has teamed up with. Siri was the only one capable of booking a restaurant table.In my limited time with M, I asked her to handle some of the most mundane tasks: Call the water company to ask about my utility bill, find out what meats are on sale at the local Whole Foods store and research when would be the cheapest time for my editor to fly to Hong Kong (not that I was trying to get rid of my editor).M pondered for a few minutes before answering each question, which made me suspect that a person handled most of the tasks. So I asked M to schedule a photo shoot with a studio owned by a friend of mine. Within minutes, the photo studio\u2019s phone rang, and my friend picked up.\u201cHi, I\u2019m calling on behalf of my boss,\u201d said M, who sounded like a young woman. \u201cHe wanted to find out if you guys have the ability for a photo shoot at 2 p.m. tomorrow.\u201dM left a contact phone number with a 650 area code, which includes Menlo Park, Calif., where Facebook has its headquarters.\u201cI didn\u2019t catch your name,\u201d my friend at the photo studio said.\u201cFirst name is M,\u201d the not-so-virtual assistant replied. \u201cLast name is Messenger.\u201d\u201cIs that Greek?\u201d my friend at the photo studio asked. M laughed nervously.In other words, M probably is more capable than all the virtual assistants, but largely because humans are on the other end of the puppet strings handling tasks that artificial intelligence cannot. That makes me doubt that many consumers will get to meet M, at least in its current state, in which it is free.\u201cM is still in its very, very early stages,\u201d Facebook said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re not yet focused on scaling M to a large number of people.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Instead, A.E.G. Live was given clearance to hold a festival in July on Randalls Island; its rivals, Madison Square Garden and Founders Entertainment, did not receive similar permission to hold their events.On Jan. 11, the day the Randalls concert was announced, Mr. Ickes and his lobbying partner, Janice Enright, contributed $400 to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign account, the limit for a registered lobbyist. Mr. Ickes\u2019s wife, and the wife of his other partner, Kevin McCabe, each gave $4,950, the maximum allowed by law, financial records show.In all, Mr. Ickes, a longtime contributor to Mr. de Blasio, acted as the intermediary for $19,250 in donations in the four days leading up to the announcement that A.E.G. could bring its festival to Randalls Island.Finding the right site for a high-profile music festival can be critical to its success, and Mr. Ickes was not the only lobbyist involved in the concert fight who collected money for the mayor\u2019s campaign. In the fall, Suri Kasirer, a lobbyist for Madison Square Garden, delivered about $56,000 in contributions, and James Capalino, who represents Founders, delivered $29,690.City officials said on Tuesday that the administration assessed each application fairly and without favor. \u201cThe parks department makes decisions on all event permits based on a standard criteria that includes impact on the park and its users,\u201d Karen Hinton, the mayor\u2019s press secretary, said in a statement.There is no limit on how much a lobbyist can bundle for a New York City candidate, and spouses of lobbyists are not restricted in how much they can give, under city campaign finance regulations.The three promoters submitted applications in the fall for a Corona Park event. Community opposition increased, and A.E.G. Live submitted a separate application for a Randalls Island on Jan. 4. Ultimately, parks officials decided not to approve an event in Queens, fearing disruptions to the park.Parks officials say that Randalls Island, already the site of several large music festivals, is an option for any promoter. People briefed on the negotiations, who spoke on the condition of on anonymity to describe private details, said A.E.G.\u2019s rivals were not aware that a Randalls Island date was in play.Tom Russell, a partner of Founders Entertainment whose Governors Ball festival will be on Randalls Island in June, said the city typically \u201chas had a fair and open permitting system for events.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re concerned by the lack of transparency during this recent decision-making process and hope the city would continue to support locally grown businesses,\u201d Mr. Russell added.Madison Square Garden declined to comment; the company did not submit a separate application for Randalls Island.Mr. Ickes, who did not return requests for comment, has a lobbying firm based in Washington, and opened a New York branch after Mr. de Blasio was elected in 2013.A.E.G. Live, which is owned by the Republican donor Philip F. Anschutz, hired Mr. Ickes in 2014; his firm lobbied several city officials and agencies on the company\u2019s behalf, disclosure records show. Since Mr. de Blasio\u2019s election, Mr. Ickes has secured major clients like JPMorgan Chase and Microsoft.Told of the timing of Mr. Ickes\u2019s contributions, Susan Lerner, executive director of Common Cause New York, said she was concerned.\u201cIt smacks of prioritizing the interests of the powerful donors over the public interest,\u201d Ms. Lerner said. \u201cIt seems to be in direct contrast to what the mayor advocates for.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon. Grail, which is majority-owned by Illumina, has also assembled a prominent roster of advisers.\u201cIf this pans out, this could be a real game changer,\u201d said Dr. Jos\u00e9 Baselga, the physician in chief at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, who will head the company\u2019s science advisory board.But some experts said that developing such a test would be a daunting task. Even Dr. Baselga seemed skeptical that a pan-cancer screening test could be ready by 2019, the goal of Illumina\u2019s chief executive, Jay T. Flatley. Screening for particular types of cancer may be easier, Dr. Baselga said.The approach to be used takes advantage of the fact that DNA from cancerous cells can be found in the blood, albeit in minute amounts. The blood test, using intensive DNA sequencing, would look for patterns of telltale mutations.But so far, liquid biopsies are mainly used for patients already known to have cancer. The tests help determine the particular mutations in the tumor to help select the best drugs to use. Or they are used to monitor whether treatment is effective or to check for a recurrence.Detecting early-stage cancer, although an eventual goal of many liquid biopsy companies, is considered more difficult. Many cells, not just cancerous ones, shed DNA into the bloodstream, and many noncancerous cells have mutations that are also found in tumors.\u201cAs you age, you have mutations,\u201d said Dr. Luis A. Diaz Jr., associate professor of oncology at Johns Hopkins and co-founder of three companies developing liquid biopsies. Polyps, moles and benign growths also have mutations that resemble those in tumors, he said.Moreover, Dr. Diaz said, current liquid biopsy technology is often not sensitive enough to pick up multiple mutations at once.\u201cPatients ought to be hesitant until there is really good data that this actually helps people, and they should remember that it could harm people,\u201d said Dr. H. Gilbert Welch, professor of medicine at Dartmouth and author of the book \u201cLess Medicine, More Health.\u201dOne company, Pathway Genomics, last year began offering a liquid biopsy test aimed at detecting early-stage cancer. The Food and Drug Administration almost immediately challenged the company, saying the test needed regulatory approval. The agency, in a letter to the company in September, also said that it had not found \u201cany published evidence that this test or any similar test has been clinically validated as a screening tool for the early detection of cancer.\u201dMr. Flatley said that Grail would overcome those problems by doing intensive DNA sequencing on 30,000 to 50,000 people over time, some of whom would have, or would develop, cancer, to figure out the mutation signatures indicating cancer.The screening test for each patient would also use the \u201cdeep,\u201d or intensive, sequencing, to check for numerous mutations. Mr. Flatley said a screening test would have to cost no more than $1,000 to be economically feasible.Sequencing a whole human genome now costs about $1,000 for big users of Illumina\u2019s sequencing machines. But costs are dropping and Grail, which does not have a chief executive yet, will get a special discount from Illumina.\u201cNone of our customers can afford to do this today \u2014 only Illumina can,\u201d Mr. Flatley said in an interview. \u201cWe have a sense of urgency to make it work.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Good Governance Stock Index Lacks Expert Judgment", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Supported byAnother ViewLast week in Davos, Switzerland, a group of giant pension funds unveiled a new stock index, the Standard & Poor\u2019s Long-Term Value Creation Global Index.In the image of the World Economic Forum whence it came, the index aspires to collect the best-run global companies, by evaluating their governance, financial quality and sustainability initiatives. Most Standard & Poor\u2019s indexes are defined by mere region and asset class. What is the purpose of a stock index composed of supposed global elites?\u201cWe are trying to use the index to change corporate behavior,\u201d said Mark Wiseman of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, a member of the group that established the index.So how will the Standard & Poor\u2019s Long-Term Value Creation Global Index work? Its marketing materials point out that despite the qualitative nature of the criteria \u2014 long-term strategy, innovation, sustainability \u2014 do not worry, \u201cexpert judgment is limited.\u201d Instead of experts using their brains, the \u201cindex\u201d will rely on a messy stew of checklists and quantitative models. The \u201cquality score,\u201d for instance, seeks to tell us how good a business is based on a formula with three inputs: return on equity, financial leverage and a rudimentary balance sheet metric. This is, of course, madness.Here we have an opaque, quantitative investment strategy masquerading as an S.&P. index based on qualitative factors. And what are the largest holdings of this \u201cindex\u201d of long-term value creators? What are the elite companies that Mr. Wiseman hopes will be the envy of their peers? Perhaps visionaries like Google, Amazon or Berkshire Hathaway? Nope. The top 10 holdings include two cigarette makers, McDonald\u2019s, and, why not, McGraw Hill Financial, which happens to own Standard & Poor\u2019s.What\u2019s especially frustrating about this ill-advised plan is that the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and its cohorts should know better. Public pension plans have learned a lot of tough lessons about the cost of bad public company governance. For much of the 1970s and 1980s, passive institutional investors struggled with their responsibilities as large public company shareholders. After they were exploited for years by both corporate raiders and entrenched management teams, General Motors\u2019 1986 buyout of Ross Perot\u2019s stake in the automaker drove them over the edge. The head of the State of Wisconsin Investment Board proclaimed, \u201cIf shareholders continue to be passive, they will continue to be shorn like sheep.\u201dBy the end of the 1980s, many large institutional investors were doing their homework. They ran proxy fights, submitted scores of shareholder resolutions and formed opinions on sophisticated corporate governance issues. This paved the way for the kind of shareholder activism that dominates markets today. The current explosion in hedge fund shareholder activism, which has pressured corporations like Microsoft, Apple, DuPont and General Electric, has been fed by the (often tacit) support of large institutional investors behind the scenes.And now, rather than directly challenging offenders as a shareholder activist might, the pension funds want to ride the growing wave of indexation to create an exclusive collection of best-in-class companies. They hope to lure retail investors into this \u201cindex,\u201d which they believe can provide excellent investment returns while encouraging corporate management teams to focus on long-term value creation. The problem is, you can\u2019t identify great, long-term oriented companies with quantitative models and checklists.The proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services provides a cautionary tale about relying on checklists to evaluate corporate boards. Robert A.G. Monks and Nell Minow, two renowned scholars of corporate governance, founded I.S.S. in 1985 with the best intentions. Mr. Monks and Ms. Minow used their own expert judgment to advise public company shareholders on how to vote their proxies. Since they sold the business in 1992, it has changed hands several times and grown rapidly. Regulations that require investment firms to have robust proxy voting policies have had the peculiar effect of pushing more of them to outsource the responsibility to I.S.S.As the proxy adviser\u2019s growth forced it to resort to standardized, checklist-style evaluations, some of its recommendations became shockingly imprudent. In 2004, I.S.S. advised Coca-Cola shareholders to withhold votes from Warren E. Buffett because of conflicts of interest related to his ownership of Dairy Queen. Apparently, there was no question on I.S.S.\u2019s checklist that asked, \u201cIs the candidate the greatest capital allocator to ever live?\u201dMr. Wiseman, the Canadian pension board and their pension fund partners should know that wise, long-term corporate governance requires the kind of sound business judgment you cannot evaluate by employing a hundred-page checklist. Markets will only reward companies that govern themselves for the long term when large institutional owners use their expert judgment to vote bad boards out of office.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Sets Its Sights on Virtual Reality", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Supported byApple recently acquired an augmented reality start-up called Flyby Media and hired Doug Bowman, who ran the Center for Human-Computer Interaction at Virginia Tech and who has researched topics such as immersion in virtual environments.Virtual and augmented reality are growing fields in the technology industry. Supporters like Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, have said virtual reality is the next big platform after mobile. The technology, which can make users feel transported by immersing them in different environments, has the potential to transform games, movies, social networks and work. Almost $4 billion has been invested in virtual reality start-ups since 2010, according to PitchBook, a research firm.Developing virtual and augmented reality technology is about creating \u201cthe next operating system,\u201d said Linc Gasking, co-founder and chief executive of 8i, a company that creates virtual reality software. \u201cApple currently owns the computer in your pocket, and it needs to be part of the next big user interface if it wants to retain that ownership.\u201dApple has not, until recently, been publicly enthusiastic about virtual reality. While it has made tiny acquisitions in the field, it has not made a deal as large as Facebook\u2019s Oculus purchase and has not brought any hardware to market.Apple has filed dozens of virtual reality-related patents in the past, including one in 2008 for a head-mounted display apparatus. The patent illustration shows a large pair of glasses that can hold an iPhone, and it looks much like Google\u2019s Cardboard.Matt Miesnieks, who is setting up an augmented reality-focused venture capital fund, said Apple had also been meeting with \u201cadvanced optics\u201d start-ups, referring to the lens that a viewer looks through.

{"Headline": "On Display at CES, Tech Ideas in Their Awkward Adolescence", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtBut if news from CES feels especially desultory this year, it might not be the show that\u2019s at fault. Instead, blame the tech cycle. We\u2019re at a weird moment in the industry: The best new stuff is not all that cool, and the coolest stuff isn\u2019t quite ready.It\u2019s not that today\u2019s tech is terrible \u2014 lots of potentially groundbreaking ideas are just around the corner. In product labs across the world, engineers and designers are working to turn a collection of annoying buzzwords \u2014 artificial intelligence, virtual reality, wearables, the \u201cInternet of things,\u201d autonomous cars and drones \u2014 into products that we find irresistible. They are all pushing the limits of what machines can currently accomplish, and working to come up with business models that customers will stomach. In time, after years of experimentation and incremental advances, many of these technologies might become mainstays.But that future will take a few years to pan out. In the meantime, you can expect to be bombarded with early versions of tomorrow\u2019s tech that are bound to feel janky and incomplete. Welcome to Prototype World, a brief intermission in your regularly scheduled program of disruption, during which everything new will more or less stink.\u201cIt\u2019s like the junior high years in technology,\u201d said Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies. \u201cWe\u2019re in those awkward teenage years where everything looks and feels funky.\u201dOver the next couple of CESes, there\u2019s a good chance we will see a lot of devices that will feel not quite ready. Virtual reality will underwhelm, artificial intelligence will feel annoyingly unintelligent, and cars and drones that navigate themselves will seem safer when parked. There will be wearables you won\u2019t want to wear and home devices that will make you want to buy a new place.\u201cIt will eventually cross that hump and become mature, but it\u2019s not there right now,\u201d Mr. Bajarin said.It\u2019s unsurprising that early versions of new tech will be a bit flawed. But what\u2019s unusual about the current moment is how many new, interdependent technologies are coming about at the same time. We\u2019re in the middle of a grand cycle in technology \u2014 the revolution pushed by smartphones, social networks and ubiquitous online servers (that is, the cloud everyone talks about). Over the last decade, these three technologies have altered wide swaths of the business world, destroying and creating hundreds of billions of dollars in wealth in sectors as varied as media and transportation.Venture capitalists are eager to see these trends continue. Fred Wilson, a co-founder of Union Square Ventures, told me he was paying close attention to opportunities for mobile devices and social networks to alter health care, finance and education.Hunter Walk, of the firm Homebrew, echoed this idea. \u201cIt may be true that there\u2019s not a consumer-tech phenomenon that breaks through this year, but the cascading wave of tech goodness from mobile isn\u2019t close to being done when we look at this other part of your life called work,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I\u2019m not bored.\u201dI take his point; we in the press are often quick to become bored and demand the next great thing. And yet, what can I say? I am kind of bored. Even if smartphones and social networks have lots of room to grow before conquering the world, they feel like old, mature tech. This is an industry that moves on anticipation of the next great thing. Artificial intelligence, virtual reality, autonomous vehicles and wearable computers are the building blocks of tomorrow\u2019s great tech cycle. The trouble is, the cycle is just getting started.But how will Apple get there from here? Improving the watch will require lots of fundamental advances over a period of years \u2014 smaller, faster processors and radios; better batteries; better artificial intelligence and voice recognition, among other things. Can Apple provide all that? Probably, and if it doesn\u2019t, some other smartwatch maker will most likely do it. But it won\u2019t happen this year. It might not even happen next year. You\u2019ll just have to wait.Similar advances will also be required to perfect self-driving cars and self-flying drones. Advances in A.I. will also power a set of intelligent assistants far smarter than Siri, some that don\u2019t make you tear your hair out.All this could be grand: A few years from now, if you believe the boosters in Vegas this week, many of us will be shuttling around in self-driving cars, regularly plugging into reality-defying virtual worlds, and adorning ourselves with smart jewelry that will seamlessly integrate our bodies with the Internet. Our homes will be connected, our drones will be autonomous and our phones will sizzle with artificial intelligence.That\u2019s a good vision to keep in mind as you struggle, over the next few years, to get anything to work as it should.Email: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjoo Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kymeta Raises $62 Million in Investment Led by Bill Gates", "Date": "2016-01-11", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Kymeta is a start-up focusing on using tiny satellite antennas. But the company has secured a new fund-raising round from some big backers, including Bill Gates.The roughly four-year-old Kymeta announced on Monday that it had raised $62 million in a new investment round, led by Mr. Gates, the venture capital firms Lux Capital and Osage University Partners, the Kresge Foundation and what the start-up described as new strategic partners.Tiny antennas \u2014 using lightweight \u201cmetamaterials\u201d to produce small, flat devices instead of traditional antennas \u2014 may seem like a smaller start-up idea than, say, shaking up the cab or hotel industries.But Kymeta, which is based in Redmond, Wash., says that its product will greatly expand connectivity throughout the world, because its antennas tap into the huge swaths of available satellite bandwidth, rather than the more limited cellular spectrum used by smartphones.The company was borne of research into metamaterials by Nathan Kundtz, who is now the start-up\u2019s chief executive, at Duke University. It first found a home in Intellectual Ventures, the patent holding company co-founded by Nathan Myhrvold, the former chief technology officer of Microsoft.Kymeta then spun out of Intellectual Ventures in 2012, taking in money from investors like Mr. Gates, Liberty Global and Lux.Since its last fund-raising round in 2014, Kymeta has struck partnerships with companies like Intelsat, Sharp and Panasonic that are aimed at both improving the manufacturing of the start-up\u2019s tiny antennas and using them in applications like on ship terminals.\u201cWe continue to be impressed with Kymeta\u2019s achievements, growth and momentum,\u201d Josh Wolfe, a co-founder and managing partner of Lux, said in a statement. \u201cWith new partnerships, rollout of its smart antenna, technology and customer milestones ahead and growing industry buzz, Kymeta is inventing and delivering a future I can\u2019t wait to live in.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Need to Fret, Apple Is Doing Fine", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtLet\u2019s get this out of the way first: Despite what you may have heard, the iPhone is not dying. Neither, by extension, is Apple.But if Apple is now hitting a plateau, it\u2019s important to remember that it\u2019s one of the loftiest plateaus in the history of business. The $18.4 billion profit that Apple reported on Tuesday is the most ever earned by any company in a single quarter.So this column will try to do something tricky: explore what\u2019s ailing Apple without going off the deep end. Here\u2019s my ice-cold take: Apple is doing quite O.K.Could it be doing some things better? Sure. Are any of its problems urgent? Not particularly, and from what one can tell, it\u2019s working to address many of its shortcomings. Does it face existential threats? Yes, but no more than any other tech giant. Will it remain an outsize presence in the tech industry for years to come, generating profits on a scale that no other corporation can match? Almost certainly.I\u2019ll get to those long-run worries in a bit, but let\u2019s start with the present. At the moment, Apple\u2019s biggest problem is its own success. The iPhone turns nine this year. The iPad turns six. These devices have made Apple the world\u2019s most valuable company (until Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, overtakes it, which might happen soon).Yet the very dominance of Apple\u2019s aging mobile empire inspires doubts about its future. The bigger the iPhone gets, the harder Apple has to work to beat its previous milestones, and the more vulnerable it appears to some fatal technological surprise.But there\u2019s something worth keeping in mind about each of these criticisms. They\u2019re the gripes of a technophile, and they don\u2019t necessarily reflect mainstream consumer perceptions about Apple\u2019s products.But if continued growth sounds like wishful thinking, there\u2019s another path for Apple to prosper even if iPhone sales do hit a wall: Suck more money out of each phone. In a note to clients last fall, analysts at Goldman Sachs suggested that through a widening number of subscription services baked into the iPhone, Apple could begin to reap a huge monthly fee from its users, which it said constituted \u201cthe most lucrative installed base in the world.\u201dIt\u2019s an argument Apple executives are starting to vocalize loudly. On Tuesday\u2019s earnings call, Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said the popularity of the iPhone provided the company a \u201clong-lasting foundation.\u201dApple\u2019s ecosystem is so sticky that people tend to flock to its services even if there are better products out there. Even if I\u2019m not a fan, 10 million people have subscribed to Apple Music in its first six months.Given all these options for minting bullion from the iPhone, the most alarming worries for Apple aren\u2019t about the present. They are about the future beyond the horizon, and they are necessarily speculative.The basic question is this: In the future, will physical devices matter less than they do now? If computers are more like the machines in the movie \u201cHer\u201d \u2014 ethereal, ambient computers that exist in the cloud, that respond to our voices and our bodies, anticipating our desires \u2014 what will happen to Apple then? This is a company whose entire existence hinges on the cultural appreciation of physical things. Can it prosper in an age of ambient computing?These are interesting questions to pose. I had a long conversation with Mr. Thompson about these ideas, and Apple\u2019s apparent weaknesses \u2014 how it\u2019s not as good at artificial intelligence and voice recognition as Google, how it lacks the cloud infrastructure that Amazon has built, and how, most important, its entire corporate culture is geared toward making actual stuff, which could limit its capacity to create fantastic online services.But ultimately the discussion felt academic. It seems obvious that as the tech world changes around it, Apple, over the next decade, will need to reinvent itself. But so will everyone else. That is just what you do in this industry.An earlier version of a credit for an illustration with this article misspelled the illustrator\u2019s surname.

He also became a consultant for Microsoft and collaborated on a movie that was accepted by the Sundance Film Festival \u2014 even though he gradually lost the ability to talk and became paralyzed except for his eyes.Mr. Gleason has A.L.S., a motor-neuron disease that afflicts an estimated 20,000 Americans. Patients lose muscle control, which eventually causes difficulty in swallowing and breathing. There is no cure, or even an effective treatment; the average life expectancy is two to five years after the diagnosis.\u201cThe disease takes away your entire physical body and almost always leaves your mind and eyes intact,\u201d Mr. Gleason wrote in an email. \u201cWhen diagnosed with A.L.S., most people are expected to fade quietly away and die.\u201d He decided to forge a different path.As is common among people with A.L.S., the diagnosis took about a year; that is because there is no test for the disease. The only way to determine that someone has A.L.S. is to test for and rule out a range of other diseases.\u201cAfter I was diagnosed, I did some research and found those who were living, and living with purpose despite their diagnosis, were doing so through the use of technology,\u201d Mr. Gleason writes.According to the ALS Association, 75 percent of those with the disease require assistance in order to communicate. New devices, many of them making use of eye-tracking technology, have allowed patients to describe their symptoms to doctors, caregivers and family members, ensuring that they receive better medical care, and have also enabled them to resume some of their hobbies and stay in contact with people via social media, lessening the physical and social isolation of the disease.Mr. Gleason had always been tech-savvy, and when he realized he would soon lose the use of his fingers, he tested out the assistive technologies available for A.L.S. patients at the time. He found that they weren\u2019t fast or powerful enough, and many tablets were not compatible with eye-tracking technology, he says. In 2014 he was tapped to appear in Microsoft\u2019s first Super Bowl commercial. Afterward, he asked the company to make its Surface Pro 2 tablet, which was featured in the advertisement but wasn\u2019t enhanced for people with A.L.S., more useful for people with disabilities.To his surprise, Microsoft said yes. The company flew him to a Microsoft hackathon in Seattle, where he challenged its corps of technologists to come up with a chair that he could drive with his eyes. Twenty-four hours later, they produced a prototype. Microsoft then hired Mr. Gleason as a consultant as it proceeded to fine-tune the chair and also improve the tablet\u2019s compatibility with eye-gaze technology.As for Mr. Gleason, \u201cIt\u2019s revolutionized my life,\u201d he writes. \u201cIt has set me free.\u201dAdvertisement"}
