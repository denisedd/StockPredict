{"Headline": "New York Hotels Make a Green Pledge", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported byUpdateSeventeen notable New York City hotels have committed to getting greener.This initial group of properties \u2014 accounting for more than 11,000 guest rooms \u2014 has pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions from their buildings by 30 percent or more in the next 10 years, a move that could reduce emissions by more than 32,000 metric tons and save $25 million of energy operating costs. Buildings account for around 75 percent of greenhouse emissions in New York City, and getting the hospitality industry on board will significantly help to cut down on the city\u2019s overall emissions, said Nilda Mesa, the director of the Mayor\u2019s Office of Sustainability.\u201cHotels are definitely a cause of emissions, and their involvement can have a big impact in achieving the goals of the NYC Carbon Challenge and the mayor\u2019s overall sustainability goals,\u201d she said. That broader vision, set forth by Mr. de Blasio in September 2014, is to reduce citywide greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent by 2050.Though 17 is a small number relative to the hotel association\u2019s members, its chairman, Vijay Dandapani, says that his group will continue to encourage more hotels to join the program.\u201cFor the hotels who need it, we can connect them with environmental consultants and give them our best practices handout on going green,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope that our help and the visibility of the hotels that have agreed so far gives others the push they need to sign up for the Challenge.\u201dIn the interim, many of the properties that have committed to the project are already on their way to meeting its goals, and the changes they are making, for the most part, involve minor construction and are unlikely to affect their guests.But the biggest undertaking is the $2.3 million expenditure on a new building management system that controls air-conditioning and heat. \u201cIt will operate on demand-based ventilation that doesn\u2019t burn excess energy,\u201d said Ron McGill, the hotel\u2019s director of engineering. All told, he said, the three changes will reduce Grand Hyatt\u2019s carbon emissions by 2,400 metric tons annually.Similar to the Grand Hyatt, other NYC Carbon Challenge hotels may have to financially invest in energy conserving upgrades, but their leadership realizes that they will save money in the long run.Like the Waldorf, tackling the issue of greenhouse gas emissions was already a priority for several of the properties before becoming a part of the NYC Carbon Challenge, but now they\u2019re intensifying their efforts.But while these moves from 1 Hotel Central Park and other NYC Carbon Challenge properties will most certainly be a factor in helping to meet the project\u2019s goals, they are not necessarily visible to hotel guests, who usually have the option of participating in their property\u2019s eco-conscious efforts with actions such as reusing their bath towels.No matter, said Adam Weissenberg, the head of the travel, hospitality and leisure sector at Deloitte & Touche, because travelers, especially millennials, want the hotels they stay at to be helping the environment even if that help isn\u2019t tangible. \u201cThese changes may not be in their faces, but the guests who care will educate themselves about how their hotels are trying to be greener,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Carmakers Forge Ahead With Electric Vehicles ", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byLAS VEGAS \u2014 Although sales of electric and hybrid vehicles have struggled, automakers are charging ahead to bring new battery-powered vehicles to market.G.M.\u2019s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said the Bolt was a big step forward in the electrification of vehicles because of its price and ability to travel 200 miles on a fully charged battery.\u201cThis is truly the first EV that cracks the code because of long range at an affordable price,\u201d Ms. Barra said in a keynote speech at the show.The Bolt, which will go on sale this year, will carry a sticker price of $30,000, including government incentives that total about $7,500.But even with its extended range and mass-market price, the Bolt may still face a difficult battle to lure consumers who are taking advantage of $2-a-gallon gasoline to buy larger vehicles.While sales of pickups and sport utility vehicles soared in 2015, all-electric models and gas-electric hybrids languished in showrooms.For example, sales in the United States of the all-electric Nissan Leaf fell 43 percent in 2015 compared with 2014, and the leading hybrid model, the Toyota Prius, dropped about 11 percent.Over all, electric and hybrid vehicles accounted for about 2 percent of the American market. Still, luxury automakers like BMW introduced a new electric car last year, and Tesla is expanding its lineup to include an all-electric S.U.V., the Model X.G.M. has had mixed success with its Volt plug-in hybrid, which marries battery power with a small gasoline engine that significantly extends its driving range.But Ms. Barra said on Wednesday that G.M. is \u201ccommitted to electrification\u201d despite the lagging sales of current electric cars and hybrids. Others at G.M. said the new Bolt could change consumers\u2019 perception of purely electric cars as strictly for commuting and other short trips.\u201cAll of our research shows the buyer consideration goes up dramatically with a range of over 150 miles,\u201d said Pam Fletcher, G.M.\u2019s chief engineer for electric vehicles.But industry analysts are unsure whether electric cars will catch on with consumers anytime soon.\u201cIt will be interesting to see how the market embraces the Bolt in this era of cheap gas,\u201d said Karl Brauer, an analyst with the auto research firm Kelley Blue Book. \u201cBut from a value and function standpoint, it sets a new benchmark.\u201dThe Bolt is a roomy, four-door compact car that seats five people and includes features like a rear camera that streams a wide-angle view directly to the rearview mirror used by the driver.Ms. Barra said that it also has fast-charging capability and can achieve an 80 percent charge within an hour. She added that the Bolt could prove ideal for ride-sharing in urban areas.This week, G.M. invested $500 million in the ride-sharing service Lyft as part of its strategy to adapt to different trends in automotive transportation.\u201cThe way people get around is changing forever, and we get that,\u201d said Ms. Barra, who emphasized that G.M. expected to be a leader in new forms of personal mobility.Other automakers are also showcasing electric models at International CES, including Volkswagen, which on Tuesday unveiled a concept version of an electric microbus.On Wednesday, VW\u2019s luxury brand, Audi, provided more details on a previously shown electric S.U.V. called the e-Tron.The battery-powered e-Tron is expected to go into production by 2018, and is a cornerstone of Audi\u2019s plans to move aggressively into electric cars and plug-in hybrids.\u201cWe expect that at least 25 percent of our business in America will have a plug within 10 years,\u201d said Scott Keogh, president of Audi of America.The e-Tron is also becoming something of a laboratory for Audi as it ramps up its development of connected vehicles and autonomous cars.\u201cElectrification, connectivity and autonomous driving are the trends,\u201d said Ricky Hudi, a senior executive at Audi in Germany.Audi has already developed prototypes of driverless cars, but the technology required was so large it took up nearly the entire trunk space.But Mr. Hudi said the technology was advancing so rapidly that Audi\u2019s current prototypes use much smaller, high-speed processors.\u201cThe brain of piloted driving has become smaller than a tablet computer,\u201d he said.The larger questions hovering over the industry are whether consumers are truly interested in purely electric vehicles, or cars that drive themselves.A new study by the research firm JD Power to be released on Thursday found that consumers ranked some automation features high on their wish list in a new vehicle. The features that are most popular include blind-spot warning for drivers, adaptive cruise control and collision avoidance systems, the firm said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Conservative Case for Solar Subsidies", "Date": "2016-01-05", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorTO many skeptics, particularly on the right, the spectacular failure of the solar-panel manufacturer Solyndra in 2011, after receiving a $535 million loan guarantee from the Department of Energy, demonstrated the industry\u2019s shaky future and the danger of government efforts to subsidize it to success.Fast forward to today. Solar energy prices have continued to fall rapidly, twice as many Americans work in the solar industry as in coal mining, and last year one-third of new electricity generation came from solar power.Solar, long viewed through the lens of crony capitalism, has shown the ability to inject real market competition in energy distribution, one of the last monopolies in the energy sector, while improving the efficiency of the grid and putting more dollars in the pockets of middle-class Americans. Conservatives, in other words, need to take another look at solar.The case for solar isn\u2019t limited to prices and jobs. Consumers want choice. Unfortunately, in most markets around the country, electricity is still one of the few areas where we have virtually no choice over our supplier. Imagine you want to buy a G.M. car, but you were told you can buy only a Toyota. You\u2019d be outraged \u2014 yet this is how almost all Americans are forced to procure their electricity.Again, to borrow an automotive analogy, you wouldn\u2019t buy a new car just for those few days you had extra errands. Instead, you\u2019d call an Uber or rent a Zipcar. That\u2019s the same role rooftop solar panels can play for our energy challenges \u2014 instead of building another huge plant for a few peak hours, we can build just as much solar capacity as we need.Critics of solar have often said that it produces only \u201cwhen the sun is shining,\u201d and that is true. Fortunately, we need energy most during the daytime \u2014 making rooftop solar a smart choice for consumers while adding energy to the grid when we need it most.And while challenges of storage and metering policies remain, both technology and regulatory models have made significant strides. States like California are considering metering policies that incentivize solar consumers to reduce their demand at peak hours and enable them to sell energy back into the grid when the grid needs it most. Technologies like Google\u2019s Nest \u201csmart\u201d thermostat and Tesla\u2019s home battery are making it easier for consumers to monitor their energy consumption and better store renewable energy when the sun isn\u2019t shining.Of course, conservatives will respond that their core objection remains: Solar functions only because of government subsidies. But there are a couple of issues to consider.For one thing, not all subsidies are created equal, and the government actually has a good track record in promoting new energy technologies. New developments often face two market gaps that can potentially delay or even kill them: the \u201ctechnological valley of death,\u201d in which promising advances hit a technical brick wall, and the \u201ccommercialization valley of death,\u201d in which an effective technology can\u2019t get to market. Government research labs and subsidies have supported a number of forms of energy \u2014 from nuclear energy, to hydraulic fracturing, to photovoltaic solar \u2014 through these troughs.Furthermore, the solar investment tax credit is pretty smart. It\u2019s structured so that as solar power becomes more efficient, the effect of the credit on each watt produced becomes smaller. Ideally, we would let markets decide the winners on their own, but so long as government is intervening in markets, it should do so in an evenhanded way. Similarly, any government support for the solar industry should be impartial, rather than having government bureaucracy pick and choose favored companies as it does through its loan guarantee program. The solar investment tax credit comes close to that ideal.And there\u2019s nothing in free-market economic theory that precludes government support. Markets tend to underproduce what economists call positive externalities \u2014 that is, the broad social benefits, like a cleaner environment, that aren\u2019t captured on a company\u2019s balance sheet.Solar panels, and the companies that make them, are replete with such benefits: They eliminate redundant power plants that otherwise lie idle, empower consumer choice and have fewer negative consequences than most other forms of energy. But markets don\u2019t always reflect these, which is why it makes sense for subsidies to enter the picture.The kerfuffle over the Solyndra collapse aside, many conservatives already agree, and have for years. When I was at the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush, we believed that an across-the-board energy policy was by far the best approach \u2014 and that included solar. From both a market and an environmental point of view, supporting the solar industry should make sense, no matter which side of the aisle you come from.Ben Ho is an economics professor at Vassar and Columbia.\u00a0He served as the lead energy economist for the White House Council of Economic Advisers from 2006 to 2007.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Video Review: Chevy Volt Impresses With Tech, Design and Driving Pleasure", "Date": "2016-01-21", "News": "Supported byDrivenTHE concept of the first Chevrolet Volt was simple \u2014 drive 40 miles or so on battery power alone and then continue the journey with a gas-powered generator. In short, driving to Duluth could be a drop-of-the-hat decision. From Anchorage.Numbers are dry, but the new Volt\u2019s are notable. Starting at $33,995 (before a $7,500 federal tax credit) it easily costs $1,000 less than its predecessor and drops some 350 pounds. The government-rated battery range of 53 miles is 25 percent more efficient, rated at 106 miles per gallon equivalent. It\u2019s more fuel-efficient too, rated at 42 m.p.g. on standard grade gas.The bulk of this article could be stuffed with details of the all-new Voltec system, from a larger, lighter four-cylinder to dual electric motors using far less rare earth material and a smaller, more powerful lithium-ion battery spanning the car\u2019s spine. But the most impressive attribute of the new Volt is this: It looks and operates like a normal car.Luddites could simply plug it in at night (my grandmother did that in northern Minnesota with her Ford LTD during the winter) and, other than its eerie silence, they may never care (or know) that it\u2019s a plug-in hybrid. No funky transmission joystick, no fear of being marooned. Chevy even got rid of the cabin\u2019s Tomorrowland touch panel for honest-to-goodness buttons and knobs.With 149 horsepower and 294 pound-feet of torque, the Volt feels fast, reaching 30 miles an hour in about 2.5 seconds. Velocity is less urgent afterward, with 60 m.p.h. arriving in 8.5 seconds, half a second faster than the first-generation Volt. It\u2019s hardly a Tesla Model S in Ludicrous mode.Volt comfortably snakes through turns with measurable road feel. The low-mounted battery improves the center of gravity, though its substantial mass is felt in hard cornering. Coasting and braking send voltage back to the pack. Gifted from the Cadillac ELR, a paddle on the back of the steering wheel activates aggressive power regeneration. When the car is driven thoughtfully, the brake pedal is seldom used.Spent batteries charge in 13 hours on 110-volt current or in four and a half hours on 220 volts. Temperatures in the 30s during my week with the Volt reduced the performance of the pack to 45 miles in city slogging, 40 at freeway speeds. My guess on gas-only fuel economy is 40 miles a gallon.Chevy\u2019s attractive dual cockpit interior is made of hard but quality plastics. The Premier model, tested at $40,225 (again, before tax credits), offers lane keep assist, low-speed automatic braking and a heated steering wheel \u2014 features found only on luxury cars five years ago. Volt helps with the chores, too, being a practical hatchback.Tempering the most-excellent Volt experience is a sparsely trimmed back seat that remains snug. Cheap gasoline doesn\u2019t quite lure shoppers into the showrooms. But when the Volt becomes available nationwide this spring, take a test drive. It is fun to drive and also offers a painless way to (mostly) reduce fossil fuel use.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "General Motors, Gazing at Future, Invests $500 Million in Lyft", "Date": "2016-01-04", "News": "Supported byG.M.\u2019s support includes more than financial backing. As part of the investment, G.M. and Lyft will work on developing an on-demand network of self-driving cars, an area of research that companies like Google, Tesla and Uber have all devoted enormous resources to in recent years.G.M. will also work with Lyft to set up a series of short-term car rental hubs across the United States, places where people who do not own cars can pick up a vehicle and drive for Lyft to earn money. Daniel Ammann, president of G.M., will join the board of Lyft, which is based in San Francisco.\u201cWe strongly believe that autonomous vehicle go-to-market strategy is through a network, not through individual car ownership,\u201d John Zimmer, president of Lyft, said in an interview.G.M.\u2019s $500 million interest in Lyft is the single largest direct investment by an auto manufacturer into a ride-hailing company in the United States, according to data from PitchBook, an alliance that pairs an auto stalwart with the kind of start-up trying to disrupt it. The investment reflects how much consumer automotive habits have been changed by technology over the last decade. With the rise of ride-sharing companies, car manufacturers have raced to adapt to how people can now use each other\u2019s vehicles for rides, which could potentially lead to a decline in car ownership.In an interview, Mr. Ammann said G.M. wanted to be part of the changing business models in transportation. \u201cWe think there\u2019s going to be more change in the world of mobility in the next five years than there has been in the last 50,\u201d he said.Mr. Ammann added that the core profit from G.M.\u2019s business comes from cars sold outside the urban environments where Lyft primarily operates, especially sales of sport utility vehicles in suburban areas.\u201cFrom a G.M. perspective, we view this as much more of an opportunity than a threat,\u201d he said.G.M.\u2019s investment is also a vote of confidence in Lyft, which faces a competitive ride-hailing field. Founded in 2012, Lyft helped promote the ride-sharing craze in the United States, positioning itself as a superior alternative to owning a car or using public transportation. Lyft users can summon a private or shared car with a few taps of an app.Lyft and G.M. did not give a specific timeline for when they expected their autonomous vehicle network to become publicly available, nor did the companies offer details on how the network is expected to function.A mix of Lyft\u2019s existing investors, including the Asian e-commerce giants Rakuten and Alibaba, also contributed to the most recent financing round, as did the Chinese ride-hailing start-up Didi Kuaidi.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of countries in which Uber operates.

All of the 2016 candidates do, too; Donald J. Trump has taken to the medium like an agitated middle schooler.Other business executives with legal problems, including Lynn G. Tilton, a private equity executive, and Charlie Shrem, who led a money transfer service, have also been pretty loose lipped.To be fair, Mr. Shkreli, for one, has not been his usual brash \u2014 maybe even bratty \u2014 self online. Before the arrest, based on his tweets and live videos, he almost seemed to be playing the role of a movie bad guy. Now he\u2019s posting on Twitter less often, and with a restrained (for him) air.But he is still talking. I called him and asked about his current approach on social media, and he responded: \u201cI\u2019m not going to say something that jeopardizes my case.\u201d He said prosecutors had a lot of sway over public opinion through events like so-called perp walks. \u201cThis sort of becomes a chess match now of public opinion \u2014 which is sad, because ultimately it should be about the facts,\u201d he said. Mr. Shkreli added: \u201cI feel like I\u2019m being prosecuted for being a jerk.\u201dThis has not happened yet, thank goodness. But give me time.The thing is, though, that as close as I regularly skate toward disaster online, I\u2019m not a chief executive, and I\u2019m not facing criminal or civil charges. What these brilliant captains of industry are doing takes boldness into a realm that even I, a great fan of boldness, find questionable.I checked in with Gerald L. Shargel, a prominent criminal defense lawyer, for insight into this phenomenon, and I\u2019m pretty sure I could hear him shaking his head over the phone. Mr. Shargel, who has represented John J. Gotti, the Mafia don, among others, said that the problem came down to brains and self-confidence.\u201cIt starts with the proposition that there are people who are very smart outside the four walls of the courtroom,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they think they are smarter than the lawyers they have engaged.\u201dThese are high-powered people, he said, who didn\u2019t get to their positions by being conventional. Is it possible, I asked, that their rule-breaking, gut-trusting ways might be part of what got them plunked down in front of a judge in the first place?He paused for a moment, and replied, \u201cWell said.\u201dThe public pronouncements get the clients the attention that they seem to crave, he said, \u201cand sometimes, it\u2019s funny \u2014 until the verdict.\u201dTo get further insight into the minds of these geniuses, I called Rory J. O\u2019Connor, who provides media training and crisis consulting to executives through his San Francisco company, Morcopy Communications. He pronounced himself mystified by the likes of Mr. Shkreli. \u201cWhat\u2019s the first line of the Miranda warning? \u2018You have the right to remain silent.\u2019\u201dMr. O\u2019Connor said that when police officers say, \u201cAnything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law,\u201d they really mean it. \u201cWhy would you want to go on social media, where they don\u2019t even need a subpoena, and say things that could be used against you?\u201dIt\u2019s great for clients\u2019 lawyers and friends to say how wonderful they are, but as for the executives facing legal trouble themselves, he says, \u201cYou want to keep your mouth shut.\u201dThere is nothing novel about this advice, he said: \u201cI\u2019ve never been in a situation where a lawyer or P.R. counsel says, \u2018Hey, get out there and open your yap.\u2019\u201dWhat does this mean for the future? I wonder whether the quiet period before an initial public offering of stock \u2014 a blessedly silent interlude when executives are prohibited from speaking out and influencing public opinion \u2014 is doomed.More generally, many corporate espionage strategies, and sophisticated market research programs, could become utterly pointless. Just check a C.E.O.\u2019s Pinterest and Instagram accounts. Maybe Tinder, too. It\u2019s all out there, baby!Vanity might finally lead to true corporate transparency.

Well, how do they sound online? I can only imagine what the real Steve Jobs would have done with a Twitter account by now. Or how Henry Ford would have fared if he had committed anti-Semitic gaffes in a social media world.Yes, strip away the layer of handlers and let us see what these giants are really like and what we think of their judgment and boldness then. We will make decisions accordingly.Of course, if Twitter leads C.E.O.s to actually start losing money \u2014 well, that\u2019s when they will finally put a sock in it.

Corporate leaders tend to spend a good deal of time talking at investor conferences or introducing new products on auditorium stages. Mr. Page, who is 42, has not been on an earnings call since 2013, and the best way to find him at Google I/O \u2014 an annual gathering where the company unveils new products \u2014 is to ignore the main stage and follow the scrum of fans and autograph seekers who mob him in the moments he steps outside closed doors.But just because he has faded from public view does not mean he is a recluse. He is a regular at robotics conferences and intellectual gatherings like TED. Scientists say he is a good bet to attend Google\u2019s various academic gatherings, like Solve for X and Sci Foo Camp, where he can be found having casual conversations about technology or giving advice to entrepreneurs.Mr. Page is hardly the first Silicon Valley chief with a case of intellectual wanderlust, but unlike most of his peers, he has invested far beyond his company\u2019s core business and in many ways has made it a reflection of his personal fascinations.He intends to push even further with Alphabet, a holding company that separates Google\u2019s various cash-rich advertising businesses from the list of speculative projects like self-driving cars that capture the imagination but do not make much money. Alphabet companies and investments span disciplines from biotechnology to energy generation to space travel to artificial intelligence to urban planning.Investors will get a good look at the scope of those ambitions on Feb. 1, when the company, in its fourth-quarter earnings report, will disclose for the first time the costs and income of the collection of projects outside of Google\u2019s core business.As chief executive of Alphabet, Mr. Page is tasked with figuring how to spin Google\u2019s billions in advertising profits into new companies and industries. When he announced the reorganization last summer, he said that he and Sergey Brin, Google\u2019s other founder, would do this by finding new people and technologies to invest in, while at the same time slimming down Google \u2014 now called Google Inc., a subsidiary of Alphabet \u2014 so their leaders would have more autonomy.\u201cIn general, our model is to have a strong C.E.O. who runs each business, with Sergey and me in service to them as needed,\u201d Mr. Page wrote in a letter to investors. He said that he and Mr. Brin would be responsible for picking those chief executives, monitoring their progress and determining their pay.Google\u2019s day-to-day management was left to Sundar Pichai, the company\u2019s new chief executive. His job will not be about preventing cancer or launching rocket ships, but to keep Google\u2019s advertising machine humming, to keep innovating in emerging areas like machine learning and virtual reality \u2014 all while steering the company through a thicket of regulatory troubles that could drag on for years.Mr. Page\u2019s new role is part talent scout and part technology visionary. He still has to find the chief executives of many of the other Alphabet businesses.And he has said on several occasions that he spends a good deal of time researching new technologies, focusing on what kind of financial or logistic hurdles stand in the way of them being invented or carried out.His presence at technology events, while just a sliver of his time, is indicative of a giant idea-scouting mission that has in some sense been going on for years but is now Mr. Page\u2019s main job.In the investor letter, he put it this way: \u201cSergey and I are seriously in the business of starting new things.\u201dMr. Page has always had a wide range of interests. As an undergraduate at the University of Michigan, he worked on solar cars, music synthesizers and once proposed that the school build a tram through campus. He arrived at Stanford\u2019s computer science doctorate program in 1995, and had a list of initial research ideas, including self-driving cars and using the web\u2019s many hyperlinks to improve Internet search. His thesis adviser, Terry Winograd, steered him toward search.\u201cEven before he came to Stanford he was interested in cool technical things that could be done,\u201d Mr. Winograd said. \u201cWhat makes something interesting for him is a big technical challenge. It\u2019s not so much where it\u2019s headed but what the ride is like.\u201dInside Google, Mr. Page is known for asking a lot of questions about how people do their jobs and challenging their assumptions about why things are as they are. In an interview at the Fortune Global Forum last year, Mr. Page said he enjoyed talking to people who ran the company\u2019s data centers.\u201cI ask them, like, \u2018How does the transformer work?\u2019 \u2018How does the power come in?\u2019 \u2018What do we pay for that?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m thinking about it kind of both as an entrepreneur and as a business person. And I\u2019m thinking \u2018What are those opportunities?\u2019\u201dAnother question he likes to ask: \u201cWhy can\u2019t this be bigger?\u201dMr. Page declined multiple requests for comment, and many of the people who spoke about him requested anonymity because they were not supposed to talk about internal company matters.Many former Google employees who have worked directly with Mr. Page said his managerial modus operandi was to take new technologies or product ideas and generalize them to as many areas as possible. Why can\u2019t Google Now, Google\u2019s predictive search tool, be used to predict everything about a person\u2019s life? Why create a portal to shop for insurance when you can create a portal to shop for every product in the world?But corporate success means corporate sprawl, and recently Google has seen a number of engineers and others leave for younger rivals like Facebook and start-ups like Uber. Mr. Page has made personal appeals to some of them, and, at least in a few recent cases, has said he is worried that the company has become a difficult place for entrepreneurs, according to people who have met with him.Part of Mr. Page\u2019s pitch included emphasizing how dedicated he was to \u201cmoonshots\u201d like interplanetary travel, or offering employees time and money to pursue new projects of their own. By breaking Google into Alphabet, Mr. Page is hoping to make it a more welcoming home for employees to build new businesses, as well as for potential acquisition targets.It will also rid his office of the kind of dull-but-necessary annoyances of running a major corporation. Several recently departed Google staff members said that as chief executive of Google, Mr. Page had found himself in the middle of various turf wars, like how to integrate Google Plus, the company\u2019s struggling social media effort, with other products like YouTube, or where to put Google Now, which resided in the Android team but was moved to the search group.Such disputes are a big reason Mr. Page had been shedding managerial duties and delegating the bulk of his product oversight to Mr. Pichai, these people said. In a 2014 memo to the company announcing Mr. Pichai\u2019s promotion to product chief, Mr. Page said the move would allow him to \u201cfocus on the bigger picture\u201d at Google and have more time to get the company\u2019s next generation of big bets off the ground.People who have worked with Mr. Page say that he tries to guard his calendar, avoiding back-to-back meetings and leaving time to read, research and see new technologies that interest him.Given that he is worth in the neighborhood of $40 billion and created the world\u2019s most famous website, Mr. Page has the tendency to attract a crowd when he attends technology events. At last year\u2019s Darpa Robotics Challenge, he was trailed closely by a handler who at times acted as a buffer between Mr. Page and would-be cellphone photographers. That commotion could annoy anyone, but it is particularly troubling for Mr. Page, who, because of damaged vocal cords, speaks just above a whisper and sometimes uses a microphone in small meetings.At home in Palo Alto, Mr. Page tries to have the most normal life possible, driving his children to school or taking his family to local street fairs, according to people who know him or have seen him at such events.And at Google, even events that are decidedly not normal aspire to a kind of casualness. Take the Camp, an exclusive and secretive event that Google holds at a resort in Sicily and where invitees have included Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla Motors and SpaceX, Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, and Tory Burch, the fashion designer.One attendee, who asked to remain anonymous because guests were not supposed to discuss the gathering, recalls being surprised by how much time Mr. Page spent with his children.In public remarks, Mr. Page has said how important his father, Carl V. Page, a computer science professor at Michigan State University who died in 1996, was to his choice of career.\u201cMy dad was really interested in technology,\u201d Mr. Page said at Google I/O in 2013, the last time he took the stage at the event. \u201cHe actually drove me and my family all the way across the country to go to a robotics conference. And then we got there and he thought it was so important that his young son go to the conference, one of the few times I\u2019ve seen him really argue with someone to get in someone underage successfully into the conference, and that was me.\u201dPeople who work with Mr. Page or have spoken with him at conferences say he tries his best to blend in, and, for the most part, the smaller groups of handpicked attendees at Google\u2019s academic and science gatherings, tend to treat him like a peer.The scope of his curiosity was apparent at Sci Foo Camp, an annual invitation-only conference that is sponsored by Google, O\u2019Reilly Media and Digital Science.The largely unstructured \u201cunconference\u201d begins when each of its attendees \u2014 an eclectic batch of astronomers, psychologists, physicists and others \u2014 write something that interests them on a small card and then paste it to a communal wall. Those notes become the basis for breakout talks on topics like scientific ethics or artificial intelligence.The last conference was held during a weekend in June on Google\u2019s Mountain View, Calif., campus, and Mr. Page was there for most of it. He did not host or give a speech, but mingled and went to talks, just like everyone else. That impressed investors and computer scientists who did not expect to see so much of him, but researchers who had come from outside Silicon Valley barely noticed.\u201cI have a vague memory that some founder type person was walking through the crowd,\u201d said Josh Peek, an assistant astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore.Another benefit of these gatherings for the reserved Mr. Page is that they are mostly closed to the news media.When Mr. Page does talk in public, he tends to focus on optimistic pronouncements about the future and Google\u2019s desire to help humanity. Asked about current issues, like how mobile apps are challenging the web or how ad blockers are affecting Google\u2019s business, he tends to dismiss it with something like, \u201cPeople have been talking about that for a long time.\u201dLately, he has talked more about his belief that for-profit companies can be a force for social good and change. During a 2014 interview with Charlie Rose, Mr. Page said that instead of a nonprofit or philanthropic organization, he would rather leave his money to an entrepreneur like Mr. Musk.Of course, for every statement Mr. Page makes about Alphabet\u2019s technocorporate benevolence, you can find many competitors and privacy advocates holding their noses in disgust. Technology companies like Yelp have accused the company of acting like a brutal monopolist that is using the dominance of its search engine to steer consumers toward Google services, even if that means giving the customers inferior information.It is hard to imagine how even the most ambitious person could hope to revolutionize so many industries. And Mr. Page, no matter how smart, cannot possibly be an expert in every area Alphabet wants to touch.His method is not overly technical. Instead, he tends to focus on how to make a sizable business out of whatever problem this or that technology might solve. Leslie Dewan, a nuclear engineer who founded a company that is trying to generate cheap electricity from nuclear waste, also had a brief conversation with Mr. Page at the Solve For X conference.She said he questioned her on things like modular manufacturing and how to find the right employees.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a nuclear background, but he knew the right questions to ask,\u201d said Dr. Dewan, chief executive of Transatomic Power. \u201c\u2018Have you thought about approaching the manufacturing in this way?\u2019 \u2018Have you thought about the vertical integration of the company in this way?\u2019 \u2018Have you thought about training the work force this way?\u2019 They weren\u2019t nuclear physics questions, but they were extremely thoughtful ways to think about how we could structure the business.\u201dDr. Dewan said Mr. Page even gave her an idea for a new market opportunity that she had not thought of. Asked to be more specific, she refused. The idea was too good to share.Doris Burke contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.E. Is Moving Headquarters to Boston and Itself Into the Digital Era", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported byYet Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chief executive, predicted last September that G.E. would be a \u201ctop 10 software company\u201d by 2020. In recent years, the company has steadily built up its software business, and its industrial products are increasingly loaded with digital sensors, all part of an effort to be a leader in the \u201cindustrial Internet.\u201dNow, in its latest step to remake itself \u2014 and its public image \u2014 as an industrial company for the digital era, G.E. said it was moving its headquarters from its longtime sprawling suburban home in Fairfield, Conn., to the high-tech environs of Boston.The relocation by G.E., long a bellwether of the American economy, illustrates how much old-line companies in nearly every industry have been forced to rethink their businesses for a digital age. It is an opportunity, but also a threat. So Walmart is investing heavily in online commerce to meet the challenge from Amazon, and Ford and General Motors are retooling to keep up with innovators like Tesla and Google.The Boston region, Mr. Immelt said, is \u201can ecosystem that shares our aspirations.\u201dThe area is crowded with 55 colleges and universities, including research centers like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard and Northeastern University. G.E. said it was also attracted by the area\u2019s thriving venture capital and start-up community, and pro-business state and local government.In Fairfield, G.E. has about 800 employees, a tiny percentage of its 360,000 employees worldwide. In Boston, G.E. will also have 800 people, but it will have a different kind of headquarters setting, the company said.Only about 200 will be corporate staff, G.E. said, while the remaining 600 will be mainly \u201cdigital industrial product managers, designers and developers\u201d in a variety of disciplines including data analysis, life sciences and robotics.The new headquarters will be leaner, faster and more open with a constant flow of industry partners, customers and innovators, G.E. executives say. The intent, they say, is that it will be more like walking into a start-up in an urban setting than the remote suburban headquarters of the past.The move fits the recent pattern at G.E., analysts say. \u201cIt affirms G.E.\u2019s digital technology orientation and that strategic commitment for decades ahead,\u201d said Steven Winoker, an analyst at Bernstein Research.For years already, G.E. has been at the forefront of industrial companies seeking to use sensor data and clever software to make its machines smarter, using less fuel and predicting when they need maintenance before breakdowns occur. Executives routinely call it \u201can industrial digital business.\u201dG.E.\u2019s digital push is part of the company\u2019s evolution, as it has focused its investment on the industrial side of its business while sharply cutting its once-huge finance arm in the wake of the financial crisis. In 2011, G.E. opened a separate software unit in San Ramon, Calif., which employs 2,000.The company moved to Fairfield in 1974, when many major companies were leaving New York City for suburbia with its lower taxes and living costs, and good public schools. G.E. first said it was weighing moving its headquarters last June, after Connecticut proposed raising taxes on businesses to close the state budget gap.That prompted G.E. to address the issue with urgency but, in its statement on Wednesday, G.E. said its senior management had been considering the appropriate role and location of its headquarters for more than three years.G.E. has not identified the address of its new headquarters, but the company said it would be in the Seaport District in South Boston, which is becoming a hub for investment by technology, biomedical and pharmaceutical companies.Massachusetts and Boston are offering an ample package of incentives. In news releases welcoming G.E., Gov. Charlie Baker and Mayor Martin J. Walsh said the state offered incentives of as much as $120 million through grants and other programs, and the city offered as much as $25 million in property tax relief.The city and state also agreed to make transportation improvements in the Seaport District and to build an innovation center where G.E. and university researchers can collaborate.Employees will move to a temporary location in Boston starting this summer, G.E. said, with the permanent move completed by 2018.G.E. said that the financial incentives from state and city governments vying for its headquarters were competitive. In the financial negotiations, G.E. wanted incentives and grants to make the move itself essentially cost-free for the company, said a person involved in the talks who was not authorized to speak publicly. But G.E. did not seek tax deals that would continue year after year, he said.In its statement, G.E. said it began its search with an initial list of 40 locations. San Francisco was ruled out partly because of its high living costs, and the longer time difference \u2014 by three hours, compared with the East Coast \u2014 in communicating with G.E.\u2019s units in Europe, where the company has a sizable business. Other cities, including New York, made strong bids, but in the end it was Boston, the person involved in the talks said. G.E. did not estimate the extent of the job losses in Connecticut as a result of the move. The company employs 5,000 people in the state, including the 800 at its headquarters.Jess Bidgood contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Last Call: A Bartender Trades SoHo for Serbia to Reclaim His Mansion", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "After decades at Fanelli Cafe in Manhattan, Bob Bozic goes in search of the family villa in Belgrade that Communists seized in 1946.Supported byIf you\u2019ve heard of Bartender Bob Bozic, then you\u2019ve heard the stories.A 65-year-old former boxer who had been a bartender at the Fanelli Cafe in SoHo since 1990, Mr. Bozic cultivated a following as a rude barman who reads several books a week, keeps season tickets to the opera and tells stories of an improbably novelistic life: He fought Larry Holmes at Madison Square Garden; he tried to rob a bank to pay overdue rent; he married Barack Obama\u2019s former girlfriend. It goes on.Fanelli\u2019s, as everyone calls it, opened on the corner of Prince and Mercer Streets in 1922. By the late 1970s it had become a gathering place for artists and bohemians. Now it is crowded with shoppers and tourists. Its hanging red neon sign makes it stand out like a lighthouse when SoHo\u2019s shops close at night, which was when regulars would return to see Mr. Bozic, who refused to make cocktails that required effort, hit on people\u2019s girlfriends and poured free drinks for those who answered his trivia questions. \u201cFanelli\u2019s is what people expect a bar in New York to be like,\u201d Mr. Bozic said, \u201cand I\u2019m what they expect a bartender to be like.\u201dFanelli\u2019s may have endured SoHo\u2019s gentrification, but it remains to be seen how it will endure without Mr. Bozic, who worked his final shift Sunday night two weeks ago. Bar-stool soliloquies about the end of an era were common at his farewell party.\u201cBob is the most interesting man I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d said Peter Berman, 61. \u201cI come here for Bob.\u201d\u201cThis place will not be Fanelli\u2019s without Bob,\u201d said Linda Lou, 63. \u201cI won\u2019t come back.\u201dMr. Bozic usually wore a ragged T-shirt to work, but he opted for a white shirt with a red tie that evening. Customers speculated aloud whether it was a clip-on.\u201cFor old times\u2019 sake,\u201d he yelled at one point, silencing the room, \u201ceverybody can light one cigarette!\u201dThe bar\u2019s owner, Sasha Noe, instantly intervened.Mr. Bozic called for silence again later to take a theatrical swig of beer before turning to his boss. \u201cI\u2019ve waited years to say this,\u201d he began, and then uttered something unprintable to much applause.Mr. Bozic halted his performance at one point to make a speech about why, precisely, he was leaving his longtime gig at a New York institution. His hulking hands wiped away tears as he sat on the bar. He was flying to Serbia the next afternoon to reclaim the 22-room mansion in Belgrade that Communists seized from his family in 1946.Regulars had heard about the unjustly seized Bozic family villa for years and mostly shrugged it off. They accepted Mr. Bozic\u2019s life as a series of dramatic anecdotes and even had a name for them: \u201cBob tales.\u201dBut the story of the mansion in Belgrade, improbable as it seems, turns out to be true, like his other tales. Or at least most of them.As he drank a bottle of red wine in his apartment in the Windsor Terrace section of Brooklyn in the first days of the year, Mr. Bozic acknowledged taking pleasure in recounting his life\u2019s episodes. \u201cI do look at it as a story,\u201d he said, \u201ca story being constantly written.\u201dThe apartment, usually littered with paperbacks and back issues of National Geographic and Foreign Affairs, was being emptied as he moved belongings to a storage facility in Red Hook. A large photo of him battling Mr. Holmes still hung in the living room. (A picture of the fight hangs at Fanelli\u2019s, too.)\u201cMy whole life has been a series of chapters,\u201d he continued. \u201cSerbia is the next one. This will be the last definitive chapter of my life.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just a house,\u201d he said. \u201cThe house is a symbol. This house has been hanging over my head since I was born.\u201dThe effort to reclaim the house began a decade ago, when he waded into the byzantine process of Serbian property restitution. But its origins date to 1946, when Mr. Bozic\u2019s family was forced to flee Yugoslavia.He was born in Windsor, Ontario, in 1950, too late to have enjoyed his family\u2019s prosperous life in Belgrade, complete with maids, nannies and a yacht. His father, Dobrivoje Bozic, was an influential engineer who invented an air-brake system for trains. The Bozic brake revolutionized train travel and made him wealthy. He bought a regal 22-room villa on Krunska Street in central Belgrade.But after World War II, the Communist Party seized much of the country\u2019s property, including the house on Krunska Street. Like other Serbian expatriates, the Bozics settled in Ontario.The move changed everything. Days after Bob was born, his father abruptly left the family. Mr. Bozic speculates that his father wanted another daughter \u2014 several years earlier, Bob\u2019s sister, Vesna, died when she was 5 from complications of appendicitis. Mr. Bozic met his father only once, when he was 5, at a family gathering. His mother, Radmila, became a cook at a hotel and lived there in a small room with Bob\u2019s brother. She placed Bob in foster care.Mr. Bozic, the legendary Fanelli\u2019s bartender, was known for his outlandish exploits, usually self-reported. They couldn\u2019t possibly all be true. Or could they?\u201cAll the early misfortunes of Bob\u2019s life stem from his childhood and the house in Belgrade,\u201d said Mr. Bozic\u2019s former wife, Alex McNear. \u201cGoing back to claim the house is a way for him to close his personal narrative.\u201d (Ms. McNear, naturally, also holds a place in the Bob tales: When Mr. Obama was a student at Columbia University in 1982, she was his first serious girlfriend. She married Mr. Bozic five years later. They are divorced but remain close.)Their 24-year-old daughter, Vesna, named after the sister Mr. Bozic never knew, shared her mother\u2019s opinion.\u201cI think he never felt he belonged,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a way for him to connect with his family. I asked him, \u2018Do you think there are ghosts in the house?\u2019 He told me, \u2018I hope so.\u2019\u201dIn Mr. Bozic\u2019s telling, this unfortunate childhood becomes more of a mythical origin story.When he was 11, a teacher falsely accused him of talking in class, and he attacked her afterward with a metal pipe. When a group of boys beat him up after school with rocks \u2014 Mr. Bozic pointed to the dents in his head as proof \u2014 he took retribution into his own hands. \u201cI started taking them out in the bathroom,\u201d he said. \u201cOne by one.\u201dHe dropped out of high school and ran away from home when he was 15. He was living on the streets of Toronto and checking pay phones for change when a bookmaker named Bertie Mignacco took Mr. Bozic under his wing, enlisting him as an errand boy and, later, a debt collector. Mr. Mignacco also owned a boxing gym, and Mr. Bozic started training there. Mr. Bozic went on to win the Canadian national amateur heavyweight championship. It turned out he could fight.Mr. Bozic\u2019s battle with Holmes, a future heavyweight world champion, occurred at the Garden in 1973. Mr. Bozic\u2019s nose was broken in the first round. Teeth flew out of his mouth in the third.\u201cI knew I was done after the Holmes fight,\u201d Mr. Bozic said. \u201cI knew he was better than I was ever going to be, and I was already starting to enter my next chapter.\u201dMr. Holmes, now 66, still remembers Bob Bozic.\u201cI won damn near every round, I think, but it was a fight I will never forget,\u201d he said when reached by phone. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he was a good boxer. He was a good fighter. There was no quit in him. He was all dog.\u201dFrom there, Mr. Bozic\u2019s story begins to jump around. He worked as a bouncer at Studio 54, was the personal driver for a reporter covering the Sandinistas in Nicaragua in the \u201980s and drove in a convoy of trucks carrying \u201cautomobile parts and sewing machines\u201d from Istanbul to Afghanistan.The bank robbery was in 1980. Mr. Bozic told the managers of a Madison Avenue bank that accomplices outside were aiming guns at them. In fact, there were no weapons involved, and Mr. Bozic was arrested when the police arrived. Somehow he managed to avoid jail time.Fanelli\u2019s hired Mr. Bozic in 1990.\u201cBob\u2019s past 20 years in New York have probably been the most uneventful of his life,\u201d said Madeleine Greey, a former girlfriend.After he served his last beer at Fanelli\u2019s, he was asked if he would miss New York. He didn\u2019t think about it long.\u201cI\u2019m good at closing chapters,\u201d he said, continuing to wipe down the bar.After Mr. Bozic arrived at Nikola Tesla Airport in Belgrade, he immediately checked into a hotel down the street from his family\u2019s old house. He is killing time in the city as he waits for a final decision regarding his ownership of the place. He spends afternoons drinking wine and reading books in cafes.The house, after being confiscated by the Communist Party, had a few illustrious owners. It was the Canadian Embassy, then the Iraqi Embassy. It later became the headquarters of Serbia\u2019s Democratic Party. And now Serbia, hoping to join the European Union, has adopted guidelines for the restitution of seized property. After a promising development in September, Mr. Bozic felt confident enough to quit his job and book a flight.The local media, amused by his tenacity, have written about his quest over the years. \u201cThey point at me on the streets,\u201d Mr. Bozic said from Belgrade. \u201c\u2018There\u2019s that bartender from New York getting that huge house.\u2019\u201dAs for the fate of Fanelli\u2019s, Mr. Bozic was not very concerned. \u201cI think they\u2019re looking for my replacement,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want a forlorn soul who reads books and can make a drink.\u201dWhile waiting for the official decision, he has been exploring the house and imagining what went on in certain rooms or where his sister might have played.\u201cIt\u2019s me and the ghosts,\u201d he said.One detail about the house delighted him. He came upon one of his father\u2019s train brakes. A previous tenant apparently thought it made a good doorstop.\u201cCan you believe that?\u201d Mr. Bozic said. \u201cIt\u2019s here, all these years later. This tiny brake that created this house and my legacy. Can you believe it?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Now, Self-Driving Cars Still Need Humans", "Date": "2016-01-17", "News": "Supported bySUNNYVALE, Calif. \u2014 Car enthusiasts, after hearing industry executives discussing the self-driving technology being built into their vehicles, might be forgiven for thinking robotic cars will soon drive themselves out of auto showrooms.Mr. Musk also said that within a year or two, it would be technically feasible to summon a Tesla from the opposite side of the country.But there is a growing gap between what these executives are saying and what most people think of when they hear executives or scientists describing autonomous or driverless cars.What Mr. Musk and Mr. Ghosn are describing \u2014 cross-country-driving hyperbole aside \u2014 are cars with advanced capabilities that can help drive or even take over in tricky situations like parallel parking on a busy street.Truly autonomous cars that do all the work, like the bubble-shaped vehicles Google has been testing near its Silicon Valley campus, are still at least a decade away from ferrying people around town, said Xavier Mosquet, a senior partner at the Boston Consulting Group and managing director of the firm\u2019s Detroit office.\u201cThis is going to be a journey, and a reasonably long one,\u201d he said.Cars are beginning to drive on their own in certain situations, and in the coming years, they will do increasingly more under computer control. They will follow curving roads, change lanes, pass through intersections, and stop and start.But they will require human supervision. Significantly, on many occasions, the cars will in effect still tell their human drivers, \u201cHere, you take the wheel,\u201d when they encounter complex driving situations or emergencies.In the automotive industry, this is referred to as the handoff problem, and automotive engineers acknowledge that there is no easy solution. Automotive designers have not yet found a way to make a driver who may be distracted by texting, reading email or watching a movie perk up and retake control of the car in the fraction of a second that is required in an emergency.The danger is that by inducing human drivers to pay even less attention to driving, the safety technology may be creating new hazards.Although Dr. Thrun left Google several years ago, he is still involved in the field of artificial intelligence. He describes himself as an enthusiastic Tesla owner. On a recent test drive, he cataloged the car\u2019s limitations and errors, including those he described as \u201ccritical interventions\u201d in which the driver must override the car\u2019s behavior.The Tesla Autopilot system permits drivers to remove their hands from the wheel, but it prompts them to regain control after a brief period. It will also warn a driver to retake control in certain situations.The Tesla performed well in freeway driving, and the company recently fixed a bug that had caused the car to unexpectedly veer off onto freeway exits. However, on city streets and country roads, Autopilot\u2019s performance could be described as hair-raising. The car, which uses only a camera to track the roadway by identifying lane markers, did not follow the curves smoothly. It also did not slow down when approaching turns.On a recent 220-mile drive to Lake Tahoe from Palo Alto, Calif., Dr. Thrun said he had to intervene more than a dozen times.The company said that on Jan. 9, it introduced a new version of the Autopilot software that offered both restrictions and improvements in handling.Like the Tesla, the new autonomous Nissan models will still require human oversight and will not drive autonomously in all conditions. Nissan\u2019s engineers acknowledged that even their most advanced models would not be autonomous in every situation, including snow, heavy rain and even some nighttime driving.\u201cThere are certain limitations depending on the condition of the weather. For example, if you are in heavy snow or rain, it is impossible to have autonomous driving,\u201d said Tsuyoshi Yamaguchi, Renault-Nissan\u2019s executive vice president for technology development. \u201cWe should make sure the vehicle recognizes it and gives a caution to the driver.\u201dThe situation is further complicated by laws and regulations that require cars to be controlled by humans. In Europe, the 1968 Vienna Convention required that \u201cevery moving vehicle or combination of vehicles shall have a driver,\u201d and \u201cevery driver shall at all times be able to control his vehicle.\u201d Although an amendment has been proposed, no new legislation is yet in place.None of that has discouraged some enthusiastic Tesla owners. Doug Carmean, a Microsoft computer designer who commutes daily between Seattle and Redmond, Wash., said he had encountered the Tesla Autopilot offramp bug and found it \u201cscary.\u201dYet as much as 45 minutes of his commute each day is in slow, stop-and-go traffic, and his car will effortlessly and predictably follow the car ahead, permitting him to surf the web on the Tesla\u2019s giant display.\u201cEven though it has these frightening movements, I\u2019ve come to enjoy it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sense of awe and pleasure.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Automakers Go Electric, Even if Gas Is Cheap", "Date": "2016-01-11", "News": "Supported byDETROIT \u2014 While American consumers were taking advantage of low gas prices to buy trucks and sport utility vehicles in large numbers, some automakers delayed investing in slower-selling electrified vehicles.But with increases in federal fuel-economy standards looming in 2017, car companies are hustling to bring out hybrid and electric models to help them meet the new rules \u2014\u00a0even though electrified vehicles make up only 2 percent of overall sales.The federal government has mandated corporate average fuel economy of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. But companies need to meet an interim standard of about 37 m.p.g. by next year.On Monday, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles introduced a plug-in hybrid-electric version of its new minivan model, the Pacifica, making it the first hybrid vehicle in the Italian-American automaker\u2019s lineup.The Pacifica joined several other new electrified models introduced by other automakers at the auto show, including models from Ford Motor Company and General Motors.Fiat Chrysler has been an industry laggard in the push for electrified cars, relying heavily in recent years on sales of Ram pickups and Jeep sport utility vehicles to drive its growth in the American market.The results, at least financially, have been stellar. Profits have surged and market share has expanded at the expense of Fiat Chrysler\u2019s rivals.But Fiat Chrysler\u2019s chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, acknowledged on Monday that his company needed more high-mileage models, and the hybrid minivan was a good starting point.9 Photos\u201cThe 2025 numbers are very high numbers,\u201d Mr. Marchionne said at a news conference. \u201cYou look around the show at all the hybrids and the electrification as being a solution to the rules in 2025.\u201dThe hybrid minivan is powered by a battery charge that can cover 30 miles of driving, at which point a gasoline engine kicks in to extend its range. The company estimates that the vehicle will achieve an equivalent of 80 m.p.g. in city driving.One hybrid alone will not improve Fiat Chrysler\u2019s corporate average fuel numbers enough to meet the coming standards. Last year, the company\u2019s fleetwide average was about 22 miles per gallon \u2014 making it one of the least fuel-efficient companies in the industry.Mr. Marchionne said the company would improve its average by continuing to improve the mileage of its conventional gasoline-powered vehicles, as well as by adding hybrids.Fiat Chrysler is also preparing for stricter federal rules on pollutants by purchasing emissions credits from competitors like Tesla, which can easily meet the standards by virtue of its all-electric product lineup.Mr. Marchionne said that Fiat Chrysler had to balance how much to spend on new technologies that improve fuel efficiency and cut pollution with the opportunity to buy credits that help it meet emissions standards.\u201cWe will get technology, but at a price,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cost associated with the plug-in minivan is not inconsequential.\u201dBuying emissions credits from other carmakers is part of the overall effort to comply with government standards. \u201cIt would be nonsensical for us not to utilize that market,\u201d he said.Other automakers are also adding vehicles to their lineups that can help improve fleetwide fuel-economy numbers.Mark Reuss, head of global product development at General Motors, said his company was improving fuel economy across its lineup with smaller, more efficient gasoline engines, aerodynamic designs and reductions in vehicle weight.But G.M. still needs new vehicles like the all-electric Chevrolet Bolt to make substantial gains in corporatewide fuel economy.\u201cIt is a zero-emission vehicle, so there are a lot of credits for vehicles like the Bolt,\u201d Mr. Reuss said. \u201cOur plan is to improve fuel economy on all fronts, from taking weight out of new models to introducing game-changers like the Bolt.\u201dThe average fuel economy of vehicles sold in the United States had been improving steadily until gas prices plunged to $2 a gallon last year.Consumers have opted to buy more trucks and S.U.V.s than passenger cars in 2015, resulting in greater overall fuel consumption.In December, the average fuel economy of a new vehicle sold in the United States was 24.9 miles per gallon, according to the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. That was the first time in two years that the average fell below 25 miles per gallon, according to figures compiled by the institute.One analyst said that automakers could hardly be blamed for meeting high demand for pickups and S.U.V.s, even if it set back their fuel-efficiency goals.\u201cThe government is regulating what automakers have to produce to meet new standards, but it isn\u2019t what consumers want to buy,\u201d said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with the firm Autotrader.On Monday, Ford Motor displayed its Fusion midsize passenger car, which also is offered in a hybrid version and a plug-in variation.Ford executives said the company was trying to offer electrification options on as many of its vehicles as possible. That way it could respond more quickly to shifts in consumer tastes if gas prices rose.\u201cEvery company has to work hard to achieve these new standards,\u201d Ms. Krebs said. \u201cSome, like Fiat Chrysler, need to do more than others because they have been relying on trucks and Jeeps to keep their sales growing.\u201dNew fuel-economy rules are not the only area where automakers and federal regulators are grappling with vehicle improvements.Companies have been meeting with officials of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recently to come up with voluntary guidelines to improve vehicle safety. The talks follow record numbers of recalls in the industry, and aggressive enforcement actions by regulators \u2014 including the imposition of big fines for safety violations.Fiat Chrysler, for example, has been hit with $175 million in fines for delaying recalls and failing to follow reporting rules.\u201cAs unpleasant as I find these fines, I understand what prompted them,\u201d said Mr. Marchionne, adding that he expected more cooperation between auto companies and the safety agency in the future.Reuters, citing company officials, reported on Monday that an agreement with regulators on voluntary safety guidelines was imminent. But a spokesman for the safety agency, Gordon Trowbridge, said no accord had been concluded.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re hopeful we have something to announce soon, but nothing has been finalized,\u201d he said.

{"Headline": "Self-Driving Cars May Get Here Before We\u2019re Ready", "Date": "2016-01-21", "News": "Supported bySOMETIME in the future \u2014 although no one quite knows when \u2014 your morning commute may look something like this: Open an app, summon a car and wait for the arrival of a driverless vehicle that will whisk you to work like a ghost chauffeur.The short answer: We are not.\u201cThe technology is really advancing faster than we had originally anticipated,\u201d said Steve Hill, the director of the governor\u2019s office of economic development in Nevada, the first state to pass legislation allowing driverless cars to be tested, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t really say that Nevada, or really any place else, has really developed the policies that will be needed to facilitate the industry moving forward.\u201dBy many accounts, Mr. Hill is right. Even though fully autonomous cars could be ready for the road within the next decade, only 6 percent of the country\u2019s most populous cities have accounted for them in their long-term plans, according to a study from the National League of Cities, an advocacy and research group.\u201cIf governments are not equipped to react quickly when automated vehicle technology is ready for use by consumers, that will be a challenge, and it has the possibility to delay consumer benefits from this technology,\u201d said Emily Castor, director of transportation policy at Lyft, which has announced a $500 million partnership with General Motors dedicated in part to developing autonomous cars.Representatives from G.M. and other members of the World Economic Forum\u2019s automotive committee will meet in Davos on Friday during closed-door sessions to discuss some of the auto industry\u2019s most pressing issues, including the regulation of self-driving vehicles, according to Alex Mitchell, the head of automotive industry at the World Economic Forum.Google, Uber, Tesla and a host of automakers have been moving at full speed to develop driverless technologies. Although the federal government has expressed support, it has so far left regulatory decisions to state and local governments.\u201cParadoxically, despite a lot of cities thinking this technology is coming, very few have started to plan for it,\u201d Mr. Mitchell said.Last week, Anthony Foxx, the United States transportation secretary, pledged that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration would help set standards for fully automated vehicles within the next six months.That\u2019s encouraging for companies that have been bullish on driverless technologies, but have until now faced a patchwork of cautious legislation: Only a handful of states have passed laws relating to the testing of autonomous cars, and no state expressly allows a completely driverless vehicle on the roadCalifornia\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles recently proposed requiring a licensed driver to be in the car at all times. That could be a disappointment for companies like Google, which is currently testing a fully autonomous vehicle in Mountain View, Calif.\u201cWe\u2019re encouraged that federal authorities want to work with states and chart a path forward for self-driving cars,\u201d said Johnny Luu, a spokesman for Google. \u201cWe stand ready to work with policy makers at all levels to educate them about the benefits of this technology.\u201dMany local governments see the potential for driverless vehicles to solve urban ills like parking, congestion and even mobility for lower-income residents.But drafting policy for a technology that is not yet on the market makes it much more complicated to answer important practical questions: Do we need extra lanes, but less parking? More curbside space? How will the cars communicate with traffic signals, and who will be responsible when there\u2019s an accident?\u201cIt\u2019s probably more fair to say that we are engaging on the issue than we have developed a plan for it,\u201d said Ron Achelpohl, the director of transportation and environment for the Mid-America Regional Council, an association of local governments in nine counties in Kansas and Missouri. \u201cUntil these vehicles start penetrating the market, it\u2019s going to be difficult to account for how people use them and behave differently.\u201dSome automakers already sell vehicles with a number of semiautonomous functions, meaning that the cars can intervene on a driver\u2019s behalf but still require a human at the wheel. Some Ford vehicles, for example, can come equipped with the ability to sense when it is drifting into another lane and correct the steering, or even help the driver park.But some who advocate driverless cars say that the full benefits come only from a completely autonomous vehicle \u2014 no human required.\u201cThe long-term goal is to have full autonomy, because that\u2019s really where you start to see the benefits from a city perspective, from a safety perspective,\u201d said Brooks Rainwater, the director of the City Solutions and Applied Research Center at the National League of Cities.A car that could spend the day picking people up and dropping them off, for instance, could greatly reduce the need for parking. Companies like Lyft, for example, hope that urbanites of the future will even forgo car ownership altogether.That could have big implications for places like Los Angeles, a city known for both its massive parking structures and its limited use of public transportation.\u201cWhen you think about the impact on our physical city, the idea of maybe smaller roads, more compact travel, repurposing parking structures and parking lots,\u201d said Ashley Z. Hand, the transportation technology strategist for the city of Los Angeles, \u201cit\u2019s a huge opportunity.\u201dFaced with the prospect that driverless technology will quickly outpace regional policy, other local governments across the country have committed more efforts to driverless vehicles. The motivations are not just practical: Driverless car companies can bring more jobs, grants and positive attention.Mr. Hill\u2019s office in Nevada, for example, recently announced that it would create a specific unit devoted to autonomous cars that could serve as a single point of contact for the industry. Driverless cars could also play a large role in which city is awarded $40 million from the Department of Transportation as part of its new Smart City program.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of cities talking as we speak,\u201d said Susan Shaheen, a co-director of the transportation sustainability research center at the University of California, Berkeley. Austin, Tex., where Google is also testing its driverless cars, is already planning to apply for the Smart City challenge, according to the mayor, Steve Adler.\u201cA driverless car doesn\u2019t break very many traffic laws, doesn\u2019t drink while it drives, doesn\u2019t get distracted, really pays attention,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "President May Have Exaggerated Role of Stimulus in Clean Energy, Experts Say", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported by\u201cGas under $2 a gallon ain\u2019t bad either,\u201d he concluded.Those facts are accurate. But, experts say, many of the changes had little to do with the stimulus law, occurring instead through government policies, market forces and private sector activities.\u201cThat paragraph as it relates to energy and climate issues \u2014 I thought it was the most troubling paragraph of the whole speech,\u201d said David Victor, an expert on energy policy at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to attribute the bulk of what\u2019s happening now in terms of bending the emissions curve and increasing renewables specifically to the stimulus.\u201dWhatever the cause, Mr. Obama can claim a number of energy successes. During his seven years in office, the United States has cut carbon pollution more than any other country, and it has reduced its dependence on foreign oil. In 2008, the United States imported nearly 60 percent of its oil, but by 2015, that number fell to 24 percent.Energy policy experts praise some of the stimulus spending, such as the $400 million that funded the creation of an Energy Department laboratory, modeled after Pentagon research labs, that is devoted to finding breakthroughs in clean technologies. Lawmakers of both parties have praised the program, known as the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, or ARPA-E. And wind and solar producers say that stimulus funding helped keep them afloat through the financial meltdown.Private oil and gas companies, however, were a driving force behind the most important changes in the United States\u2019 energy landscape over the past seven years: lower fossil fuel emissions and a reduction in dependence on imported oil. Using an extraction method known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, the companies made the United States the world\u2019s leading producer of oil and natural gas.A glut of domestic oil has helped lower prices and imports. The new supply of domestic natural gas has helped lower greenhouse gas emissions. Electric utilities have traditionally relied on coal as the cheapest fuel source, but turned to natural gas as it became cheaper.\u201cThe results that the president trumpeted were driven in part by government action but were at least as much a result of market forces,\u201d said Michael Levi, an expert on energy policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cThe president didn\u2019t get in the way, but that doesn\u2019t mean he made these things happen all by himself.\u201dMr. Levi said that it was a different Obama policy \u2014 a set of Environmental Protection Agency rules \u2014 that required a sharp increase in vehicle fuel efficiency and helped lower oil demand.Wind and solar energy producers say that two policies have long powered their industry. One is a set of state laws, now enacted in more than 30 states, mandating the use of renewable electricity. The other is production and investment tax credits.The most important factor behind the growth of the solar industry is an eight-year extension of a federal investment tax credit, approved by President George W. Bush in 2008, said Rhone Resch, the chief executive of the Solar Energy Industries Association, the main trade group.\u201cWe were such a small industry, it provided that stability so that we could bring forward all sorts of new styles of solar projects \u2014 we really hadn\u2019t done utility-scale solar projects in any kind of meaningful way up until that point,\u201d he said.Mr. Obama\u2019s economic stimulus included provisions to extend those tax credits, and it made the money available for wind and solar projects as cash grants.The federal loan guarantee program \u2014 created under the Bush administration but infused with billions under the stimulus \u2014 had several high-profile failures, but it has had many more successes, including Tesla. The failures cost taxpayers $780 million, the Energy Department said, representing a little more than 2 percent of the $34.2 billion it issued in loans. The agency has recouped the losses through interest payments.Still, experts said that while some programs funded by the stimulus have borne fruit, they have not done so at the scale Mr. Obama signaled in his speech.\u201cThe stimulus program subsidized a lot of things that would have happened anyway, or that shouldn\u2019t have happened,\u201d Mr. Victor said. \u201cBut it also funded a handful of important things that wouldn\u2019t have been funded. Exhibit A is ARPA-E, which is innovating important new energy technology. There were huge amounts of money sloshing around, and some droplets sloshed into important places.\u201dCoral Davenport reported from Washington, and Diane Cardwell from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Tesla, a New Car Smell That Vegans Can Get Behind", "Date": "2016-01-14", "News": "Supported byWheelsBut for some discerning consumers, there is a nagging problem. The leather in the seats and steering wheel requires slaughtering animals, and the cloth substitute doesn\u2019t quite measure up for a vehicle that can cost more than $100,000.Now, in response, comes the Tesla that even a luxury-minded vegan could love.Synthetic leather, in a shade Tesla calls Ultra White, is available as an option for the new Model X sport utility vehicle.Tesla is just the latest automaker to join in what even Euell Gibbons, the naturalist of Grape-Nuts fame, would have had a hard time imagining a generation ago: a rush by the car industry \u2014 long a symbol of environmental wreckage \u2014 to project a more responsible image.\u201cAll the car companies want sustainability cred,\u201d said Jack Nerad, executive editorial director at Kelley Blue Book.Perhaps it was inevitable. After all, celebrities like Beyonc\u00e9 and Brad Pitt have given the vegan lifestyle gloss, while its growing number of adherents have pushed restaurants and food companies to create more palatable plant-based products that mimic meat and dairy items. If vegans are willing to pay for a premium vehicle, why shouldn\u2019t they be able to have fake leather, too?So in recent years, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Lexus and Ferrari have begun offering models with faux leather seating, and Volvo and Ford have increasingly emphasized the use of more natural components like soy foam in their seats.Consider the BMW i3. For $42,400 and up, a buyer gets an interior with open-pore eucalyptus wood harvested from a \u201ccertified forest.\u201d (Translation: a forest that is responsibly managed.) The interior panels are made of a renewable Asian kenaf plant, and it is all assembled in a wind-powered factory in Germany.\u201cThe aim of developing the BMW i cars is not simply to build emission-free cars,\u201d the company\u2019s website says, \u201cbut also to use the maximum possible amount of sustainably produced and recycled materials \u2014 especially inside.\u201dAt BMW, it appears, environmental guilt no longer comes standard.In the case of Tesla, whose brand represents a kind of sustainable luxe, many vegans have complained that it makes no sense for an eco-friendly car to include animal products, given the significant amount of greenhouse gases the industrial agriculture sector emits. Even Nikola Tesla, the inventor for whom the car is named, they point out, was a vegetarian.Leilani M\u00fcnter, a professional racecar driver and environmental advocate who is vegan, said she was disappointed when she first tried to buy the Model S and could not get the faster, sportier model without real leather seats.She contacted Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s founder and chief executive, who helped her get the desired model with cloth seats, she said. Not too long after \u2014 faced with several complaints from similar-minded would-be customers \u2014 the company made cloth seats, only in black, an option for all models and trim packages, with a synthetic-leather-clad steering wheel available on special request.The new seating option for the Model X goes a step further.\u201cTesla revolutionized the electric car and now it\u2019s redefined luxury interiors by using these vegan materials, which are both animal- and environmentally friendly,\u201d said Anne Brainard, senior corporate liaison and manager of corporate affairs at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. The group urged Tesla to stop using leather at its shareholder meeting last June and had since remained in discussions with the carmaker.\u201cWe find that customers enjoy both leather and nonleather options for their Teslas,\u201d Khobi Brooklyn, a company spokeswoman, said in an email. \u201cWe are committed to giving customers the ability to build the Tesla that meets their needs and lifestyle choices.\u201dJack Norris, executive director of Vegan Outreach, an advocacy group based in Davis, Calif., said Tesla\u2019s move indicated that enough people had voiced concern to push the carmaker to respond.\u201cFortunately the options for this lifestyle are really expanding and becoming cool,\u201d Melissa Wood, who drives a BMW with synthetic leather seating, said in an email.Still, as the push to reduce carbon dioxide emissions leads to the use of new energy sources, it may become even trickier to avoid animal products.Biofuels aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 like those United Airlines announced last year it would start using, and would invest $30 million to develop \u2014 are sometimes derived from animal fats. And the use of animal-based food waste to make electricity and fuel is on the rise in places like Cleveland, Boston and Orlando.Ms. M\u00fcnter, who turned down sponsorship from a company that was making lubrications from beef tallow, said that she looked forward to a day without liquid fuels entirely.\u201cI don\u2019t like burning fuel,\u201d she said. \u201cEventually, it\u2019s just not going to be a byproduct they\u2019re trying to use because hopefully there won\u2019t be this huge industry that\u2019s slaughtering billions of animals every year.\u201dMark and Elizabeth Peters, shareholders and S-Model owners who are vegan and have publicly pressed Tesla to abandon animal products, agreed, but said that it was difficult to completely avoid them.\u201cThere\u2019s ingredients in most everything that we see, wear and experience in our daily lives that somehow have utilized a part of an animal, which is unfortunate,\u201d Ms. Peters said. \u201cBut if we know, then we can make a choice.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Looking Beyond the Internet of Things", "Date": "2016-01-01", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 If you have sent email on Google or used Microsoft\u2019s browser or databases, you have touched the technology handiwork of Adam Bosworth.Mr. Bosworth, a tall and grizzled but still trim 60-year-old, is a Johnny Appleseed of sorts in the tech industry, with a penchant for being intimately involved in the creation of generations of widely used technology.While it is never easy to predict what the next big thing will be, identifying what Mr. Bosworth is working on is always good for clues. Right now, along with competitors at companies like Amazon and Google, he is building what some call a \u201cdata singularity.\u201dAll those devices and sensors would also wirelessly connect to far-off data centers, where millions of computer servers manage and learn from all that information.Those servers would then send back commands to help whatever the sensors are connected to operate more effectively: A home automatically turns up the heat ahead of cold weather moving in, or streetlights behave differently when traffic gets bad. Or imagine an insurance company instantly resolving who has to pay for what an instant after a fender-bender because it has been automatically fed information about the accident.Think of it as one, enormous process in which machines gather information, learn and change based on what they learn. All in seconds.It is lofty language, no doubt, but he and others believe they are on the brink of one of the next big shifts in computing, perhaps as big as the web browser or the personal computer.But building an automated system that can react to all that data like a thoughtful person is fiendishly hard \u2014 and that may be Mr. Bosworth\u2019s last great challenge to solve.It is difficult to say just how big this business could be, but there are two good indicators: Analysts at Gartner estimate that by 2019 retail cloud computing \u2014 the data center side of the equation Mr. Bosworth is working on \u2014 will double in size, to $314 billion. The sensors on objects will be a $2.6 trillion business, an increase of 250 percent, Gartner estimates.Mr. Bosworth went to Harvard with Bill Gates, where he took just one class in computers while studying Asian history. He nonetheless landed a job on Wall Street, where he persuaded his bosses to give him $1 million for minicomputers \u2014 the cutting edge of computing before personal computers \u2014 that could deliver the first instant reports on how business was doing.He got interested in tech\u2019s next big thing, PCs, and wrote an early spreadsheet program. He joined Microsoft in 1989. His first years there were spent on databases, but as the Internet got big he helped turn browsers from software that looks up web pages to software that interacts with the web.He and Mr. Gates repeatedly argued over the importance of the Internet, according to people there at the time. Mr. Gates may also have goaded Mr. Bosworth, knowing he is the sort who does not like to be told something is not possible.\u201cHe sees out into the future, but not too far that you can\u2019t build something,\u201d said Brad Silverberg, a Seattle venture capitalist who has known Mr. Bosworth since 1981 and was his boss at Microsoft. \u201cIf you want to make sure something gets done, tell him not to do it.\u201dThe son of a demanding private school headmaster, Mr. Bosworth also clashed with Larry Page, Google\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, while working there on interactive software and a failed effort to build online health services.\u201cWe had styles that weren\u2019t synergistic,\u201d said Mr. Bosworth. \u201cHe looks intensively at massive amounts of data-gathering, and assumes he\u2019ll be able to do something with it using math. I was focused on getting people to communicate with other people.\u201dMarc Benioff, the chief executive at Salesforce and a friend of Mr. Bosworth, asked him to look at the technology being used at the San Francisco company, which was founded in 1999 and was one of the first to use cloud computing technology.Over lunch a few months later, Mr. Bosworth told Mr. Benioff that his once-revolutionary company was in peril.\u201cComputers are 50 times faster than when Salesforce started,\u201d he said. \u201cI told Marc, \u2018There is a whole new technology that is going to overtake you, the way the web overtook Microsoft.\u2019\u201dThat technology \u2014 the data singularity \u2014 is what Mr. Bosworth is now working on at Salesforce.If he is right, this new era in computing will have effects far beyond a little more efficiency. Consumers could see a vast increase in the number of services, ads and product upgrades that are sold alongside most goods. And products that respond to their owner\u2019s tastes \u2014 something already seen in smartphone upgrades, connected cars from BMW or Tesla, or entertainment devices like the Amazon Echo \u2014 could change product design.Analysts foresee a scramble to own and manage these systems and their data, and ever more power accruing to just a few companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft, which already have the global computing systems and reach to make it happen.Few outfits have the engineering talent to manage this sort of thing. One year after starting the business, for example, Microsoft\u2019s cloud handles a trillion sensor messages a week.Salesforce, which is worth $54 billion, is an underdog compared to that tiny group of tech behemoths. It lacks global data centers, but does control important data, like information about what customers are buying.Who will ultimately control that data, from the sensors to the cloud and back, is one of the most contentious questions in tech.\u201cYou\u2019ve got Amazon knowing everything about purchasing, Google knowing everything about what people do on the Internet, and Salesforce knowing everything about the revenue side of a business,\u201d said Scott Raney, a venture capitalist at Redpoint Ventures who invests in companies related to what Mr. Bosworth is working on.\u201cLay computer processing on all that, and it\u2019s powerful to a point where a little creepiness sets in; no one else will have the data,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m buying the stock of all the companies. I just hope they\u2019ll be benevolent dictators.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.M.\u2019s Investment in Lyft Hedges Against a Future With Fewer Car Owners", "Date": "2016-01-04", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsThe challenges these shifts pose to the business of making vehicles may seem still in the distance. Car sales in the United States hit a record 17.5 million in 2015 and could keep rising. And analysts predict G.M.\u2019s profit will reach $8.3 billion this year, according to Thomson Reuters data. Yet the company\u2019s stock trades at just six times earnings. Rival Ford manages an only slightly better seven times.Several factors are to blame: fears of overheating sales, fueled in part by subprime lending; a sluggish turnaround in Europe; problems in Latin America and Russia; and a slowdown in China.But there\u2019s also a longer-term worry about the rise of self-driving cars, shared ownership and ride-hailing. People may buy fewer cars in the future and the likes of Tesla, Google, Apple and tech-focused car-parts suppliers could become more important, and more profitable, at the expense of traditional manufacturers.Branching out into Lyft gives G.M. a better chance of navigating these trends. For example, the two companies plan to set up hubs offering people who want to drive for Lyft the chance to rent cars by the day, week or month. That\u2019s a flexible approach that aligns with part-time and multijob employment trends. And it gives G.M. an extra market for its vehicles.Over the longer run, the two also intend to pair Lyft\u2019s ride-matching and payments systems with G.M.\u2019s progress in making autonomous and connected cars. The company already has its own assisted-driving technology with OnStar, as well as arrangements with suppliers like the camera and radar maker Mobileye.Lyft is not the market leader. Its latest $5.5 billion valuation makes it just one-tenth the size of Uber. But that also makes G.M.\u2019s hefty stake and board seat less expensive at Lyft. It\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s a partial insurance policy against what could become existential threats.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Godzillium vs. Trumpium: Some Suggestions to Add to the Periodic Table", "Date": "2016-01-14", "News": "Supported byWhat would you name a new element on the periodic table? That\u2019s a question that groups of scientists from Japan, the U.S. and Russia will have to decide as they replace the current identifiers of four elements \u2014 113, 115, 117 and 118 \u2014 with something a little more evocative.With the ushering in of these four superheavy elements, and the approval of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, the Periodic Table\u2019s seventh row will be complete.We recently solicited reader suggestions. Many proposed naming them after prominent scientists such as Rosalind Franklin, Ada Lovelace, Nikola Tesla and Carl Sagan or after chemistry professors that they admired in college and high school.Others tapped into popular culture, picking \u201cadamantium\u201d after the material, in Marvel lore, that makes Wolverine\u2019s indestructible claws, and \u201cunobtanium,\u201d the coveted element from the movie Avatar. Donald Trump is shaking up this contest, too \u2014 readers suggested \u201ctrumpium,\u201d \u201ctrumpillium,\u201d \u201ctrumpissum\u201d and \u201cAnyoneButTrumpium.\u201dHere are some other standouts:The most popular suggestion we received was to name element 113 after Riken institute in Japan. The team of scientists from the institute were the first researchers in Asia to discover an element and gain the right to name it. But \u201cRikenium\u201d does not follow the rules set out by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, which ultimately must approve the winning names (Riken is an institute, not a place, and therefore would most likely be disqualified as a contender).David Bernklau, a reader from Brooklyn, suggested naming one of the new elements after Albert Ghiorso, who codiscovered an astonishing 12 elements, a record. Over the course of 30 years, his inventions contributed to the discovery of americium, curium, berkelium, californium, einsteinium, fermium, mendelevium, nobelium, lawrencium, rutherfordium, dubnium and seaborgium. Seaborgium was named after his colleague Glenn Seaborg, a nuclear scientist.\u201cIn a nutshell, it is unbelievable that an element has yet to be named after him!\u201d said Mr. Bernklau.Several people suggested naming one of the new elements after the 300-foot-tall mutant lizard.\u201cGodzillium,\u201d Susan Sampson wrote, \u201cis mythical, Japanese, and worthy of an element that is unnatural, radioactive and rapidly self-destructive.\u201dElement 43 was later found and named technetium in 1937 and the symbol \u201cNp\u201d was used to describe neptunium in 1940.Lisa DeBenedittis said she would bestow the name sisyphisium on element 118 because it is the heaviest synthetic element. Her logic:\u201cTherefore, I look to two attributes: its heaviness and its second appearance, as noteworthy. Like the heavy boulder that Sisyphus was condemned to push up a mountain, only to watch it roll down, for eternity, this name evokes 118\u2019s emblematic characteristics.\u201dHolly Triebe also decided to borrow a name from Greek mythology for her suggested name. She went with \u201cnarcissium\u201d after the handsome hunter, Narcissus, who upon looking into a pool of water, fell deeply in love with his reflection and stared at it until he died.\u201cThis word suits any of the newfound elements because they are all man-made elements, and scientists have begun to play God in this aspect. They decide what is created and what they believe is necessary,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a form of self-importance because the elements present on Earth are no longer good enough.\u201dA picture caption with an earlier version of this article, using information from a photo agency, referred incorrectly to the periodic table pictured. It was not created by Dmitri Mendeleyev, the Russian chemist who died in 1907; it was photographed in 1947.Advertisement"}
