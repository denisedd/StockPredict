{"Headline": "Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio Clash Harshly, Filling Void on G.O.P. Debate Stage", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byMr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio, who are behind Mr. Trump in the Iowa polls and hoping for surprise finishes here, were repeatedly confronted with pointed questions about their views and Senate votes on providing citizenship or legal status to immigrants who are in the country illegally. But it was Mr. Cruz who was hit hardest on the issue, as Mr. Rubio teamed up with Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky to portray him as an opportunist.\u201cEverybody\u2019s for amnesty except for Ted Cruz,\u201d Mr. Paul said, turning Mr. Cruz\u2019s favorite shibboleth against him as he denounced the \u201cfalseness\u201d that he said Mr. Cruz perpetrated. \u201cThat\u2019s an authenticity problem.\u201dMr. Rubio was even harsher as he tries to upset Mr. Cruz here and finish in second place, which could strengthen his position against Mr. Trump in the Feb. 9 New Hampshire primary.\u201cThis is the lie that Ted\u2019s campaign is built on,\u201d Mr. Rubio said, seizing on a brutal compilation of video clips that the Fox News debate moderators had shown, highlighting Mr. Cruz\u2019s apparent shifts on immigration.Mr. Cruz struck back by getting nearly as personal with Mr. Rubio. \u201cI like Marco,\u201d he said, unconvincingly. \u201cHe\u2019s very charming. He\u2019s very smooth.\u201d However, Mr. Cruz added, when Mr. Rubio came to the Senate, he backed off his hard-line stance on immigration and supported an overhaul favored by the Republican Party\u2019s \u201cmajor donors because he thought it was politically advantageous.\u201dIf the debate began on a surreal note, with the candidates poking fun at the absence of the field\u2019s leader, Mr. Trump, it quickly turned conventional as the contenders tried to undercut one another in hopes of gaining favor with Iowa voters.But the added attention may not have been particularly helpful. There was more time for Mr. Cruz\u2019s image as a consistent conservative to come under relentless attack. There was more time for Mr. Rubio\u2019s past alliance with Democrats on an immigration overhaul to come under scrutiny. There was more time for former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio to discuss policy, in hopes of helping their chances in New Hampshire, but neither man had particularly electrifying moments.Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, playing the Washington outsider, landed some deft attacks against Hillary Clinton, earning applause for promising that he would never let her \u201cget within 10 miles of the White House.\u201d Mr. Paul, who is so far behind in the polls that he did not qualify for the last prime-time debate, was aggressive and passionate as he made the case for his brand of libertarian politics, explaining that he was opposed to abortion rights but would leave the issue to the states. Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon, was almost as faded a presence as Mr. Trump.Mr. Cruz, who ascended in the Republican race in part thanks to his effective debate performances, found himself absorbing the fiercest attacks yet as he looked to regain lost ground in Iowa. While Mr. Trump had often been a punching bag at past debates as moderates and rivals challenged his policy ideas, Mr. Cruz became the main target this time around, facing skeptical questions from the moderators on immigration, ethanol subsidies and his personal style.His rivals were even more severe, painting him as a holier-than-thou politician. \u201cTed, you worked for George W. Bush\u2019s campaign; you helped design George W. Bush\u2019s immigration policies,\u201d Mr. Rubio said in a rhetorical torrent. \u201cThen, when you got to the Senate, you did an interview with CBS News \u2014 it wasn\u2019t even part of the video \u2014 where you said, on the issue of people that are here illegally, we can reach a compromise.\u201dYet Mr. Rubio was also a frequent target over his past support for a comprehensive immigration overhaul. Mr. Bush, whose allies have unleashed a multimillion-dollar ad campaign attacking Mr. Rubio over his support for the overhaul, accused him of having \u201ccut and run because it wasn\u2019t popular among conservatives, I guess.\u201dMr. Rubio, referring to a book on immigration that Mr. Bush wrote and had just mentioned, quickly returned fire. \u201cThat is the book where you changed your position on immigration,\u201d he said, noting that Mr. Bush had moved from supporting a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants to favoring only a path to legal status.\u201cSo did you,\u201d Mr. Bush responded. \u201cSo did you, Marco.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s absence was mentioned repeatedly, with Mr. Bush speaking out most forcefully against him. Mr. Trump\u2019s celebrity and pugnacity had turned previous debates into widely watched spectacles that frequently descended into shouting matches, dueling insults and, in Mr. Trump\u2019s case, frequent mockery of his rivals as listless, flailing and even ugly.Megyn Kelly, the Fox News talk-show host whose participation on Thursday night was Mr. Trump\u2019s reason for skipping the event, began the questioning by noting \u201cthe elephant not in the room\u201d and lobbed a softball question to Mr. Cruz about the missing Mr. Trump. It gave him a prime opportunity at the top of the debate, when the most viewers were watching, to speak directly to Iowans with the caucuses nearly at hand. He portrayed Mr. Trump as an unserious insult artist not fit for high office.\u201cI\u2019m a maniac, and everyone on this stage is stupid, fat and ugly \u2014 and Ben, you\u2019re a terrible surgeon,\u201d Mr. Cruz said, recalling some of Mr. Trump\u2019s gibes, including his suggestion that Ben Carson, a renowned neurosurgeon, had been a mediocre physician.\u201cNow that we\u2019ve gotten the Donald Trump portion out of the way,\u201d Mr. Cruz continued, before being interrupted by laughter and applause, \u201cI want to thank everyone here for showing the men and women of Iowa the respect to show up.\u201dYet Mr. Bush mocked his Republican rivals for trying to act tough against Mr. Trump, noting that he had been the first to wrangle with Mr. Trump in last year\u2019s debates. \u201cEveryone else was in the witness protection program when I went after him,\u201d Mr. Bush said.\u201cHillary Clinton cannot win this election,\u201d Mr. Rubio said.Mr. Christie, who has not been shy about lashing his Republican rivals at past debates, also trained his fire on Mrs. Clinton as he tried to project a positive message about Republican leadership. Asked whether Mr. Cruz and Mr. Paul were qualified to be president in light of their support for curbs on the National Security Agency\u2019s surveillance practices, Mr. Christie quickly said he disagreed with their views and then moved on.\u201cLet me tell you what the country should really be worried about,\u201d Mr. Christie said, before bringing up Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email practices as secretary of state.While the concerns and values of Iowans were an ongoing motif at the Iowa Events Center here, with the debate coming four days before the caucuses, several candidates who are far behind in the polls sought to look beyond the Iowa vote. Mr. Bush brought up the needs of New Hampshire voters. Mr. Kasich, also hoping to appeal to viewers in New Hampshire as much as in Iowa, argued that he would be the best steward of the nation\u2019s economy, given his record of creating jobs and a budget surplus in his state, and even trumpeted the New Hampshire-area newspaper endorsements he had won.Mr. Paul, hoping for a surprise performance in Iowa or New Hampshire, made some of the sharpest attacks against the Republicans on the stage with him. Trying to appeal to both libertarian-leaning Republicans and the broader conservative primary electorate, Mr. Paul called a past suggestion from Mr. Rubio that the country might have to consider shutting down mosques \u201ca huge mistake,\u201d but also attacked Mr. Rubio for his support of an immigration overhaul in 2013.\u201cHe made a deal with Chuck Schumer that he would oppose any conservative amendments,\u201d Mr. Paul said, referring to a Democratic senator from New York and noting that he had tried to file an amendment to the bill. \u201cMarco can\u2019t have it both ways. You can\u2019t be in favor of defending us from radical Islam if you\u2019re not supporting border security.\u201dMr. Rubio said that Mr. Paul\u2019s amendment had been wrongheaded and added, \u201cWhen I am the president of the United States, if we don\u2019t know who you are and why you\u2019re trying to come to the United States, you\u2019re not going to get in.\u201dAfter hovering in single digits for months in Iowa, Mr. Rubio has moved into the teens in recent surveys. And his assertiveness on stage Thursday, combined with the absence of Mr. Trump and the assault on Mr. Cruz, may have offered an much-needed lift to his campaign here.Conscious of the Iowa evangelical voters still up for grabs, Mr. Rubio twice spoke emphatically about his Christianity, saying his faith would play a central role were he to be president and in another instance referring to \u201cJesus Christ, who came down to earth and died for our sins.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the candidate who tried to file an amendment to a Senate immigration bill in 2013. It was Rand Paul, not Marco Rubio.Advertisement"}

A data-driven exploration of future-ready economies.  Today, the Swedish capital is among the fastest-growing urban centers in Europe, with a population that\u2019s expected to grow 11 percent to more than 1 million by 2020. It\u2019s also a major exporter of technology, with 22,000 tech startups alone. The birthplace of Skype, Minecraft and Spotify, it has more \u201cunicorns\u201d per capita \u2014 startups valued over $1 billion \u2014 than any other region outside California\u2019s Silicon Valley.  The Stockholm metropolitan area ranked No. 9 among the 50 regions surveyed as part of the Dell Future Ready Economies Model, with higher-than-average scores in the three categories of human capital, commerce and infrastructure.  Planning and investment in education, urban development and technology have created an environment that\u2019s attracting new people, ideas and businesses. It\u2019s a virtuous cycle that\u2019s a common theme among the world\u2019s future-ready economies.  \u201cStockholm is the kind of city that we really like to point out,\u201d said Jim Diffley, senior director at HIS, which partnered with Dell to develop the rankings. \u201cYou could compare them to Silicon Valley and that type of environment. They don't get the big splashy press because of where they're located, but they have been quietly making a lot of investment and being progressive.\u201d  One area of investment is education, where teachers and school officials are investing time and money to understand what tools are the most effective, said Suss Forssman Thullberg, former head of communications at the Swedish Agency for School Improvement.  \u201cWe have a strong tradition in Sweden of innovative education,\u201d she says. \u201cIt has taken a long time to really find out from the teacher\u2019s perspective what are the tools that really make a difference.\u201d  At the Viktor Rydbergs School, for example, students are using the popular world-building game Minecraft to learn how to collaborate and build. \u201dThey\u2019re actually learning to understand each other and each other\u2019s differences,\u201d says Stina Afsenius, a teacher at the school. \u201cIt\u2019s important to include technology.\u201d  Stockholm also invested early and aggressively in the Internet. In 1994, the Swedish government announced that it would create a fiber-optic network spanning its capital city. The network now includes enough fiber to wrap around the globe 30 times. All businesses and 90 percent of homes are connected, and about 94 percent of schoolchildren have access to the Internet at school.  \u201cThey realized, very early on, what impact it could have on the city,\u201d said Niklas Agevik, chief executive of Instabridge, the world\u2019s largest crowdsourced Wi-Fi network. \u201cGrowing up in Stockholm had a huge impact on my view of technology, from having fun with it to what I\u2019m doing today \u2014 building a company out of it.\u201d Dell.com/FutureReadyEconomies Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, Xeon Phi, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Economic Turmoil Sends Ripples to Global Markets", "Date": "2016-01-07", "News": "Supported byNow, it appears to be China\u2019s turn to cause havoc far beyond its borders.China\u2019s challenges have been debated for years, but in recent months they have taken on a greater importance in the minds of investors and policy makers. China was the focus when stocks sold off sharply during the summer, and such worries have again driven global markets down in recent days.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, for instance, plunged 2.4 percent on Thursday after the Chinese currency continued to fall and trading was halted on its stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average is now trading 9.8 percent below the all-time nominal high that it reached last year.China\u2019s convulsions have come at an inopportune time. The Federal Reserve recently increased interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade, a move that appears to have intensified an exodus from riskier markets. And there are signs of weakness in the United States economy, like the manufacturing sector.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.The White House said on Thursday that it was monitoring the turbulence in the markets. \u201cObviously, we\u2019re aware of the kind of volatility that we\u2019ve seen in China over the last several days, and this has had an impact on markets in other countries, including ours,\u201d said the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest. \u201cSo that\u2019s certainly something that we\u2019re closely watching.\u201dChina is in many ways different from the United States or Europe, and its unique strengths and weaknesses are complicating efforts to assess the level of damage that the country might inflict on the rest of the world. This task is made even harder by the enmeshed nature of the world\u2019s markets and economies. Problems in one large country can transmit to other places in several ways \u2014 and they may feed on themselves as they do so.But despite this murkiness, some analysts and economists say they are becoming less optimistic that the United States will remain unscathed by China\u2019s struggles.\u201cIf things were to get really disruptive, global growth would stall to where the U.S. would be affected,\u201d said George Goncalves, a rates strategist at Nomura in New York. \u201cThese issues started percolating last year and they don\u2019t just go away because the calendar year changed.\u201dThe slowing of China\u2019s economy from historically high rates of growth has long been expected to weigh on growth elsewhere. \u201cThe China that had been growing at 10 percent for 30 years was a powerful source of fuel for much of what drove the global economy,\u201d said Stephen S. Roach, a senior fellow at the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs at Yale. The growth rate has slowed to an official figure of around 7 percent. \u201cThat\u2019s a material deceleration,\u201d Mr. Roach said.But investors have long doubted the official numbers. And they are increasingly worried that the Chinese authorities\u2019 handling of the country\u2019s challenges may set off chain reactions that hurt other markets.Much now depends on how China manages the devaluation of its currency, the renminbi. By allowing it to fall against other currencies, the Chinese authorities apparently hope to spur higher exports and reduce imports, bolstering Chinese businesses in the process.Countries devalue all the time without causing too many shock waves. But it is not clear how far the authorities want the currency to fall. \u201cMere uncertainty about where the exchange rate will ultimately be creates higher risk premiums in financial markets,\u201d said Steven Wieting, global chief investment strategist at Citigroup\u2019s private bank. \u201cThat can diminish when there is stability, but we don\u2019t have stability right now.\u201dAnd there are ways in which a Chinese devaluation could go wrong. A devaluation could end up being unsettlingly large. China, for instance, slashed the value of the renminbi in 1994, an event that investors have not forgotten.A steep drop in the renminbi could do significant harm to the real economies of other countries. A much cheaper renminbi could, for instance, make it much harder for companies in, say, Indonesia or South Korea to compete in world markets against Chinese rivals. Some countries might then slash the value of their currencies to regain competitiveness, setting off a currency war.In such a scenario, the dollar, as a safe haven currency, would most likely strengthen, creating a headwind for United States corporations that export into global markets. A stronger dollar would make imports into the United States cheaper, potentially intensifying the forces that have pushed inflation down to a level that has made the Federal Reserve nervous. \u201cInflation is now going to have a hard time rising,\u201d said Mr. Goncalves, the strategist.Fearing that the United States economy might soon sag, investors would most likely clamor for the Fed to hold off on increasing interest rates. A monthslong guessing game over monetary policy could then occur, stoking further uncertainty.Global investors might soon also have to contend with high numbers of defaults in China\u2019s corporate sector. Chinese companies have borrowed billions of dollars in recent years. As the renminbi falls, many companies may find it harder to pay back dollar debts.Most large foreign banks do not appear to be holding dangerous amounts of dollar-denominated debt owed by Chinese corporations. As a result, such banks may avoid taking the sort of losses they suffered on mortgage bonds during the 2008 financial crisis. Still, rising defaults could harm Chinese investors and banks, creating the sort of headlines that could at least cause global investors to scale back their risk-taking.Still, the current storm in the markets may pass, as it did last year.The recovery going on in the rest of the world may yet survive China\u2019s turbulence. Policy makers in Europe, Japan and the United States can always respond aggressively, as they have done in past crises. The dollar could weaken under such stimulus.And China may just be going through a necessary but bumpy adjustment, not a full-blown shakeout.China may, for instance, be able to manage a steady devaluation and absorb corporate defaults while avoiding a dangerous level of financial instability. Its government, after all, has far deeper pockets than the Europeans at the height of the Continent\u2019s crisis. And on some measures, China is still doing rather well. Growth may be slowing, but the Chinese government may ultimately care more about employment than headline growth figures, said Mr. Roach of Yale. And he noted that China\u2019s jobs numbers had been healthy in recent months. This could be a sign that China\u2019s plan to shift more of its economy away from manufacturing and toward the services sector, which creates more jobs, is bearing fruit. \u201cThe bottom line for the economy is that it\u2019s still growing fast enough to create a lot of jobs,\u201d Mr. Roach said.Gardiner Harris contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investment in Internet Start-Ups Appears to Slow in China", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s Internet companies, in recent years, have been the shining stars of growth, with Alibaba and Tencent rivaling in size some of their most formidable global competitors.Inspired by their success and driven by huge buyouts of smaller companies by China\u2019s Internet giants, investors have poured money into new start-ups.But new figures from the end of 2015 show that wave of investment may be coming to an end, or at least slowing.Among the contributors may be the Chinese Internet giants that have fueled the boom. Hiring freezes at Alibaba and Baidu have signaled recent caution about spending, according to Mark Natkin, founder of the research firm Marbridge Consulting in Beijing.\u201cA year or two ago, V.C.s felt they didn\u2019t have to drive a company all the way to I.P.O. for an exit because Baidu, Tencent and Alibaba were rolling down the aisles with their shopping carts,\u201d he said, referring to venture capital firms. He pointed out that now those firms are less focused on smaller companies, and instead are preoccupied with consolidating more mature sectors like group buying and ride-hailing apps.A looming question is how much recent market turmoil in China will affect private fund-raising in 2016. A major slowdown could dent Beijing\u2019s ambitions to continue the rapid growth of the Internet industry.In recent economic plans, the Chinese Communist Party has identified Internet-related businesses as fundamental to the transition of the Chinese economy from one centered on infrastructure investment to one based on consumer spending.Yet the drop-off in China and Asia comes amid a very different context than the drop-off in the United States. In Asia, the increase in venture capital funding rose much more sharply after 2013. Such investment in Asia jumped from just $2.8 billion in the first quarter of 2014 to $14.2 billion in the third quarter of 2015. In the fourth quarter it fell to $9.7 billion.Still, 2015 was a banner year for Asian venture capital investment, with deals totaling $39.7 billion in 2015, well above the $21.1 billion in 2014 and the meager $6.4 billion in 2013.The report said venture capital firms may be sitting out the latest investment rounds because they expect valuations to come back down to earth in the next year or two. In Asia, roughly one-third of investment in start-ups comes from large corporations, compared to just a quarter in North America.Lyndon Fung, an analyst with KPMG\u2019s U.S. capital markets group, wrote in the report that Chinese investors are also increasingly looking abroad.\u201cWe are seeing Chinese V.C. investors and V.C.-backed companies shifting their focus to invest in the international market, where things are a bit more stable, to acquire complementary technologies to strengthen their ecosystem,\u201d he wrote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Bernanke Fed Decided to Pump Billions Into the Economy", "Date": null, "News": "Advertisement\nIt was a hard-fought battle internally, with several of Mr. Bernanke\u2019s colleagues either reluctant supporters or outright opponents of the action. The bond buying also caused considerable political blowback both in the United States and abroad.As The Times reviews the hundreds of pages of transcripts, we are adding notable or revealing exchanges and nuggets here as we find them.Jean-Claude Trichet, then the president of the European Central Bank, had told Mr. Bernanke of the E.C.B.\u2019s intention to start a controversial program to intervene in markets by buying bonds, such as Greek government bonds, that private investors were dumping. But the E.C.B. would not announce it until after Europe\u2019s fiscal authorities agreed to concerted action. Still, Fed officials in the United States were briefed about a European policy action long before the public. The same meeting offered a window into the Fed\u2019s interactions with the Obama administration and Congress at a delicate time. The Europeans requested that the Fed open up \u201cliquidity swap lines\u201d to channel dollars to global banks in need. Mr. Bernanke agreed the step was justified on the merits, but did worry that it could create political blowback in Congress at a very delicate moment for the central bank. The Dodd-Frank Act, legislation intended to regulate the financial industry, was in the final stages of passage, and some proposed provisions of the law, in Mr. Bernanke\u2019s view, would have compromised Fed independence. Headlines describing the Fed as bailing out European banks would be distinctly unhelpful in that context. At the September meeting, Janet L. Yellen, the current Fed chairwoman and then the president of the San Francisco Fed, cited some novel evidence that Americans\u2019 inflation expectations were falling: A drop in the number of people doing Google searches for \u201cinflation\u201d and a rise in searches for \u201cdeflation.\u201d She emphasized during this meeting that the challenges of the domestic job market did not seem likely to change anytime soon, and that inflation was likely to remain well below the central bank\u2019s 2 percent target. Fed policy meetings are usually serious \u2014 one might even argue breathtakingly boring \u2014 affairs, full of discussion of the yield curve and terms like premia and so on. Once in awhile, a moment of levity breaks through. Sometimes it involves Lady Gaga and a meat dress. John F. Moore, a vice president of the San Francisco Fed, represented the bank at this meeting, because Ms. Yellen was the outgoing president at this point, having been named vice chairwoman of the central bank, and her successor as San Francisco Fed president had not taken office. For context, two important things happened in the fall of 2010. The San Francisco Giants won the World Series. And the singer Lady Gaga wore a dress in which her body was draped in raw flank steak to the MTV Video Music Awards. Take it away, John F. Moore. Advertisement"}

But it is also the only personal link most voters have with a candidate, and research shows it to be the most effective way to motivate them.Ms. Pollard, 58, a retired orthopedic nurse, is one of the best in the game, credited with turning out more Democratic votes in 2014 than any other volunteer in the state.On Sunday, with the temperature on her sport utility vehicle\u2019s dashboard reading minus 1, she picked up a clipboard with 37 addresses at the Clinton field office in Newton, in a former dress shop on the town square.Ms. Pollard, bundled up in a yellow ski parka, collected just two cards signed by voters committed to caucus for Mrs. Clinton on Feb. 1. Some declared their support for Mr. Sanders, but most remained on the fence.\u201cYesterday, we got four of these cards,\u201d Ms. Pollard said as she tucked the first into the dashboard. \u201cSome days, we get a ton.\u201dJobs returned, but wages have not matched the levels of a decade ago. The stresses were evident in many ways. A surprising number of the homes Ms. Pollard visited had adult children living with their parents. She repeatedly told wavering voters, \u201cNewton can\u2019t afford to have anything more taken away.\u201dMost maddening to Ms. Pollard was the resistance of voters who had not yet made up their minds, often after months of wavering. At the home above a garage of Joe McCombs, a social worker she had visited before, Ms. Pollard asked, \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m still between Hillary and Bernie,\u201d Mr. McCombs said.\u201cCan I answer any questions about Hillary?\u201d she asked Mr. McCombs.\u201cNo, I\u2019ve been reading and listening to everything,\u201d he said.Ms. Pollard told Mr. McCombs that when Gov.

She lingered in people\u2019s foyers, or even outside in a bitter wind, to the point of awkwardness. Noticing a photograph on the wall of Mr. McCombs posing on a beach, she said, \u201cThat\u2019s a great picture of you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a fake,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were on a cruise.\u201d The backdrop was painted.\u201cO.K., anything else?\u201d Mr. McCombs asked, standing in sweatpants and socks as the television played.\u201cO.K., Joe, have a good one,\u201d Ms. Pollard said as she backed out.At another home, Eileen Johnson, a grandmother, said, \u201cHillary, she gives you hope that things can be better.\u201d But after 20 minutes of conversation while Ms. Johnson\u2019s cat pawed at Ms. Pollard\u2019s legs, Ms. Johnson was no closer to a decision. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of what the good Lord wants for us, I guess,\u201d she said.Ms. Pollard has been canvassing almost every day since last spring, and the data experts for the Clinton campaign, who record every contact with voters, say she has knocked on 1,500 doors.In Iowa\u2019s midterm elections two years ago, Ms. Pollard collected more than 700 absentee ballot requests, the most of any volunteer in the state, which represented 10 percent of all the votes cast in Newton.Along with the economic struggles since Maytag\u2019s departure, Ms. Pollard sees evidence of a fraying civic fabric. Many homes now have \u201cGo Away\u201d signs, sometimes with cruder language. At a home with an enormous carved eagle in the yard, Ms. Pollard asked the woman who answered, \u201cDo you like Hillary?\u201d\u201cNope, I don\u2019t,\u201d she said.In the background, a man shouted, \u201cAnybody but Hillary Clinton.\u201dAs she drove away, Ms. Pollard said: \u201cIt\u2019s not really the Iowa way.\u201d But she was unfazed. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get rejected a few times a day,\u201d she said.Outside Jeff and Alice McKibben\u2019s home, there was a sign with the image of a rifle and the message, \u201cIf you can read this you\u2019re in range.\u201dIt was 4:30 p.m., and the temperature had dropped. Mr. McKibben invited Ms. Pollard to step out of the wind and into his garage, where tools were stored as neatly as in the garage of Clint Eastwood\u2019s character in \u201cGran Torino.\u201dMr. McKibben said firmly that he did not plan to caucus. \u201cTo tell you the truth, I wish we weren\u2019t the first in the nation,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sick of all the phone calls. I\u2019m sick of the ads.\u201dAccording to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.He had lost a $65,000-a-year job when Maytag left. He said he was once a \u201cstraight Democrat\u201d but now was an independent. He disagreed with Democrats on gun control and abortion.As Ms. Pollard urged him to take her Clinton literature, placing it on the hood of a car, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not real fond of the lady.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s got the experience,\u201d Ms. Pollard said. \u201cShe cares about people.\u201d She said the issue of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails had been distorted by her enemies.\u201cHow do I know that? I\u2019m just Joe Public,\u201d Mr. McKibben said.Since leaving Maytag, he had found work teaching welding at a state prison, but it had taken him seven years to reach the same salary he once made.Ms. Pollard pushed the Clinton flier a little closer. \u201cShe\u2019s the one who\u2019s going to help the most,\u201d she said.\u201cI did vote for her husband twice,\u201d Mr. McKibben allowed. \u201cI had more money in my pocket when he was in office.\u201d\u201cWell, consider that, will you?\u201d Ms. Pollard said, nudging the literature across the car hood.Mr. McKibben took the flier. \u201cI\u2019ll consider it,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ten Theses on Immigration", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "This is unlikely to happen; even less likely is the resignation of Angela Merkel, which I concluded the column by suggesting would be appropriate at this point. But whatever comes in Germany it\u00c2\u00a0seems very likely\u00c2\u00a0that immigration, and with it what the former National Review editor John O\u2019Sullivan calls \u201cthe national question,\u201d will dominate European and American debates for at least as long as the refugee emergency continues in the Middle East and North Africa. And since the immigration debate has long been dominated at the elite level by voices that blend an economistic view of immigration as always and everywhere a net plus\u00c2\u00a0with a cosmopolitan-utilitarian\u00c2\u00a0view of open borders (or something close) as a humanitarian obligation, it seems worth laying out some premises that I think ought to underly\u00c2\u00a0the conservative alternative to that consensus.Now to my own premises:This is true up to a point, but its logic assumes that immigrant assimilation goes reasonably well \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0that immigrants find it relatively easy to learn the language, to adapt (at least up to a point) to Western social norms, to find and hold jobs in a post-industrial economy, and that they don\u2019t simply become another set of\u00c2\u00a0 clients of the welfare state they were supposed to save. And under conditions of demographic decline the pressure to adapt\u00c2\u00a0will necessarily be weaker, because there are simply fewer natives around to define the culture into the new arrivals are expected to assimilate. (In the German case, as my column suggested, a few more years of migration at this pace could forge a rising generation in which Middle Eastern and North African immigrants are actually a near-majority.)\u00c2\u00a0In which case the odds of fragmentation and balkanization go up, because \u2026And these commonalities are a complex, in which no single variable is necessarily a trump. For instance, race and racism are obviously potentially powerful obstacles to assimilation. But as Schwarz points out, the English experience suggests that racial differences need not preclude immigrant success in cases where other cultural variables favor integration:Take a black immigrant from Jamaica in the 1950s. He\u00e2\u0080\u0094the first New Commonwealth immigrants were overwhelmingly men\u00e2\u0080\u0094was probably Anglican, likely cricket-playing, and quite possibly a wartime veteran of the British armed forces or merchant navy. Had he been schooled, he would have learned England\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history and been introduced to its literature. (Probably owing to these commonalities, today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s black Caribbean population has the highest rate of intermarriage with British whites of any minority group.) The cultural distance that separated him from a white British native was almost certainly smaller than is the chasm that today separates a white British resident of, say, Sheffield from her new neighbor, a Roma immigrant. Yet that immigrant, having almost certainly arrived from Bulgaria, Slovakia, or Romania, would be classified by UK immigration authorities as a European Union migrant\u00e2\u0080\u0094EU citizens enjoy the unfettered right to live and work in Britain\u00e2\u0080\u0094and would therefore be presumed \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhite\u00e2\u0080\u009d by researchers making extrapolations from immigration data.Likewise, immigrants whose\u00c2\u00a0ethnicity (or race or religion) looks similar on a bureaucratic spreadsheet can have very different trajectories depending on where they\u2019re actually coming from. A \u201cSouth Asian immigrant\u201d immigrant fleeing\u00c2\u00a0Idi Amin\u2019s purge of Uganda\u2019s Indian petit-bourgeoisie\u00c2\u00a0is not a \u201cSouth Asian immigrant\u201d from rural Kashmir.\u00c2\u00a0A \u201cMuslim immigrant\u201d\u00c2\u00a0from Istanbul\u00c2\u00a0is not a \u201cMuslim immigrant\u201d from eastern Syria is not a \u201cMuslim immigrant\u201d from\u00c2\u00a0Afghanistan.This dynamic applies to other ethnic groups as well. In 2007, Zhenchao Qian of Ohio State and Daniel T. Lichter of Cornell found that over the course of the 1990s, the percentage of Asians marrying whites, and Hispanics marrying whites, fell sharply, a development they attribute to rising immigration. As the size of an ethnic group increases, in-group contact and interaction increases. This in turn strengthens in-group ethnic solidarity while reducing intermarriage.This effect is particularly strong, as Schwarz notes, when marriage itself becomes a transmission belt for migrants, as it has been for many people (especially women) passing from the Muslim world to England:Two-thirds of British Muslims only mix socially with other Muslims; that portion is undoubtedly higher among Pakistanis and Bangladeshis specifically. Reinforcing this parallel life is the common practice of returning \u00e2\u0080\u009chome\u00e2\u0080\u009d for a few months every two or three years and an immersion in foreign electronic media. Integration into a wider national life is further hindered\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the retention of a deeply foreign culture is further encouraged\u00e2\u0080\u0094by the fact that most Pakistani marriages, even if one spouse is born in Britain, essentially produce first-generation-immigrant children: the one study that measured this phenomenon, conducted in the north England city of Bradford, found that 85 percent of third- and fourth-generation British Pakistani babies had a parent who was born in Pakistan. (Incidentally, that study also found that 63 percent of Pakistani mothers in Bradford had married their cousins, and 37 percent had married first cousins.)This pattern applies to economic assimilation as well: The one place\u00c2\u00a0where even the most pro-immigration\u00c2\u00a0economists generally concede\u00c2\u00a0that new immigration drags down\u00c2\u00a0low-skilled wages is among the previous cohort of immigrants. Thus the faster immigrant populations replenish themselves, the more slowly they can hope to gain ground economically relative to natives.When critics of open immigration raise this point, the rebuttal is often that well, the immigrants themselves tend to favor more immigration, so we should defer to their ethnic solidarity rather than trying to impose our view of their economic best interests. But deferring to their ethnic solidarity is a good way to ensure that assimilation happens very slowly, because \u00e2\u0080\u00a6Now, though, there is a palpable sense in the liberal circles that in the ideal society everyone would be a true citizen of the world, a dilettante of culture and religion, equally comfortable around neighbors of any race or faith or background, with no unchosen preferences or loyalties.But how much caution depends on context, and here it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to stress that \u00e2\u0080\u00a6We also aren\u2019t just a narrow sea away from\u00c2\u00a0an array of broken, chaotic, fundamentalism-ravaged societies,\u00c2\u00a0and we don\u2019t face the kind of demographic mismatch with Latin America that Europe faces with Africa. Immigration enthusiasts on the right often overstate and oversentimentalize the \u201cCatholic values\u201d that Latin American migrants share with religious conservatives in the U.S., but there is no question, none, that much of Latin America has more in common culturally with the contemporary U.S. than the Iraqi hinterland has in common with contemporary England \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or at least the parts of England that haven\u2019t become, as Schwarz puts it, \u201cmetaphorical foreign encampments\u201d within a late-modern society.So while we should be guided, no less than Europe, by a greater prudence than our leadership has shown to date, we should also recognize that what is (for Germany especially) now a crisis Over There remains as yet an opportunity for us.FollowAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "San Francisco Office Rents Pass Manhattan as Most Expensive in Country", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "Move over Manhattan: Office rents in San Francisco have eclipsed those in New York\u2019s costliest borough as the most expensive in the country.   A combination of the booming technology sector and tight supply of commercial real estate propelled average office rents that San Francisco landlords are asking for to $72.26 a square foot in the fourth quarter of last year, edging out the $71.85 a square foot in Manhattan, according to a new report from CBRE Group, a commercial real estate services and investment firm. The prices in San Francisco rose 14 percent last year, compared with 7 percent in Manhattan. Not since the original Internet gold rush more than a decade and a half ago has the price of office space in San Francisco surpassed that of Manhattan, long the country\u2019s most expensive commercial market. San Francisco\u2019s supremacy back then proved short-lived, as the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2000 wiped out many start-ups. The era of social media and sharing economy companies has brought a flood of technology companies back to San Francisco, including icons like Twitter, Uber and Airbnb. Yet evidence of a more cataclysmic shakeout in tech hasn\u2019t materialized yet, and until it does, the commercial real estate market is likely to keep humming along. In a phone interview, Colin Yasukochi, director of research and analysis at CBRE, said about 29 percent of the occupied office space in San Francisco is filled with tech tenants, around double the percentage back during the height of the first dot-com boom. The growth in the tech sector overshadows all else in the city.    \u201cThe market here in San Francisco has been largely driven by the tech industry, which has really been one of the growth leaders coming out of the recession,\u201d Mr. Yasukochi said. \u201cManhattan is more dominated by financial services firms who were not on that same growth trajectory coming out of the recession.\u201d Patrick Llewellyn, the chief executive and president of the company, said many of the start-up\u2019s employees lived in the East Bay, where Oakland is located, and the company was able to find a far better space in the city\u2019s Uptown neighborhood than it could in San Francisco. He said 99Designs could have afforded to pay the higher office rents in San Francisco, but the terms were onerous.  \u201cLandlords are demanding seven-year leases at minimums,\u201d Mr. Llewellyn said. \u201cIn the fast-moving landscape that is the start-up business, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a long, long time.\u201dIt\u2019s important to note that CBRE\u2019s rankings are based on average rents, and one of the unique characteristics of the San Francisco commercial real estate market is how little variation there is between office prices in upscale and less-upscale neighborhoods, compared with markets like Manhattan.  Mr. Yasukochi attributes that to a more flexible attitude toward workplaces among technology start-ups, which tend to be more concerned about space for bicycle parking and dog play areas than striking views.  In nearby Silicon Valley, there is also far greater variation in commercial rents than in San Francisco. The average rent in Silicon Valley as a whole is $52.92 a square foot, according to CBRE, significantly less than the average in San Francisco. But that figure encompasses towns like Milpitas, at around $20 a square foot, and the chic streets of Palo Alto, near the epicenter of venture capital and Stanford University, where the average office rent is about $100 a square foot. The chart-topping office rents in San Francisco are also a testament to the city\u2019s geographic constraints, crammed as it is into 47 square miles at the top of a peninsula. The technology scene to the south in the sprawl of Silicon Valley is now and will most likely remain far bigger. Of the 172 million square feet of office space in the Bay Area occupied by technology companies, only about 13 percent is in San Francisco, with around 73 percent of it in Silicon Valley, CBRE estimates.

{"Headline": "In the Birthplace of Pizza, Pollution Rules for Ovens Spur Outrage", "Date": "2016-01-07", "News": "Supported bySAN VITALIANO, Italy \u2014 If there is one label that Antonio Falcone, a doctor turned civic leader, does not want to be known by, it is \u201cthe anti-pizza mayor.\u201dYet that is how notoriety caught up with the mayor of this small town in the Neapolitan hinterland in late December when, in an effort to decrease air pollution, he issued an ordinance banning the use of wood-fired stoves not equipped with filters that reduce toxic air pollutants.The ban affects family homes with chimneys as well as businesses like bakeries, restaurants and \u2014 most controversially \u2014 wood-burning pizzerias, the gastronomic boast of an area known as the birthplace of one of Italy\u2019s most renowned culinary exports. Outrage was guaranteed.\u201cWe\u2019ve even been compared to China,\u201d complained Pasquale Tufano of Ristorante La Vigna, piqued that the town\u2019s half-dozen pizzerias had been singled out and equated with a country whose capital, Beijing, announced its first-ever toxic smog red alert last month.The mayor here was attacked on social media. There were public protests and calls for his resignation.\u201cI became the anti-pizza mayor,\u201d said Mr. Falcone, adding that he acted only in San Vitaliano\u2019s best interests. \u201cI am responsible for the health of the citizens of this town. We had to start somewhere.\u201dIn fact, Mr. Falcone was one of dozens of Italian mayors who adopted emergency measures last month after a prolonged dry spell repeatedly pushed air pollutants beyond legal limits.Rome, which has been trying to reduce car emissions to help clean the air, restricted driving to days based on the odd or even numbers at the end of license plates. Milan banned all traffic for three consecutive days, to little effect. Milan and other cities even banned fireworks on New Year\u2019s Eve.Italy is one of the worst countries in Europe for air quality. The country has a heavily industrialized north, poorly maintained private furnaces, growing traffic congestion, widespread use of diesel fuel and years of neglectful spending on infrastructure for freight trains and public transportation, environmentalists say. Even the geography hurts Italy, with its mountains and valleys preventing much-needed air circulation.A 2015 government study found that some 30,000 Italians died as a result of air pollution each year.As pollution levels rose this winter, and municipalities imposed bans on sources of pollution, the nation\u2019s environment minister held an emergency meeting in Rome with representatives of Italy\u2019s regions and municipalities.The group proposed turning down thermostats in homes and offices, reducing city speed limits, scrapping older cars, encouraging public transportation and limiting the use of chimneys. But none of the measures were legally binding, and short of a nationally integrated approach to fighting pollution \u2014 Italy currently lacks one \u2014 the responsibility falls to mayors like Mr. Falcone.The local ordinance gives pizzerias and other businesses until Feb. 29 to equip their ovens with appropriate filters. Starting March 1, inspectors will begin making their rounds.\u201cWe\u2019re giving them time to prepare themselves. It\u2019s a question of civility,\u201d said Tulliano Carpino, who heads the town\u2019s technical department.Let the inspectors come, said a defiant Giovanni Arricchiello, the owner of Il Cavallino restaurant, which is along the long strip mall along one edge of San Vitaliano.Like other local pizza makers, Mr. Arricchiello already has pollution filters on his ovens, so the ordinance should not affect them.\u201cYou can\u2019t get a restaurant license without them,\u201d he said of the filters, producing a folder containing a photo of his high-tech one, as well as the restaurant\u2019s annual maintenance records. The vast majority of San Vitaliano\u2019s pizzerias say they have the proper filters in place.Pizza ovens aside, Mr. Falcone said the main causes of San Vitaliano\u2019s air pollution remained a mystery. Traffic can be intense, but the town, about 15 miles northeast of Naples, is quite small, he said, and there are no major industries.The town, however, abuts a highway cloverleaf, and is part of the densely populated Naples area, in a region known for illegal incineration of toxic waste by organized crime.Vincenzo Russo, the council member responsible for the environment, proposed that cheap, chemically treated pellets used in stoves and boilers might be a culprit.San Vitaliano\u2019s leaders, he said, have also begun a study with the nearby University of Naples Federico II to determine \u2014 among other possible causes \u2014 what impact a waste-to-energy plant in Acerra, a town less than 12 miles away, might be having on its neighbor.\u201cBut the message that has gotten through is that the mayor is anti-pizza,\u201d Mr. Russo said.When Mr. Falcone called for a meeting with representatives from neighboring cities to discuss the pollution issue, only two midlevel administrators showed up, he said.Locals say they have been wrongly singled out and are being punished because San Vitaliano is the only town in the area that has an air quality monitor, which became operational about a year ago.\u201cPollution is a real problem for all the area, but we\u2019ve got the only monitor, so we got caught in the crossfire,\u201d said Mr. Tufano, whose pizzeria, La Vigna, is equipped with filters.He said that he spent the better part of the last two weeks reassuring customers that his pizzeria had not been shut down.\u201cI had to explain that we\u2019ve got all our papers in order,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anything, I told them that they should not light their chimneys.\u201dRains that have swept through Italy since the beginning of the year have reduced pollution levels and could help sweep the problem away, as they have in the past.\u201cWe\u2019re the first people who enjoy pizza, but the question is bigger. There\u2019s an anthropological disaster in play,\u201d said Mr. Falcone, standing by his ordinance. \u201cThe important thing is to make people aware and sensitive.\u201dBut some experts and environmentalists, while supportive of the measures proposed by the Italian government, remained skeptical that they would do much good without a more concerted national effort.\u201cWe need to decarbonize our society, that\u2019s what it comes down to, to invest in a real green economy,\u201d said Nicola Pirrone, director of the Institute of Atmospheric Pollution Research at Italy\u2019s National Research Council. \u201cWe still don\u2019t have a long-term strategic vision.\u201dPizza makers scoffed, too, in light of the rather obvious fact that polluted air moves, and complained that the ordinance would do little good if it applied only to San Vitaliano, barely a blip within the large Naples metropolitan area.\u201cWhat are the other mayors doing? They\u2019re pretending like nothing is happening,\u201d said Antonio Mercadante, a local baker who said his ovens passed muster.He understood why the mayor had issued the ordinance, but unless other towns took measures, the baker added, \u201cit\u2019s just a joke.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The company told the magazine that it was involved in a dispute with the government over a public works contract and was seeking Mr. Amari\u2019s help in settling the matter in its favor.Mr. Amari said little else about the allegations at the news conference but promised to provide more details \u201cwithin a week, after confirming my memories.\u201d He said that he had no plans to resign and that Mr. Abe had encouraged him to \u201cfocus on my job.\u201dFunding scandals are a recurring problem in Japanese politics, and Mr. Abe has lost several cabinet ministers to them in the past.

The issue was related to the disposal of industrial waste at a public works site in Chiba Prefecture, northeast of Tokyo.But Ms. Marukawa said the aide was merely seeking information about the case and did not try to influence its outcome.The minister of land, infrastructure, transport and tourism, Keiichi Ishii, said his ministry was examining allegations in the Shukan Bunshun report that the construction company, which the magazine did not identify by name, used Mr. Amari\u2019s office as a conduit to pass gift certificates to ministry officials with jurisdiction over other aspects of the case.\u201cI honestly had no idea what my secretaries were doing,\u201d Mr. Amari said.The opposition condemned Mr. Amari\u2019s response to the accusations as inadequate.\u201cHe hasn\u2019t provided a single explanation,\u201d Yoshiaki Takaki, a senior official of the Democratic Party of Japan, the largest opposition group, said in Parliament.Members of the opposition walked out of Parliament before a previously scheduled address by Mr. Amari on Friday.Makiko Inoue contributed reporting from Tokyo.Advertisement"}

When his rich father (Jeffrey DeMunn) tries to negotiate a house-arrest arrangement for an old family friend convicted of insider trading, Rhoades faces an early test of his resolve \u2014 one that he passes with flying colors. But Rhoades\u2019s prosecutorial zeal has its limits: His 81-0 record on financial cases speaks less to his skill than to his pragmatism. Victory must be assured.There\u2019s another reason Rhoades doesn\u2019t want the case: His wife, Wendy (Maggie Siff), has worked for Axe Capital for years as an in-house psychiatrist for Axe\u2019s team of stress-fried brokers. It\u2019s a job that represents \u201cBillions\u201d as its most deliriously and deliciously absurd, revealed in a therapy session that starts with a suit moping his declining profits and ends with Wendy pumping him up like a trade-floor evangelist or a college football coach at halftime. The session is not about restoring his mental health; it\u2019s about bringing his testosterone level back to performance level, like Viagra for the psyche. She\u2019s a complicated figure, but in this first hour, Wendy\u2019s hyper-aggression so uncannily resembles her boss\u2019s that she\u2019s like Axe\u2019s surrogate at home, too, squashing Rhoades\u2019s ineffectual suggestion that she look for work elsewhere. The reveal that she\u2019s her husband\u2019s dominatrix is funny, but not surprising.Bulls and Bears: \u2022 Mr. Koppelman, Mr. Levien and Mr. Sorkin don\u2019t go light on the stylized dialogue. The language is as entertainingly robust as their characters are outsize, even if some of the metaphors don\u2019t land. Plenty of contenders for line of the night, but my favorite is a bit of encouragement Axe gives a reporter: \u201cYou do an autopsy on the deal, you\u2019ll find yourself a Pulitzer in the carcass.\u201d)\u2022 Conceiving Axe and his wife, Lara (Malin Akerman), as self-starters from humble stock is a little neat in light of Rhoades\u2019s family wealth, but it accounts for their two-fisted style. Details like Axe\u2019s affection for his childhood pizza place and a shot of him eating a White Castle burger at his desk shows that he can only stray so far from his roots. As for Lara, her chat with the disgruntled widow of a former partner who died on 9/11 lifts the veil off the veiled threat.\u2022 \u201cBillions\u201d is only just starting to get into 9/11, which spared Axe but left the other partners dead. A widow complaining that she had to sell their yacht doesn\u2019t draw much sympathy, but there\u2019s some suggestion that Axe\u2019s philanthropic mission masks a more sinister agenda.\u2022 At the Axelrod dinner table, the kids get lesson in the art of the con.\u2022 The push-and-pull between Rhoades\u2019s conscience and his ego will play out all season, but the scene where he refuses a backroom deal for a white-collar criminal is a rousing show of principle. \u201cIt\u2019s the type of deal that\u2019s been made in this library many times,\u201d Rhoades says. \u201cBy my predecessors.\u201d His resistance stands to weaken.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Retreats, Start-Ups Find a Way to Recharge Workers\u2019 Batteries", "Date": "2016-01-11", "News": "Supported byItinerariesJoshua Reeves, the co-founder and chief executive at the payroll and benefits management start-up Gusto, rented a house for a week in 2013 with his roughly 10 colleagues for what he called a \u201cworkation.\u201dOne part reward for the long hours they worked, one part brainstorming marathon, the retreat allowed the group to cook together, hike and plan the fledgling company\u2019s next steps.\u201cThe two main goals we had were to bring the team together, take a step back and have a chance for community time and connection,\u201d Mr. Reeves said. \u201cPhysically going somewhere else can actually be a great catalyst for introspection.\u201dAlthough Gusto now has 300 employees in San Francisco and Denver, retreats are still part of the company culture. Recently, its human resources department took a four-day trip to Los Angeles that included a trip to Disneyland to observe and gather ideas for how to scale up their operations. Staff members from both of the company\u2019s offices attended.\u201cWe really love the time we\u2019ve spent on retreats,\u201d Mr. Reeves said.Today, companies not generally given to embracing start-up corporate culture are finding retreats to be an effective way to accomplish seemingly conflicting goals: Getting people to relax and to work harder. And hotels have been eager to accommodate companies\u2019 increased willingness to reward hard work with off-site getaways.\u201cOver the last 18 months, we\u2019ve been seeing a really encouraging uptick,\u201d said Alison Taylor, senior vice president of global sales at Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, which has had an approximately 12 percent increase, year-over-year, in reward and incentive travel, including retreats.And by all accounts, that business is growing \u2014 especially among younger workers. \u201cWe definitely have seen the reinvestment of corporations back into those,\u201d said David Peckinpaugh, president of Maritz Travel Company and Experient. \u201cWe saw, in particular, from 2014 to 2015, a significant spike,\u201d he said. Last year, he said, his company had roughly 30 percent more corporate incentive programs.\u201cI think we typically see it as synonymous with a growing economy,\u201d said Andrew Flack, vice president for global marketing at Hilton Worldwide, where requests for corporate retreat bookings have increased by a double-digit percentage. \u201cAlso, companies in particular are looking for how to sustain growth, and that\u2019s a lot of what they talk about.\u201dThe trend dovetails with a push in human resources management to reward more while paying less. \u201cI\u2019m seeing more off-sites that fall under the category of culture-building and team-building,\u201d said Paul McDonald, senior executive director at the recruiting firm Robert Half.Although Labor Department data show wages slowly creeping up, many companies see an advantage to giving employees bonuses or other rewards because this lets them avoid adding a fixed amount to their bottom line, as pay raises would.Still, even as companies try to hold the line on pay, the labor market has tightened sufficiently, especially in some high-tech and professional services fields, that companies recognize the need to keep employees happy as well as hardworking.\u201cI think the most important thing that corporate America has found is that they need their employees to perform,\u201d said Christine Lawson, senior vice president of sales and catering at Kimpton Hotels & Restaurants. \u201cThey understand that engagement is absolutely essential to their productivity.\u201dMs. Lawson said more than half of her brand\u2019s corporate business, which is up roughly 10 percent year-over-year, consisted of retreats.As retreats grow in popularity, traditional incentive programs are incorporating more retreatlike elements even as they expand beyond perks for top sales executives or dealers.\u201cIncentives are being opened up,\u201d Ms. Taylor said. \u201cThe incentive business has morphed now to be about community.\u201d Hotel companies welcome the broader scope of the programs because that means more business for them.Another change is the incorporation of brainstorming or high-level strategy sessions among the recreation and bonding activities. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing either a half-day or a full-day working session,\u201d said Mark Sergot, senior vice president for global sales at FRHI Hotels & Resorts. Like many other aspects of both corporate culture and business travel, the growth of retreats and the evolution of incentives are being driven by Generation Y, people like Mr. Reeves of Gusto: young and with the mentality of a Silicon Valley start-up.\u201cThey really like to feel like they\u2019re part of something, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing the increase,\u201d Mr. McDonald said. \u201cMillennials expect that,\u201d Ms. Taylor said. \u201cThey want to have that interaction with the C-level executives, and incentives are a very nice way to do that, to make them feel included.\u201dMs. Lawson of Kimpton said the brand, which is based in San Francisco, has a long history of catering to the high-tech industry\u2019s casual, quirky meeting style.\u201cTech has always come into our hotels in jeans and T-shirts and wanted their room to have beanbags and couches,\u201d she said. Only recently, she said, have other industries started following suit \u2014 forgoing the suits and boardroom presentations for more intense but more intimate sessions of brainstorming or strategizing.\u201cGenerally, we don\u2019t see boardroom-type retreats anymore,\u201d Mr. Sergot said. While this might be new territory for groups in buttoned-up fields like insurance, professional and financial services, even start-ups can take time to get the hang of the laid-back retreat. At Gusto\u2019s first retreat in 2013, Mr. Reeves recalled bringing in the components of workstations: desks, tables, PC monitors. They went unused.\u201cAs it turned out, everybody spent the whole week on the couches with their legs up,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s Lead Over Bernie Sanders Slipping in New Poll", "Date": "2016-01-12", "News": "Supported byYet more than 7 in 10 Democratic voters \u2014 including most supporters of Mr. Sanders \u2014 still believe Mrs. Clinton will ultimately win the party\u2019s nomination. Voters expressed deeper confidence in her ability to be an effective commander in chief and more of her supporters say their minds are made up compared with Mr. Sanders\u2019s backers.Mr. Sanders\u2019s shifting fortunes underscore the unsettled state of the presidential race in both parties with just three weeks before the Iowa caucuses. Previous contests have seen candidates rise and fall in the weeks before the first votes are cast, and national polls at this stage of the race are not necessarily predictive of the final outcome of the monthslong nominating battle. But Mr. Sanders\u2019s surge has clearly unnerved the Clinton campaign, and she is responding aggressively.\u201cI like Bernie\u2019s sincerity,\u201d Dalton Paget, 27, an insurance agent from Spokane, Wash., said in a follow-up interview. \u201cHe\u2019s talking about working towards policies that he\u2019s been championing for a long time.\u201dIn particular, Mr. Paget cited Mr. Sanders\u2019s advocacy of overhauling the campaign finance system. \u201cHonestly, before I heard much about Bernie Sanders and realized he had a decent chance for winning, I might have supported Hillary,\u201d he said.Republican and Democratic primary voters give their opinions on the candidates.Only about a third of Republican primary voters who back a candidate say their minds are made up. But most Trump supporters \u2014 52 percent \u2014 say they have decided. A narrow majority of Republican primary voters say they expect Mr. Trump to be the party\u2019s nominee, similar to the finding of last month\u2019s poll.Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz run closely among very conservative voters, but Mr. Trump now leads among evangelicals 42 percent to 25 percent.\u201cI think he\u2019s going to try to do what\u2019s best for the working man,\u201d said Kevin Jarrell, 41, from Proctorville, Ohio, who said he was a born-again Christian. \u201cHe\u2019s got money so he\u2019s not going to try to do what\u2019s best for him. He\u2019s going to try his best to create jobs and he\u2019s going to shut out the refugees.\u201dBut Mr. Trump trails his top two rivals on whether he possesses the right kind of temperament and personality to be a good president. Half of Republican primary voters say he does, while about two-thirds say so of Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio.The latest New York Times/CBS News national poll finds a significant narrowing of the race for the Democratic nomination while Donald Trump maintains his sizable lead among Republican primary voters.The generational divide on the Democratic side was more pronounced than even the split among voters of differing political ideology. In addition to his strong support among younger voters, Mr. Sanders, who describes himself as a democratic socialist, is backed by 55 percent of liberals, compared with 40 percent who support Mrs. Clinton.Mrs. Clinton is boosted by older voters, who favor her by an even larger margin than younger voters favor Mr. Sanders. She fares better with moderates than Mr. Sanders does; 51 percent support her, while 33 percent back Mr. Sanders.She also holds a double-digit lead among female voters, but the race is closer among men \u2014 45 percent back Mr. Sanders, compared with 40 percent for Mrs. Clinton.\u201cI like the way he says the economy should be run,\u201d said Jerry Auguste, 28, of Brooklyn, who works in retail. He said he was more with Mrs. Clinton at first, but has been leaning toward Mr. Sanders in the past month or so, \u201cmainly because I\u2019ve heard more of what he\u2019s been saying about the economy and climate.\u201dAbout as many Democratic primary voters say Mr. Sanders shares their values as say Mrs. Clinton does. But Mrs. Clinton, who served as secretary of state in Mr. Obama\u2019s administration, holds an edge in an important area: Some Democratic voters seem to have an easier time envisioning her in the White House.More than 4 in 10 say they are very confident in her ability to be an effective commander in chief of the nation\u2019s military, compared with just over 2 in 10 who are very confident in Mr. Sanders\u2019s ability.\u201cAs far as commander in chief goes, she\u2019s been there, she knows what\u2019s been going on, and she would be effective,\u201d said Leona H. Alford, 81, a retiree from Brown Deer, Wis., who worked in social services.Likewise, about 8 in 10 Democratic primary voters say Mrs. Clinton has the right kind of temperament and personality to be a good president, compared with two-thirds who say Mr. Sanders does.About 3 in 10 say his involvement in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign makes them likelier to support her, though two-thirds said it does not make a difference.The national Times/CBS News poll, conducted Jan. 7 through 10 on cellphones and landlines, included 442 Republican primary voters and 389 Democratic primary voters. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 6 points for both Democratic and Republican primary voters.Marina Stefan, Megan Thee-Brenan and Giovanni Russonello contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Transcript of Obama\u2019s 2016 State of the Union Address", "Date": "2016-01-12", "News": "Supported byOBAMA: Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, my fellow Americans: tonight marks the eighth year that I\u2019ve come here to report on the state of the Union. And for this final one, I\u2019m going to try to make it a little shorter. (APPLAUSE)I know some of you are antsy to get back to Iowa.(LAUGHTER)I\u2019ve been there. I\u2019ll be shaking hands afterwards if you want some tips.Now, I understand that because it\u2019s an election season, expectations for what we will achieve this year are low. But, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the constructive approach that you and other leaders took at the end of last year to pass a budget and make tax cuts permanent for working families.So I hope we can work together this year on some bipartisan priorities like criminal justice reform, and helping...(APPLAUSE)... and helping people who are battling prescription drug abuse and heroin abuse.(APPLAUSE)So who knows. We might surprise the cynics again.But tonight, I want to go easy on the traditional list of proposals for the year ahead. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got plenty, from helping students learn to write computer code to personalizing medical treatments for patients.And I will keep pushing for progress on the work that I believe still needs to be done: fixing a broken immigration system...(APPLAUSE)... protecting our kids from gun violence, equal pay for equal work, paid leave, raising the minimum wage.(APPLAUSE)All these things \u2014 all these things still matter to hardworking families. They\u2019re still the right thing to do, and I won\u2019t let up until they get done. But for my final address to this chamber, I don\u2019t want to just talk about next year. I want to focus on the next five years, the next ten years and beyond. I want to focus on our future.We live in a time of extraordinary change \u2014 change that\u2019s reshaping the way we live, the way we work, our planet, our place in the world. It\u2019s change that promises amazing medical breakthroughs, but also economic disruptions that strain working families.It promises education for girls in the most remote villages, but also connects terrorists, plotting an ocean away. It\u2019s change that can broaden opportunity, or widen inequality. And whether we like it or not, the pace of this change will only accelerate.America has been through big changes before \u2014 wars and depression, the influx of new immigrants, workers fighting for a fair deal, movements to expand civil rights.Each time, there have been those who told us to fear the future, who claimed we could slam the brakes on change, who promised to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening America under control. And each time, we overcame those fears.We did not, in the words of Lincoln, adhere to the dogmas of the quiet past. Instead we thought anew and acted anew.We made change work for us, always extending America\u2019s promise outward, to the next frontier, to more people. And because we did, because we saw opportunity where others saw peril, we emerged stronger and better than before.What was true then can be true now. Our unique strengths as a nation \u2014 our optimism and work ethic, our spirit of discovery, our diversity, our commitment to rule of law \u2014 these things give us everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generations to come.In fact, it\u2019s in that spirit that we have made the progress these past seven years. That\u2019s how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in generations.(APPLAUSE)That\u2019s how we reformed our health care system and reinvented our energy sector.(APPLAUSE)That\u2019s how \u2014 that\u2019s how we \u2014 that\u2019s how we delivered more care and benefits to our troops coming home and our veterans.(APPLAUSE)That\u2019s how we \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s how we secured the freedom in every state to marry the person we love.(APPLAUSE)But such progress is not inevitable. It\u2019s the result of choices we make together. And we face such choices right now. Will we respond to the changes of our time with fear, turning inward as a nation, turning against each other as a people? Or will we face the future with confidence in who we are, in what we stand for, and the incredible things we can do together? So let\u2019s talk about the future, and four big questions that I believe we as a country have to answer, regardless of who the next president is or who controls the next Congress.First, how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy?(APPLAUSE)Second, how do we make technology work for us, and not against us, especially when it comes to solving urgent challenges like climate change?(APPLAUSE)Third, how do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman?(APPLAUSE)And finally, how can we make our politics reflect what\u2019s best in us, and not what\u2019s worst?(APPLAUSE)Let me start with the economy and a basic fact. The United States of America, right now, has the strongest, most durable economy in the world.(APPLAUSE)We\u2019re in the middle of the longest streak of private-sector job creation in history.More than 14 million new jobs, the strongest two years of job growth since the 1990s, an unemployment rate cut in half. Our auto industry just had its best year ever.(APPLAUSE)That\u2019s just part of a manufacturing surge that\u2019s created nearly 900,000 new jobs in the past six years. And we\u2019ve done all this while cutting our deficits by almost three-quarters.(APPLAUSE)Anyone claiming that America\u2019s economy is in decline is peddling fiction. Now...(APPLAUSE)What is true \u2014 and the reason that a lot of Americans feel anxious \u2014 is that the economy has been changing in profound ways, changes that started long before the Great Recession hit, changes that have not let up. Today, technology doesn\u2019t just replace jobs on the assembly line, but any job where work can be automated. Companies in a global economy can locate anywhere, and they face tougher competition.As a result, workers have less leverage for a raise. Companies have less loyalty to their communities. And more and more wealth and income is concentrated at the very top.All these trends have squeezed workers, even when they have jobs, even when the economy is growing. It\u2019s made it harder for a hardworking family to pull itself out of poverty, harder for young people to start their careers, tougher for workers to retire when they want to. And although none of these trends are unique to America, they do offend our uniquely American belief that everybody who works hard should get a fair shot.For the past seven years, our goal has been a growing economy that also works better for everybody. We\u2019ve made progress, but we need to make more. And despite all the political arguments that we\u2019ve had these past few years, there are actually some areas where Americans broadly agree.We agree that real opportunity requires every American to get the education and training they need to land a good-paying job. The bipartisan reform of No Child Left Behind was an important start, and together, we\u2019ve increased early childhood education, lifted high school graduation rates to new highs, boosted graduates in fields like engineering.In the coming years, we should build on that progress, by providing Pre-K for all and offering every student...(APPLAUSE)... offering every student the hands-on computer science and math classes that make them job-ready on day one. We should recruit and support more great teachers for our kids.(APPLAUSE)And \u2014 and we have to make college affordable for every American.(APPLAUSE)No hardworking student should be stuck in the red. We\u2019ve already reduced student loan payments by \u2014 to 10 percent of a borrower\u2019s income. And that\u2019s good. But now we\u2019ve actually got to cut the cost of college.(APPLAUSE)Providing two years of community college at no cost for every responsible student is one of the best ways to do that, and I\u2019m going to keep fighting to get that started this year. It\u2019s the right thing to do.(APPLAUSE)But a great education isn\u2019t all we need in this new economy. We also need benefits, and protections that provide a basic measure of security. It\u2019s not too much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in America who are going to work the same job, in the same place with a health, and a retirement package for 30 years are sitting in this chamber. For everyone else, especially folks in their 40\u2019s and 50\u2019s, saving for retirement, or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher. Americans understand that at some point in their careers, in this new economy, they may have to retool, they may have to retrain, but they shouldn\u2019t lose what they\u2019ve already worked so hard to build in the process.That\u2019s why Social Security and Medicare are more important than ever, we shouldn\u2019t weaken them, we should strengthen them.(APPLAUSE)And for American short of retirement, basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today.That, by the way, is what the Affordable Care Act is all about. It\u2019s about filling the gaps in employer based care so that when you lose a job, or you go back to school, or you strike out and launch that new business you\u2019ll still have coverage. Nearly 18 million people have gained coverage so far, and in the process...(APPLAUSE)In the process health care inflation has slowed, our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law.Now, I\u2019m guessing we won\u2019t agree on health care anytime soon.(APPLAUSE)A little applause right there.(LAUGHTER)Just a guess.But there should be other ways parties can work together improve economic security. Say a hardworking American loses his job, we shouldn\u2019t just make sure he can get unemployment insurance; we should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business that\u2019s ready to hire him. If that new job doesn\u2019t pay as much, there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills. And even if he\u2019s going from job to job, he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him. That\u2019s the way we make the new economy work better for everybody.I also know Speaker Ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty. America is about giving everybody willing to work a chance, a hand up, and I\u2019d welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support, like expanding tax cuts for low-income workers who don\u2019t have children.(APPLAUSE)But there are some areas where we just have to be honest. It has been more difficult to find agreement over the last seven years, and a lot of them fall under the category of what role the government should play in making sure the system\u2019s not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest corporations.(APPLAUSE)And it\u2019s an honest disagreement. And, the American people have a choice to make.I believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy. I think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed, there is red tape that needs to be cut.(APPLAUSE)There you go. Yes.(APPLAUSE)See?But after years of record corporate profits, working families won\u2019t get more opportunity or bigger paychecks just by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules at everybody else\u2019s expense.(APPLAUSE)Middle-class families are not going to feel more secure because we allowed attacks on collective bargaining to go unanswered. Food Stamp recipients did not cause the financial crisis; recklessness on Wall Street did.(APPLAUSE)Immigrants aren\u2019t the principal reason wages haven\u2019t gone up. Those decisions are made in the boardrooms that all too often put quarterly earnings over long-term returns. It\u2019s sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts.(APPLAUSE)The point is, I believe, that in this new economy, workers and start-ups and small businesses need more of a voice, not less. The rules should work for them. And...(APPLAUSE)... I\u2019m not alone in this. This year, I plan to lift up the many businesses who\u2019ve figured out that doing right by their workers or their customers or their communities ends up being good for their shareholders...(APPLAUSE)... and I want to spread those best practices across America. That\u2019s part of a brighter future. In fact, it turns out many of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative.And this brings me to the second big question we as a country have to answer: how do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our biggest challenges?Sixty years ago, when the Russians beat us into space, we didn\u2019t deny Sputnik was up there.(LAUGHTER)We didn\u2019t argue about the science, or shrink our research and development budget. We built a space program almost overnight, and twelve years later, we were walking on the moon. (APPLAUSE)Now, that spirit of discovery is in our DNA. America is Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers and George Washington Carver. America is Grace Hopper and Katherine Johnson and Sally Ride. America is every immigrant and entrepreneur from Boston to Austin to Silicon Valley racing to shape a better future.(APPLAUSE)That\u2019s who we are, and over the past seven years, we\u2019ve nurtured that spirit. We\u2019ve protected an open Internet, and taken bold new steps to get more students and low-income Americans online.(APPLAUSE)We\u2019ve launched next-generation manufacturing hubs and online tools that give an entrepreneur everything he or she needs to start a business in a single day. But we can do so much more.You know, last year, Vice President Biden said that, with a new moon-shot, America can cure cancer. Last month, he worked with this Congress to give scientists at the National Institutes of Health the strongest resources that they\u2019ve had in over a decade.(APPLAUSE)Well, so \u2014 so tonight, I\u2019m announcing a new national effort to get it done. And because he\u2019s gone to the mat for all of us on so many issues over the past 40 years, I\u2019m putting Joe in charge of mission control.(APPLAUSE)For the loved ones we\u2019ve all lost, for the families that we can still save, let\u2019s make America the country that cures cancer once and for all. What do you think? Let\u2019s make it happen.(APPLAUSE)And medical research is critical. We need the same level of commitment when it comes to developing clean energy sources.(APPLAUSE)Look, if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change, have at it. You will be pretty lonely because you\u2019ll be debating our military, most of America\u2019s business leaders, the majority of the American people, almost the entire scientific community, and 200 nations around the world who agree it\u2019s a problem and intend to solve it.(APPLAUSE)But even if \u2014 even if the planet wasn\u2019t at stake, even if 2014 wasn\u2019t the warmest year on record until 2015 turned out even hotter \u2014 why would we want to pass up the chance for American businesses to produce and sell the energy of the future?(APPLAUSE)Listen, seven years ago, we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history. Here are the results. In fields from Iowa to Texas, wind power is now cheaper than dirtier, conventional power. On rooftops from Arizona to New York, solar is saving Americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their energy bills and employs more Americans than coal \u2014 in jobs that pay better than average.We\u2019re taking steps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and store their own energy \u2014 something, by the way, that environmentalists and Tea Partiers have teamed up to support. And meanwhile, we\u2019ve cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly 60 percent and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on Earth.(APPLAUSE)Gas under $2 a gallon ain\u2019t bad either.(LAUGHTER)Now we\u2019ve got to accelerate the transition away from old, dirtier energy sources. Rather than subsidize the past, we should invest in the future, especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels. We do them no favor when we don\u2019t show them where the trends are going. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet. And that way, we put money back into those communities and put tens of thousands of Americans to work building a 21st century transportation system. (APPLAUSE)Now, none of this is going to happen overnight, and yes, there are plenty of entrenched interests who want to protect the status quo. But the jobs we\u2019ll create, the money we\u2019ll save, the planet we\u2019ll preserve, that is the kind of future our kids and our grandkids deserve. And it\u2019s within our grasp.Now, climate change is just one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world, and that\u2019s why the third big question that we have to answer together is how to keep America safe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nation- build everywhere there\u2019s a problem.I told you earlier all the talk of America\u2019s economic decline is political hot air. Well, so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker. Let me tell you something. The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth, period. Period.(APPLAUSE)It\u2019s not even close. It\u2019s not even close. It\u2019s not even close. We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined.(APPLAUSE)Our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world.(APPLAUSE)No nation attacks us directly or our allies because they know that\u2019s the path to ruin. Surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when I was elected to this office, and when it comes to every important international issue, people of the world do not look to Beijing or Moscow to lead. They call us.(APPLAUSE)So I think it\u2019s useful to level set here, because when we don\u2019t, we don\u2019t make good decisions. Now, as someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing, I know this is a dangerous time. But that\u2019s not primarily because of some looming superpower out there, and it\u2019s certainly not because of diminished American strength.In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re threatened less by evil empires and more by failing states. The Middle East is going through a transformation that will play out for a generation, rooted in conflicts that date back millennia. Economic headwinds are blowing in from a Chinese economy that is in significant transition. Even as their economy severely contracts, Russia is pouring resources in to prop up Ukraine and Syria, client states that they saw slipping away from their orbit. And the international system we built after World War II is now struggling to keep pace with this new reality.It\u2019s up to us to help, the United States of America, to help remake that system. And to do that well, it means that we\u2019ve got to set priorities. Priority number one is protecting the American people and going after terrorist networks.(APPLAUSE)Both Al Qaida and now ISIL pose a direct threat to our people, because in today\u2019s world, even a handful of terrorists who place no value on human life, including their own, can do a lot of damage. They use the Internet to poison the minds of individuals inside our country; their actions undermine and destabilize our allies. We have to take them out.But as we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top claims that this is World War III just play into their hands. Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages, they pose an enormous danger to civilians, they have to be stopped, but they do not threaten our national existence. That is the story ISIL wants to tell; that\u2019s the kind of propaganda they use to recruit.We don\u2019t need to build them up to show that we\u2019re serious, and we sure don\u2019t need to push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie that ISIL is somehow representative of one of the world\u2019s largest religions.(APPLAUSE)We just need to call them what they are: killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out, hunted down, and destroyed.(APPLAUSE)And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing. For more than a year, America has led a coalition of more than 60 countries to cut off ISIL\u2019s financing, disrupt their plots, stop the flow of terrorist fighters, and stamp out their vicious ideology. With nearly 10,000 air strikes, we are taking out their leadership, their oil, their training camps, their vicious ideology.With nearly 10,000 air strikes, we\u2019re taking out their leadership, their oil, their training camps, their weapons. We\u2019re training, arming and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in Iraq and Syria.If this Congress is serious about winning this war and wants to send a message to our troops and the world, authorize the use of military force against ISIL. Take a vote.(APPLAUSE)Take a vote. But the American people should know that, with or without Congressional action, ISIL will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them. If you doubt America\u2019s commitment \u2014 or mine \u2014 to see that justice is done, just ask Osama bin Laden.(APPLAUSE)Ask \u2014 ask the leader of Al Qaida in Yemen, who was taken out last year, or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks, who sits in a prison cell. When you come after Americans, we go after you. And it may take time, but we have long memories, and our reach has no limits.(APPLAUSE)Our foreign policy has to be focused on the threat from ISIL and Al Qaida, but it can\u2019t stop there. For even without ISIL, even without Al Qaida, instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world \u2014 in the Middle East, in Afghanistan and parts of Pakistan, in parts of Central America and Africa and Asia.Some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks. Others will just fall victim to ethnic conflict or famine, feeding the next wave of refugees.The world will look to us to help solve these problems, and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet-bomb civilians. That may work as a TV sound bite, but it doesn\u2019t pass muster on the world stage.We also can\u2019t try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis...(APPLAUSE)... even if it\u2019s done with the best of intentions. That\u2019s not leadership; that\u2019s a recipe for quagmire, spilling American blood and treasure that ultimately will weaken us. It\u2019s the lesson of Vietnam. It\u2019s the lesson of Iraq, and we should have learned it by now.(APPLAUSE)Fortunately, there is a smarter approach, a patient and disciplined strategy that uses every element of our national power. It says America will always act, alone if necessary, to protect our people and our allies, but on issues of global concern, we will mobilize the world to work with us, and make sure other countries pull their own weight.That\u2019s our approach to conflicts like Syria, where we\u2019re partnering with local forces and leading international efforts to help that broken society pursue a lasting peace.That\u2019s why we built a global coalition, with sanctions and principled diplomacy, to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. And as we speak, Iran has rolled back its nuclear program, shipped out its uranium stockpile, and the world has avoided another war.(APPLAUSE)That\u2019s how \u2014 that\u2019s how we stopped the spread of Ebola in West Africa.(APPLAUSE)Our military, our doctors, our development workers \u2014 they were heroic. They set up the platform that then allowed other countries to join in behind us and stamp out that epidemic. Hundreds of thousands \u2014 maybe a couple million lives were saved. That\u2019s how we forged a trans pacific partnership to open markets, and protect workers and the environment, and advance American leadership in Asia. It cuts 18,000 taxes on products made in America which will then support more good jobs here in America. With TPP, China does not set the rules in that region, we do. We want to show our strength in this new century? Approve this agreement, give us the tools to enforce it. It\u2019s the right thing to do.(APPLAUSE)Let me give you another example.Fifty years of isolating Cuba had failed to promote democracy, it set us back in Latin America. That\u2019s why we restored diplomatic relations, opened the door to travel and commerce, positioned ourselves to improve the lives of the Cuban people.(APPLAUSE)So, if you want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere, recognize that the Cold War is over. Lift the embargo.(APPLAUSE)The point is American leadership in the 21st century is not a choice between ignoring the rest of the world, except when we kill terrorists; or occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling. Leadership means a wise application of military power, and rallying the world behind causes that are right. It means seeing our foreign assistance as part of our national security, not something separate, not charity. When we lead nearly 200 nations to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change, yes, that helps vulnerable countries, but it also protects our kids. When we help Ukraine defend its democracy, or Colombia resolve a decades-long war, that strengthens the international order we depend on. When we help African countries feed their people and care for the sick...(APPLAUSE)It\u2019s the right thing to do, and it prevents the next pandemic from reaching our shores. Now right now, we are on track to end the scourge of HIV/AIDS, that\u2019s within our grasp, and we have the chance to accomplish the same thing with malaria, something I\u2019ll be pushing this Congress to fund this year. That\u2019s American strength. That\u2019s American leadership. And that kind of leadership depends on the power of our example. That is why I will keep working to shut down the prison at Guantanamo. It\u2019s expensive, it\u2019s unnecessary, and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies. There\u2019s a better way.(APPLAUSE)And that\u2019s why we need to reject any politics \u2014 any politics that targets people because of race or religion.(APPLAUSE)Let me just say this. This isn\u2019t a matter of political correctness. This is a matter of understanding just what it is that makes us strong. The world respects us not just for our arsenal, it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith. His Holiness, Pope Francis, told this body from the very spot I\u2019m standing on tonight that \u201cto imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place.\u201d When politicians insult Muslims, whether abroad, or fellow citizens, when a mosque is vandalized, or a kid is called names, that doesn\u2019t make us safer. That\u2019s not telling it what \u2014 telling it like it is, it\u2019s just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world.(APPLAUSE)It makes it harder to achieve our goals. It betrays who we are as a country.\u201cWe the People.\u201d Our Constitution begins with those three simple words, words we\u2019ve come to recognize mean all the people, not just some. Words that insist we rise and fall together, that that\u2019s how we might perfect our union.And that brings me to the fourth, and maybe most important thing that I want to say tonight. The future we want, all of us want \u2014 opportunity and security for our families, a rising standard of living, a sustainable, peaceful planet for our kids \u2014 all that is within our reach. But it will only happen if we work together. It will only happen if we can have rational, constructive debates. It will only happen if we fix our politics.A better politics doesn\u2019t mean we have to agree on everything. This is a big country, different regions, different attitudes, different interests. That\u2019s one of our strengths, too. Our Founders distributed power between states and branches of government, and expected us to argue, just as they did, fiercely, over the size and shape of government, over commerce and foreign relations, over the meaning of liberty and the imperatives of security.But democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens. It doesn\u2019t \u2014 it doesn\u2019t work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice, it doesn\u2019t work if we think that our political opponents are unpatriotic or trying to weaken America.Democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise or when even basic facts are contested or when we listen only to those who agree with us. Our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get all the attention. And most of all, democracy breaks down when the average person feels their voice doesn\u2019t matter; that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some special interest.Too many Americans feel that way right now. It\u2019s one of the few regrets of my presidency \u2014 that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better. I have no doubt a president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide, and I guarantee I\u2019ll keep trying to be better so long as I hold this office.But my fellow Americans, this cannot be my task \u2014 or any president\u2019s \u2014 alone. There are a whole lot of folks in this chamber \u2014 good people \u2014 who would like to see more cooperation, would like to see a more elevated debate in Washington but feel trapped by the imperatives of getting elected, by the noise coming out of your base. I know; you\u2019ve told me. It\u2019s the worst-kept secret in Washington. And a lot of you aren\u2019t enjoying being trapped in that kind of rancor.But that means if we want a better politics \u2014 and I\u2019m addressing the American people now \u2014 if we want a better politics, it\u2019s not enough just to change a congressman or change a senator or even change a president. We have to change the system to reflect our better selves.I think we\u2019ve got to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters and not the other way around.(APPLAUSE)Let a bipartisan group do it.(APPLAUSE)I believe we\u2019ve got to reduce the influence of money in our politics, so that a handful of families or hidden interests can\u2019t bankroll our elections.(APPLAUSE)And if our existing approach to campaign finance reform can\u2019t pass muster in the courts, we need to work together to find a real solution, because it\u2019s a problem. And most of you don\u2019t like raising money. I know. I\u2019ve done it.We\u2019ve got to make it easier to vote, not harder. We need to modernize it for the way we live now.(APPLAUSE)This is America. We want to make it easier for people to participate. And over the course of this year, I intend to travel the country to push for reforms that do just that.But I can\u2019t do these things on my own. Changes in our political process \u2014 in not just who gets elected, but how they get elected \u2014 that will only happen when the American people demand it. It depends on you. That\u2019s what\u2019s meant by a government of, by, and for the people.What I\u2019m suggesting is hard. It\u2019s a lot easier to be cynical, to accept that change is not possible, and politics is hopeless, and the problem is, all the folks who are elected don\u2019t care, and to believe that our voices and our actions don\u2019t matter.But if we give up now, then we forsake a better future. Those with money and power will gain greater control over the decisions that could send a young soldier to war, or allow another economic disaster, or roll back the equal rights and voting rights that generations of Americans have fought, even died, to secure. And then, as frustration grows, there will be voices urging us to fall back into our respective tribes, to scapegoat fellow citizens who don\u2019t look like us, or pray like us, or vote like we do, or share the same background.We can\u2019t afford to go down that path. It won\u2019t deliver the economy we want. It will not produce the security we want. But most of all, it contradicts everything that makes us the envy of the world.So, my fellow Americans, whatever you may believe, whether you prefer one party or no party, whether you supported my agenda or fought as hard as you could against it, our collective futures depends on your willingness to uphold your duties as a citizen, to vote, to speak out, to stand up for others, especially the weak, especially the vulnerable, knowing that each of us is only here because somebody somewhere stood up for us.(APPLAUSE)We need every American to stay active in our public life and not just during election time so that our public life reflects the goodness and the decency that I see in the American people every single day. It is not easy. Our brand of democracy is hard. But I can promise that, a little over a year from now, when I no longer hold this office, I will be right there with you as a citizen, inspired by those voices of fairness and vision, of grit and good humor and kindness, that have helped America travel so far.Voices that help us see ourselves not first and foremost as black or white or Asian or Latino; not as gay or straight, immigrant or native born; not Democrat or Republican; but as Americans first, bound by a common creed.Voices Dr. King believed would have the final word \u2014 voices of unarmed truth and unconditional love. And they\u2019re out there, those voices. They don\u2019t get a lot of attention. They don\u2019t seek a lot of fanfare, but they\u2019re busy doing the work this country needs doing.I see them everywhere I travel in this incredible country of ours. I see you, the American people. And in your daily acts of citizenship, I see our future unfolding.I see it in the worker on the assembly line who clocked extra shifts to keep his company open, and the boss who pays him higher wages instead of laying him off.I see it in the Dreamer who stays up late at night to finish her science project, and the teacher who comes in early, maybe with some extra supplies that she bought, because she knows that that young girl might someday cure a disease.I see it in the American who\u2019s served his time, made bad mistakes as a child, but now is dreaming of starting over, and I see it in the business owner who gives him that second chance; the protester determined to prove that justice matters; and the young cop walking the beat, treating everybody with respect, doing the brave, quiet work of keeping us safe.(APPLAUSE)I see it in the soldier who gives almost everything to save his brothers, the nurse who tends to him until he can run a marathon, the community that lines up to cheer him on. It\u2019s the son who finds the courage to come out as who he is, and the father whose love for that son overrides everything he\u2019s been taught.(APPLAUSE) I see it in the elderly woman who will wait in line to cast her vote as long as she has to; the new citizen who casts his vote for the first time; the volunteers at the polls who believe every vote should count, because each of them, in different ways, know how much that precious right is worth.That\u2019s the America I know. That\u2019s the country we love. Clear- eyed, big-hearted, undaunted by challenge, optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word. That\u2019s what makes me so hopeful about our future.(APPLAUSE)I believe in change because I believe in you, the American people. And that\u2019s why I stand here, as confident as I have ever been, that the state of our Union is strong.(APPLAUSE)Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.ENDAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Moves to Limit Emissions of Planet-Warming Methane", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "Supported byThe issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.The proposal is also intended to increase the royalties that oil and gas companies pay to drill on public lands by tightening requirements on when operators owe royalties on flared gas, and ensuring that the Interior Department can increase royalty rates above the current rate of 12.5 percent of the value of production.\u201cI think most people would agree that we should be using our nation\u2019s natural gas to power our economy \u2014 not wasting it by venting and flaring it into the atmosphere,\u201d Sally Jewell, the interior secretary, said in a statement. \u201cWe need to modernize decades-old standards to reflect existing technologies so that we can cut down on harmful methane emissions and use this captured natural gas to generate power and provide a return to taxpayers, tribes and states for this public resource.\u201dEnvironmental groups applauded the move. \u201cThe science is clear that the best thing this administration can do to ensure our public lands are managed in the public\u2019s interest is to end all fossil fuel extraction on them entirely,\u201d said Michael Brune, president of the Sierra Club. \u201cAnd today\u2019s action from the Bureau of Land Management represents a positive step towards reining in this industry\u2019s misuse of our public lands.\u201dWhile oil and gas companies have pushed back against the cost of proposed new regulations, the Interior Department estimates that the rule\u2019s net benefits could range from $115 million to $188 million per year, including increased revenues for operators from sale of recovered natural gas and environmental benefits of reducing emissions.United States oil production is at its highest level in nearly 30 years and the nation is now the largest producer of natural gas in the world. That boom in production has led to lower energy prices, but also to more natural gas and methane leaks. About 5 percent of the nation\u2019s oil supply and about 11 percent of its natural gas supply are extracted from about 100,000 federal onshore oil and gas wells. In 2014, those wells generated about $3 billion in royalties to the Treasury.From 2009 to 2014, enough natural gas was lost through venting, flaring and leaks to power more than five million homes for a year, according to figures provided by the Interior Department. That led to a loss of up to $23 million annually in royalty revenue to the federal government, according to a 2010 report by the Government Accountability Office.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Zika Virus \u2018Spreading Explosively\u2019 in Americas, W.H.O. Says", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported by\u201cThe level of alarm is extremely high,\u201d said Dr. Margaret Chan, the director general of the W.H.O., in a speech in Geneva.Even as international health authorities sounded strong warnings, health officials in the United States sought to reassure Americans, saying that the vast majority of those exposed to the virus never have symptoms and that the risk of a homegrown outbreak is very low, largely because of more effective mosquito control.\u201cFor the average American who is not traveling to this area, there is nothing they need to worry about,\u201d said Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the disease centers, briefed President Obama this week, and a team of experts from the C.D.C. is in Brazil working with the authorities. The Pan American Health Organization, or PAHO, the W.H.O.\u2019s regional office responsible for the affected area, has been tracking cases since May. Some experts complained that the agency\u2019s head office in Geneva had been slow to act, echoing the agency\u2019s tepid reaction at the outset of the Ebola epidemic in 2014. Officials sought to dispel that impression.\u201cThe aim here is to ensure that we are ahead of the curve,\u201d Marcos Espinal, director of the Department of Communicable Diseases and Health Analysis at PAHO, said in an interview this week.Global health authorities face the delicate task of alerting the world to the dangers of Zika without provoking panic. They are trying to mobilize a forceful response in an effort to avoid the failures of flawed intervention that hobbled the fight against Ebola in West Africa. Monday\u2019s meeting could clear the way for a much more aggressive response.That has provoked a certain hesitation about what tone to strike, even within the W.H.O. Dr. Bruce Aylward, a W.H.O. assistant director general, said the situation was not alarming, the very word Dr. Chan, the head of the agency, used earlier in the day.\u201c \u2018Concerned\u2019 is certainly the right language to be used,\u201d he said. \u201c \u2018Alarmed\u2019 would definitely not be the right language.\u201dWhy scientists are worried about the growing epidemic and its effects on pregnant women, and how to avoid the infection.The biggest unresolved question is whether infection by the Zika virus can cause microcephaly. \u201cBased on the information so far, there is more and more concern that there may be a causal relationship, but a lot of the work so far is to rule out other possible causes,\u201d Dr. Aylward said.\u201cThe level of concern is high, as is the level of uncertainty,\u201d Dr. Chan said. \u201cQuestions abound. We need to get some answers quickly.\u201dBut that is different from a broad public health epidemic, which experts said was unlikely. The United States, like other developed countries, is good at breaking transmission of the virus. Windows have screens, and homes have air-conditioning, keeping infected mosquitoes away from people. They also keep mosquitoes from contracting the virus from infected people and spreading it further. The small clusters of infections from a related virus \u2014 dengue \u2014 that have popped up in recent years in the continental United States did not spread.\u201cAs long as we are on the ball, if somebody is sick they get removed from proximity to mosquitoes,\u201d said Dina M. Fonseca, an entomology professor at Rutgers University-New Brunswick.She added that her state, New Jersey, has a plan in place for chikungunya, another related virus, that includes testing mosquito pools, and if any are positive, taking action, which could include spraying. If someone is infected locally \u2014 not during travel to another country \u2014 that also prompts mosquito control, she said. She expected similar plans to be laid for Zika by summer.The virus was first identified in 1947 in Uganda, but for decades it afflicted mainly monkeys. In 2007, the first outbreak was documented in the Pacific islands, in the Federated States of Micronesia. Then, in May 2015, Brazil reported its first case of Zika virus disease. Since then, the disease has spread within Brazil and to more than 20 other countries in the region, the W.H.O. said.Dr. Espinal said the W.H.O.\u2019s regional offices began working with the countries on the problem last May and set up an incident control center. Dr. Aylward said the health agency held a meeting to address microcephaly in November, after discovering an increase in cases in one part of Brazil. But experts have still not nailed down the link. The C.D.C. said it planned to send a team of epidemiologists to Brazil next month to work on the question.One worry is that there is no vaccine against the virus or a rapid diagnostic test to determine whether someone has been infected. Dr. Anthony S.

{"Headline": "Sean Penn\u2019s Excursions Into Writing Often Mix Activism With Journalism", "Date": "2016-01-10", "News": "Supported byMr. Penn, 55, the Academy Award-winning actor and director, was attending a fund-raiser for the relief organization he co-founded that is helping Haiti recover from its devastating 2010 earthquake.The many contradictions at play in such a moment are emblematic of Mr. Penn\u2019s long and layered career, in which he has become as well known for his roles in movies like \u201cDead Man Walking\u201d and \u201cMystic River\u201d as for his outspoken activism, which on several occasions has led him into journalism, with controversial results.For his journalistic detours, Mr. Penn has faced his own share of criticism, some of it blunt and some of it cloaked as satire.Speaking to ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday, Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said that if American actors like Mr. Penn want \u201cto go fawn all over a criminal and a drug trafficker in their interviews, they have a constitutional right to do it.\u201dMr. Rubio added, \u201cI find it grotesque.\u201dReaders were not much kinder. Within hours, if not minutes, of the publication of the Rolling Stone article, Mr. Penn was being vilified for his self-indulgent prose style and his awkwardly friendly attitude toward Mr. Guzm\u00e1n, a wanted criminal.\u201cThis simple man,\u201d Mr. Penn observes, \u201cfrom a simple place, surrounded by the simple affections of his sons to their father, and his toward them, does not initially strike me as the big bad wolf of lore.\u201dIn addition to an aside about his fear that his genitals might be cut off and his description of flatulence in front of Mr. Guzm\u00e1n, Mr. Penn asks in the Rolling Stone article, \u201care we, the American public, not indeed complicit in what we demonize?\u201d He goes on to suggest that as consumers, we are complicit in every murder, and in every incidence of corruption \u201cthat comes as a result of our insatiable appetite for illicit narcotics.\u201dAfter an account of drinking tequila with Mr. Guzm\u00e1n, and comparisons to the Brian De Palma crime movie \u201cScarface,\u201d Mr. Penn tells of asking his host how \u201cthe current pandemonium of the Middle East\u201d and its \u201cfrenzied opiate economies\u201d is affecting his drug trade.Sean Penn came to prominence in the 1980s as a hot-tempered bad boy, gaining attention for films like \u201cFast Times at Ridgemont High\u201d (playing the lovable surfer dude Jeff Spicoli) and \u201cThe Falcon and the Snowman\u201d (as a drug dealer drawn into K.G.B. espionage). He had a tumultuous marriage to Madonna that ended in divorce and received a short jail sentence after he punched an extra on a film set.In subsequent years, as praise for his screen work increased, Mr. Penn became more socially conscious and more vocal. He was a fierce detractor of the administration of President George W. Bush, paying to publish open letters in The Washington Post and The New York Times criticizing military action in Iraq. Writing for The San Francisco Chronicle, Mr. Penn gave accounts of his travels in Iraq after the United States invasion, and in Iran as it prepared for its 2005 presidential elections.But his earnest efforts were mocked in comedies like \u201cTeam America: World Police,\u201d in which a puppet depiction of Mr. Penn boasts that he recently traveled to Iraq, which he describes as \u201ca happy place \u2014 they had flowery meadows and rainbow skies, and rivers made of chocolate where the children danced and laughed and played with gumdrop smiles.\u201dIn 2008, he wrote at length for The Nation and The Huffington Post about his visits with President Ra\u00fal Castro in Cuba and Mr. Ch\u00e1vez in Venezuela. The results, not unlike Mr. Penn\u2019s Rolling Stone article on Mr. Guzm\u00e1n, were a mixture of wordy, breezy travelogue with moments of nonchalance and unintentional comedy.Mr. Penn described Mr. Castro as having \u201ca humor\u201d in his voice \u201cthat recalls a lifetime of affectionate tolerance for his big brother\u2019s watchful eye.\u201dHe said the Cuban leader, then in his 70s, moved \u201cwith the agility of a young man,\u201d and quoted Mr. Castro as saying to him, \u201cI was told you make long movies. Maybe you will make long journalism as well.\u201dIn a tongue-in-cheek 2008 commentary for The New Yorker, published after Mr. Penn\u2019s interviews with Mr. Castro and Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, George Packer wrote that his excursions into nonfiction revealed \u201ca kind of contempt for journalism, which turns out to be rather difficult to do well.\u201dMr. Packer wrote: \u201cNo one else working today inhabits his roles as completely as Penn, and I hope one day to see him portraying a foreign correspondent. He\u2019s such an accomplished actor that I\u2019m absolutely certain he\u2019ll do a more convincing job on screen than in his actual journalistic efforts.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Foes May Hate Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, but They Like His Political Playbook", "Date": "2016-01-26", "News": "Supported byThere was one thing Mr. Ch\u00e1vez promised but never handed over en masse, though: the property titles that would allow his supporters to sell their homes and cash out.Now the new leaders are drawing from the same populist playbook that they made their name criticizing, a telling sign that the strategy of winning trust through government largess has not gone away.\u201cThe opposition is trying to imitate the popular aspects of Chavismo,\u201d said Francisco Rodr\u00edguez, an economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, referring to Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s political movement.And so the lawmakers have turned to the hundreds of thousands of homes that Mr. Ch\u00e1vez and his followers built.\u201cIt gets at the heart of what the economic model should be in Venezuela,\u201d said David Smilde, a sociologist at Tulane University who lives in Caracas, the capital. \u201cShould it be about poor people deciding what to do with their own property, or should it be about the government ultimately making the decisions?\u201dJulio Borges, the legislator who is drafting the law, argues that the homes will give capital to the poor for the first time, drive activity to help ease Venezuela\u2019s economic crisis, and let the poor determine their own fates from now on.\u201cPeople had been treated like they were children,\u201d he said. \u201cWith this law you can make a sale and give an inheritance, something you can\u2019t do now.\u201dMaduro supporters see any proposal to transfer the titles as snake oil, a blatant attempt to claim credit for a vast store of homes built as public property.\u201cWe gave people dignified housing,\u201d said Dar\u00edo Vivas, a legislator in Mr. Maduro\u2019s United Socialist Party. \u201cJulio Borges and the opposition haven\u2019t built one home.\u201dMr. Vivas argued that the government had already delivered on its promise to hand over property titles, a position widely held by leftists. But many experts countered that if the government ever gave deeds to the homes, it was most likely only in a few cases and that most residents do not have titles.In a fiery State of the Union address before legislators this month, Mr. Maduro vowed to do what he could to block his opponents\u2019 work.\u201cYou will have to topple me first to approve a privatization law,\u201d he said to the applause of leftists.Here in Ciudad Miranda, about an hour\u2019s drive from Caracas, Coromoto Carmona, 40 and unemployed, looked out a window that was laden with bars. She told the story of how she got her home here and how it has become a place where she feels trapped.Ms. Carmona lost her first home in a deadly mudslide in 1999 and spent five years bouncing between government-run shelters. In 2004, she received a thrilling call from the government: She would attend a meeting at Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s presidential mansion, La Casona, where he would personally award her a new home.She moved into her two-bedroom home with nine members of her family. But problems soon emerged. Ms. Carmona realized there were no places to buy groceries, few schools and no public spaces for residents. These days, there is water for only four hours once a week.Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s government had promised her and others the titles to their homes. But Ms. Carmona received only a laminated piece of paper saying she was allowed to live there. If she leaves, it is unclear if she will be able to find anywhere else to live.\u201cIt\u2019s like jail here,\u201d she said.Franco Micucci, an architect who worked on Ciudad Miranda, says its social problems are not unique and will be as much a challenge to Venezuela\u2019s new leaders as they were to Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s movement. He says that he and colleagues originally drew up plans for public spaces and services like schools and grocery stores for residents at Ciudad Miranda. But the government built only the homes.\u201cI\u2019m not surprised residents want to leave that place,\u201d he said. \u201cMe and many architects were optimistic,\u201d but in the end \u201cCiudad Miranda is like \u2018Ciudad de Dios,\u2019\u201d he added, using the Spanish name for \u201cCity of God,\u201d a Brazilian film about the drug-ridden slums of Rio de Janeiro.Residents of Ciudad Miranda say the area is now run by armed gangs, known locally as colectivos, that are aligned with Mr. Maduro\u2019s party. Despite losing its majority in the legislature, the president\u2019s party won in Ciudad Miranda.Yoni Iriarte, a 26-year-old opposition activist, said he was threatened during a get-out-the-vote campaign by members of colectivos who surrounded him on motorcycles.\u201cThey told me, \u2018The government will take away your house,\u2019\u201d he said. Other residents in the neighborhood, including Ms. Carmona, reported receiving similar threats.Mr. Iriarte said that being granted the title to his house would allow him to vote freely.\u201cIf there is no blackmail of the government revoking my home, then I can vote for whomever I want, no matter who happens to be president at the time,\u201d he said.Ricardo Hausmann, a Harvard economist who worked for the government in the 1990s, sees other benefits, too.By creating homeownership for Venezuela\u2019s poor, lawmakers would create capital for those who did not have it, something that could lead to long-term social mobility.\u201cHaving property rights means you have an asset, you are empowered,\u201d he said, referring to past projects that did the same with Argentine public housing. \u201cThe effects are huge: You save, you invest, you improve your home.\u201dMr. Rodr\u00edguez, of Bank of America, was more cautious. He cited land redistribution plans after the Mexican Revolution in which peasants were given the titles to small plots and eventually the ability to sell them. In the end, many of the plots were bought up by big owners, something he says might happen with the Venezuelan apartments.\u201cIf you allow people to sell without restrictions, you can create new problems,\u201d he said.At first glance, the high-rises look idyllic: new towers with two-bedroom apartments, elevators and common areas. Outside, residents played a game of pickup soccer with a group of workers from China who are executing contracts for a raft of new buildings under construction.Yet Ms. Alcendra says the only place to buy food is a black market store that sells basic goods for far more than the government-controlled prices. She has boarded up her windows, fearing robbery. And though soldiers from the base guard the entrance to the complex, she says it is her neighbors whom she fears.\u201cMy life was better before,\u201d she said.Not everyone feels this way, not least the most loyal supporters of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, who retains a cultlike following even after his death almost three years ago.\u201cI went from living in a slum high on a hill 500 stair steps up, where we only had access to water once a month, to here where I have everything,\u201d said Daniel Vel\u00e1zquez, an activist showing off his home built in a government housing project in Bellas Artes, Caracas\u2019s downtown museum district.\u201cHere I have services \u2014 like water, electricity and a phone,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone always talks about how much their life has changed since moving here.\u201dIn the other room, his wife, Ana, cooked arepas in a kitchen with pans neatly hung on the wall. She was not interested in the opposition\u2019s plan to give her a title to the home.\u201cIt is like they are trying to make us forget about Ch\u00e1vez,\u201d she said. \u201cLike how they took down his pictures in the National Assembly. But they can\u2019t make us forget him. They can\u2019t take down the hundreds of buildings he built.\u201dMeridith Kohut and Mar\u00eda Eugenia D\u00edaz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Enduring Coach Pulls a Timely Trick", "Date": "2016-01-12", "News": "Supported byOn College FootballMarlon Humphrey of Alabama was on the sideline in the fourth quarter. The 24-24 score had resulted from several defensive lapses on Clemson\u2019s part, and did not reflect that the undefeated Tigers had been dominating.Then Humphrey heard his name called. He knew what it meant: a play called Pop Kick. A surprise onside kick.He lined up on the far right of Alabama\u2019s kickoff formation, parallel with Clemson\u2019s widest returner. As the play began he sprinted forward, subtly flaring toward the sideline, taking a slightly harder angle with each step. The kick, disguised until nearly the end, bounced up into the flat, past the required 10 yards, to a space where Humphrey and only Humphrey could make a play on it. He hauled it in over his back; it looked like Willie Mays\u2019s famous World Series catch. Alabama ball.Saban, whose reputation is of someone who would be dour at his daughter\u2019s wedding, smiled and all but skipped down the sideline.\u201cObviously, the couple of special teams plays were huge momentum plays,\u201d said Clemson Coach Dabo Swinney, referring also to a later 95-yard kick return by Alabama\u2019s Kenyan Drake.The onside kick was a classic underdog maneuver, a high-stakes gamble from a program that is seemingly always favored and from a coach that never used to make such moves. Alabama went on to beat Clemson, 45-40. It was Saban\u2019s fifth national championship, and fourth with the Crimson Tide. It held the promise of yet more.To be sure, the play succeeded because it worked technically. Saban and Bobby Williams, Alabama\u2019s special teams coordinator, had noticed watching tape that Clemson tended to leave \u201ca lot of field,\u201d in Williams\u2019s words, between the sideline and its leftmost returner, who on the fateful play was lined up on the hash mark. They discussed the play, Williams said, before every kickoff. They had practiced it all season.\u201cIt works almost every time, except I usually drop the ball,\u201d said Humphrey, adding, \u201cWe practiced it this past Thursday \u2014 we hadn\u2019t practiced it in a while, and I actually dropped it.\u201dThe surprise was heightened by the incongruity. Here was Saban, a former defensive back, N.F.L. defensive coordinator and steadfastly defense-first coach, voluntarily putting the ball into the hands of his offense rather than trusting his defense.\u201cI made the decision,\u201d Saban said after the game, because \u201cwe were tired on defense and weren\u2019t doing a great job of getting them stopped.\u201dSaban\u2019s old philosophy, of outsize defenses smothering opponents and then letting a humble offense take care of the rest, was good for three national titles in four seasons. The apotheosis was 2011\u2019s campaign: Alabama lost just once, to Louisiana State, in a 9-6 kickers\u2019 duel, and then shut out the same L.S.U. team in the championship game, 21-0.But cracks appeared. In 2012, Johnny Manziel marched into Tuscaloosa, Ala., as a redshirt freshman and scrambled his way to a Texas A&M victory. Between 2010 and 2013, Auburn took two Iron Bowls with a spread offense run under the offensive coordinator and then head coach Gus Malzahn.In response, Saban brought in the offensive coordinator Lane Kiffin before last season to jolt his attack. Alabama beat Auburn, 26-21, in 2009, but it beat Auburn, 55-44, last season. It scored 21 against L.S.U. in January 2012, but scored 38 against Michigan State and then 45 against Clemson\u2019s highly ranked defense in this postseason.If not quite \u201cif you can\u2019t beat \u2019em, join \u2019em,\u201d it was some sort of concession, and it paid off Monday night against an explosive Clemson offense led by quarterback Deshaun Watson, a Heisman Trophy finalist who will be a junior next year on a team that will probably be the preseason No. 1.There is precedent for an all-time-great college coach realizing that his previous methods were no longer optimal, altering them, and securing a national championship. In fact, it was his fifth title, too.This is no coincidence; Saban\u2019s and Krzyzewski\u2019s are similar responses to the same trends in big-time college sports. Earlier specialization has made recruiting more important than ever. Wider exposure and broader distribution of revenue have created a more level competitive playing field. It all means that staying with one\u2019s old, preferred ways is no longer sufficient.\u201cI don\u2019t know how you do what he\u2019s doing,\u201d Kiffin, who has been the head coach at Southern California and Tennessee, said of his boss. \u201cIt\u2019s too hard now. Nobody does it. I know people did similar stuff years ago. But the scholarship numbers are lower now, players leave early for the draft, and there\u2019s so many good coaches.\u201dAlthough football does not work quite like basketball \u2014 players typically may not turn professional after one year, and at many positions even the most talented compete for four \u2014 the new reality has compelled Saban to retrofit his always top-notch strategy.The pitch: Come to Alabama, play if you are the best, receive a distinct job so that you can always contribute, win national championships and continue in your football career.Geno Matias-Smith, a cornerback-turned-safety whose 11 tackles led Alabama on Monday night, said recently that he was coaxed to Alabama by being told \u201cthat I\u2019d have to compete \u2014 come out every day and compete in practice, just work hard. Nothing is guaranteed.\u201d\u201cWe try to sub and play a lot of players,\u201d said Kirby Smart, Saban\u2019s longtime defensive coordinator, who as of game\u2019s end was exclusively Georgia\u2019s new head coach. \u201cSo we create team morale by playing players.\u201dHe added, \u201cThe best players end up playing at Alabama.\u201dAsked if this philosophy helped with recruiting, he said, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201dThe result was apparent Monday night. Over the course of the season, Alabama\u2019s biggest contributors \u2014 the Heisman Trophy-winning running back Derrick Henry, quarterback Jake Coker, center Ryan Kelly, defensive lineman A\u2019Shawn Robinson, linebacker Reggie Ragland \u2014 were upperclassmen. So were Monday night\u2019s offensive and defensive players of the game, tight end O. J. Howard and safety Eddie Jackson.But Alabama\u2019s best receiver this season was Calvin Ridley, another freshman. Humphrey was a redshirt freshman. Two freshman cornerbacks, Minkah Fitzpatrick and Ronnie Harrison, were perhaps the game\u2019s unsung heroes: each made terrific plays denying touchdowns to Clemson receivers in one-on-one coverage; failure on either play would have erased Alabama\u2019s margin of victory.Reflecting on his play after the game, Fitzpatrick was sanguine in both senses \u2014 stoic, and bloodthirsty.\u201cI played all right,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my best game. I\u2019m going to try to make up for it the next couple of seasons.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the year Duke won a national basketball title with an experienced team. It was 2010, not 2009.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Matteo Renzi, Italian Premier, Pushes for a Place at Europe\u2019s Power Table", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported by\u201cI\u2019m the leader of a great country,\u201d Mr. Renzi said during an interview last week. \u201cI have my ideas.\u201dMr. Renzi, too, argues that European Union institutions are too bureaucratic and too dominated by a clique of elites and favored nations, especially Germany. Yet he does not want to destroy European institutions.Instead, he is demanding that Italy be given a seat at the power table with Ms. Merkel and President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France.\u201cIf we are looking for a European solution to the refugee problem, then it is not right that Angela first speaks to Hollande and then calls European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, and I only find out about it in the press later,\u201d Mr. Renzi told the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on Thursday, in advance of his visit to Berlin.In his office last week, Mr. Renzi said Europe lacked a larger, positive vision on fighting unemployment and spurring growth and also needed a foreign policy strategy in the Middle East and Africa to curb migration. He said bureaucrats in Brussels must not only focus on fighting with national governments over budget flexibility or achieving fractional deficit targets.\u201cThis is not Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a nightmare.\u201dNearing his two-year anniversary as prime minister, Mr. Renzi said Italian credibility had suffered from past political dysfunction. But he pressed his case that, under his leadership, Italy had now earned the right to be taken seriously, as his government has passed a succession of political, labor, public administration and economic reforms.\u201cAfter two years of listening, now I speak,\u201d said Mr. Renzi, adding that Italy is too often portrayed as a problem child of Europe, dependent on largess from Brussels when, in fact, it contributes more to European Union coffers than it receives in return. \u201cItaly is not the problem, as in the past.\u201dMr. Renzi\u2019s frustrations steadily mounted last year, as he clashed with different European Union officials, and then confronted Germany during a two-day summit meeting of European leaders in Brussels.This month, Mr. Renzi publicly sparred with Mr. Juncker, who warned the Italian leader to stop badmouthing the European Commission \u201cat each street corner.\u201d Mr. Renzi responded by saying Italy had regained a leadership role and others must \u201cdeal with it.\u201dThe money for Turkey is likely to be a major topic of discussion on Friday with Ms. Merkel, who strongly supports the deal and whose own political prospects depend on slowing the numbers of incoming refugees.In Rome, many analysts and politicians say Mr. Renzi\u2019s confrontational tactics reflect genuine Italian frustrations with Brussels. For years, Italy sought financial help on migration but got little from European Union officials.\u201cTo a certain point, he is right,\u201d said Gian Luigi Gigli, a lawmaker in Italy\u2019s lower house. \u201cWe were considered the kids at school who were not doing our homework. In a way, we have done our homework.\u201dBut many analysts also point out that Mr. Renzi is under political pressure at home, as the economy, while improving, is still sluggish and his reforms have not had enough time to bring major changes to people.Taking a tougher stance with Brussels helps him fend off populist political challenges. And other analysts argue that Mr. Renzi is trying to gain leverage as he negotiates with Brussels over more flexibility for Italy\u2019s national budget.Mr. Gigli added that Mr. Renzi was playing a dangerous game and that Italy could only push so far. He said economic indicators were improving in Italy but the country\u2019s staggering public debt remained a critical problem. This week, Italian bank stocks plummeted, as investors were unimpressed with the government\u2019s new agreement with Brussels on addressing nonperforming bank loans.\u201cHow far can we go with this confrontation?\u201d he asked. \u201cThere is the risk that we really can be beaten.\u201dOne question is whether other European leaders will follow Mr. Renzi\u2019s direction, especially in southern countries where left-wing governments are gaining.Fredrik Erixon, an analyst in Brussels, said Mr. Renzi could also benefit from growing resentment toward Germany, as others also complain that Berlin is imposing its will on European Union institutions more directly than in the past.\u201cHe is basically doing what the German government and other governments would be up to \u2014 trying to fight for their national interests,\u201d said Mr. Erixon, director of the European Center for International Political Economy, a research institute. \u201cAnd he is doing it in a way that is not kowtowing to Berlin.\u201dGaia Pianigiani contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

He told reporters that only the country\u2019s flag and shield should be displayed.President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s handpicked successor, wasted no time in trying to turn his opponents\u2019 symbolic gesture to his advantage. In a nationally televised speech on Wednesday evening, he called the removals outrageous, and said that portraits of Simon Bol\u00edvar, the country\u2019s independence hero, had also been taken down.\u201cI can\u2019t fail to express my anger, my repudiation,\u201d Mr. Maduro said. \u201cI call on the people to rebel against these neo-fascists, anti-Bolivarians, anti-patriots.\u201dOn Thursday, a number of demonstrators assembled at a downtown plaza, heeding the president\u2019s call. The Ch\u00e1vez portraits were brought there and guarded by soldiers.The spat over the portraits could augur poorly for Venezuela\u2019s political prospects in the new year, the country\u2019s first taste of a divided government where disputes boil up as the economy continues its meltdown. Venezuela has the largest estimated oil reserves in the world, yet price controls and inflation have led to shortages of basic items like eggs and flour.

{"Headline": "Our Mediterranean, Our Survival", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 All the world\u2019s seas are bedeviled by global warming, pollution and overfishing, but the Mediterranean and the 20-plus nations that ring it face another threat: A rising flood of invasive marine species flowing through the Suez Canal.On Aug. 6, 2015, over the objections of environmentalists and the reservations of many economists, the canal\u2019s latest expansion opened to shipping. The new 22-mile channel will double the canal\u2019s capacity, allowing 97 ships to pass through each day. It also opens a wider path for invasive species from the Indian and Pacific Oceans to flood through the Red Sea into the Mediterranean.Once they\u2019re in, there\u2019s no way to get them out, and the changes they bring are irreversible. Israeli scientists have identified more than 450 alien species of fish, invertebrates and algae that are not part of the Mediterranean\u2019s natural ecosystem. Several pose public health hazards, while others threaten fisheries and tourism and denude underwater ecosystems, greatly reducing biodiversity.Egyptian authorities say the $8.5 billion project will reduce bottlenecks and increase toll revenue from $5.3 billion to $13.2 billion a year by 2023. But these benefits come at the cost of continuing environmental degradation. \u201cThe recent doubling of the canal will decimate coastal ecosystems with dire implications for the regional economy and human health. We can\u2019t continue to overlook this threat,\u201d warns Dr. Bella Galil, a senior scientist at Israel\u2019s National Institute of Oceanography.It can take generations, she says, for an alien species to expand its range. The presence of Red Sea fish in the Levant Basin, for example, was not recorded until 1902, more than three decades after the canal first opened in 1869. Subsequent waves have followed major canal expansions in 1980 and in 2010. The eastern Mediterranean, mere miles from the canal\u2019s mouth, has been hardest hit, and experts from Turkey, Cyprus, Greece, Israel and Lebanon say this invasion has drastically altered fisheries.In the 1970s, according to Dr. Dor Edelist, a marine ecologist at the University of Haifa, invasive species constituted 21 percent of Israeli trawler catch; today, more than half are alien. In the first decade of this century, Israel\u2019s Mediterranean fishery brought in $14 million to $26 million a year. Today, it\u2019s about $16 million, of which $6 million to $10 million are invasive species. Some are edible, like the goldband goatfish, but it has replaced the native species, red mullet. Gone too are native food fish like European hake and porgies. Turkish and Lebanese fisheries report similar losses.Putting a precise figure on the economic impact is difficult. Standard commercial fisheries statistics tell how much fish is caught and sold, but fishermen are notorious for underreporting their catch. And no one is tracking the economic loss from season to season as commercial species collapse or as environmental degradation reduces tourism.Three alien species have been particularly destructive. Rabbit fish have devoured algal forests, leaving wide areas of bare rock and undermining the complex ecosystems of the Levant Basin.A more recent arrival is the poisonous silverside puffer fish, native to the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Puffer fish eat 20 percent to 33 percent of fish caught on long-line hooks and often chew through a trawler\u2019s nets, according to Aylin Ulman, a doctoral student at the University of Pavia, who studies Turkish fisheries. \u201cWhere gill nets used to last 15 years, puffer fish cause so much damage that nets have to be replaced in just a few months,\u201d he says. Researchers say Greek fishermen face the same issues in the Aegean and off Crete. Among other prey, they devour such staple foods as squid, octopus and cuttlefish. Off the coast of Cyprus, the octopus catch has plummeted from 175 tons per year in 2001 to below 50 tons in 2009, according to the Sea Around Us, an environmental fisheries program run by the University of British Columbia.Another voracious and painfully venomous predator, the nomad jellyfish, entered the Mediterranean in the 1970s. Now they form large swarms every summer, washing up on shores, endangering beachgoers and divers, blocking the water-intake pipes of power and desalinization plants. Swarms have reached the Straits of Sicily and are endangering Atlantic bluefin tuna eggs, threatening a fishery already on the verge of collapse.Though we can\u2019t remove invasive species, we do have the engineering expertise to stem the migration. The Panama Canal, which opened to shipping in 1914, offers an example of what might be accomplished. It operates a series of locks that function like sets of double doors, allowing ships to pass while making it more difficult for alien species to follow. Moreover, the fresh water of Gatun Lake, which forms a major part of the canal complex, provides a 21-mile barrier that impedes the migration of most saltwater species.The Suez Canal once had its own salinity barrier, known as the Bitter Lakes. Previous expansions and agricultural wastewater dumped into the canal flushed it away, but recreating it could be cost-effective. Installing locks for the Suez Canal, located in a much simpler physical environment than the mountainous Panamanian region, should be easier and less costly than the $3.2 billion the Panama authorities expect to pay for modernized lock equipment.Scientists and environmentalists have appealed to the European Commission to install locks and salinity barriers in the Suez Canal and have requested an environmental impact assessment. Despite Egypt\u2019s assurances that the information would be provided by May, European Union officials say they have still not received a definitive report. But in discussions last October conducted by the United Nations Environment Program, the Egyptians reportedly said they would not sign an updated United Nations Mediterranean Action Plan unless language stating that invasive species are coming through the Suez Canal was removed. The MAP draft decision, with the language regarding the Suez Canal in brackets, goes to the Barcelona Convention for the Protection of the Mediterranean for review in February.Observers say that Brussels doesn\u2019t want to lean too hard on Egypt because President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is cooperating in dealing with the refugee crisis. Many European Union member states with their own national interests in the Mediterranean see the Suez expansion as a sovereign decision by the Egyptian government and are loath to interfere.But Egypt and its neighbors are losing sight of the big picture. For Egypt, with its large underemployed population, managing the fishing industry more wisely would employ more people and have greater long-term economic benefits than building expensive canal infrastructure that is vulnerable to a volatile global economy.So, how can these competing interests be resolved? The problem may require new ideas and neutral leadership. In the mid-2000s, overfishing and environmental degradation was ruining fisheries off California. The Nature Conservancy bought up boats and licenses and leased these back to fishermen willing to employ more sustainable methods and use reporting software to help the NGO develop baseline data on the fishing stocks themselves. The result: Local fishermen are still fishing, and fish stocks are coming back. The program has been copied by several New England fisheries.There\u2019s surely a creative solution for the Mediterranean\u2019s problems, and the place to start is by rebuilding salinity barriers in the Suez Canal. As we become more aware of the risks to our planet, we must remember that human beings, by nature, are not only competitive \u2014 we\u2019re also cooperative.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Social Security in an Election Year", "Date": "2016-01-02", "News": "Supported byEditorialThis election season offers an opportunity to reframe the debate over Social Security. It is necessary, of course, to ensure the program\u2019s long-term health beyond 2034, when the system is projected to come up short. But this can\u2019t be done by broadly cutting benefits. In fact, there\u2019s mounting evidence that Social Security, which has become ever more important in retirement, needs to be expanded.Despite these facts, nearly all Republican candidates have called for cuts to Social Security benefits.Mr. Bush and Mr. Cruz have said that Social Security payroll taxes should be diverted into new private accounts for employees, a reprise of President George W. Bush\u2019s failed privatization attempt in 2005. Private accounts do not enhance retirement security. They divert money that would otherwise finance Social Security to Wall Street and shift the risk from government to individuals.Donald Trump opposes benefit cuts, including a higher retirement age, but he has offered no meaningful ideas for reform.The Democratic candidates have played defense and offense. They have opposed benefit cuts and privatization. They have proposed increasing the system\u2019s revenues by raising the ceiling on the amount of wages, currently $118,500, that are subject to payroll taxes. That reform is overdue. If the wage ceiling had kept pace with the income gains of high earners over the decades, it would be about $250,000 today.More important, they have stressed that an aim of reform is to bolster the system, not shrink it. Hillary Clinton would raise benefits for widows and for retirees who had long absences from the work force to care for relatives. Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley would increase benefits more broadly, especially for low-income recipients.Ultimately, strengthening Social Security requires a growing and healthy economy. The Democratic candidates have credible ideas for creating jobs and raising wages that would revitalize the tax base for Social Security. Those and other sensible fixes, not deep and broad cutbacks, will ensure that the system continues to provide a basic level of guaranteed retirement income for all workers.Advertisement"}

Republicans got to respond. Our take? Things are pretty good. We offer a few indicators that give us reason to be optimistic, though, as with most things, there are always caveats.Margot Sanger-KatzMargot Sanger-KatzIf you want to feel optimistic about the job market, look to the unemployment rate, which at 5 percent suggests an almost complete recovery since 2008.

{"Headline": "How Stories Drive the Stock Market", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewSince the stock market began falling at the beginning of this year, there seems to have been a palpable change in the stories we have been hearing. Suddenly there is more willingness to entertain the possibility of a major stock market correction, or of an economic recession.One tale that has been intensified lately has focused on the Chinese economy and its stock market, including sharp market declines at the beginning of 2016. Long-abiding concerns about Chinese overinvestment, shadow banking issues, ghost cities that were built but never inhabited and similar problems have been amplified. In the West the narrative has been colored with emotions. China\u2019s mistakes have been contrasted with Western optimism, our sense of patriotism and our sense of competitiveness.Another current focus is the fact that this year set a record for poor performance of the stock market in the first week of the year. That timing has given the market-decline story wings, though there is really nothing special about such timing. After all, the date of the new year is an arbitrary social convention. There\u2019s a Western Christian New Year, an Orthodox New Year, a Jewish New Year, an Islamic New Year, a Chinese New Year and so forth. The prominence of the Western year in global calendars reflects a history of Western dominance, and that has given the new year the ability to spark stories that evoke mixed, and changing, feelings.A third narrative that is being widely conveyed concerns oil, and the extremely low prices that energy commodities have reached.Just a few years ago the prevailing narrative about oil was all about the amazing United States success with a newly improved extraction method, fracking, to the detriment of the less creative oil-exporting countries. That story has been resonant here in America, where it has been taken as a tale of peculiarly American creativity. The history of modern petroleum may be seen as an American story that goes back to 1859 and Edwin Drake, who showed the world how it was possible, in Titusville, Pa., to drive a pipe deep through bedrock to reach oil. Drake became part of a great social narrative, leading the way to an entrepreneurial revolution in oil production and to still enduring American pride.Unfortunately, the bottom has just dropped out of that narrative, and some of us have gotten emotional about that, too. With this year\u2019s extremely low oil prices, many of these frackers, so recently hailed as heroes, are going out of business. Their very ingenuity in increasing the supply of oil has been part of the problem by contributing to the oil price drop. It is easy to jump from this to broader conclusions: Maybe we\u2019re not so smart after all, or so the new story goes. This thinking is a downer: Sometimes social narratives are quite depressing.Professor MacMullen tries to convey to the reader the feelings people had long ago when they were inspired or dejected. He says he believes this will help us understand history at a deeper level. One emotional story loaded with moral value leads to another, in his retelling. As an example, he gives us the tale of the murder of the abolitionist editor Elijah Lovejoy by a pro-slavery mob in 1837. That story motivated John Brown, helping to lead years later to his revolt and capture and hanging in 1859. And those events created another widely recounted emotional story that helped to lead to the Civil War and, eventually, abolition. Such popular stories are serious matters. They can lead to revolutions, or to market collapses.Those who care about the stock market will surely be living through a new sequence of stories this year, including the four that I have enumerated here. Whether these narratives have a cascading effect, leading to further price decreases and yet more negative stories, is one possibility. But only time will tell us how the stories go.ROBERT J.

Its revenue was weaker than Wall Street analysts had anticipated. The falloff in sales from its big oil-field equipment unit was one reason, but so was $1 billion in other equipment deals that G.E. expected to close in the fourth quarter but did not. G.E. executives insisted that most of those were fairly normal delays in completing heavy-equipment transactions rather than a signal that customers were becoming reluctant to buy, given the uncertain economic outlook.In a conference call, Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.\u2019s chief executive, said the crucial signal of future business for the company \u2014 orders for its industrial products \u2014 was growing. And at the end of 2015, the company said it had a robust $315 billion backlog of orders for products including jet engines, power turbines and railway locomotives, and for services to care for the machinery.Mr. Immelt acknowledged the sluggish global economy and the \u201cespecially volatile\u201d early weeks of 2016.

G.E.\u2019s share price fell 2 percent shortly after it announced the results and closed down 1.2 percent.\u201cThe revenue shortfall was a disappointment,\u201d said Steven Winoker, an analyst at Bernstein Research. But the strong order backlog and disciplined management of expenses, he said, should \u201cease concerns.\u201dG.E. is undergoing two major shifts: in its portfolio of businesses, by shedding financial assets; and on the industrial side, by moving to become what G.E. executives call a \u201cdigital industrial company.\u201dG.E. is a leader among industrial companies in placing sensors on heavy equipment and then analyzing the machine data with software to predict, for example, when a locomotive needs maintenance before it breaks down.

{"Headline": "What\u2019s New in the Dietary Guidelines", "Date": "2016-01-18", "News": "Jane Brody on health and aging.If, like me, you are a fan of high-fat foods like nuts or avocados, high-cholesterol foods like shrimp or eggs, coffee or an occasional alcoholic drink, the new guidelines provide some additional reassurance. They emphasize the need to focus on a health-promoting eating pattern \u00e2\u0080\u009cacross the life span\u00e2\u0080\u009d that includes these and other foods, in moderation, while cutting down on added sugar.On the other hand, the new guidelines can be confusing, containing what seems like conflicting messages and bowing, in some cases, to industry pressures, especially with regard to meats.The new guidelines emphasize a lifelong eating pattern that contains adequate essential nutrients, a caloric intake that supports a healthy body weight and foods that reduce the risk of chronic disease. This means diets with a rich variety of vegetables and fruits; whole grains; fat-free or low-fat dairy foods like milk, yogurt and cheese, and protein foods that contain little or no saturated fat, including eggs, shellfish, lean meat and poultry, beans and peas, soy products, nuts and seeds.However, the new guidelines do not suggest restricting total fat, a nutrient that has been much maligned, albeit unfairly it is turning out, as something to avoid to maintain a normal body weight. While it is true that ounce for ounce, fat has more calories than sugars and proteins, it is also more satiating and can curb overeating.It is critical, though, to understand the difference between fats. Most experts consider saturated fats to be the bad actors; they are found in butter, whole milk, well-marbled meats, poultry fat (especially the skin) and tropical oils like coconut and palm oil.With saturated fat widely considered the primary culprit in raising blood serum levels of cholesterol, most experts are far less worried about cholesterol intake from low-fat foods like eggs, shrimp and other shellfish. Although a small fraction of the population may be sensitive to dietary cholesterol, for most people on an otherwise wholesome diet, cholesterol naturally produced by the liver is the main reason for rising serum cholesterol that prompts people like me to control it with a daily statin.More good news, this time for fellow coffee-lovers. For the first time since the 1980s, when five-year updates to Dietary Guidelines for Americans were first issued, they specifically mention that moderate consumption of coffee \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a couple of cups a day \u00e2\u0080\u0094 can be part of a healthful eating pattern. Moderation is also urged with regard to alcohol, up to one drink a day for women and up to two for men.But white rice and breads, cakes, cookies and pastries would take a hit if most Americans abided by the new guidelines. They urge that at least half of the grains we eat be whole ones, not refined and stripped of their essential nutrients. Refined grains amount to empty calories that are not much better than eating straight sugar, which they quickly turn into when digested.Two decades ago, a friend of mine suffered a heart attack shortly after eating a pastrami sandwich rich in both saturated fat and salt. While health problems can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be attributed to eating a single sandwich, a lifetime of avidly consuming steaks, burgers, sausages and other processed meats can load the body with unhealthful fats and salt.The guidelines do suggest that teenage boys and men eat less protein. But because the guidelines do not specifically say how this should be accomplished, these groups could still derive much of their protein from unhealthful meats.Economics clearly comes into play here. The sugar industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economywide annual impact is $19 billion, which may sound like a lot until you compare it with the meat and poultry industry \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the largest segment of the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agricultural economy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which has a ripple effect that generates $64.2 billion a year.

{"Headline": "\u00adElizabeth Warren: One Way to Rebuild Our Institutions", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 WHILE presidential candidates from both parties feverishly pitch their legislative agendas, voters should also consider what presidents can do without Congress. Agency rules, executive actions and decisions about how vigorously to enforce certain laws will have an impact on every American, without a single new bill introduced in Congress.The Obama administration has a substantial track record on agency rules and executive actions. It has used these tools to protect retirement savings, expand overtime pay, prohibit discrimination against L.G.B.T. employees who work for the government and federal contractors, and rein in carbon pollution. These accomplishments matter.Whether the next president will build on them, or reverse them, is a central issue in the 2016 election. But the administration\u2019s record on enforcement falls short \u2014 and federal enforcement of laws that already exist has received far too little attention on the campaign trail.In a single year, in case after case, across many sectors of the economy, federal agencies caught big companies breaking the law \u2014 defrauding taxpayers, covering up deadly safety problems, even precipitating the financial collapse in 2008 \u2014 and let them off the hook with barely a slap on the wrist. Often, companies paid meager fines, which some will try to write off as a tax deduction.The failure to adequately punish big corporations or their executives when they break the law undermines the foundations of this great country. Justice cannot mean a prison sentence for a teenager who steals a car, but nothing more than a sideways glance at a C.E.O. who quietly engineers the theft of billions of dollars.These enforcement failures demean our principles. They also represent missed opportunities to address some of the nation\u2019s most pressing challenges. Consider just two areas \u2014 college affordability and health care \u2014 where robust enforcement of current law could help millions of people.When the Education Management Corporation, the nation\u2019s second-largest for-profit college, signed up tens of thousands of students by lying about its programs, it saddled them with fraudulent degrees and huge debts. Those debts wrecked lives. Under the law, the government can bar such institutions from receiving more federal student loans. But EDMC just paid a fine and kept right on raking in federal loan money.When Novartis, a major drug company that was already effectively on federal probation for misconduct, paid kickbacks to pharmacies to push certain drugs, it cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars and undermined patient health. Under the law, the government can boot companies that defraud Medicare and Medicaid out of those programs, but when Novartis got caught, it just paid a penalty \u2014 one so laughably small that its C.E.O. said afterward that it \u201cremains to be seen\u201d whether his company would actually consider changing its behavior.Enforcement isn\u2019t about big government or small government. It\u2019s about whether government works and who it works for. Last year, five of the world\u2019s biggest banks, including JPMorgan Chase, pleaded guilty to criminal charges that they rigged the price of billions of dollars worth of foreign currencies. No corporation can break the law unless people in that corporation also broke the law, but no one from any of those banks has been charged. While thousands of Americans were rotting in prison for nonviolent drug convictions, JPMorgan Chase was so chastened by pleading guilty to a crime that it awarded Jamie Dimon, its C.E.O., a 35 percent raise.To be fair, weak enforcement is sometimes a result of limited authority. Despite the company\u2019s history of egregious safety failures, for example, the former C.E.O. of Massey Energy was convicted only of a single misdemeanor in the deadly Upper Big Branch mine disaster that killed 29 miners in West Virginia in 2010, because federal mining laws are too weak. It\u2019s on Congress to stiffen such penalties.But in many instances, weak enforcement by federal agencies is about the people at the top. Presidents don\u2019t control most day-to-day enforcement decisions, but they do nominate the heads of all the agencies, and these choices make all the difference. Strong leaders at the Environmental Protection Agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Labor Department have pushed those agencies to forge ahead with powerful initiatives to protect the environment, consumers and workers. The Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, a tiny office charged with oversight of the post-crash bank bailout, has aggressive leaders \u2014 and a far better record of holding banks and executives accountable than its bigger counterparts.Meanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission, suffering under weak leadership, is far behind on issuing congressionally mandated rules to avoid the next financial crisis. It has repeatedly granted waivers so that lawbreaking companies can continue to enjoy special privileges, while the Justice Department has dodged one opportunity after another to impose meaningful accountability on big corporations and their executives.Each of these government divisions is headed by someone nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. The lesson is clear: Personnel is policy.Legislative agendas matter, but voters should also ask which presidential candidates they trust with the extraordinary power to choose who will fight on the front lines to enforce the laws. The next president can rebuild faith in our institutions by honoring the simple notion that nobody is above the law, but it will happen only if voters demand it.Elizabeth Warren is a Democratic senator from Massachusetts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Movies the Oscars Will Overlook, but Shouldn\u2019t", "Date": "2015-12-30", "News": "Supported byIt happens every year. Some actor stands next to another performer or the president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and they take turns telling you what\u2019s up for an Oscar. Which means they\u2019re also telling you what\u2019s not. And \u201cwhat\u2019s not\u201d tends to be as important as what is. And every year, I\u2019m left wondering whether months of punditry and daily forecasts of awards-season weather pollutes what was scarcely a pure process to begin with.It\u2019s a tough, funny, infuriating piece of business, in which a Vienna-born Los Angeles dress-shop owner (Helen Mirren) and a boyishly polite lawyer (Ryan Reynolds) fight the Austrian government for a Klimt painting the Nazis stole from her family. The story is based in truth, for what it\u2019s worth. And after 15 minutes, you know you\u2019re in good hands (Simon Curtis directed; Alexi Kaye Campbell did the script). Even the flashbacks to the affluent Jewish girlhood of Ms. Mirren\u2019s character work.His is a shameless piece of acting, but it\u2019s driven by so much confidence, so much sexiness, that all that\u2019s really embarrassing is how you ever doubted that he could still teem with this much louche charisma. Mr. Pacino is a Golden Globe nominee, and though I\u2019m reluctant to credit the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for anything, I salute it for this. He also brings out the best in Annette Bening, Christopher Plummer, Bobby Cannavale, Josh Peck and Jennifer Garner. Whatever an \u201cOscar movie\u201d is, this isn\u2019t it, which is all the more reason to consider it. Every person I\u2019ve forced to see it has been delighted. Why shouldn\u2019t those people include the men and women of the Academy?\u201cResults\u201d presented two personal trainers in Austin, Tex., and the miserable New Yorker they can\u2019t get into shape. Cobie Smulders and Guy Pearce play Kat and Trevor, the romantically dysfunctional trainers; Kevin Corrigan is Danny, the client; and none of those three have been better.At some point, Kat gives Trevor some inconvenient news, which he processes by rotating his body through his arms as he hangs from a pull-up bar. What\u2019s funny is that this is obviously how Trevor does his thinking and his emoting: through random expressions of fitness. That, and the fact that he\u2019s doing those pull-ups not in a gym but in a hallway outside his kitchen.Mr. Bujalski has come up with a movie that understands the peculiar chemistry of personality and occupation. Danny has come into a fortune and therefore doesn\u2019t work. With no job to offset his borderline obnoxiousness, he becomes insufferable. The character is maladroit, but Mr. Corrigan gives this potbellied, balding guy all the cool and sadness he can muster. His scenes with Ms. Smulders have a gemlike gleam. Kat is hard, detached from her feelings, obsessed with perfection and almost pathologically opposed to surrender.Setting aside Mr. Coogler\u2019s intelligent adjustment of the racial temperature \u2014 it\u2019s a reconsidering of the original movie rather than a rebuke \u2014 there is the rousing fact of his skill. The script takes the simple premise of an underrated light-heavyweight and doesn\u2019t oversell melodrama. Adonis is the son of Rocky\u2019s late foil-turned-friend, Apollo Creed. And there is honor in his compulsion to box. Mr. Coogler gives the compulsion emotional contour.The movie\u2019s got two wildly convincing fights, one done in a single take, another done to take your breath away. Then there\u2019s the hard grace of the acting. What Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone bring out in each other is funny, tender, earnest and not the least bit flamboyant. Mr. Jordan will just keep getting better with time; somehow Mr. Stallone has been made very good because of it. Mr. Stallone might have taken a chance on Mr. Coogler, but Mr. Coogler also took a chance on him. No one\u2019s leaning on nostalgia to move you. Your excitement is earned.Is there something undignified in pleading with 6,000 or so strangers to make room on their Oscar nomination ballots for movies they\u2019ve skipped or never heard of? Of course. But discovery is one of the joys of moviegoing. You just never know \u2014 even when the pundits insist that you do.Advertisement"}

But the restaurant\u2019s owner, Angus McIndoe, recently announced that he had not been able to agree to terms with his landlord that would allow him to keep the restaurant open. Sunday night would be Angus\u2019s last.\u201cThe idea was to open a restaurant that would be here forever for the theater people,\u201d Mr. McIndoe said on Sunday, as he stood near the front door greeting patrons. \u201cI think it kind of worked.\u201dMr. Lane, who sat at a table against a wall on Sunday night, was known to order a takeout dinner to be delivered to his dressing room between performances. Mr. Broderick would sometimes join other cast members there for a midnight repast after a show. Another early investor was Frank McCourt, the Irish-American schoolteacher turned best-selling memoirist. A framed dust jacket of his best-known book, \u201cAngela\u2019s Ashes,\u201d hangs on a wall in the third-floor bar, known as the Mac Bar.Sometime patrons included the actors Lauren Bacall, Robert De Niro, Katie Finneran and Kevin Spacey, the playwright Charles Busch and the novelist Kurt Vonnegut.Despite its eventual success, Angus\u2019s faced some bleak moments when it opened, less than two months after the terrorist attack that destroyed the World Trade Center and sent tremors through the local economy. The flow of tourists, seen by some as the lifeblood of Broadway, slowed to a trickle, and Mr. McIndoe wondered whether his restaurant would survive. A Broadway musician\u2019s strike in 2003 also hurt business, but by 2004 the restaurant was thriving, because of Mr. McIndoe\u2019s gregarious nature.Born in a village outside Glasgow, he moved to London as a teenager, worked in restaurants and wound up as a well-known and well-liked ma\u00eetre d\u2019h\u00f4tel at Joe Allen, a longtime Broadway staple on West 46th Street. At Angus\u2019s, Mr. McIndoe remembered names, personally seated guests and dispensed fond greetings to established stars and chorus youths alike. He regarded people who visited just a few times a year as valued regulars and could show a hint of chagrin if he had to turn a complete stranger away from a full house.\u201cAngus was like the father of the bride, all night every night,\u201d said Jackie Green, a theater press agent, who was sitting at the bar on Sunday. \u201cI came here because of him.\u201dThe restaurant was known as a homey hangout. Music was kept at a background level and bartenders sometimes played full albums by musicians like John Coltrane and Tom Waits. One highlight was about a month ago, Mr. McIndoe said, when Mr. Waits brought a portable keyboard up to the third-floor bar during a fund-raiser for the Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago and performed two songs.But it would not have been a true Broadway haunt without the odd bit of drama. In 2003, according to Michael Riedel, a theater columnist for The New York Post, the director of the troubled musical \u201cTaboo,\u201d which Rosie O\u2019Donnell spent $10 million to produce, worked late nights at the restaurant making changes to the show. The next year Mr. Riedel himself was a topic; he found himself on the floor there after an encounter with the director David Leveaux, whose work he had criticized.\u201cThis is a little theater in itself,\u201d Mr. Rhoton said, discussing the incident.Mr. McMahon, who provides piano accompaniment during Broadway auditions, mentioned a few fond memories. One included Elizabeth Ashley, whom he approached one night as he was leaving the restaurant, to let her know that he had admired her in \u201cCat on a Hot Tin Roof.\u201d\u201cShe looked right at me,\u201d Mr. McMahon remembered. \u201cAnd then she said, \u2018It helps to have a good script.\u2019 \u201dAn article in some editions on Monday about the closing of a Broadway hangout rendered its name incorrectly. It is Angus\u2019 Cafe Bistro, not Angus\u2019s Cafe and Bistro. The article also misidentified the birthplace of the author Frank McCourt, an early investor in the restaurant.

{"Headline": "France Forfeits Its Own Values", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorHOUSTON \u2014 IN French, the word \u201cd\u00e9ch\u00e9ance\u201d has several meanings, all of them bleak. It can refer to the fall of a civilization, or the degradation of the social fabric. More formally, it means the forfeiture of a right or a possession \u2014 one\u2019s citizenship, for example. All three meanings, carrying echoes of the country\u2019s experience under Vichy, resonate in a political drama unfolding in France.Two weeks ago, the Socialist prime minister, Manuel Valls, delivered a stunning blow to the French revolutionary ideal that citizenship is no less indivisible than the republic itself. He announced at a news conference that his government would introduce legislation this year to amend the Constitution to allow the government to strip French citizenship from individuals who are found guilty of acts of terrorism \u2014 but only if they are among the three million French citizens who hold dual nationality.Mr. Valls has the support of the leading conservative parties, the Republicans and the xenophobic National Front, but his own party exploded.Speaking for several dozen fellow deputies, Beno\u00eet Hamon, a former government minister, described the measure as \u201cinspired and supported by the National Front.\u201d Among the Socialists\u2019 erstwhile allies on the left, the outrage was even greater. Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, leader of the Left Party, denounced the \u201ccomplete moral d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance\u201d of the government, while C\u00e9cile Duflot of the Greens called upon \u201call republican consciences to awaken and refuse to step onto this slippery slope.\u201dThe news took even many in the Socialist government by surprise. The day before Mr. Valls\u2019s announcement, the outspoken minister of justice, Christiane Taubira, dismissed the idea of such legislation as null and void. \u201cIt will fizzle out on its own,\u201d she assured reporters, a statement echoed by other members of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s inner circle.Skeptical reporters could be forgiven, because the original idea came from Mr. Hollande himself. When he convened both houses of the French Parliament at Versailles three days after the Paris terrorist attacks, he came with three goals: to reassure a shaken nation, reaffirm his personal authority and restrain the right\u2019s ascendancy. In a Gallic variation on the Patriot Act, Mr. Hollande announced not just the extension of the state of emergency and expansion of the state\u2019s ability to gather intelligence, but also the constitutional wrinkle concerning terrorists\u2019 holding dual nationality.At the time, few Socialist politicians, still in shock over events, took that last goal seriously. Mr. Hollande and Mr. Valls had vehemently opposed the same proposal when the previous president, Nicolas Sarkozy, embraced it in 2010. But with the National Front\u2019s dramatic electoral gains in regional elections in December, things seemed to change: Successive polls revealing an overwhelming majority of French in favor of such a law most likely persuaded Mr. Hollande, whose approval ratings remain dismal, to carry out his original promise.Yet for many Socialists, already embittered by his modest efforts to \u201cliberalize\u201d the moribund economy, Mr. Hollande was committing both a moral crime and a political blunder. His proposal would in effect create two classes of citizens, the lesser of which would enjoy the rights and duties of citizenship, but with the proviso that they could be legally withdrawn by the state. Hence the explosion of anger when Mr. Valls worried that his Socialist critics had allowed \u201cgrand values\u201d to \u201clead them astray.\u201d Christian Paul spoke for a growing number of Socialist deputies when he replied: \u201cThose who forget their values lose their honor.\u201dSomething else has also been forgotten, however. While the question of citizenship is no small matter for any nation, it has a particularly compelling role in French history and identity. The French Revolution invented the modern conception of national citizenship and formalized the ideal of civil equality. Thanks to its revolutionary heritage, France juggles a unique combination of \u201cjus sanguinis\u201d \u2014 where children inherit their parents\u2019 nationality \u2014 and \u201cjus soli,\u201d where the soil one is born on, and not the parents one is born to, determines one\u2019s nationality. (Children born on French soil to foreigners become citizens at age 18, if they don\u2019t have a criminal record and have resided continuously in the country for five years.)This makes perfect sense for a country like France: not only is it a nation of immigrants, but it is also a nation supremely confident in its powers of assimilation. Until now, that is.Mr. Hollande\u2019s decision to hold fast to his presidential word is in fact a confession of weakness, an avowal that France has failed in its republican mission. It also undermines the status of three million Frenchmen and women by adding an asterisk to their status. This step, for some critics, is not unlike stamping the word \u201cJuif\u201d or \u201cJuive\u201d on the papers of French Jews under the collaborationist regime of Vichy, not to mention its stripping of citizenship in 1940 from naturalized French Jews.As the debate sharpens over the next few weeks, more than one lawmaker will wonder what the Constitution\u2019s founder would make of it. After all, 75 years ago last month Charles de Gaulle, who had left France for England to continue the war against Nazi Germany, was shorn of his French citizenship by Vichy.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the month Charles de Gaulle\u2019s citizenship was revoked by France\u2019s wartime Vichy government. It was in December, 1940, not January, 1941.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sri Lanka Destroys Illegal Elephant Tusks", "Date": "2016-01-26", "News": "Supported byCOLOMBO, Sri Lanka \u2014 A group of saffron-robed monks chanted as officials crushed more than 300 elephant tusks in a seaside ceremony on Tuesday, as the new government of President Maithripala Sirisena sought to differentiate itself from its predecessor by sending a powerful message of intolerance for elephant poaching.The crushed ivory weighed 1.5 tons, far less than some caches that have been destroyed. But the action was significant because Sri Lanka is a transit hub for trading in illegal ivory, which is popular in Asia as a symbol of prosperity and for use in Buddhist religious ceremonies. More than 100 tons of poached ivory have been destroyed since 1989, according to the World Wildlife Fund.Vidya Abhayagunawardena, an environmentalist who helped coordinate the event for the Sri Lankan Wildlife Ministry, said destroying the ivory sent a strong message to the Asian region, where the valuable tusks are perceived as symbols of wealth and class, and are used to create religious and cultural objects that continue to drive the illegal trade.The biggest demand is from several fast-growing economies in Asia, including Thailand and China, the world\u2019s largest consumer of ivory. The United Nations Environment Program says that surveys have documented a tripling of poaching and seizures of illegal ivory headed for Asia since 2007. In central and western Africa, the killing of elephants far exceeds their natural population replacement rate, the group says.The ceremonial crushing of the 359 tusks began with two minutes of silence, after which the group of Buddhist monks chanted prayers for a \u201crebirth without suffering\u201d for the elephants killed. In a show of religious solidarity, Hindu, Christian and Muslim leaders joined the monks in their prayers.After the ceremony, the crushed ivory was transported to a factory in Puttalam, a district in the island\u2019s northwest, for incineration, government officials said. DNA testing found that the tusks had originated in Tanzania, and the stockpile was valued at $2.6 million, the Sri Lanka Customs Department said.The tusks were confiscated by Sri Lankan customs officials in May 2012, en route to Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, from Kenya.Some of the world\u2019s leading wildlife advocates attended the event, held at Galle Face Green, a large seaside park in Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital. It was presided over by John E. Scanlon, the secretary general of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, an international agreement between governments that regulates the global wildlife trade. Sri Lanka has been a party to Cites since 1979.The ivory trade is part of what the World Wildlife Fund estimates is a $10 billion annual trade in illegal wildlife.Dharisha Bastians reported from Colombo, Sri Lanka, and Geeta Anand from Mumbai, India.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China Embraces Craft Beers, and Brewing Giants Take Notice", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 When Jin Xin first started selling imported premium beer a decade ago, his bar manager predicted that it would take a month or two just to sell a single case. But within a few years business picked up, and soon customers started frequenting the bar for its India pale ales and other European beers.Now, one of Mr. Jin\u2019s bars, NBeerPub, tucked away in a laid-back part of Beijing\u2019s old town, buzzes with young Chinese customers ordering imports like Delirium Tremens, Lindemans Framboise and Brewdog Punk IPA. Mr. Jin even sold a bottle of Brewmeister Snake Venom, a high-alcohol barleywine-style beer from Scotland, for about 2,700 renminbi, or more than $420.\u201cSlowly, Chinese people have more money in their pocket,\u201d Mr. Jin, 43, said in his apartment, where over 6,000 bottles from more than 60 countries filled the shelves. \u201cAfter they have money, some want something better in terms of taste as well as lifestyle, especially young people.\u201dAs tastes rapidly change, Chinese consumers are swapping mass-produced local beers for imports and local craft beers.The deal between Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller is the latest merger of mass-market beer brands.\u201cIt\u2019s an escape route from maturity in the West,\u201d said Spiros Malandrakis, a senior analyst of alcoholic drinks at the research firm Euromonitor International, referring to the established markets of the United States and Europe.In China, Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller are betting on premium products.The two beer behemoths were among the first international entrants into China in the 1990s and initially teamed with local brewers. At the time, domestic breweries produced beer of inconsistent quality, but they were quickly multiplying, and consumption was soaring along with disposable incomes.SABMiller took a 49 percent stake in a joint venture that makes Snow, which is now China\u2019s best-selling beer brand. Anheuser-Busch InBev has since bought Harbin and Sedrin, two other top domestic brands. Together, the international brewers account for about one-third of the overall beer market in China. As they pursue a merger, given their dominance, Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller are expected to prune their portfolio in China to keep regulators happy, though it remains unclear where the trimming will be done. Some analysts think they would be able financially to justify the sale of a big domestic brand like Snow, since the market is moving toward premium offerings.\u201cThey might be forced to divest, but it might not be the end of the world for them, because Snow is not necessarily the price point for them,\u201d said Shaun Rein, founder of China Market Research in Shanghai. \u201cConsumers are looking for better quality.\u201dWhen the deal was announced, Anheuser-Busch InBev said it would \u201cpromptly and proactively\u201d resolve any regulatory issues in China.The focus follows the shift in the market in recent years.Imports have swiftly grown to 1.4 billion renminbi in 2013, or around $220 million, from 335 million renminbi in 2009. But the total volume of beer sales in China has dipped of late. Homegrown craft beers are gaining favor. Beijing is home to about half a dozen microbreweries, and others have popped up in cities across China.At the Jing-A Brewing Taproom in Beijing, the owners, transplants from Connecticut and Toronto, serve American-inspired beers with local flair, including Worker\u2019s Pale Ale, Airpocalypse Double IPA and Mandarin Wheat.Ji Chen, a banker, developed a taste for fine beer as a student in Belgium. When he returned to China, Mr. Chen, now 28, started buying imported beer at the supermarket and hanging out at brew pubs.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s expensive,\u201d he said, sipping the Flying Fist IPA at Jing-A. \u201cIf you go out to drink at a bar, you would have to spend this much for any drink you get. And craft beers here are of good quality.\u201dThe high-end varieties can fatten a company\u2019s bottom line.\u201cAll of this premiumization and trading up is the biggest revenue driver of our industry,\u201d Jean Jereissati, Anheuser-Busch InBev\u2019s China president, said at an investor seminar in September. \u201cAnd it is very relevant for our company.\u201dAnheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller are digging deep into their cooler of longtime brands in the hope of attracting more discerning customers. In part, they are promoting the provenance of their brands.Lifestyle, too, is major selling point.\u201cThey put a lot of money into the marketing, the heritage \u2014 all those things make consumers pay more for it,\u201d said Jonny Forsyth, a global drinks analyst at Mintel, a research firm. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s been missing in China. Younger people are more receptive to it.\u201dThe message is getting through to consumers, who are increasingly willing to pay for beer.At Heaven Supermarket, a store and bar with a backpacker vibe, Chen Jing, 30, browsed through the imported beer with her boyfriend, both of them clutching beers that cost about 50 renminbi each, or nearly $8. A bottle of Snow from the grocery store next door cost just 1.9 renminbi, or about 30 cents.Most of the bottles going through the checkout at Heaven are overseas varieties like Hoegaarden, Corona and Budweiser, selling for 15 renminbi. And the store, across the road from a Rolls-Royce and Bentley dealership, is not short of people perusing more expensive beers, which can cost up to 100 renminbi, or about $15.Ms. Chen started drinking foreign beer after vacationing around China and Southeast Asia. She has taken such a liking to the beer culture that she is planning a holiday in Belgium.\u201cI would rather be spending money on few quality beers than buying lots of cheap beers and feeling full and headachy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s more about the lifestyle I choose than simply drinking.\u201dAmie Tsang reported from Hong Kong and Cao Li contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

And it shows, he added, in the language of Republicans seeking their party\u2019s presidential nomination: \u201cWe either want to say, \u2018Our way or the highway,\u2019 or we say, \u2018Build a wall.\u2019\u201dThe overhaul of the I.M.F., which now has 188 countries as members, will be the most significant since the organization was formed in 1945 as an international lender of last resort to foster global stability and reduce poverty after decades of world wars and economic depression.The changes, spearheaded in 2010 by the Obama administration, are intended to reset members\u2019 quotas for contributions and their voting shares to better reflect the current world. They would raise the status of emerging nations \u2014 in particular China, but also India, Russia and Brazil \u2014 at the expense of European and Persian Gulf nations. The United States would retain its veto power.While quotas would be doubled to buttress I.M.F. lending, that would cost the United States and other countries relatively little because emergency funds affluent countries provided in the crisis would be counted toward members\u2019 quotas.Yet after taking the lead in designing the overhaul, the United States was the holdout as the proposal languished in Congress. \u201cMy counterparts were saying, \u2018We trust you, but we don\u2019t know if we trust the United States to get this done,\u2019\u201d Mr. Lew said.He pressed Republican leaders in Congress and by April had their commitments to help pass the overhaul in 2015. Mr. Lew said he took part in hundreds of calls \u2014 including a crucial round with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, while he was in Armenia for the centennial of the Armenian massacre. With the phone system there overwhelmed by the throngs in the streets, the Americans kept losing their connections, Mr. Lew recalled.For months, a series of bills were considered and rejected as vehicles for an I.M.F. amendment, out of fear that the I.M.F. bill would endanger its carrier. In December, the overhaul got its ride on the year\u2019s last must-pass bill, which funded government operations through September.Mr. Lew said two factors crystallized the argument that American credibility and leadership were at stake. One was the need to persuade the I.M.F., and the emerging nations among its members, to aid Ukraine. The other was the rise of China\u2019s new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which was poised to fill a vacuum left by the United States.While I.M.F. members and its managing director, Christine Lagarde, supported the change, Mr. Truman called it \u201ca horrible precedent\u201d for Congress to impose such conditions. Still, he applauded Mr. Taylor for his role in gathering Republican support.Mr. Taylor, for his part, said: \u201cThis is an international organization, and many parts of the country don\u2019t even know what it is. Members had to have a reason to vote for it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Proof That a Price on Carbon Works", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported byEditorialLawmakers who oppose taking action to lower greenhouse gas emissions by putting a price on carbon often argue that doing so would hurt businesses and consumers. But the energy policies adopted by some American states and Canadian provinces demonstrate that those arguments are simply unfounded.Carbon pricing comes in two forms: a direct tax on emissions or a cap on emissions. British Columbia, for instance, has levied a tax on emissions from fuels like gasoline, natural gas and heating oil. California and Quebec, which are working together, place a ceiling on overall emissions and allow utilities, manufacturing plants, fuel distributors and others to buy and sell permits that entitle them to emit greenhouse gases. Like the cap itself, the number of permits decline over time, becoming more expensive.Many economists regard carbon taxes as the simpler and more elegant solution, and cap-and-trade systems like the one that failed in the United States Congress as complex and hard to explain. But both systems effectively raise the price of using fossil fuels, which encourages utilities and other producers to generate more energy from low-carbon sources like solar, wind and nuclear power.These actions deserve applause. But their real value may lie in providing a template for the rest of the world. Broad participation is essential to keeping warming below a point of no return; as a practical matter, it is also essential to keep companies from moving their operations to nations that do not impose a cost on carbon emissions.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In China, Shares Remain Volatile; Europe Markets Are Steady", "Date": "2016-01-11", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Chinese stocks plunged again on Monday, as jittery investors worried about whether the authorities could manage the financial market turmoil and a broader economic slowdown.Following steep losses last week, the main Shanghai share index fell 5.3 percent on Monday. The benchmark Shenzhen index ended the day down 6.6 percent.Global stocks, though, largely shrugged off the slump in China, with Asian and European stocks steadying after a tumultuous week. The futures markets pointed to gains on Wall Street.After several months of relative calm, global investors have faced a wild ride, set off by weakness in the Chinese stock market and currency. The troubles have raised concerns about the health of the country\u2019s economy, a major engine of global growth.\u201cA China hard landing is bad for capital markets, and we think the risk is uncomfortably high, higher than we would prefer,\u201d Bob Browne, the chief investment officer at Northern Trust, said Monday morning in an interview in Hong Kong. A sharp slowdown was not the likeliest outcome for China\u2019s economy, Mr. Browne added, but it remained a cause for worry among global investors.The government\u2019s messy attempts to manage the situation have added to investors\u2019 anxiety.While the government is pushing for major overhauls, it has also kept a tight control over areas like the market and currency. It is sending a mixed message to investors, making it more difficult to navigate the markets.Take the so-called circuit breaker mechanism, a newly installed measure that halts trading when losses reach a certain threshold.The mechanism, a response to last summer\u2019s stock plunge, was intended to bring greater stability to the markets. But it deepened the losses last week.The government backtracked, suspending the use of the circuit breaker late Thursday. In a stark admission, the main securities regulator acknowledged that it had \u201cno experience\u201d operating such a mechanism.Adding to the recent uncertainty has been the renewed weakness of China\u2019s currency, the renminbi.The renminbi, which is tightly controlled by the government, has been steadily falling in recent weeks. While that has helped exporters, it has also pushed companies and families to pull money out of the country, in anticipation that their wealth will be worth less.The government tried to calm the markets by setting the renminbi\u2019s official exchange rate stronger against the dollar for the second day in a row. But it is also making it difficult to discern the motives of policy makers.The strengthening in the official exchange rate on Monday set off a scramble for offshore renminbi in Hong Kong, where the currency is more freely traded, albeit in smaller volumes.The overnight bank-to-bank borrowing rate for offshore renminbi in Hong Kong rose sharply on Monday to a record high of 13.4 percent. Such a drastic, short-term spike in demand can indicate a so-called short squeeze, in which investors betting that the currency will continue to weaken are forced to buy it to avoid losses, temporarily increasing its value.Stock investors in China took a dim view of the currency, bringing the total losses on the Shanghai market to 15 percent this year. The sharp sell-off spilled over into Hong Kong, where the Hang Seng, which includes a large numbers of companies from the mainland, closed down 2.8 percent. Markets in Japan were closed for a holiday.Global investors, though, were more sanguine.Shares in Europe were steady, after falling slightly in early trading. The blue-chip FTSE 100 in London rose 0.1 percent in afternoon trading, while the DAX in Frankfurt gained 0.6 percent.An earlier version of this article misstated when China set the renminbi stronger against the dollar. The rate was set stronger on Friday and Monday, not just on Monday.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Is the Economy Doing? It May Depend on Your Party, and $1", "Date": "2016-01-01", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewSuppose it is dinnertime, and the phone rings. It is a polite survey taker with a simple question for you: How is the economy doing?You might answer the question based upon the news stories you\u2019ve seen recently about the latest unemployment rate, or perhaps based on anecdotal observations, such as whether your long-jobless cousin has had any luck finding work.But a wide range of academic work suggests a different factor that is likely to shape your answer: whether the current occupant of the White House is of your preferred political party.Did unemployment get better or worse during Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency? In a 1988 survey, some 80 percent of dedicated Republicans accurately said it had improved, compared with 30 percent of loyal Democrats. In the 1990s, the pattern reversed on a range of factual questions about economic and fiscal issues. In a 1997 survey, for example, Republicans were far less likely than Democrats to acknowledge that the budget deficit had declined during the Bill Clinton administration.As an economics writer, I see the same thing anecdotally. When I wrote articles recently about the unemployment rate\u2019s dip to 5 percent, I received vehement responses from conservatives convinced that the Obama administration was cooking the numbers. They were not so different from responses I received from liberals when the jobless rate was at that level in 2005, during the George W. Bush administration.In other words, when you ask people about the economy, the answers are less a statement of objectivity and more like what they\u2019d say if you\u2019d asked which pro football team was the best. That has important implications for democracy. How can people judge whether a party is effective if there is no sense of objective truth? And it could even have implications for the economy itself if, for example, conservative-leaning business executives freeze hiring or investment when the president doesn\u2019t share their politics.But new research from two teams of political scientists adds a wrinkle to these findings. It turns out that the partisan bias in how people answer factual questions about the economy is diminished by this one weird trick: Pay people.When survey respondents were offered a small cash reward \u2014 a dollar or two \u2014 for producing a correct answer about the unemployment rate and other economic conditions, they were more likely to be accurate and less likely to produce an answer that fit their partisan biases.In other words, when money was added to the equation, questions about the economy became less like asking people which football team they thought was best, and more like asking them to place a wager. Even a little bit of cash gets people to think harder about the situation and answer more objectively.\u201cPeople are not telling you what they actually believe in ordinary surveys,\u201d Mr. Bullock said. \u201cWith a payment, we\u2019re eliciting not necessarily thoughtful responses, but more sincere responses.\u201dThe effect was even more pronounced when respondents were rewarded for honestly answering \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d when they didn\u2019t have enough information. Otherwise, it appears that people will respond objectively to questions when they know the answer, but revert to their partisan biases when they don\u2019t.The paper by Mr. Bullock, Alan S. Gerber, Seth J. Hill and Gregory A. Huber found that offering a $1 payment for a correct response and a 33-cent payment for an answer of \u201cDon\u2019t know\u201d eliminated the entire partisan gap between Democrats and Republicans on questions about the economy.Interestingly, in the paper by Mr. Prior, Gaurav Sood and Kabir Khanna, the cash payments became less effective at coaxing an accurate answer if the question mentioned the president by name. George W. Bush was president at the time of the survey, but by extension it appears that Americans can be more objective answering a question like \u201cIs the unemployment rate lower or higher than it was seven years ago?\u201d than a question like \u201cIs the unemployment rate lower or higher than it was when Barack Obama became president?\u201d even though as a factual matter those are the same question.The research could have interesting parallels beyond the realm of opinion surveys. It calls to mind, for example, energy executives who might support politicians who deny that climate change is happening, but when doing their jobs with real money on the line, accept the scientific consensus that the planet is warming, and plan accordingly. Similarly, people who hate the Affordable Care Act and think it is a disastrous public policy will nonetheless take advantage of it to obtain health insurance.The findings have some interesting implications for democracy, too, though depending on your inclination you could view it as good news or bad.The good news is this: No matter how politically polarized society might seem, there is an objective reality we can agree upon on how the economy is performing and on other measures of national well-being. It just takes a little skin in the game to get people to acknowledge those facts when they are at odds with their political instincts.\u201cTo put it bluntly, this is bad news for survey research, but good news for democracy,\u201d as the Prior paper puts it.Mr. Bullock isn\u2019t certain. The research supports the idea that \u201cpeople are not as deluded as we imagine,\u201d but he doesn\u2019t see this as all good news.\u201cYes, people are less deluded about objective conditions than we imagined, but that also implies that peoples\u2019 belief about objective conditions matters less for how they vote than we thought,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always thought that how people vote depended a lot on the state of the economy and the state of war. But maybe those objective realities matter less than we thought.\u201dIn other words, people don\u2019t simply look at how the economy is doing and whether the nation is at peace, and decide whether to vote for the incumbent party based on those realities. Instead they have political preferences that stay in place regardless of how the country is doing. That implies that political parties won\u2019t be rewarded for delivering good performance, or punished for bad performance.Whether one takes the optimistic or pessimistic case for democracy from these findings, one conclusion is hard to escape. We all might be wiser, and more sensible, if we tried to understand the world as it is, not as our political views suggest we want it to be. We\u2019ll be smarter for it \u2014 even if we don\u2019t have a researcher paying us a dollar or two.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Some Cars by Renault and Other Makers Fail French Air-Quality Emissions Tests", "Date": "2016-01-14", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 The French government said on Thursday that tests on exhaust emissions of nearly two dozen cars made by Renault and other automakers had found that \u201cseveral\u201d of the cars violated the country\u2019s air-quality standards.But the government said tests still underway had so far found no evidence of technology meant to cheat on emissions tests, except on two Volkswagen models the government had tested.The French environment minister, S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, told reporters after the test results were released that Renault was one of the companies whose car emissions were found to exceed the allowable limits of carbon dioxide \u2014 a greenhouse gas \u2014 and nitrogen oxide, a health hazard. Earlier in the day, Renault\u2019s stock price plunged on news that the government had recently searched the company\u2019s offices in Boulogne-Billancourt, near Paris, as part of the investigation.The French government provided few details on Thursday of its findings so far but said it would work with the companies to try to bring their cars into compliance with air-quality standards.The shares recovered somewhat after Renault said that government investigators had so far found no wrongdoing. But they still ended down more than 10 percent in Paris trading.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.The French economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, speaking to reporters late in the day during a visit to Berlin, insisted that Renault was \u201cin no way a comparable situation\u201d to that of Volkswagen and expressed his \u201cconfidence\u201d in the French manufacturer, which is 15 percent owned by the French state.The Volkswagen scandal has called attention to the discrepancies between what diesel cars emit during official laboratory tests and how much they pollute in everyday driving. European rules ban so-called defeat devices meant to trick emissions testers, but carmakers have broad leeway to tune their cars to perform well on the tests.Efforts to tighten testing procedures \u2014 and to test cars on the road rather than just in the lab \u2014 have run into strong opposition in the European Parliament from legislators in countries like Germany that have large auto industries.In a statement on Thursday, the French Environment Ministry said tests had been conducted by UTAC, a private French company appointed by the ministry to review the emissions performance of French carmakers, on 22 vehicles of 100 that the government plans to test. The ministry said that the initial round of tests found that just two vehicles, both made by Volkswagen, had defeat devices installed. The statement did not specify the models.The ministry said \u201cseveral\u201d foreign manufacturers and one French company \u2014 which Ms. Royal subsequently identified as Renault \u2014 exceeded emission standards for carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide.The ministry\u2019s statement said that Renault had already indicated it would \u201cexchange views with members of the commission at its next meeting,\u201d referring to the government-appointed commission reviewing the tests. \u201cSimilarly, other manufacturers will be invited,\u201d the ministry said.Renault said it was cooperating fully with the government\u2019s investigation.Fabienne Barbey, a company spokeswoman, said late Thursday that Renault had been in discussions with the commission since last month about the discrepancies found between lab results and road tests on some of its vehicles and about the ways Renault planned to address them. Ms. Barbey cited a company statement on Dec. 17 announcing plans to invest 50 million euros, or about $54 million, toward an \u201caccelerated deployment\u201d of a new exhaust-gas recirculation system for its diesel vehicles that would \u201csignificantly reduce the gaps\u201d identified between the real-world and laboratory emissions test results of its cars.The company expects to start installing the enhanced exhaust treatment system in new cars starting in July.Nicola Clark reported from Paris, and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Retail Sales Were Lackluster in December, Signaling Fragile Economy", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byBut even excluding receipts of autos and gas, retail sales were flat in December, after a 0.4 percent rise in November. Economists had forecast that December would mirror the gains recorded in the previous month.The National Retail Federation, an industry trade group, separately estimated that holiday sales rose just 3 percent from the previous year, far below its projection of 3.7 percent growth.Lackluster retail sales also reflect wider shifts in the habits and fortunes of many American consumers, economists say. Much of the wage gain has come at the top end of the wage distribution, leaving many middle-income Americans feeling less than well-off. And burned by the Great Recession, many households have increased their savings, while paring back borrowing.When they do spend, more shoppers hunt for deals, a shift evident in the recent success of heavy discounters like T.J. Maxx and Marshalls. To compete, major department store chains like Macy\u2019s and Nordstrom have raced to open their own off-price locations.For the rest of the retail industry, business has become a cutthroat battle for market share, involving longer sales seasons and deeper discounts.This holiday\u2019s winners include Lululemon Athletica, the upscale maker of stretchy yoga pants, which raised its earnings outlook as it continued to ride a boom in athletics wear. L Brands, which owns Victoria\u2019s Secret, reported its \u201cbest December ever\u201d after the lingerie brand generated holiday buzz with a star-studded fashion show.While falling prices for crucial items may be good news for consumers in the short term, a prolonged fall can condition consumers to hold off on spending as they wait for better deals.

{"Headline": "For Stock Markets, January Is a Cloudy Crystal Ball", "Date": "2016-01-07", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseAs January goes, so goes the entire market year.That\u2019s probably the best-known aphorism from the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac, an annual compilation of dates, statistics and advice for investors first published in 1968 by Yale Hirsch. A prolific author of pithy investment advice, Mr. Hirsch also created the strategy often referred to as \u201cSell in May and go away,\u201d and he identified a year-end seasonal \u201cSanta Claus\u201d rally.His so-called January barometer posits that a decline in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index in January means that major averages will also end that calendar year with a decline, and vice versa if stocks rise during the month.Given the global plunge in stock market prices this week \u2014 United States and European shares dropped sharply on Thursday in the face of market turmoil in China \u2014 it may be a grim year for stock investors. With the S.&P. 500 already down more than 5 percent in just the first four days of trading of the year, this is shaping up as one of the worst Januarys ever. (In January 2009, the index declined 8.6 percent.) If the selling keeps up through the end of the month, the almanac suggests investors should sell stocks and wait for the inevitable further decline.If only it were that simple.It\u2019s tempting to dismiss the January barometer as just another statistical coincidence, along with other market predictors that have enjoyed periodic bursts of popularity, such as the Super Bowl indicator (if the winning team is from the old National Football League, now the National Football Conference, stocks will rise); the Chinese zodiac (years of the rabbit and dragon are best for stocks); or the old hemline indicator (skirt lengths shorten during market upswings and fall to the floor during downturns).The impulse when the stock market falls hard for a few days in a row is to do something but it probably doesn\u2019t make much sense to overhaul an investment strategy based on a blip of market activity.But Mr. Hirsch\u2019s son Jeff, who now runs the publishing and investment business his father founded, calculates that the January barometer has been right 87.7 percent of the time since 1950 (ignoring basically flat years) and 75 percent of the time including all years. He said the percentages were roughly the same extending back to 1938. He also examined all other months of the year, and none displayed any predictive capacity. (April was next best, but showed only a modest correlation with subsequent stock movements, he said.)Traders react to them immediately, usually with considerable foresight, and then the economic implications unfold throughout the year, confirming the traders\u2019 January instincts. \u201cTraders and analysts react to the political agenda, as well as what the new year looks like based on last year and the state of the world economy,\u201d Mr. Hirsch told me this week. \u201cI think that\u2019s the root of it.\u201dEspecially ominous this year is the Almanac\u2019s \u201cFirst Five Days\u201d indicator, which posits that in presidential election years, the market\u2019s performance during the first five days of trading will determine whether the market ends up or down for the year. Mr. Hirsch said that indicator had been accurate in 14 of the last 16 such years.But such causation in the stock market is impossible to prove or disprove, unlike, say, the link between smoking and lung cancer.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.\u201cYou can\u2019t possibly prove this is causal or even predictive, which might be a better concept,\u201d said Rebecca Goldin, a mathematics professor at George Mason University and director of research for Stats.org. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t, but you\u2019d need to know much more.\u201dShe pointed out that a 75 or 87 percent correlation sounds impressive, but not if the stock market goes up every year, in which case it is meaningless. In fact, the stock market does tend to rise more often than it falls: It has gained in 21 of the last 30 years, or 70 percent of the time. So simply predicting every year that the stock market would go up would have been nearly as accurate as the 75 percent rate achieved by the January barometer when all years were included.Moreover, using January to predict the outcome for the full calendar year incorporates January\u2019s results, which further biases the prediction.Given the vast number of variables that might be used to predict stock prices, it\u2019s possible that even a high degree of accuracy of the January barometer is a purely random outcome.\u201cIf you have a truly random variable, and there are, say, 60 million possibilities, it\u2019s impossible not to find some pattern somewhere,\u201d said Nassim Nicholas Taleb, a professor of risk engineering at New York University, author of \u201cThe Black Swan\u201d and a former derivatives trader on Wall Street. \u201cYou might well find a correlation between changes in your grandmother\u2019s blood pressure and stock prices. But that\u2019s a spurious correlation.\u201dHe added, \u201cIt\u2019s surprising we don\u2019t have more weird correlations, given the vast number of possible variables and the large number of markets we have.\u201dProfessor Goldin said that if you flipped enough coins every year, you would most likely find one that predicted stock prices with 100 percent accuracy. \u201cYou could call that a magic coin,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has an impressive correlation looking backward. The problem is, it wouldn\u2019t give you any sense of how well it\u2019s going to do going forward.\u201dThat seems to have been an issue lately with the January barometer, whose accuracy in recent years has been slipping. Over the last 10 years, it gave false negative indications in 2014, 2010, 2009 and 2005, and a false positive in 2011.That\u2019s a success rate of just 50 percent, which is what you would expect from a coin toss.And the magnitude of a January decline doesn\u2019t seem to be a factor. In 2009, after a dreadful start, the S.&P. 500 gained more than 23 percent for the year. In two of the four years since 1950 when the January decline was greater than 6 percent, the index ended the year with a gain.That has not curbed popular demand for Mr. Hirsch\u2019s insights. He has been deluged with media requests this week and has been making television appearances talking about the almanac and the January barometer. Most likely for evolutionary reasons, the human mind looks for patterns, and it is uncomfortable with randomness.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.\u201cThere\u2019s a reason people love almanacs,\u201d Professor Taleb said. \u201cThey purport to find order in random events, like weather or the seasons. People have an irrational belief in them.\u201d\u201cOur brains are hard-wired to find causality,\u201d Professor Goldin said. \u201cThat\u2019s especially true for the stock market. The stock market may not be entirely random, but there\u2019s enough about it that is to make it unpredictable. The desire to find a pattern is really strong because if you\u2019re right, it could make you rich.\u201d(Some, like the mathematician and quantitative hedge fund manager James Simons, do seem to have found such patterns, and Forbes estimates Mr. Simons\u2019s net worth at $14 billion. But as far as is known, his formulas cannot be reduced to a single catchy sentence.)Even Mr. Hirsch does not rely entirely on the January barometer, which he said was just one of many technical and fundamental factors he takes into consideration when making investment decisions. \u201cI try not to be too one-dimensional, and use all the tools available,\u201d he said. Although he\u2019s not nearly as bullish this year as he was last year, \u201cI\u2019m not throwing in the towel yet,\u201d he said.Professor Taleb said that despite this week\u2019s decline in share prices, he would not be buying United States stocks now because of high valuations, rising interest rates and the continuing plunge in commodity prices. And while that decision has nothing to do with a bearish forecast from the January barometer, he doesn\u2019t entirely dismiss such market maxims.\u201cOne thing you learn as a trader is, don\u2019t bet against the folk wisdom,\u201d he said. \u201cThe odds are this is a purely random outcome, but sometimes there\u2019s a kernel of truth in these sayings.\u201dThe Common Sense column on Friday, about what the stock market\u2019s performance in January means for the rest of the year, gave an outdated name for the organization for which Rebecca Goldin, a mathematics professor at George Mason University who commented on the issue, is research director. It is Stats.org, no longer the Statistical Assessment Service.Advertisement"}

Audiences typically respond to the destruction of the Death Star with triumphant cheers.When the Rebel Alliance emerged victorious in \u201cReturn of the Jedi\u201d and, presumably, chose to repudiate the imperial debts from both Death Stars, there would have been a drop of nearly 8.5 percent in gross galactic product (G.G.P.), according to my analysis, an almost sure path to economic depression. In only 40 percent of my simulations, the financial system absorbed this shock to the banking sector. However, the other 60 percent of cases set off a systemic crisis that crippled the galactic economy.Fortunately, \u201cStar Wars\u201d is a work of fiction. Unfortunately, as we witnessed in 2008, financial systemic risk is a very real threat to the economic well-being of the United States and the world. As with a medical epidemic, understanding the causes, symptoms and progression of a contagious event is necessary to prevent economic illness. Financial contagion is the spreading of losses of individual institutions to other firms, and ultimately to the whole economy. That contagion can occur through local or global interactions: for example, locally through direct financial obligations, and globally to any bank through the impact on asset prices.BECAUSE of the large cost to society, it is important that we accurately model what occurs in a systemic crisis. This is why my model of the \u201cStar Wars\u201d economy \u2014 a system of mathematical equations \u2014 is not entirely silly. Financial-contagion models provide a glimpse into how the financial sector can affect the health of the entire economy. Just as I made simplifying assumptions to price the Death Star, researchers construct mathematical models (in all fields) by looking at the world and translating what they observe into mathematical formulas.Over time, through the efforts of researchers worldwide, these formulas are refined, making the model more realistic but also more complicated. These mathematical models, as simplifications of the real world, reveal which properties are general and which are specific to the crisis at hand. If done properly, they can help inform decision makers on how to prevent or mitigate future systemic crises.I have found that the general lessons learned from studying financial risk do not always hold true during a systemic crisis. For the individual investor or bank, greater diversification is a prudent strategy to reduce risk. However, increasing diversification at all institutions might create new channels of contagion, which would exacerbate rather than mitigate a systemic crisis.With my simple model, I have also found that when banks (and the Trade Federation in \u201cStar Wars\u201d) compete to maximize profits during a systemic crisis, they can unintentionally devalue financial assets to levels lower than necessary to reach a post-crisis equilibrium. As a consequence, this exacerbates the spread of the economic disease.Because of the tremendous costs associated with systemic crises, it is paramount that we continue to study how to model financial contagion and measure systemic risk. As \u201cStar Wars\u201d proves, sometimes these crises can appear when and where we least expect them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Indebted Chinese Companies Increase Pressures on Government", "Date": "2016-01-17", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Sainty Marine Corporation started small, buying and selling a few ships in the 1980s. But Sainty Marine, a Chinese state-owned company, went on a debt-fueled binge over the last few years, opening its own shipyards and signing orders worth hundreds of millions of dollars each.Sainty Marine just found itself in court, as one of China\u2019s biggest banks asked to dismantle the company to recoup overdue loans. Government regulators are investigating the accuracy of the company\u2019s financial reports, its bank accounts have recently been frozen and its shares have not traded on the Shenzhen stock market since August.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty dire,\u201d said Matthew Flynn, a Hong Kong shipping consultant.Shipbuilding is part of a long list of Chinese industries, including steelmaking, coal mining and auto manufacturing, that borrowed heavily from state-run banks to expand during the good years, helping to propel the country\u2019s three decades of double-digit annual economic growth. But growth has now slipped to around 7 percent, and many companies are running low on cash.The direction of the Chinese economy has made global investors nervous and weighs on the price of oil. And troubled companies like Sainty Marine are clouding the outlook.For years, state-owned companies could regularly mark up their prices to help them pay off their loans. As customers now pull back and deflationary pressures set in, companies are being forced to cut prices, while facing the same debt payments.But ever more borrowing leaves China vulnerable, as company blowups add to the pressures. Last year, total debts of all sorts in China \u2014 household, corporate and government \u2014 increased by an amount equal to 12 percent of the entire country\u2019s economy. Overall lending expanded in December at the fastest pace since June, figures released by the central bank on Friday show.Companies in industrial sectors, which accounted for the bulk of borrowing, are navigating a treacherous environment.Low or falling prices mean that companies need to sharply increase their sales volume every year to have enough revenue to cover their debt payments. But increasing sales is hard in a slowing economy.China is not the only country with falling producer prices. They are also down in the United States from a year ago amid weak prices for oil and other commodities.What makes China unusual is that companies are coping with sharply rising labor costs. Blue-collar wages are up nearly 10 percent a year, as the work force ages and more young people prefer white-collar jobs. Overinvestment in many sectors is also resulting in too many factories and other businesses chasing the same limited sales.\u201cThe combination of rising staff costs and lower prices is a real challenge,\u201d said Sabine Bauer, a senior director for financial institutions in the Hong Kong office of Fitch Ratings.Shipbuilders like Sainty Marine illustrate the litany of problems.Up and down the Chinese coastline, in harbors and along coastal rivers, companies bought big plots of land, purchased cranes, and hired large numbers of welders. China expanded from one-fifth of global shipbuilding capacity in 2008 to two-fifths by last year.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.Quality control was a problem from the start. \u201cIn China, building what are supposed to be two identical ships in two adjacent slips, you get two different vessels,\u201d said Basil Karatzas, a Manhattan ship broker. \u201cIn Japan, they can build 10 ships and they are all the same.\u201dWith many Chinese shipyards dogged by complaints, competition was fierce. Japanese and South Korean shipyards demanded 20 percent down payments for orders, plus a guarantee from an international bank to pay the rest of the cost if the buyer defaulted. Although Chinese shipyards demanded the same deposits, they did not require the guarantees, and accepted orders from what were effectively shell companies with weak finances.That put Chinese shipyards at risk.If ship prices fell sharply, buyers could forfeit their deposits and not pay for the rest of the vessel, leaving the shipyard stuck with the project. As global demand for commodities withered in the last two years, ship prices dropped more than 20 percent \u2014 and in some cases, more.For the 58,000-ton bulk freighters that Chinese shipyards were churning out, prices have plunged from nearly $30 million in 2013 to just $16 million now. Buyers who bought at the high end chose to forfeit their deposits instead of paying for finished vessels worth less.Chinese shipyards are now littered with half-finished shells, like immense steel earthworms cut in two. Many shipyards lack the money to complete vessels and sell them at a discount that might allow them to recover some costs.Even strong buyers are balking at completing deals. Sainty Marine has four finished vessels that were rejected by Precious Shipping of Bangkok. Precious Shipping backed away in a dispute over the quality that has resulted in an arbitration case in London.The Bank of China, one of the country\u2019s biggest commercial banks, pushed Sainty Marine into court on Tuesday in the shipyard\u2019s hometown, Nanjing, in Jiangsu Province. The bank requested the appointment of a liquidator, as Sainty Marine is already overdue on $81 million in loans.Mixed policy signals from China have roiled global investors. Here are five officials who are calling the shots in Beijing.A Sainty Marine official who gave only her family name, Ma, said that the court had held hearings last week, but added that she was not aware of any decisions. The bank and the court had no comment.It is rare for state-owned banks to pursue debts so aggressively.But banks usually keep rolling over debts and lending more, particularly for state-owned companies like Sainty Marine, where the controlling shareholder is Jiangsu Province. The government has been hesitant to completely shut down companies, over fears that large-scale layoffs might lead to protests.The shipbuilding industry, though, is in complete disarray, with dozens of Chinese companies lacking any orders. The government, which has halted export credits for the sector, seems determined to force some closings.In other circumstances, a weaker currency might offer relief.When the currency drops, it makes imported goods more expensive. That helps stave off deflationary pressures that hurt companies\u2019 ability to raise prices. It also makes labor costs look lower in dollar terms, which in turn can help attract overseas investment.Those dynamics are a big reason the Chinese government has been letting the renminbi fall.But the currency is also challenging.A weaker renminbi could further dampen Chinese demand for imported commodities, which are typically priced in dollars. As Chinese appetite wanes, freight stagnates and shipping companies have even less need for new vessels.It\u2019s a disastrous situation for Sainty Marine. \u201cEven for what\u2019s in the order books,\u201d said Mr. Flynn, the shipping consultant, \u201cpeople don\u2019t want to take delivery of the vessels.\u201dOwen Guo contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A January Pause, but Fed Affirms Plan for Gradual Rate Increases", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve entered 2016 with a fairly straightforward plan to gradually increase its benchmark interest rate so long as job growth remained strong.\u201cI still think they are going to raise rates in March,\u201d said Gus Faucher, a senior economist at PNC Bank. \u201cI don\u2019t want to oversell it, but I think that while what goes on overseas has an impact on the U.S. economy, what\u2019s much more important is what goes on domestically.\u201dIn response to the Fed announcement, equity markets fell broadly on Wednesday. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell 1.1 percent to close at 1,882.95. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was unchanged at 2 percent.Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, said after the December announcement that \u201cthe economic recovery has clearly come a long way, although it is not complete.\u201dThe new policy statement suggested that the Fed\u2019s confidence in the economic outlook had since deteriorated.In December, it described the chances of faster and slower growth as \u201cbalanced.\u201d This time, the Fed reserved judgment. \u201cThe committee is closely monitoring global economic and financial developments and is assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation, and for the balance of risks to the outlook,\u201d the statement said.The Fed noted that some economic measuring sticks were doing well, like continued job growth, more spending by businesses and consumers and the revival of the housing market.On the other hand, it said domestic economic growth apparently slowed in the final months of 2015. Equity markets have fallen sharply in January, erasing wealth and weighing on confidence, while the dollar continues to gain strength, limiting demand for American exports.Forecasters estimate the economy expanded at an annual rate below 1 percent in the last three months of 2015. The government will publish a preliminary estimate on Friday.The weakness and the risk that things will get worse have persuaded some analysts that the Fed is unlikely to raise rates again until the summer, or perhaps even later.\u201cBased on the state of the economy today, we believe the bar has become insurmountable for a follow-up rate hike in March,\u201d Ellen Zentner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley, wrote on Wednesday. Ms. Zentner noted that investors were betting against a March increase, based on the price of assets tied closely to short-term interest rates, and she said it was significant that the Fed had made little effort to alter those expectations.Mr. Dudley also emphasized the Fed\u2019s focus on job growth. Officials expect inflation to increase as labor market conditions improve. They are raising interest rates before that happens because monetary policy exerts a gradual influence on economic conditions, and they are concerned that inflation will begin to rise too quickly. Mr. Dudley said that when the Fed needed to regain control of inflation, it generally ended up causing a recession.One question mark for the Fed is the impact of global weakness on the domestic economy.Some officials see little evidence that slow growth in the rest of the developed world, and problems in China and other developing nations, will interfere significantly with domestic growth. The United States, after all, is by far the largest consumer of its own goods.Others, however, argue that the risks are being understated. The divergence between the United States and its major trading partners has increased the value of the dollar, reducing demand for exports like manufactured products and farm goods. Worries about global growth have unsettled equity markets, taking a bite out of household savings.Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, said it made sense for the Fed to avoid coming to a conclusion in Wednesday\u2019s statement.\u201cThe current uncertainty over the global outlook and what it means for the U.S. economy is not easily susceptible to measurement,\u201d he wrote, adding the Fed might go ahead with another rate increase in March, but was more likely to wait until June. \u201cWe think this language buys them time.\u201dThe Fed also is wrestling with the persistent sluggishness of inflation, both a symptom of the broader weakness of the economy and an economic problem in its own right.The Fed aims to keep prices rising at about 2 percent a year, but it has consistently fallen short since the recession that lasted from the end of 2007 to the middle of 2009. The Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, which excludes food and energy prices because they are volatile, rose 1.3 percent during the 12 months through November, the most recent available data.The Fed reiterated Wednesday that it wanted to see \u201cactual and expected progress\u201d toward its 2 percent goal as it considers further interest rate increases. But the central bank also said it remained confident that inflation would begin to rise \u201cas the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further.\u201dWednesday\u2019s decision to hold rates steady, in a range of 0.25 to 0.5 percent, was made unanimously by the 10-member committee. The Fed said everyone was able to attend the meeting in person despite the weekend snowstorm in Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Are Corporations Hoarding Trillions?", "Date": "2016-01-20", "News": "Supported byOn MoneyThere is an economic mystery I\u2019ve been struggling to understand for quite some time, and I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s confused: Among financial experts, it is often referred to as a conundrum, a paradox, a puzzle. The mystery is as follows: Collectively, American businesses currently have $1.9 trillion in cash, just sitting around. Not only is this state of affairs unparalleled in economic history, but we don\u2019t even have much data to compare it with, because corporations have traditionally been borrowers, not savers. The notion that a corporation would hold on to so much of its profit seems economically absurd, especially now, when it is probably earning only about 2 percent interest by parking that money in United States Treasury bonds. These companies would be better off investing in anything \u2014 a product, a service, a corporate acquisition \u2014 that would make them more than 2 cents of profit on the dollar, a razor-thin margin by corporate standards. And yet they choose to keep the cash.Take, for example, Google. Its new parent company, Alphabet, is worth roughly $500 billion. But it has around $80 billion sitting in Google\u2019s bank accounts or other short-term investments. So if you buy a share in Alphabet, which has sold for roughly $700 lately, you are effectively buying ownership of more than $100 in cash. With $80 billion, Google could buy Uber and its Indian rival Ola and still have enough left over to buy Palantir, a data-mining start-up. Or it could buy Goldman Sachs outright or American Express or most of MasterCard; it could buy Costco or eBay or a quarter of Amazon. Surely it could use those acquisitions to earn more than 2 cents on the dollar.This strange vogue for corporate hoarding seems to have begun around the turn of the millennium. General Motors is perhaps the most extreme: It now holds nearly half its value in cash. Apple holds more than a third. These numbers are maddening on their face. If the companies spent their savings, rather than hoarding them, the economy would instantly grow, and we would most likely see more jobs with better pay. In the 1990s, when companies saved far less of their profits, they built new factories, bought new buildings. In part because of all that corporate spending, the 1990s were a period of low unemployment and high growth. Remarkably, the United States government was able to tax all that productive corporate behavior so much that it came close to paying off all its debts for the first time in 160 years.So what is going on now? There are countless economic journal articles laying out theories about why corporations have shifted from borrowing to saving. Some of the reasons are prosaic. Just like people, companies might want to have money for emergencies or for lousy economic times, and the past decade has been a period of increasing risk. Also, corporations have become far more focused on something they call \u2018\u2018tax efficiency,\u2019\u2019 which the rest of us call \u2018\u2018tax avoidance\u2019\u2019: For various reasons, holding on to cash and carefully shifting it among subsidiaries, especially foreign ones, is a great tool to shrink your tax bill.Another reason to hold on to cash is a byproduct of the increasingly intense competition for talent and acquisitions, especially in technology and pharmaceuticals. When Apple or Google enter negotiations to buy a smaller company, any other firm considering a competing offer may be scared off by their nearly infinite resources. Oddly enough, then, holding on to all that cash might be saving these companies even more money, by allowing them to pay less for the firms they acquire. (Google buys about one company a week, on average; Apple\u2019s acquisitions are more sporadic, but not far behind.)But even if you accept all these reasons, we are still left with an enormous puzzle. Companies like Google and GM are holding on to far more cash \u2014 many times more \u2014 than could possibly be explained by emergency funds and tax efficiencies and M.&A. intimidation put together. Lee Pinkowitz, a professor at Georgetown, told me that finance economists agree that there is a puzzle here but break into two distinct camps over the cause. One camp believes that a large cash hoard is a sign of an unhealthy company. Maybe its whole industry is doing so poorly that there is nothing worth investing in; maybe it\u2019s because executives are up to something shady, stockpiling cash as a personal war chest to mask poor decision-making and protect their jobs (cash in the bank, suddenly deployed, can make a firm seem more profitable than it actually is). The other camp doubts that the free market could be allowing executives to hold all that cash if it were purely for their own benefit.Along with his colleague Rohan Williamson, Pinkowitz built a valuation model that analyzed how investors react to different levels of cash holding. He ran 50 years of data (originally from 1965 to 2004, but then he kindly updated his findings for me, through 2014) for 12,888 different publicly traded companies. The model shows how investors value a dollar of savings when it\u2019s held by different sorts of companies, divided into 43 industry types.His findings show that both theories have some truth to them. For several industries, hoarding cash is clearly correlated with negative results. When publishing and entertainment companies or aircraft manufacturers hold on to extra cash, investors perceive that money to be worth less than it should, somewhere in the neighborhood of 40 cents on the dollar (the authors make a specific estimate for each industry but also provide a range to account for error). The defense and coal industries are considerably worse, with a dollar in savings valued negatively. This might suggest protective behavior by chief executives in those industries, because the market is clearly not valuing their decision to save.For other industries, though, a dollar of savings is worth a lot more than itself. For pharmaceutical companies, a dollar in savings is worth $1.50. For software firms, it\u2019s even higher: more than $2. This means that investors are behaving as if they trust the executives in these industries, like Larry Page of Alphabet, to be smarter about using that money than the investors themselves could be. And a cursory scan of the industries in this second group \u2014 which also includes automakers, medical-equipment makers and others \u2014 correlates well with the ones hoarding the most cash. Corporations, it seems, may have amassed at least a good chunk of that $1.9 trillion in mysterious savings because the stock market is rewarding them for it.Which leaves one last question: Why? The answer, perhaps, is that both the executives and the investors in these industries believe that something big is coming, but \u2014 this is crucial \u2014 they\u2019re not sure what it will be. Through the 20th century, as we shifted from a horse-and-sun-powered agrarian economy to an electricity-and-motor-powered industrial economy to a silicon-based information economy, it was clear that every company had to invest in the new thing that was coming. These were big, expensive investments in buildings and machinery and computer technology. Today, though, value is created far more through new ideas and new ways of interaction. Ideas appear and spread much more quickly, and their worth is much harder to estimate. (Indeed, the impossibility of valuing the Internet is essentially what created the 2000 stock bubble.)Surely the most important economic question of our time is a fairly simple one: Are the good times over? Will wages continue to fall for many, while rising high for a few? In the cash conundrum, we might find a modest reason for optimism. If corporate leaders and their investors truly believed that the future were bleak, that innovation and economic growth were irreparably slowing, there would be little reason to hold on to all that cash. Their hoarding of it hints that they think the next transformative innovation could be just around the corner. If in fact they do \u2014 and if they\u2019re right \u2014 it\u2019s good news for all of us.Adam Davidson is a founder of NPR\u2019s \u2018\u2018Planet Money\u2019\u2019 and a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

Shamalov who has similarly received sanctions for his connection to Mr. Putin. Kirill Shamalov is also widely reported in Russian and Western news media to be the son-in-law of Mr. Putin.\u201cWhen the economic crisis deepens, and this floats to the surface, it could be a serious blow to Putin,\u201d Stanislav A. Belkovsky, a political analyst, said of lending to a figure linked to Mr. Putin\u2019s family.The Russian Direct Investment Fund defends the Sibur deal, saying it follows the fund\u2019s investment guidelines. The chief executive, Kirill Dmitriev, in a written statement, characterized the loan as commercially motivated and issued \u201cin line with our established practices.\u201dMr. Putin, like many Russian officials, refuses to discuss his family or reveal family business activities. Mr. Shamalov has declined to confirm or deny whether he is married to the younger of Mr. Putin\u2019s two daughters; a representative for Mr. Shamalov did not respond to written questions. Sibur said in a statement that the company would not comment on \u201cspeculation\u201d that a shareholder is a son-in-law of the president and said that shareholders in any case had no role in negotiating financing.Mr. Shamalov\u2019s company, Ladoga Management, declined in a statement to say whether he is a son-in-law of Mr. Putin, asserting that, \u201clike every other person, Kirill Shamalov has the right to privacy.\u201d\u201cThe Soviet tradition was the relatives should not be in the public eye,\u201d said Mr. Belkovsky, the political analyst.Former President Dmitri A. Medvedev established the fund in 2011 with the explicit goal of restoring confidence in Russia\u2019s investment climate.Mr. Medvedev wanted to attract overseas investors to the country\u2019s companies, and tried to entice them by matching state funds with private capital. The partnership with the state, the theory went, would reduce the investors\u2019 worries about the risk of nationalization and arbitrary regulation.To further shore up support, the fund rounded up prominent investors to serve on the advisory board. Along with the TPG and Blackstone executives, the fund recruited Leon Black of Apollo Global Management; Richard M. Daley, the former mayor of Chicago; Kurt Bj\u00f6rklund of Permira; and Chinese and Middle Eastern fund managers.By lending their names to the fund\u2019s advisory board, these financial heavyweights were supposed to ensure that money did not flow to political pet projects. The first wave of deals focused on bread-and-butter investments in companies building out Russia\u2019s infrastructure and catering to the middle class.In a typical investment, the fund and the American investment management company BlackRock in 2012 together poured $50 million into a chain of private hospitals called Mother & Child. With more Russians watching movies, the fund also invested $100 million into a multiplex business, along with Baring Vostok Capital Partners, a Russian private equity company.But western players backed away after the sanctions targeted the fund\u2019s parent bank, Vnesheconombank, a major Russian state-owned bank, in response to Russia\u2019s intervention in the eastern Ukraine war. Mr. Schwarzman and Mr. Bonderman withdrew their names from the published list of advisers in 2014.Blackstone and TPG declined to comment about the Russian fund.In two deals, the Russian Direct Investment Fund helped invest about $800 million of this pension system money into companies building electrical power lines and expanding broadband Internet access to rural areas.An even bigger investment with Sibur soon followed.In December, the fund disclosed an investment totaling $5.05 billion for Sibur to build a petrochemical factory in the Siberian city of Tobolsk, to make precursor chemicals for plastics and synthetic rubber.The Russian Direct Investment Fund and foreign investors, including unspecified Middle Eastern sources and two German funds that tie financing to the export of German industrial goods, raised $3.3 billion. Such moves fulfilled the fund\u2019s mandate to raise private sector capital.The Russian Direct Investment Fund also arranged the $1.75 billion loan from the National Welfare Fund. It was structured as below-market-rate bonds sold to the sovereign wealth fund.\u201cYou can see the conflict of interest here,\u201d Vladimir A. Ryzhkov, a former deputy speaker of the Russian Parliament, said in a telephone interview. The National Welfare Fund, he said, is legally obliged to cover pension system deficits like those existing in Russia today because of the oil price slump. Pensions this year will decline relative to inflation.\u201cThe president controls the resources in these funds,\u201d Mr. Ryzhkov said, \u201cand if his son-in-law is a part owner of this company, there is a conflict.\u201dSibur is one of Russia\u2019s largest petrochemical companies, processing the country\u2019s rich supplies of oil and natural gas into plastic, synthetic rubber and other goods. From an industrial policy perspective, the company\u2019s activities help diversify Russia\u2019s economy by creating value-added products from its resources.In a statement announcing the funding, Mr. Dmitriev, the Harvard-trained chief executive of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, a former Goldman Sachs banker and McKinsey & Company consultant, praised the loan to Sibur as \u201ca milestone in Russian industry and infrastructure development.\u201dBut the connection to Mr. Putin has attracted attention, in part because of the veil of secrecy that surrounds his family.At a news conference on Dec. 17, Mr. Putin faced questions about his two grown daughters. As usual, he declined to disclose details about his family. He denied that his daughters were involved in business, and offered few clues about their activities.A journalist from RBC, a Russian newspaper that has investigated Mr. Shamalov\u2019s business dealings, asked Mr. Putin whether his daughter, born Yekaterina Putina, has been living in Russia under the assumed name of Katerina Tikhonova.Mr. Putin declined to answer questions about his family at the conference.\u201cI read, of course, on the Internet and in some other publications about Yekaterina Tikhonova, just as I\u2019ve read things about other possible relatives and daughters at different times,\u201d Mr. Putin said, according to a Kremlin transcript. He said his daughter is living in Russia, but declined to say whether she is Ms. Tikhonova.\u201cI am proud of them,\u201d he said, speaking of his two daughters.\u201cThey are taking just first steps in their careers, but already achieved successes,\u201d he added. \u201cThey are not in business or politics, and are not sticking their nose into anything.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "La Loche, the Canadian Town Where 4 Were Killed, Has a Bleak History", "Date": "2016-01-23", "News": "Supported byThe police on Saturday offered few additional details about the shootings. The 17-year-old suspect, whose motive has not been revealed, remains in the custody of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, who said they had also seized a weapon. The police said the suspect, whose identity cannot be disclosed because of his age, faced four charges of first-degree murder, seven charges of attempted murder and a weapons charge.The police identified the victims as Marie Janvier, 21, an educational assistant at the school, Adam Wood, 35, a teacher who moved to La Loche from Ontario in September, and two brothers, Dayne Fontaine, 17, and Drayden Fontaine, 13, who were killed at a home about half a mile from the school.La Loche is more than seven hours northwest of the nearest major city, Saskatoon. It is a community with high levels of unemployment and addiction to drugs and alcohol and a reputation as a tough town. In 2011, two Mounties were forced to barricade themselves into the local health clinic when a mob attacked them after incorrectly assuming that the officers had beaten a man who had been injured in an all-terrain vehicle accident. A police truck was also burned, and an ambulance badly damaged. When La Loche appears in the provincial news media, it is usually in connection with violence or drug arrests.But looming over the town, whose residents are predominately Dene Indians, are sporadic waves of suicides, including one last year. Eighteen people, most of them young, killed themselves from August 2005 to January 2010 in La Loche, which has a population of about 2,600.Laurence Thompson, a sociologist in Saskatoon who has worked with the native friendship council in La Loche for several years, said that while the town\u2019s lakeside setting in the boreal forest was spectacular, its poverty was immediately apparent. Despite being the hub for nearby communities with a combined population of about 4,000 people, La Loche has no sit-down restaurants, no banks, no movie theaters, not even a coffee shop. The nearest Tim Hortons restaurant, a Canadian staple, is about 60 miles away.\u201cThere\u2019s just not enough of an economy to support these kinds of activities,\u201d Mr. Thompson said. More critically, the absence of such enterprises largely limits employment to a tiny number of local businesses and to government posts or jobs at publicly funded institutions, like the clinic and schools. Police officers and local professionals are often hired from elsewhere. Many fly in, do their work and fly out.\u201cWhat do you do when you leave school in La Loche?\u201d Mr. Thompson asked. \u201cYou either leave town, stay and get one of the few jobs in the community or stay and do nothing.\u201d One result, he said, is that much of the community survives on public benefits.\u201cGetting a quality education for our youth is vital,\u201d Chief Cameron said. \u201cBut we tell them that they have to leave to seek employment, find opportunities.\u201dDespite the town\u2019s desperate economic circumstances, Mr. Thompson said the La Loche Community School, which hold classes in two buildings for students from junior kindergarten to 12th grade, was a bright spot. The high school building, where two of the victims were killed on Friday, is modern, clean, well equipped and well staffed. It would not be out of place in a prosperous town in southern Canada.Chief Cameron, who lives at the Witchekan Lake First Nation, south of La Loche, agreed. But he said that even a good school filled with dedicated teachers could not always engage students whose parents\u2019 lives are disrupted by alcohol. The town has a government-owned liquor store and two bars, despite the lack of restaurants. Students may find themselves sharing a small house with 10 other people because of a chronic housing shortage.Prosperity, or at least stability, has been tantalizingly close. Not far to the west is Fort McMurray, Alberta, the heart of Canada\u2019s oil sands. It was Canada\u2019s greatest boom town until the recent decline in the price of oil. But the lack of a road, other than a very rough ice road in the winter, has meant that few La Loche residents have been able to take jobs there.The residents of La Loche who have escaped a reliance on welfare tend to be older and follow traditional Dene methods of living off the land through hunting and fishing. Few of the town\u2019s young, Chief Cameron said, have such skills.\u201cYou take away the land, you take away the traditional livelihoods, you feed them booze, you introduce smallpox in your trade wars,\u201d he said. \u201cWe won\u2019t call it genocide, because we\u2019re white guys and white guys don\u2019t do that. That\u2019s just other evil people in the world.\u201dHe added, \u201cI began to understand that colonization isn\u2019t something that\u2019s a long time ago, it\u2019s something that\u2019s at work right now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

There he attracted many thousands of additional followers from all over the world.If Santa Claus and John Maynard Keynes could combine as one, he might well be Edward Hugh. He was roly-poly and merry, and he always had a twinkle in his eye, not least when he came across a data point or the hint of an economic or social trend that would support one of his many theories.His intellect was too restless to be pigeonholed, but when pressed he would say that he saw himself as a Keynesian in spirit, but not letter. And in tune with his view that economists in general had become too wedded to static economic models and failed their obligation to predict and explain, he frequently cited this quotation from Keynes:\u201cEconomists set themselves too easy, too useless a task if in tempestuous seasons they can only tell us that when the storm is long past, the ocean is flat again.\u201dEdward Hugh Bengree-Jones was born in Liverpool, England, on Dec. 29, 1948. He moved to London and received an undergraduate degree from the London School of Economics. He pursued his doctoral studies at Victoria University in Manchester, although he never completed them.Throughout the 1970s and 1980s he bounced from job to job, mostly in education, taking on projects such as teaching English to Chilean refugees.In 1990 he moved to Barcelona, having fallen in love with the city\u2019s multicultural flair during a holiday visit. He quickly became fluent in both Spanish and Catalan and decided that Barcelona would become his home.He would became a champion of Catalonia\u2019s push for independence and was an informal adviser to senior Catalan politicians, including Artur Mas, the leader of the movement\u2019s main party.While Mr. Hugh\u2019s pointed pen often ruffled feathers, especially in Spain, he did become a local celebrity of sorts. He was a regular presence in the papers and appeared frequently on television, where he would expound for hours in Spanish and Catalan.On occasion his prognostications were overly pessimistic, and Spain\u2019s surprisingly quick economic recovery was an event that he, along with many others, did not foresee.Until this summer, when his cancer worsened, he spent his days posting daily economic snippets on Facebook, digging deep into independent films from around the world, and having long, lazy lunches with local notables and friends.That he never finished his doctorate or wrote his great work never truly bothered him, he said in his interview with The Times.\u201cThe last time I was asked what it was I \u2018did,\u2019 I replied rather cantankerously, that I don\u2019t do, I think,\u201d he recalled.Besides his son, Morgan, his survivors include his wife, Barbara; a brother, David, and a half sister, Anne.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oil Market Tests Banks\u2019 Ability to Weather Losses", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported byBanks of all sizes are marking down the value of loans and setting aside reserves to absorb additional losses as oil producers struggle to pay their debts.On Tuesday, Bank of America said provisions for credit losses increased $264 million in the fourth quarter, driven by the downturn in the energy sector. Citigroup, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase reported last week that oil issues also weighed on fourth-quarter earnings.While the energy downturn is cutting into profits, it is not threatening the big banks\u2019 capital cushions, a testament, analysts say, to the rigorous regulations put in place to protect the financial system after the collapse of the mortgage market in 2008.Still, the worst pain for the banks may lie ahead. While many banks have reduced credit lines to oil producers, some lenders are loath to cut off financing entirely for fear of forcing energy companies into bankruptcy, according to energy lawyers and consultants.The banks \u2014 and their regulators \u2014 are also trying to determine loan values and forecast future losses amid great uncertainty about the direction of oil prices, which have dipped below $30 a barrel. Some analysts and energy executives say prices could rebound in a few months if the global oil glut eases. Others say it could take years for prices to rise again as the global economy slows and new supply comes online from countries like Iran.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.\u201cThe natural bias will be to keep these things on life support for as long as you can,\u201d said Dennis Cassidy, a co-head of the oil, gas and chemical practice at AlixPartners, a consulting firm.\u201cThe question becomes how much of that waiting can you endure before you get to the point where you say, \u2018It is never going to turn around,\u2019 \u201d he added.There are other factors that may be putting off a reckoning for oil companies and their lenders, even as the slump in oil prices enters its second year.When times were booming and oil was selling for more than $100 a barrel, many banks required energy companies to hedge, or protect against price drops. As a result of those deals, some companies are still receiving as much as $80 a barrel. But those hedges are supposed to expire early this year \u2014 dealing a big blow to some companies\u2019 cash flow and their ability to make debt payments.\u201cA lot of these energy companies are still enjoying some handsome hedges,\u201d said Brady Gailey, an analyst at the investment bank Keefe Bruyette & Woods, who covers regional banks in the oil-producing regions of the Southwest.Executives at the largest banks have stressed in recent days that oil and gas exposure does not make up a big percentage of overall loans.Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks\u2019 bottom lines.But that confidence is also prompting questions from some analysts about whether the banks are socking away adequate reserves in light of the prolonged oil slump.Shares of bank stocks have been hammered since the start of the year when the stock market turned volatile in the face of the collapse in oil prices and concern about China\u2019s slowing economy. Bank of America\u2019s shares, for example, are down more than 15 percent since the start of the year, while the broader market has fallen more than 8 percent.Loans to oil and gas companies make up less than 2 percent of the loans at Bank of America and Wells Fargo \u2014 a far cry from the residential mortgage exposure at some large banks, which was as high as 25 percent leading up to 2008.There is always risk, analysts say, that declining oil prices could lead to additional energy losses from trading positions or hedges that go against the banks.But it is not likely to equal the vast array of the derivatives like collateralized debt obligations and other mortgage-related investments that clogged the bank\u2019s balance sheets and nearly brought them down.\u201cYou could easily write off every dollar in oil and energy loans and have more capital than before that last crisis,\u201d said Mike Mayo, a banking analyst at CLSA. \u201cBanks have enough cushion.\u201dFor years, North America\u2019s expanding oil production \u2014 particularly in the shale fields of North Dakota and parts of Texas \u2014 was a boon to the nation\u2019s biggest banks. Over the last five years, oil and gas companies in the United States and Canada have issued bonds and taken out loans that are together worth more than $1.3 trillion, according to data provider Dealogic.In good times, the financing boom provided banks with billions in fees and interest incomes. The banks financed nearly every facet of the industry, from drilling operations to the service companies providing the drill bits. In the downturn, the risks are becoming clearer.Bank of America said on Tuesday that $8.3 billion of its $21 billion in energy exposure was in the \u201chigh risk\u201d activities of exploration and production and oil field services. The bank has classified about one-third of that debt as problematic.\u201cWe feel like we have a very good handle on our energy portfolio,\u201d the bank\u2019s chief financial officer, Paul Donofrio, said in a conference call on Tuesday morning.Wells Fargo said most of its $17 billion in energy exposure was to noninvestment-grade companies, which are at higher risk of default.Citigroup said 32 percent of its energy loans went to below-investment-grade borrowers.For regional banks, where energy exposure makes up as much as one in five of the bank\u2019s loans, the pain is more acute.Last week, BOK Financial, which includes banks in Oklahoma and Texas, updated investors ahead of its scheduled earnings release to say that its credit-loss provisions in the fourth quarter would total $22.5 million, not the $3.5 million to $8.5 million that it had previously forecast. A bank official said \u201ca single borrower reported steeper-than-expected production declines.\u201dMr. Gailey, the banking analyst, was blunt in his prediction: \u201cThese oil patch banks have a tough road ahead in 2016.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Carbon Pricing and Climate Change", "Date": "2016-01-25", "News": "Supported byLettersTo the Editor:It was heartening to read your editorial, just the latest sign that carbon pricing is becoming a more popular option for tackling climate change. Adopting an economywide tax will have the most impact in addressing climate change, changing industrial behavior and shifting away from fossil fuels.Any tax must be set high enough to induce change in our energy mix, but not so high that energy prices skyrocket. To protect growth, any legislation must ensure that low-income consumers and small businesses are protected, that larger businesses aren\u2019t disadvantaged against foreign competitors in countries without carbon taxes, and that people in fossil-fuel-dependent communities get the support they need to transition into new industries.Done right, carbon pricing can be a boon not just for fighting climate change but for moving our economy into the 21st century. But it will require strong action from Congress, and the support of the business community, to have any chance of passage. ZACH BERNSTEINWashingtonThe writer is research manager at the American Sustainable Business Council.To the Editor:Your editorial answers the wrong question about carbon trading. The question isn\u2019t whether pricing carbon harms consumers and businesses; it\u2019s whether or not it will reduce climate-change emissions.British Columbia\u2019s own statistics don\u2019t bode well for the ability of carbon taxes to produce the real change needed to address global warming. The province\u2019s emissions did drop slightly between 2008 and 2013, but the small reduction was spread out among all sources of emissions, including non-taxed mineral extraction and agriculture; the claim that the reduction was attributable to any tax on gasoline is highly suspect.As with the tobacco tax, pricing carbon will have only a minor impact on behavior. It\u2019s the regulation of tobacco \u2014 smoking bans, for example \u2014 that have had a far greater impact. Nine of the 10 states with the lowest smoking rates in the United States have public smoking bans firmly in place.If we want to stop runaway emissions, we must bypass the pricing schemes and move to regulate emissions strictly and enact policies to phase out fossil fuels.WENONAH HAUTERExecutive Director, Food & Water WatchWashingtonTo the Editor:Not only are states, provinces and countries putting a price on carbon, but so are many companies.More than 430 major companies \u2014 including General Motors, Stanley Black & Decker and Colgate-Palmolive \u2014 are now using an internal price on carbon for internal planning and to make investment decisions, according to C.D.P. (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project). More than a thousand companies worldwide, including most major hydrocarbon companies, are doing this or have pledged to do so within two years.Rather than stand by while businesses and states price carbon individually, Congress should enact a revenue-neutral carbon fee. The proceeds could be used to fund long-overdue tax reform, cutting taxes for business and reimbursing lower-income families for paying a few cents more at the pump.Our nonprofit has spoken with 175 members of Congress, or their aides, and there is bipartisan openness to considering this idea after the election. Most want to know that their business leaders back home are on board. Those opinion leaders need to deliver the message to Congress that this is the cheapest and fastest way to reduce dangerous emissions.WALT MINNICKWashingtonThe writer, a Democrat and the co-founder of the Partnership for Responsible Growth, represented Idaho\u2019s First District in the House, 2009-11.To the Editor:Indeed there are examples for Congress to follow. Maybe after the 2016 election we can end the fake war against climate change and start the real war. Both parties need to participate.CHRIS WIEGARDChester, Va.The writer is a volunteer for Citizens\u2019 Climate Lobby.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump and Cruz Set an Ugly, Nasty Tone", "Date": "2016-01-14", "News": "Supported byRemember that phase of the campaign when Ted Cruz spoke no ill of Donald Trump, who returned the favor?You may now forget it. Bury it. Write its obituary, in a pen dipped in acid.At Thursday night\u2019s Republican debate, the two frontrunners didn\u2019t merely spar, as was expected. They glared at and scolded each other with a venomousness that was initially mesmerizing, then horrifying and finally just sad\u2014very, very sad.The trajectory of the Republican primary has been one of growing pessimism, intensifying acrimony and abundant pettiness, and it reached its ugly nadir on the stage in North Charleston, S.C.This happened when Cruz was asked to respond to Trump\u2019s claim that he might not qualify as a \u201cnatural-born citizen\u201d eligible for the presidency. Cruz was ready for it, asserting that as recently as four months ago, Trump had sung a different tune.\u201cSince September, the Constitution hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cBut the poll numbers have, and I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.\u201dThe two men argued about what the numbers really said, Trump insisting that his were bigger. They battled over the legitimacy and motivations of a Harvard law professor who had weighed in skeptically on Cruz\u2019s eligibility. They traded barbs about Trump\u2019s mother. Yes, his mother.Some of their lines were wicked\u2014some of Cruz\u2019s, at least. He\u2019s frighteningly talented at this sort of thing, and told Trump: \u201cI\u2019m happy to consider naming you as V.P., and so, if you happen to be right, you can get the top job at the end of the day.\u201dBut as the scabrous exchange went on (and on) and John Kasich visibly slumped in frustration and the other candidates gaped in what seemed like genuine disbelief at the length of this endless digression, it was impossible to be entertained or amused.Over the course of this sixth meeting of the leading Republican candidates, serious issues were indeed broached, and the candidates raised legitimate questions about what President Obama had and hadn\u2019t done to make Americans feel safe. They had a warranted discussion about whether the American economy had improved enough and in the right ways.But the tone eclipsed the substance, and the tone was nastier than it had to be, sometimes to the point of pure silliness.With the Iowa caucuses less than three weeks away, the New Hampshire primary right after that and several of the seven men onstage still looking for elusive traction, they went for broke: exaggerated words, extreme claims, voices raised high and chests puffed out as never before.Trump was, as ever, at center stage.For such a small-minded man, he hovers so large over this country\u2019s political landscape, casting the longest and most sinister of shadows. He was the sire of President Obama\u2019s State of the Union address, which could be heard as a point-by-point retort to the gloom, doom and bigotry that Trump peddles. He was the sire of Nikki Haley\u2019s State of the Union response, which was as concerned with chastising him as with contradicting the president.And he was the sire of this debate, inasmuch as the anger that he summons and the uncompromising toughness that he projects have infected his adversaries, tugging them toward truculence. On Thursday night, several of them seemed intent on out-Trumping Trump.Chris Christie didn\u2019t merely portray himself as the most effective opponent for Hillary Clinton.\u201cIf I\u2019m the nominee, she won\u2019t get within 10 miles of the White House,\u201d he proclaimed.He didn\u2019t merely state his differences with Obama. He compared the president to \u201ca petulant child\u201d and made him a promise.\u201cWe are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall,\u201d he said. Trump couldn\u2019t have expressed it more crudely.Rubio, for his part, wholly abandoned the upbeat message and mien that once defined him. There\u2019s no sunshine in a race that orbits around a star as dark as Trump. There\u2019s only thunder, fear, apocalyptic musings and bellicose vows to exert America\u2019s muscle around the world.Rubio talked about handing out many a \u201cone-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay.\u201d Cruz talked about \u201cthe full force and fury of the United States of America.\u201dRubio and Cruz squared off against each other just before the debate clock ran out, with Cruz calling Rubio soft on immigration and Rubio calling him soft on national defense. But it wasn\u2019t typical political theater: It was more sneering and more savage than that\u2014jarringly so.\u201cThat is not consistent conservatism,\u201d Rubio said of Cruz\u2019s record. \u201cThat is political calculation.\u201dCruz insisted on ample time to respond. \u201cHe had no fewer than 11 attacks there,\u201d he said, and then, addressing Rubio directly, added: \u201cI appreciate your dumping your oppo research folder.\u201dBy the time it was all over, I was fantasizing about Trump\u2019s promised wall, only it didn\u2019t separate the United States from Mexico. It separated Cruz from Trump, Rubio from Cruz and all three of them from the rest of us, who are looking for leadership, not egos and vitriol.Advertisement"}

Let\u2019s call it, Who\u2019s Losing?But don\u2019t expect it to shift much. Asking \u201cwho\u2019s losing?\u201d misses a larger truth about how thoroughly Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft now lord over all that happens in tech.Who\u2019s really losing? In the larger picture, none of them \u2014 not in comparison with the rest of the tech industry, the rest of the economy and certainly not in the influence each of them holds over our lives.But for much of the last half-decade, most of these five giants have enjoyed a remarkable reprieve from the bogeymen in the garage. And you can bet on them continuing to win. So I\u2019m coining the name the Frightful Five.Though competition between the five remains fierce \u2014 and each year, a few of them seem up and a few down \u2014 it\u2019s becoming harder to picture how any one of them, let alone two or three, may cede their growing clout in every aspect of American business and society.Indeed, the Frightful Five are so well protected against start-ups that in most situations, the rise of new companies only solidifies their lead.This gets to the core of the Frightful Five\u2019s indomitability. They have each built several enormous technologies that are central to just about everything we do with computers. In tech jargon, they own many of the world\u2019s most valuable \u201cplatforms\u201d \u2014 the basic building blocks on which every other business, even would-be competitors, depend.These platforms are inescapable; you may opt out of one or two of them, but together, they form a gilded mesh blanketing the entire economy.The Big Five\u2019s platforms span so-called old tech \u2014 Windows is still the king of desktops, Google rules web search \u2014 and new tech, with Google and Apple controlling mobile phone operating systems and the apps that run on them; Facebook and Google controlling the Internet advertising business; and Amazon, Microsoft and Google controlling the cloud infrastructure on which many start-ups run.Many of these platforms generate what economists call \u201cnetwork effects\u201d \u2014 as more people use them, they keep getting more indispensable. Why do you chat using Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp, also owned by Facebook? Because that\u2019s where everyone else is.Then there\u2019s the data buried in the platforms, also a rich source for new business. This can happen directly \u2014 for instance, Google can tap everything it learns about how we use our phones to create an artificial intelligence engine that improves our phones \u2014 and in more circuitous ways. By watching what\u2019s popular in its app store, Apple can get insight into what features to add to the iPhone.\u201cIn a way, a lot of the research and development costs are being borne by companies out of their four walls, which allows them to do better product development,\u201d Mr. Parker said.This explains why these companies\u2019 visions are so expansive. In various small and large ways, the Frightful Five are pushing into the news and entertainment industries; they\u2019re making waves in health care and finance; they\u2019re building cars, drones, robots and immersive virtual-reality worlds. Why do all this? Because their platforms \u2014 the users, the data and all the money they generate \u2014 make these far-flung realms seem within their grasp.Which isn\u2019t to say these companies can\u2019t die. Not long ago people thought IBM, Cisco Systems, Intel and Oracle were unbeatable in tech; they\u2019re all still large companies, but they\u2019re far less influential than they once were.Even with these difficulties, it\u2019s unclear if the larger dynamic may change much. Let\u2019s say that Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce company, eclipses Amazon\u2019s retail business in India \u2014 well, O.K., so then it satisfies itself with the rest of the world.So get used to these five. Based on their stock prices this month, the giants are among the top 10 most valuable American companies of any kind. Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft are the top three; Facebook is No. 7, and Amazon is No. 9. Wall Street gives each high marks for management; and three of them \u2014 Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook \u2014 are controlled by founders who don\u2019t have to bow to the whims of potential activist investors.So who\u2019s losing? Not one of them, not anytime soon.Advertisement"}

Sometimes it\u2019s effective, sometimes not.\u201dThis year, Super Bowl organizers are playing up the region\u2019s reputation as a center for technology and innovation, with Keith Bruce, chief executive of the Super Bowl 50 Host Committee, promising the \u201cthe most interactive fan experience ever.\u201d\u201cIf I lived in the Bay Area and this came to town, I\u2019d go to it,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said. \u201cIt\u2019s silly, and ridiculous, but also pretty fun.\u201dIf you\u2019re not that into the football, there\u2019s always the food.Mr. Hoffman said that he is looking forward to one thing in particular.\u201cI haven\u2019t had a good burrito in 12 years,\u201d he said.This experience does come at a price ($700), but all proceeds go to food banks located in the 32 cities that are home to N.F.L. teams, and you will also be treated to a concert by the rock group Third Eye Blind.\u201cThey get the best local chefs from the big restaurants to do their signature thing,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said. \u201cThe problem for us vegetarians is that almost every chef\u2019s signature dish is a meat dish.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s almost clich\u00e9d to say it\u2019s \u2018the burrito place,\u2019 but it really is \u2018the burrito place\u2019 for a reason,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said, but also added, \u201cif you find any taqueria in the Mission you\u2019re doing well.\u201dAnd infrequent visitors should take care to pack appropriate clothing. Just because it\u2019s California does not mean it\u2019s always warm and sunny.\u201cThere\u2019s a certain rite of passage of going to San Francisco as a tourist, or even a local who lives outside of the city, of every time you go, you have to buy something to keep you warmer,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole thriving tourist economy based on hooded sweatshirts.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Conservative Louisiana, Obama Finds Little but Love", "Date": "2016-01-14", "News": "Supported byWhite House MemoBut even though he spent the last two days in red America, he found himself immersed in deeply blue crowds.First in Nebraska, then in Louisiana, Mr. Obama heard not a single disagreeable word. In Omaha, someone in the crowd called out to urge a third term. In Baton Rouge, an audience member said that since Mr. Obama could not do that under the Constitution, could Michelle Obama be persuaded to run instead. (\u201cNo,\u201d he answered emphatically.)Indeed, the president\u2019s town-hall-style meeting here at McKinley High School, where he took questions from an announced audience of 1,000 on Thursday, could be considered a lovefest.\u201cMy question \u2014 I don\u2019t have one,\u201d said the first woman he called on. \u201cI just want to thank you.\u201dAnother woman, referring to the president and his wife, said, \u201cYou are our biggest inspirations, and we want to be just like you guys.\u201d\u201cSo can you help us?\u201d she said. \u201cGive us some tips?\u201dA young man expressed his gratitude. \u201cThanks for being an inspiration, because I aspire to be where you are in the next 30 years.\u201dIn the end, of course, what president does not like to be bathed in admiration? Especially one whose poll numbers show that a majority of his constituents are not big fans anymore. Advisers to George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan and other presidents certainly arranged public appearances in which their bosses were surrounded by devotees and their exposure to contrary opinions was fleeting.After that meeting, aides told reporters that they hoped to reproduce the experience more often, starting after the State of the Union speech. \u201cHe wants to have more conversations with Americans like he did in the 2008 campaign, including with people who disagree with him,\u201d said Jen Psaki, the White House communications director.He did not find them in Omaha or Baton Rouge. In Omaha on Wednesday, the predominantly white crowd of 8,000 in a university sports arena cheered him raucously, reminiscent of campaign rallies. \u201cThis is a pretty good crowd!\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThis is so nice. What a wonderful welcome.\u201dIf anything, the welcome in Baton Rouge was even nicer, as a predominantly black audience in the high school gymnasium cheered and shouted and, in some cases, jumped up and down. \u201cHe\u2019s here! He\u2019s here!\u201d one woman yelled as his motorcade arrived.Some of the questions Mr. Obama took were serious and heartfelt. A 10-year-old girl asked about curing cancer. (\u201cIt probably won\u2019t be cured in my lifetime,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I think it will be cured in yours.\u201d) A judge asked if she could offer ideas about overhauling the criminal justice system. (\u201cI\u2019ll have my people call your people,\u201d he said.)He was asked what he would do after leaving office and said he was too busy to think about it much. The question about a campaign by Mrs. Obama seemed to particularly amuse him.\u201cLet me tell you, there are three things that are certain in life: death, taxes and Michelle is not running for president,\u201d he said. (His spokesman later said that presumably applies to any other elected office.)White House officials were not the only ones who had anticipated that Mr. Obama might hear voices of dissent.\u201cThe president is trying to convince us that down is up,\u201d Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, said in a statement, meaning that neither the economy nor the president\u2019s health care program were doing as well as he has said. \u201cIf the president listens to the people of Louisiana and doesn\u2019t just speak, he will understand life for those outside of Washington.\u201dIt is not as if presidents are unaware of opposing viewpoints. Mr. Obama, like Mr. Bush, shies away from television news, but he spends evenings scouring the Internet on his iPad.Experiencing such views in person, however, is rarer. Supporters are more likely than critics to endure long lines, security sweeps and then sometimes hours of waiting for his arrival. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said the audience at the session on guns last week was more balanced because it was selected by a news organization. Crowds like those in Omaha and Baton Rouge, he said, tend to be more \u201cself-selecting,\u201d not through any design of the White House.\u201cIt\u2019s not because we choose the audiences,\u201d Mr. Earnest said. \u201cIt\u2019s because the audiences choose themselves.\u201dStill, the White House preselected a range of questions for Mr. Obama to choose from during a session on Twitter that followed his meeting on Thursday. He chose none that challenged him in any way.Others posed more substantive, but still friendly, questions about climate change, college affordability, discrimination against Muslims and gun control. Mr. Obama did not answer questions posted by the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, about the war against the Islamic State or executive overreach.On his way back to the airport, Mr. Obama stopped at Poor Boy Lloyd\u2019s to pick up oyster, shrimp and roast beef po\u2019 boys for lunch. Patrons eagerly shook his hand and snapped pictures, but again none offered any conflicting views, at least not that were heard by reporters.\u201cI\u2019m going to enjoy these po\u2019 boys,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Greece Resists Its Role as European Union\u2019s Gatekeeper", "Date": "2016-01-30", "News": "Supported byIDOMENI, Greece \u2014 On a recent weekday, 40 buses jammed into the parking lot of a gas station near the Macedonian border, carrying thousands of refugees who had survived a perilous crossing on wintry seas from Turkey. Now they were approaching ground zero in the intensifying debate over how to curb the unceasing stream of men, women and children from war-ravaged and poor nations in the Middle East and Africa heading to the safety and prosperity of Europe.At the border crossing here \u2014 one of the busiest gateways for migrants on the path north and the site of occasional violence between the authorities and frustrated migrants \u2014 Greece has played that filtering role to some degree for months. In theory, Greece is allowing only Syrians, Iraqis and Afghans to continue toward their preferred destinations in Germany and Austria.The rest \u2014 from places like Iran, Morocco, Eritrea, Libya, Somalia and Congo \u2014 are supposed to be sent to camps in Athens, where they can be deported or apply for asylum in Greece, whose economic troubles would make it an unattractive new home to most migrants even if they were accepted.But other European nations say Greece is not doing enough to enforce the border, and with the number of refugees expected to surge again as the weather improves, the pressure for a new approach is escalating rapidly.Exasperated with what they claim is a Greek policy of waving people through to the rest of Europe, officials in the European Union are talking about temporarily expelling Greece from the bloc\u2019s passport-free travel zone, known as the Schengen area.The European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, endorsed a separate idea to send the police from member states to Macedonia, which is not part of the European Union, to buffer its side of the border with Greece. One Belgian minister even called for refugee camps to hold 300,000 to be built in Greece.Greek officials have reacted angrily to the proposals. They say the plans would not deter migrants from heading to Europe in the first place and would stigmatize Greece \u2014 already under heavy European Union oversight as it relies on international bailout funds \u2014 for a crisis created elsewhere in Europe.\u201cThe climate has changed from the welcoming politics of Merkel to one of fear and panic,\u201d said Nikos Xydakis, Greece\u2019s foreign minister for European affairs, referring to Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s decision last summer to open Germany\u2019s doors to refugees. \u201cIf they want to raise a new Iron Curtain, we will not be the ones to blame.\u201dHere along the border with Macedonia, anxiety among the migrants is high. But having come this far, few of them seem to think any policy change will keep people from fleeing war, repression and poverty to seek a better life in Europe.\u201cI pray to my god that they don\u2019t close the borders,\u201d said Mohamed Salem Ibrahim, a teenager who fled Afghanistan to make the long trek to Germany.\u201cWe have no other future but Europe,\u201d he added, his eyes alighting on the single bag of belongings he had stowed on a bus. \u201cWe must get in one way or another.\u201dIf border controls are imposed on Greece, Mr. Xydakis said, \u201cthe flow will stop at the Greek sea, because people won\u2019t want to be trapped in a black box in Greece. But migrants will just find other ways to get into Europe, even if they have to go through the Arctic Circle.\u201dThe European Union this week proposed allowing countries to suspend the Schengen agreement for up to two years, a move that could push the open-border policy toward collapse and damage economies when the bloc needs more resources to deal with the migrants. Several member countries, including Germany, Sweden, Hungary and Austria, have already temporarily reinstated border checks.European officials accuse Greece of creating a \u201cdomino\u201d of tightened borders along the path to Germany.In Macedonia, officials say if Greece does not adequately distinguish refugees from migrants who have no claim to asylum, many could get stuck in Macedonia if Serbia, its northern neighbor, rejects them.\u201cThen we will be the place where tents will be installed, and we\u2019d become a huge refugee camp under open skies,\u201d said Nikola Poposki, Macedonia\u2019s foreign affairs minister. \u201cWe will do everything necessary to avoid that.\u201dHere in Idomeni, at the official migrant camp abutting the checkpoint between Greece and Macedonia, Greek officers scrutinized the papers of hundreds of bedraggled refugees as they waited to cross an opening in a new 12.5-mile razor-wire fence separating the two countries.A 23-year-old Libyan woman who gave her name only as a Fatimah said she and her husband had just been refused passage at the border because their nationality was not one of the three designated for refugee status.\u201cLibya is hell, it\u2019s dangerous, too, and yet we cannot get approval to get to Germany,\u201d she said, as tears filled her eyes. One month pregnant and wearing a pink knit cap, Fatimah spoke in French and English and said they had no money for the bus fare to Athens, where they would have to wait for months with thousands of unaccepted migrants at a huge makeshift camp in a former Olympic center until their future was sorted out.\u201cStill,\u201d she said, looking at the bright blue sky, \u201cwe\u2019ll make it somehow to Athens, and then we\u2019ll apply for asylum in Greece and try to get jobs.\u201dAlthough the migrant flow slowed in the winter, the numbers are higher than ever for this time of year. In January alone more than 45,000 migrants arrived at Greek islands from Turkey, a 20-fold increase from a year ago, despite a pledge of 3 billion euros, or $3.25 billion, from the European Union to Turkey in return for efforts to reduce the migrant flow.Greek officials say they have already improved some tasks, like fingerprinting arrivals, stepping up sea patrols and upgrading registration facilities for migrants on the Greek islands.In the meantime, the situation in Idomeni is but a taste of what Greece could look like if Europe decides to suspend Greece from the Schengen area or seal the border with Macedonia.Over the past few days, the official camp has become more orderly, with aid groups running shelters and handing out food and clothing. Still, an overflow of refugees was stuck about 12 miles away at the Eko gas station, a waiting room for those hoping to continue north.In the parking lot, buses lined up side by side, casting slanted shadows on the asphalt. Women in head scarves sprawled, exhausted, on thick gray blankets flung on a strip of grass next to the highway, as children kicked plastic bottles on a small service road. Groups of men warmed their hands over fires built in oil drums, while families washed clothes and hung them to dry on a chain-link fence.Inside white tents set up by Doctors Without Borders, travelers took breaks from the biting cold until their bus was called to leave for the border station, often with little warning.One bus, emblazoned with the words \u201cSuccess Travel,\u201d suddenly revved up as the driver blasted the horn. Scores of people ran out of the tents. Many had to scramble aboard as the bus began to pull away.\u201cWe are happy to have made it to Greece, but we want to move on,\u201d said Najib Nasrati, 15, an Afghan whose family hoped to reach Germany.Earlier in the day, he had heard a rumor that Germany might completely shut its borders in six months.\u201cI felt angry when I heard that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are all in a very bad situation. If we have to stay in Greece or be sent back, it will be chaos.\u201dDimitris Bounias contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russian Shares and Ruble Fall as Oil Prices Continue to Tumble", "Date": "2016-01-11", "News": "Supported byThe retreat for Russian shares was in line with declines on other exchanges around the world in the first week of the year, when financial markets in Moscow were closed for the Eastern Orthodox Christmas holiday.One broad index of Russian stocks, the Micex, closed 3.75 percent lower on Monday. Another index, the RTS, which prices Russian shares in dollars and therefore reflects changes in the exchange rate as well as in the stock market, fell 4.9 percent.The ruble dropped sharply at the opening of trading to more than 76 to the dollar, from 74.75, before recovering to close at 75.8.Oil and other commodities like natural gas and steel, which make up the bulk of Russia\u2019s exports, have fallen sharply on fears of a slowdown in the Chinese economy. A barrel of the benchmark Brent crude was trading at less than $32, down more than 4 percent for the day.In an interview published on Monday in the German newspaper Bild, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia conceded that the plunge in oil prices was hurting his country\u2019s economy, but that it would have a positive side in that it would push Russia to improve its financial policies.\u201cOur nonoil and gas deficit had risen to a very dangerous level,\u201d Mr. Putin said. Resisting spending oil funds is difficult, he said, but \u201cit is the reduction of these expenses that improves the economy.\u201dThe Russian government taxes oil companies at higher rates when oil prices are higher, and at lower rates during a price slump.As a result of that policy, the federal budget, rather than the companies, has borne the brunt of the oil price decline.The average after-tax profit a Russian oil company earned from the sale of a barrel of oil actually rose over the past year \u2014 to 1,290 rubles in 2015, from 1,012 rubles in 2014, according to an analysis by Renaissance Capital, a Moscow-based investment bank. Because of the skewed price signals, Russian oil companies have ramped up production, reaching a post-Soviet record of 10.8 million barrels a day in December.The Russian government has budgeted for an average oil price of $50 in 2016, far above where it stands today, with a deficit of 3 percent of gross domestic product.The government could balance its budget at a lower oil price and with that deficit only if the central bank allowed the ruble to decline against the dollar, further whittling away the value of Russians\u2019 wages and pensions.Russia\u2019s central bank has warned that the country\u2019s economy could continue to contract this year, after a 3.8 percent drop last year, if oil prices do not recover.\u201cWe believe we will gradually be looking at the stabilization and rise of the economy,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Donald Trump Keeps Lying About Unemployment", "Date": "2016-01-21", "News": "At its worst in the last downturn, unemployment was 10 percent (in 2009). Since then, it has fallen to 5 percent.Case closed? Unfortunately, no. One reason political lies are insidious is that rebutting them requires repeating them. Rebuttal is a vital public service, but lies thrive on repetition.In the process, the broader electorate loses, because lies short-circuit public discussion. Rebuttals can set the record straight. But a cycle of lies and rebuttals is not a policy debate. A worthwhile debate begins with a reasonably defensible diagnosis of a problem and proceeds with prescriptions to fit that diagnosis. Serial distortions about the facts of a matter mean that a candidate, Mr. Trump in this case, never even gets to the starting point.For example, in dissecting Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claims, The Post pointed out that while unemployment is now at 5 percent, underemployment currently clocks in at 9.9 percent. (Underemployment includes jobless workers who are actively looking for work and those who have not recently looked for a job, as well as people who work part time but need full-time hours.)Those two numbers have important policy implications. Historically, an unemployment rate of 5 percent implies that the economy is at or near full employment, a sweet spot where tight labor markets push up wages as employers compete for workers.That is a clear and present challenge, requiring specific and creative solutions. But Mr. Trump keeps putting out dishonest sound bites. The lies get rebutted, but the policy void remains.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An\u00e1lisis: Para bien o para mal, el d\u00f3lar sigue al alza", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported byAm\u00e9rica Hace unos d\u00edas recib\u00ed un correo en el que Ron Paul, icono libertario, antiguo congresista de Texas y padre del candidato republicano Rand Paul, proclamaba que su \u201cpredicci\u00f3n definitiva sobre el colapso del d\u00f3lar est\u00e1 a punto de convertirse en realidad\u201d.El correo ten\u00eda un tono un poco extremista, con referencias a la hiperinflaci\u00f3n de la rep\u00fablica alemana de Weimar, el Zimbabue de Robert Mugabe y el libro G\u00e9nesis. Pero el presagio extremo de Paul coincide con la idea republicana de que la administraci\u00f3n de Obama y la Reserva Federal debilitan a la econom\u00eda estadounidense.Todas estas predicciones se equivocaron. El alza del d\u00f3lar, que comenz\u00f3 pr\u00e1cticamente el mismo d\u00eda en que Feldstein hizo su predicci\u00f3n en 2011, no da se\u00f1ales de detenerse. Se trata de la tercera vez que se ha dado un aumento tan consistente desde que Richard Nixon suspendi\u00f3 en 1971 la convertibilidad del d\u00f3lar estadounidense en oro.Puede que la econom\u00eda estadounidense avance en medio de tropiezos, pero lo hace much\u00edsimo mejor que en el resto del mundo industrial. Barry Eichengreen, investigador de la Universidad de California en Berkeley, explic\u00f3: \u201cEs muy natural que el pa\u00eds cuya econom\u00eda tiene el desempe\u00f1o menos malo tenga la moneda menos mala\u201d.Pero con el descenso de muchas econom\u00edas en desarrollo y los mercados de valores dando tumbos, \u00bfpuede el alza del d\u00f3lar da\u00f1ar el fr\u00e1gil orden econ\u00f3mico?Muchos economistas sostienen que, en gran medida, es un factor positivo. Que el d\u00f3lar se mantenga fuerte puede ayudar a que Europa y Jap\u00f3n superen sus debilidades econ\u00f3micas, pues har\u00e1 que sus productos sean m\u00e1s baratos en los mercados mundiales, lo que es positivo para el crecimiento global. El fortalecimiento del d\u00f3lar, seg\u00fan me coment\u00f3 Oliver Blanchard, execonomista del Fondo Monetario Internacional, \u201ces, en esencia, un proceso saludable\u201d.Pero existen motivos para actuar con cautela. Como el d\u00f3lar est\u00e1 fuerte, los fabricantes estadounidenses que se han visto beneficiados por la ca\u00edda en los precios de energ\u00eda y el aumento de los salarios en China experimentar\u00e1n diversas presiones. Esto afectar\u00e1 el crecimiento en Estados Unidos y contendr\u00e1 la inflaci\u00f3n, que ya se encuentra por debajo de la cifra que esperaba la Reserva Federal.Los encargados de establecer las estrategias en los pa\u00edses en desarrollo pueden recordar las dos ocasiones en que el d\u00f3lar atraves\u00f3 etapas de una pronunciada alza en su valor. Fue en la primera mitad de la d\u00e9cada de los ochenta cuando Am\u00e9rica Latina cay\u00f3 en lo que ahora se conoce como la \u201cd\u00e9cada perdida\u201d, y en la segunda mitad de los noventa, cuando gran parte de Asia termin\u00f3 en crisis. No son recuerdos placenteros.Ahora el factor adicional es el nuevo papel de China en la econom\u00eda mundial, pues es una presencia significativa y su moneda ya no est\u00e1 aislada de las fuerzas externas, como ocurri\u00f3 durante esos momentos.Los ataques son un error. De hecho, el Fondo Monetario Internacional ya no considera que la moneda de China, el renminbi, est\u00e9 subvalorada. En realidad la divisa china ha aumentado la mayor parte del tiempo junto con el d\u00f3lar y as\u00ed aumenta la presi\u00f3n sobre su econom\u00eda, que ya est\u00e1 desacelerada.Beijing est\u00e1 en problemas. El verano pasado el gobierno chino prob\u00f3 la estrategia de Washington y permiti\u00f3 que las fuerzas de mercado influyeran para determinar el tipo de cambio. Pero cay\u00f3 el renminbi y se produjeron las quejas populistas de Estados Unidos. Lo peor es que los inversionistas chinos se apresuraron a sacar su dinero por temor a que la moneda estuviera al borde de una gran baja.El incremento del valor del d\u00f3lar \u201ccomplica el manejo de las pol\u00edticas\u201d en China, subray\u00f3 Eswar S. Prasad, exdirector de la divisi\u00f3n para China del FMI y acad\u00e9mico en la Universidad de Cornell. \u201cSi el renminbi baja un par de puntos porcentuales, significar\u00e1 que el banco central quiere una moneda mucho m\u00e1s barata y eso provocar\u00e1 m\u00e1s fugas de capital\u201d.Prasad, como la mayor\u00eda de los economistas, cree que la subida del d\u00f3lar es positiva. \u201cEstados Unidos es el \u00fanico pa\u00eds cuya moneda puede aumentar su valor sin que su econom\u00eda sufra consecuencias negativas importantes\u201d, afirm\u00f3. \u201cEn cierta forma, es una bendici\u00f3n para el mundo\u201d.Pero su an\u00e1lisis incluye otro aspecto.\u00bfRecuerdan la crisis financiera que afect\u00f3 al mundo debido al mercado inmobiliario de Estados Unidos y sus bancos? A pesar de encontrarse en el epicentro del desastre, el d\u00f3lar no se debilit\u00f3; por el contrario, se fortaleci\u00f3. Dominados por un terrible temor, los inversionistas no se atrevieron a mover sus fondos a otra moneda.En la actualidad quiz\u00e1 sea seguro afirmar que al d\u00f3lar, en general, lo rigen fuerzas naturales que deber\u00edan revertirse cuando el crecimiento se desarrolla en otra parte del mundo. Pero en esta econom\u00eda global tan inestable, ser\u00eda muy temerario ignorar una de las principales fuerzas que han regido los flujos financieros a lo largo de la historia: la irracionalidad.Advertisement"}

Khalifa Hifter, a divisive figure who has promised to purge Libya of Islamists and leads forces that are closely allied with the eastern government.The race to consolidate the government comes as the Islamic State has intensified its attacks on Libyan oil facilities to the east of the extremist group\u2019s stronghold in the central city of Surt. Mustafa Sanalla, the head of Libya\u2019s state oil company, said in a statement on Sunday that the group had done \u201ca tremendous amount of damage to the oil industry in the last two weeks.\u201d\u201cTheir objective is to prevent the new government from stabilizing the economy, and unless they are stopped, they might succeed in their aims,\u201d Mr. Sanalla said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bank of England to Require More Buffers for Britain\u2019s Biggest Banks", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Britain\u2019s largest banks would have to hold an additional buffer of capital under newly proposed rules meant to protect their retail banking businesses in a financial crisis, the Bank of England said on Friday.Under the latest proposal, banks and building societies with more than 175 billion pounds, or about $250 billion, in total assets would have to maintain a so-called systemic risk buffer beginning in 2019, the central bank said.The new buffer, which had been anticipated, would be equivalent to as much as 3 percent of a lender\u2019s assets as measured by risk, the Bank of England said.The central bank expects to conclude a public consultation period on the proposed buffer in April and finish its capital framework requirements for ring-fenced banks by the end of May. The ring-fencing rules would go into effect in 2019.\u201cThe financial crisis demonstrated the long-lasting damage that can be caused when large banks become distressed and have to cut back lending to the economy,\u201d he added. \u201cThese proposals are intended to reduce the risk of this happening again.\u201dRing-fencing rules would apply to banks and building societies with more than \u00a325 billion in deposits.The British retail banking businesses of Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group and the Royal Bank of Scotland would be among those subject to ring-fencing.The systemic risk buffer could range from 1 percent to 3 percent of assets as measured by risk and would be based by a lender\u2019s overall assets, the Bank of England said.Based on current information, the Bank of England\u2019s Financial Policy Committee estimated that the largest ring-fenced bank in Britain would have to maintain a 2.5 percent buffer in 2019.The central bank contends that the British banking system as a whole would only need to raise additional capital equivalent to about 0.5 percent of total risk-weighted assets held by lenders in order to comply with the new buffer.Advertisement"}

Investors like Mr. Li, who has built two other factories here, as well as Chinese state companies, are active all over the country, building highways, digging mines and melting steel.In Tehran, the Chinese have been involved in the construction of a huge elevated expressway and the building of the Niayesh Tunnel, which at more than three and a half miles will be one of the longest urban tunnels in the world. The city\u2019s metro system was built from scratch, starting in 1995, with Chinese capital and Chinese engineers. The train cars that run on it are Chinese, too.\u201cWesterners visiting the capital often wonder how we managed to pull off such ambitious projects during the heaviest sanction regime in history,\u201d said Mohammad Reza Sabzalipour, Iran\u2019s World Trade Center representative. \u201cWell, we did it with the help of our Chinese friends.\u201d Thirst for cheap crude oil and enthusiasm for the Silk Road project, which incorporates the goal of unlocking China\u2019s isolated western provinces, brought the Chinese to Iran, the only country in the Middle East where the United States had no presence. Iran had long welcomed the relationship, but after sanctions started to squeeze the economy at the end of the last decade, the country gained a special status, and China\u2019s slow but steady advance here began.\u201cWe are Iran\u2019s biggest trading partner for six years in a row,\u201d Mr. Xi wrote in an open letter to the Iranian people, Xinhua, China\u2019s state news agency, reported on Thursday, a day before his arrival on a Middle East tour that will also take him to Saudi Arabia and Egypt.During the Iran-Iraq war, China sold weapons, including Silkworm missiles, to Iran.\u201cAfter the revolution we exchanged the Western frowns with the smiles from the East,\u201d said Asadollah Asgaroladi, one of Iran\u2019s wealthiest businessmen and the head of the Iran-China chamber of commerce. \u201cThey continue to smile at us.\u201dSo the two countries, which were connected by the old Silk Road, have embarked on building a new one.\u201cChina has considerable strength in capital, technologies, equipment and other areas,\u201d Mr. Xi wrote in his letter. \u201cIran has rich resources, ample labor force and huge market potential, and it is in the crucial stage of industrialization and modernization.\u201dIn the last decade, trade started gravitating toward China and away from Germany, Iran\u2019s traditional partner, with a business volume of more than $30 billion annually. Iran exported $19 billion in crude oil and petrochemical products and imported $17 billion in goods and services in 2013. Iran\u2019s other big petroleum customers, South Korea and Japan, were persuaded by the United States to halve their purchases of Iranian light crude.China did not play along.\u201cThey are an independent country,\u201d Mr. Asgaroladi said. \u201cThey don\u2019t allow the Americans to tell them what to do. So they buy our oil, now and in the future.\u201dIn order to ease Chinese oil payments to Iran, a bank was created, Mr. Asgaroladi said.Although that institution, the Bank of Kunlun, was formed to handle oil money, Reuters, quoting a Western intelligence report, said in 2014 that the elite Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps also used the bank for payments.The Chinese may have no qualms about buying Iranian oil, but they take care not to violate United States sanctions on banking transactions because of their extensive use of American banks, Mr. Asgaroladi said.\u201cThe Ministry of Oil\u2019s money is deposited in accounts in this bank,\u201d he said. \u201cWe use 30 to 40 percent to make cash payments for purchases elsewhere in Asia, and the rest is used to finance projects in Iran and buy Chinese items.\u201dDuring a visit last summer to Mr. Li\u2019s steel mill, near the village of Zarrinabad, Chinese laborers were sweeping in preparation for its opening.Speaking through an interpreter, Mr. Li said that he became interested in Iran after relatives told him that it was an interesting place to invest, and that he came here in 2010. While he refused to go into details of how the money for the project arrived, he said it involved a \u201cprivate transfer,\u201d essentially a money swap that was based on trust and that avoided traditional banking routes.Mr. Asgaroladi said Mr. Li had received financing through the Chinese government but did not say how that money made it to Iran. \u201cWe do a lot of bartering,\u201d he said.\u201cIf all goes well, we will have a yearly output of 600,000 tons of steel,\u201d an assistant to Mr. Li said. In August, the plant \u2014 which has a private train, 700 mostly Chinese employees and a huge exhaust tower \u2014 was officially opened in the presence of Iranian and Chinese officials.China took the opportunity the sanctions offered, said Mr. Sabzalipour, the Tehran World Trade Center representative. Of course, for outsiders, it seems as if the Chinese have ignored the economic cordon against Iran, he said.\u201cOn the other hand, I think it was never the intention to destroy our economy, just make us feel pain,\u201d he said. \u201cSo perhaps the Americans intentionally looked the other way when China threw us this lifeline.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Racial Identity, and Its Hostilities, Are on the Rise in American Politics", "Date": "2016-01-05", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneWhy do working-class Americans vote as they do?The question has long bedeviled analysts on the left, troubled that people who would largely benefit from a more robust government seem so often to vote for right-leaning politicians eager to cut federal programs to pay for tax cuts for the rich.Though subtle, this variation reflects an important shift in American politics: Perhaps even more than economic status, racial, ethnic and cultural identity is becoming a main driver of political choice.It suggests that the battle over the purpose and configuration of the American government \u2014 what it\u2019s for, who it serves \u2014 may become more openly about \u201cus\u201d versus \u201cthem,\u201d along ethnic lines.Donald Trump is backed by 43 percent of Republicans with at most a high school education, but only 28 percent of those with bachelor degrees and 21 percent of those with some graduate school, according to an analysis of the most recent New York Times/CBS poll.Such voters are nostalgic for the country they lived in 50 years ago, when non-Hispanic whites made up more than 83 percent of the population. Today, their share has shrunk to 62 percent as demographic change has transformed the United States into a nation where others have a shot at political power.Their fear is understandable. In general, the concerns of Hispanic and black American voters are often different from those of white voters. But the reaction of whites who are struggling economically raises the specter of an outright political war along racial and ethnic lines over the distribution of resources and opportunities.Race, of course, has shaped political choices for a long time. The Republican takeover of the South is understood by scholars as a reaction to whites\u2019 sense of betrayal after the Democratic push for desegregation under President Lyndon Johnson.Racial animosity has long helped foster a unique mistrust of government among white Americans. Nonwhite voters mostly like what the government does. But many white Americans, researchers have found, would rather not have a robust government if it largely seems to serve people who do not look like them.The eminent sociologist William Julius Wilson described two decades ago how race and economics collided. In the United States, he wrote, white taxpayers have opposed welfare because they see themselves \u201cas being forced, through taxes, to pay for stuff for blacks that many of them could not afford for their own families.\u201dScholars have found evidence for these attitudes all over the place.Notably, minorities in the United States have never held much power. They are unlikely to feel that political influence to direct and constrain what government does is slipping away.Right-wing parties, Mr. Fischer added, are replacing the notion of a nation built on a shared commitment to a common constitutional and legal order with an ethnic definition of nationhood, derived from common descent and religion. White Europeans, in other words, are circling the wagons.A few years ago it looked as if the United States \u2014 long more tolerant of immigration, with a more fluid sense of national identity that readily allowed for hyphenation \u2014 could avoid this turn.But judging by this year\u2019s political debate, held against the background of improving but still insufficient prosperity, Americans are moving in the same direction. Racial identity and its attendant hostilities appear to be jumping from their longstanding place in the background of American politics to the very center of the stage.Email: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Businessman Who Trades in Hand-Me-Downs", "Date": "2016-01-17", "News": "Supported byKabul JournalKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 Hajji Ramazan has built a modest empire from used clothes.His shop, which has seen its fortunes wax and wane with those of Kabul, was started by his father 40 years ago in Chindawul market, one of the oldest in the city. Vendors in the narrow alleyway of several dozen shops sell everything from coal for heating to televisions to jalebi, spiral fritters soaked in syrup.The market was going through a relatively quiet period recently after the bustle of late autumn, when bales of imported used winter clothing \u2014 children\u2019s sweaters, women\u2019s jackets and men\u2019s overcoats \u2014 were stacked high in the shops.On a cold afternoon, day laborers crouched against a wall in the sunlight, chatting while sipping tea. Their carts were parked neatly in a row as snow-covered mountains glistened in the distance.The shop owners kept themselves busy by sorting clothes in front of their stores or on the rooftops, or by cooking lunch and cleaning their dishes afterward. They settled accounts with partners on the phone and planned ahead for spring, when new items would arrive. Several customers carried bales on carts, or backed up rented trucks to load their purchases.Back when Mr. Ramazan was a boy, he used to spend his mornings at school and his afternoons helping his father in the shop.\u201cIn those days, the poor and the rich came here to buy used clothes,\u201d Mr. Ramazan, 58, recalled fondly. \u201cIn downtown Kabul, there were maybe two or three stores of new clothes, but those clothes were not the same good quality as the used clothes here.\u201dHe added: \u201cMinisters would come, army generals would come. They would park their vehicles outside the market and walk with their children \u2014 no bodyguards or such in those days.\u201dThe upheaval of the 1980s after the Soviet invasion brought the used-clothing market in Chindawul to a standstill. After a police station near the market was attacked and looted by rebels, the Soviet-backed government rounded up men and boys in the area, including shopkeepers, bakers and even travelers staying in nearby hotels.Mr. Ramazan\u2019s family closed the shop and left for their village in the north. The market, owned by a family that migrated to the United States after the Soviet invasion, was looted and burned in the subsequent civil war of the 1990s.When Mr. Ramazan returned to open the shop during the Taliban years, much of the market remained in ruins.Soon after the new American-backed government was installed in 2001, he came up with the ambitious idea of buying from the source. He traveled for the first time to Karachi, the Pakistani port city where traders buy used clothing from charities and sorting businesses in the United States, Britain, Germany and South Korea, the biggest exporters. (Used clothing is a multibillion-dollar global industry.)The Karachi traders then supply northern parts of Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan.After a two-day journey by bus, Mr. Ramazan was welcomed excitedly by the traders, who wanted to increase exports to Afghanistan again. Without much history of doing business with him, they gave him 40 bales on credit.\u201cYou will not steal our money, we are confident,\u201d Mr. Ramazan recalled the traders telling him.Ever since, Mr. Ramazan has been making two trips to Karachi a year, each for two to three weeks. The traders there have even given him a room to use for business that he maintains all year. He has become one of the biggest traders of used clothes in Afghanistan, importing 1,000 bales each winter.He sells to about 50 retailers in Kabul and other provinces, and has what he calls \u201ccommission workers,\u201d who take clothes from him on credit in the morning and return in the evening to clear their accounts, paying him 15 percent of their profits.Mr. Ramazan\u2019s family has a house in Qalai Shadah, a part of Kabul\u2019s Old City, and a four-wheel-drive vehicle, popular with the well-off. He has also managed to send one of his five sons to Australia, paying smugglers $16,000 to get him there.As he grows older and slowly hands the business over to his eldest son, Mr. Ramazan prefers to spend mornings at home. After lunch, he walks an hour to the shop.\u201cUnless I really have to, I don\u2019t ride in the car,\u201d he said. \u201cAt my age, walking is good for my health.\u201dPouring himself cup after cup of tea from a thermos, he spends much of his time on the phone with clients in the provinces and the source in Karachi, placing smaller, more specific orders. Two large turquoise and carnelian rings on his fingers, he is constantly punching numbers on a large calculator, converting currencies.Once a retailer he works with buys a bale \u2014 the prices range from $130 for 100 pounds of socks to $700 for Korean blankets \u2014 the clothes go through another round of sorting, with the value of each item being set based on its condition. Some traders have complained of a slump in their business as the Afghan economy reels from a tough year. And some fret that the quality of imported clothes is not what it used to be.\u201cEven when we open bales from the U.S. and Germany, we find a lot of Chinese clothes,\u201d said Sayed Ahmad, 40, a retailer. \u201cWhat comes out of the bale, it\u2019s all about luck.\u201dThe retailers, used to long stretches of waiting, rub their hands for warmth, chat with neighbors and sip tea until a customer arrives. Sometimes conversations \u2014 a lot of bargaining and no buying \u2014 end in frustration.\u201cIf you like, you can buy, and if you don\u2019t, you can put it down and go,\u201d one retailer, a 68-year-old former resistance fighter who said he once commanded 1,000 men, told an older couple trying to bargain down the price of a pair of ski pants.\u201cWhy are you fighting?\u201d the older man said as he put down the pants and walked away with his wife.Other bargains are snapped up quickly. Abdul Hamid, a fourth-grade student who works as an apprentice at a restaurant after school, negotiated a $1.80 navy blue sweatshirt down to $1.10 at Mr. Ahmad\u2019s shop. One of the sleeves had holes, he argued, as he picked it up from the pile and tried it on \u2014 twice. He counted notes with his young hands, rough from labor, and walked away with a smile.The writing on the sweatshirt: \u201cSuperlative Conspiracy.\u201dZia ur-Rehman contributed reporting from Karachi, Pakistan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "College Towns Get New Housing, but It\u2019s Decidedly Not Dorms", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported bySquare FeetPHILADELPHIA \u2014 A block from Drexel University, a glassy new rental building offers residents a roof deck with a heated saltwater pool, a fire pit and outdoor televisions \u2014 amenities that would make for a raucous college party, if college students could live there.Instead, it aims to attract young professionals \u2014 junior faculty, office workers and young doctors \u2014 to live in University City, a West Philadelphia neighborhood that is also home to the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia and the Penn Presbyterian Medical Center.The Market Street apartments are among roughly 2,000 residential units that are planned or have recently opened in University City and are aimed at young professionals and graduate students. A local developer has also acquired eight rental buildings in the neighborhood since the summer, with plans to renovate those 600 units to attract more young professionals.Near college campuses around the country, developers have begun building luxury housing for the staff, not the students. Tapping into a desire among some younger workers to live in walkable, urban communities, these developers have discovered that a college neighborhood can fit that bill, as students are no longer the only ones who want to live near campus.\u201cIn a way, it\u2019s almost a continuation of the college experience,\u201d said Bruce J. Katz, the centennial scholar at the Brookings Institution, where he focuses on global urbanization. \u201cParticularly for people who are involved in the entrepreneurial economy and who are looking to spend the bulk of their time outside their apartment.\u201dAmong the new developments around the country are Century Square, a 60-acre mixed-use project rising near Texas A&M University in College Station with 250 luxury rentals; a mixed-use complex with 453 luxury rentals opposite Arizona State University in Tempe that will break ground this spring; and a 15-story tower with 180 residential units that opened in December in Hyde Park, a few blocks from the University of Chicago.College campuses, particularly research universities, have all the ingredients necessary to become a trendy live-work enclave. The area around a college campus \u201cis already lively. There are already bars and restaurants. There are already residential services,\u201d said Dustin Downey, the senior vice president for multifamily development at Southern Land Company, which developed 3601 Market in Philadelphia with Redwood Capital Investments and the University City Science Center. Southern Land also built similar projects in Nashville near Vanderbilt University and in Raleigh near North Carolina State University. \u201cWith those conveniences comes a really high quality of living.\u201dFor the universities, shiny new towers with playful amenities like shuffleboard, game rooms and dog runs make it easier to recruit young faculty members at no cost to the school, particularly in places like West Philadelphia, which lacks quality housing and has been plagued by poverty and crime for decades.These apartments do not come cheap. At 3601 Market, a third of the units have rented since leasing began in August. Of the remaining listings, a 427-square-foot studio is $1,525 a month; a 698-square-foot one-bedroom with a balcony is $2,025 a month; and two bedrooms start at $2,749 a month. By comparison, the median rent in University City is $1,450 a month, according to the University City District\u2019s report.Developers use various strategies to keep undergraduates away from these new projects, including high rents that most students can\u2019t afford. They time leasing to miss the start of the academic year, reject applicants who will rely on a guarantor to pay the rent and design spaces that are not ideal for young students. \u201cThe undergraduates get the message,\u201d Mr. Downey said.Otherwise, potential residents get skittish if they think that the halls might eventually get overrun with college students. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to have bicycles hanging off of the balconies and we\u2019re not going to have music blaring and kegs rolling down the hall,\u201d said Lawrence Pobuda, a senior vice president at Opus Group, which plans to build luxury housing next to Arizona State University.Not every community wants a glassy high rise with hundreds of new tenants who could strain public transit and increase traffic congestion. \u201cThere has been tension for many decades,\u201d said Carolyn T. Adams, a professor at Temple University who studies urban development. \u201cAnd so every time those institutions have needed to do some kind of construction or building they have had to work very hard to manage their relationship with the neighbors.\u201dFor the residents of Powelton Village, which abuts Drexel University, new market-rate housing means a reprieve from undergraduate housing, which to them translates to empty beer cans littering the sidewalks of the tree-lined streets. Powelton Village is a neighborhood of mostly Victorian homes, yet the homeownership rate was only 13 percent in 2010, according to a neighborhood report co-written by Drexel University.Many of the homes are divided into apartments for students. \u201cWe just need a balance in the neighborhood to keep it a community,\u201d said John J.H. Phillips, an artist and the president of the Powelton Village Civic Association, which supported Drexel\u2019s plan to redevelop 3201 Race Street. \u201cThe students don\u2019t take part in things that communities do, whereas young professionals and young families would have a more active role in the community.\u201dThe new development is having a ripple effect on the neighborhood. Last summer, Post Brothers Apartments, a local developer, began buying aging rental buildings with plans to renovate them. The centerpiece of the $95 million portfolio is Garden Court Plaza, a 146-unit Art Deco building at 4701 Pine Street. Apartments have parquet floors and crown molding, but kitchens and bathrooms need updating. As part of the renovations, the developers plan to upgrade an expansive green roof deck, adding croquet courts and outdoor grills. The developers also plan to restore the historic lobby and renovate apartments as leases turn over, raising rent to $1,900 a month for a one-bedroom, from about $1,200 a month.\u201cFor a very long time no developer was focused on serving this massive market of young professionals that are working here,\u201d said Matthew Pestronk, the president of Post Brothers Apartments. Until recently, \u201cThere has not been a white-collar, entry-level housing option available at all.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In India, a Small Band of Women Risk It All for a Chance to Work", "Date": "2016-01-30", "News": "The Indian Constitution guarantees equality under the law. But for women facing a patriarchal social order, strict caste rules and centuries of traditions, that guarantee means little.Supported byOn a humid, sweaty, honking afternoon last summer, two women were making their way through the court complex in the north Indian city of Meerut, searching for the office of the subdivisional magistrate.They walked past the purveyors of stamp papers and affidavits, typists clickety-clacking on stools, barristers-at-law in flapping gowns, pillars of wadded files bound in twine.It is fair to say that these two did not belong. They had the swaying walk of village women \u2014 half-duck, half-ballerina \u2014 who have spent their lives balancing bundles of firewood on their heads. When they entered the office of a criminal defense lawyer, in the sweat-stained broom closet where he receives clients, they were at first so conscious of their low status that they tried to sit on the floor.They were engaging his services because they wanted to work. They lived 10 miles away, in a small settlement where, for generations, begging had been the main source of income. A few weeks earlier, the male elders of their caste had decreed that village women working at nearby meat-processing factories should leave their jobs. The reason they gave was that women at home would be better protected from the sexual advances of outside men. A bigger issue lay beneath the surface: The women\u2019s earnings had begun to undermine the old order.It came as a surprise when seven of the women, who had come to rely on the daily wage of 200 rupees, about $3, refused to stop. The women would have to, the men said, blocking the lane with their bodies. They did not expect the women to go to the police.It would have been impossible \u2014 this appeal to the distant, abstract power of the Indian state \u2014 if the women had not been so angry.Geeta, the younger of the two, was born angry. Even as a child, if her siblings took her portion of food, she was apt to throw everyone\u2019s dinner into the dirt. \u201cA real bastard-woman,\u201d one neighbor called her, eyes widening with admiration.\u201cLet their ladies sit and cook for them,\u201d Geeta would hiss to her friend Premwati, as they walked together past their neighbors. \u201cOur husbands are with us.\u201dPremwati was a more cautious sort. In the tradition of their caste, the Nats, a person challenging a community punishment could offer a defense at trial by picking up a red-hot piece of iron and walking five steps toward the temple. If her hands burned, she was guilty, and would be placed in a hole in the ground until she confessed.They had wandered into dangerous territory, she and Geeta. She knew that. When evening fell in the village of Peepli Khera, Premwati would crouch over her clay stove, rolling chapatis in and out of the embers, and survey the forces arrayed against them. Too poor to afford a house with a door, she lay at night under a thatched roof, listening for the footsteps of people she could not see.Last summer, as they fought to remain in the work force, Geeta and Premwati made up a small part of a big economic puzzle.In India, women\u2019s participation in the labor force stands at around 27 percent, lower than any other country in the G-20, except for Saudi Arabia. Standard models suggest that a lucky confluence of factors \u2014 economic expansion, rising education levels and plummeting fertility \u2014 would draw women swiftly into India\u2019s economy.The Nat families were just crossing that threshold, and many things were changing. Premwati and Geeta could feel the grip of the local moneylenders loosening; the taste of independence made them bold. In this way, over five months last spring and summer, the unstoppable force of economic need met the immovable object of social control.The cost of remaining in the work force, they discovered, was very high.At 10 o\u2019clock on a morning in May, Geeta and Premwati wrapped fried bread in plastic bags and set off on foot toward the meat-processing factories. It was blindingly hot, and stray dogs and buffaloes lay in strips of shade on either side of the road.To save the 5-rupee, or 7-cent, fare for an auto-rickshaw, they walked the whole dusty distance, nearly an hour from their small community of Nats, who are Hindus, through the Muslim neighborhoods that surround the factories. They kept their dupattas pulled all the way down over their faces, following the medieval tradition of purdah, or veiling, but men in skullcaps lingered in the doorways anyway, gawking.\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d one of the men yelled, breaking the silence.\u201cGeeta,\u201d came the reply, bell-clear.The two met as young wives, taken away from their home villages and deposited among strangers in Peepli Khera. Geeta, who had barely hit puberty, landed in the grip of a mother-in-law who believed that drinking tea made a girl greedy for extra helpings of food.So Geeta would sneak over to see Premwati, who made buckets of tea, watery and sweet. Geeta was scrawny and mouthy. She tended to alienate women \u2014 maybe it was the way she called them fat buffaloes \u2014 but Premwati calmly allowed Geeta\u2019s insults to bubble over her. Geeta returned the favor by stomping over and intervening whenever Premwati\u2019s husband beat her.\u201cIt has become a habit to take a beating,\u201d Geeta said one day, scowling.In this way, Geeta had carved out a role for herself as the bossiest woman in the village. No one beat her. \u201cHer husband is like a chicken \u2014 if she tells him to get up, he will get up!\u201d chuckled the chief in the town where she grew up.As the women approached the factories that morning, they pulled their scarves over their faces against the smell, a stomach-turning odor that wafts off tallow-rendering vats and suggests rotting meat. Over the last five years, with the market for flash-frozen buffalo meat booming in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and China, India had quietly become the world\u2019s largest meat exporter. The factories outside Meerut were expanding.For this reason, about five years earlier, Geeta and her friends had been drawn into the labor force, supplementing their husbands\u2019 seasonal earnings as wedding-band musicians. Inside the boundary walls of the factories, they broke rocks into rubble and carried cement mix in shallow pans, balanced on the crowns of their heads, to stonemasons building interior walls. Some washed meat pans; some assembled cartons; some carried bricks.Geeta and Premwati found the work boring, and also terrifying. The women of their community live by rules: If an older man approaches, they cannot sit on any surface above the ground, so it is not unusual to see them suddenly slither down off cots and chairs. They are forbidden to have physical contact with men from outside the community, with the exception of physicians or bangle sellers.At first they went to work with their stomachs knotted with fear that a strange man might grab their hand. At this prospect, even Geeta\u2019s nerve collapsed. Once, while carrying a load of mud at a factory that crushes bones for animal feed, she slipped and fell into a 10-foot trench, her leg buckling beneath her. But when the factory\u2019s clerk, a Muslim, reached a hand down to help her up, she jerked away, as if his touch would scald her.She lay there in the mud, at the bottom of the ditch, until Premwati arrived to help her clamber out.As the weeks passed, though, their fears ebbed. At the construction sites, they watched migrant workers from Nepal and Bangladesh, buyers who flew in from China, and the sons of the factory owners, roaring in and out in BMWs and Audis.At night, returning home, they withdrew sweaty, folded bills from their blouses. A hollow-eyed woman named Pooja announced, with some surprise, that her husband and mother-in-law had stopped beating her. \u201cWhen you earn money,\u201d she said, \u201cyou are of some use to them.\u201d As for Geeta, it became clear to her that the men swarming around the factory grounds were not making sexual advances.\u201cWhen you start working, your heart opens up,\u201d she said. \u201cThen you\u2019re not scared anymore.\u201dAt this point, the women began to make changes to their appearance. Geeta took note when the other workers recoiled from her, and began to wash twice a day, with soap. She bought seven-foot lengths of cotton, the brighter the better, and paid tailors to stitch it into billowing pants.Premwati, whose husband spent most days stretched out drunk on his rope cot, felt, for the first time in years, that she was standing on solid ground. With her earnings she married off three children. One last son needed settling. Then she could exhale.Geeta\u2019s plans were wilder, more improbable. Though she had never been taught letters or numbers, she worked her cellphone constantly, using a system of vigorous trial and error. In the financial cooperative that the village women had formed, pooling their resources and extending loans, she proved to be an excellent, if frightening, debt-collector. She began making payments into a life insurance policy with such a generous payout that she sometimes daydreamed, a little wistfully, about her husband\u2019s untimely death.She took advances on her salary, which were interest-free, rather than patronizing the local moneylenders.Then, last spring, she attracted attention by building a second house for herself, of rosy, freshly kilned brick, abutting the compound of Roshan, the village\u2019s most powerful man.When Roshan, the Nat chief in Peepli Khera, is ready to perform an exorcism, he starts out by asking a coy question: \u201cDo you want to see the real drama?\u201dThen he trembles. His eyes roll back, he arches his tongue against his teeth like the goddess Kali, who communicates to him through a string of wooden beads that he holds up to his ear, as if it were a cellphone. Nat families who are mistrustful of hospitals \u2014 that is, nearly all of them \u2014 come from miles away to see Roshan, who claims to be able to evict the jinns that have inhabited their bodies.Asked how many of his patients survive, he barks laughter. \u201cHow do I know that? If they survive, they survive.\u201dIn the half-light of evening, Roshan surveys the settlement, his chest thrown out. He has the high cheekbones of his nomadic ancestors, who made a living walking tightropes to entertain the Mughal courts. His lips are speckled and plump as cuts of liver. This is his dominion \u2014 about 40 miles northeast from Delhi as the crow flies, but far from the modern world.Villagers live in a few dozen houses arranged around a whitewashed temple. A plaque notes that the temple was built by Roshan\u2019s family, though no one needs to be reminded, and anyway, only two adults here know how to read. No one uses a surname or knows his or her age. One man, asked how old he thought he was, responded, \u201cI don\u2019t have any teeth left, and I am about to go.\u201dOn a recent morning, a woman named Usha, her leg shrunken from polio, held a 4-month-old baby who was suffering from vomiting and diarrhea. His limbs were wasted, and he looked up with the slow, narcotic gaze of a very old man. His vertebrae pressed sharply out of the parchment skin of his back. He was too weak to cry.Three of Usha\u2019s children had already died. The three who had survived infancy were sitting on the ground near her, eating dry toast from a plastic bag. One was so hungry that he grabbed a raw, half-peeled potato, speckled with rot, out of her hand, and bit into it. When a passing neighbor asked why they were so dirty, she grimaced.\u201cWe are poor people,\u201d she said hoarsely. \u201cWe were born in dirt, we live in dirt, we will die in dirt.\u201dRoshan\u2019s proudest moment occurred decades ago, when a police officer, sniffing for bribes, made the mistake of venturing into the square and grabbing his cousin by the neck. Roshan, then a young man, picked up an ax handle and hit the officer hard in the face. Since then, he likes to say, the police have not found occasion to come here. A boundary had been demarcated: This is a place beyond the reach of the state.With the arrival of the factories, that boundary had begun to disappear. Roshan\u2019s village was being swallowed by an expanding city. He forbade the women in his own family to work at the factories, but watched with distaste as his neighbors left in the morning. He looked back with nostalgia at the time when the Nats supported themselves by begging.\u201cLife was much better 20 years back,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a nice society. Now women are going out and meeting strange men.\u201dIn the spring of last year, after Geeta built her new house, Roshan\u2019s son Dharmender began observing her with special interest. He noted her new outfits, the way she came home \u201cwith the crease in her clothes still visible.\u201d He scanned her friends\u2019 faces for traces of makeup. He shared his suspicion that they worked at an air-conditioned site.Their work, he said, had a whiff of immorality.\u201cThey have everything: Clothes to wear. Enough to eat,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy would they need to work? They still have husbands. It\u2019s not just insulting to them, it\u2019s insulting to the whole village.\u201dIt was difficult to say where the rumor started. It concerned Geeta\u2019s neighbor Pinki, who had fair skin and a little girl\u2019s high, fluting voice. She was married with one child and worked at one of the new construction sites, breaking rocks with a hammer. Some reported that Pinki had been seen riding on a strange man\u2019s motorcycle, others that a man from the construction site had shown up at her family home.In May, Roshan vanished into the temple to present the matter to his most trusted authority: the goddess Kali. After a long conversation over the magic necklace, he emerged saying that the goddess had shared a piece of disturbing news. Women in the village, he said, were engaged in prostitution.\u201cIf Kali tells us this person is wrong,\u201d he said, \u201cthis person is wrong.\u201dRoshan wrapped his head in the stained turban that marked him as the chief, and for more than an hour, as the smell of heat and dung filled the square, the men of the village debated what to do. The problem, Roshan said, went beyond Pinki, to the general question of what went on when their women disappeared into the factories.His younger brother was in full agreement: Female employment, he said, \u201chas spread like wildfire\u201d and was hurting the reputation of the village. A third elder, their cousin, observed that his own wife worked at a factory, adding 5,000 rupees a month to the 1,800 he earned in a wedding band, but that there was an important difference between these income flows. \u201cMy money,\u201d he said, \u201cis the money that is earned with respect.\u201dIt was decided: The village\u2019s women would stop working.Geeta gathered a war council on the floor of her house. They were a party of seven, including Premwati, Pinki and another neighbor, Rekha. Geeta\u2019s proposal was to ignore Roshan\u2019s ban. If their female neighbors were willing to quit their jobs, it was only out of fear. The fear would fade, maybe in a month, maybe in two. In the meantime, she told her friends, they had the full support of the Indian government.The government she had in mind was a Muslim politician named Jahiruddin Mewati, who had served as chief of the village of Peepli Khera until a few years earlier, and who was running again in the fall.Mr. Mewati\u2019s furred belly peeks out of the bottom of his dress shirt, and he has Tourette\u2019s syndrome, so he emits a stream of grunts and tics. In the middle of a conversation, he slammed his hand with great force on the table, exclaiming, \u201cI am on the side of the truth! I am not worried about votes! I am the true servant of the people, because injustice has been done!\u201dMr. Mewati\u2019s study of politics, especially the tactics of the British Raj, had persuaded him that there was much to be gained \u2014 specifically, votes \u2014 by inserting himself into local controversies. With all adult men and women counted, there are about 150 votes in the Nat community, nothing to sneeze at in a district where elections are won by a margin of 20 or 30. When Geeta appeared in his reception area, a collection of plastic chairs arranged under a tree, he smelled opportunity.\u201cNobody can stop them from going to work,\u201d he said staunchly. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a Taliban here. It\u2019s a democracy.\u201dHeartened, the women decided they would simply leave for work in the morning. Except, when they did, their neighbors were standing there, telling them to stop.\u201cOn 18.05.2015 at 9:00 A.M. I was going for work,\u201d reads the report filed at the police station in Kharkhauda, signed with Pinki\u2019s thumbprint and written in the hand of their sponsor, Mr. Mewati.\u201cThese people started saying that we were told not to go to the factory, because bad things are happening at the factory. These people became angry and started abusing me and they threatened to kill me. I request you to lodge my report and take legal action.\u201dShe added, for good measure, \u201cthese people can beat me at any time.\u201dThe station officer, Manoj Kumar Singh, took her complaint with a grain of salt. He had seen versions of this drama playing out in other hamlets where young women were leaving for work. The old, patriarchal order was dying in rural India, dying slowly, and releasing toxic bursts as it did.\u201cThat may be the cause of this whole trouble, that they are losing control,\u201d he shrugged. \u201cThese old practices are going away.\u201dWhen word got out that the women had gone to the police, Roshan\u2019s son Dharmender was the one sent to tell them how they would be punished. He stood in the lane and yelled it over the wall, using the old phrase \u201cHookah-pani bandh,\u201d a sanction that dates back to medieval times, when sharing a water-pipe packed with tobacco was the prerogative of adult men in rural India. From this point forward all seven women would be outcasts \u2014 symbolically denied the hookah, as well as pani, water, from a shared pump.Geeta, Premwati and their friends tried to wrap their heads around it. As children they had heard of the rite of ostracism \u2014 it was used to frighten them into obedience \u2014 but they had never seen it imposed. At first they found ways to adjust, avoiding a confrontation with their neighbors by sticking to the lanes and handpumps that had been constructed with government money.A few days passed before the finger of the punishment touched them. Geeta\u2019s teenage niece greeted the girl next door and watched her glide by wordlessly, like a ghost. Rekha dialed the numbers of relatives, one after the other, and when she told them what had happened to her and spoke the phrase \u201chookah-pani,\u201d they hung up.Then a wedding was held at the home of a neighbor of Geeta\u2019s. There was a bus full of well-wishers, rice and dal for families who converged from a constellation of villages. The outcasts could hear the music from their homes.A delegation had come from Geeta\u2019s home village, and it included her mother, Anguri. Geeta remembered her tenderly massaging her legs before sending her away to be married. She thought she was around 10. She had seen her on rare occasions since then.Geeta offered her mother a glass of water. She refused. Geeta offered her tea. She refused. Geeta invited her in. She refused.\u201cI feared that if I drank it they would declare me an outcast,\u201d her mother said later. \u201cWe have no outcasts here. In our community, the elders are supreme.\u201dGeeta\u2019s mother began to weep, right there in the road. Then she turned her back and returned to the neighbor\u2019s house.Geeta liked to think of herself as hardened, but this took her by surprise. \u201cShe always loved me before this dispute,\u201d she said.Unwilling to cry in front of the neighbors, Geeta turned, walked into her own house, closed the door, and wept.Dharmender was astounded that the seven women persisted in going to work. The rest of the village\u2019s women spent their days collecting firewood, and by mid-July, the piles had grown into towering, tangled masses that threatened to topple over. In the mornings, when Geeta and her friends left for the factories, men lined the roadway and jeered. \u201cAre you going to star in a pornographic movie?\u201d one of them called out.The whole thing was strange, Dharmender said. The women had been offered a deal, allowing them back in the community if they confessed to \u201cimmoral acts\u201d and paid a fine, but they had refused it. Ostracism was such a severe punishment that dissenters usually relented within 24 hours, paying whatever fine the elders demanded. Geeta and her friends had already lived as outcasts for three months. \u201cWho,\u201d he wondered aloud, \u201cwould be willing to suffer so much?\u201dThe women, too, were in uncharted territory. Every two weeks, they made a trip to the magistrate\u2019s court in Meerut to renew a restraining order that the police had recommended, which would impose a 50,000-rupee fine on anyone who resorted to violence.Their lawyer, Mohammed Yusuf Siddiqui, had rarely sat across his desk from such nervous clients. In his practice, it was not unusual to see state justice conflict with caste justice. One of his clients, who had appealed to court in order to obtain a divorce, had been assigned a punishment by his village council, to spit on the ground and then lick the spit.Still, there was something unusual about these women, who signed each document with a thumbprint. Mr. Siddiqui watched them curiously.\u201cThey know nothing about court procedure,\u201d he said. \u201cThey never ask me questions. They just say one thing: \u2018We are not wrong. We are not wrong. We are not wrong.\u2019\u201dPremwati, it turned out, had not fully reckoned how much she had to lose. Earlier in the year, she had managed to arrange a marriage for the second of her sons, a muscular teenager named Bhima. She had found a way to secure a bride without going deeper into debt, enrolling him in a mass wedding sponsored by the government to ease the financial burden on poor families.Under the circumstances, Bhima was braced for disappointment, but the girl Premwati had found was, improbably, a beauty: her eyes large and luminous, brows arched like a film star. Bhima was boggled with love.By late July, two months after Premwati was ostracized, that small victory had curdled. The girl, Puja, now an outcast by virtue of her marriage, was not allowed to attend her brother\u2019s wedding, and she was wild with anger, crouching on the ground and murmuring to herself. She glowered at Bhima if he so much as put his arm around her. In the evenings, he began to beat her, energetically enough that the neighbors heard.One hot night, Puja\u2019s father swaggered into the family\u2019s courtyard, a flask of Besto whiskey and a toy revolver tucked into his waistband, and announced that he was going to take his daughter back to her home village. He lifted one foot and kicked a chunk out of the mud wall that marked the edge of Premwati\u2019s homestead.\u201cAll these problems are caused by one woman. I don\u2019t want to say her name right now,\u201d he said, and turned his bleary gaze to Premwati.Just like that, the young bride was gone. Puja dressed up on the morning of her departure, putting on the rhinestone-studded kitten-heeled sandals she had worn at her wedding. They kicked up a cloud of dust as she disappeared down the road.Premwati seemed deflated. The monsoon rains had brought down the wall of her hut in a lumpy mass, and when night fell, clouds of mosquitoes moved in. Now her son, withdrawn into a lovesick funk, blamed her for the breakup of his marriage. She looked exhausted. \u201cI have worked so hard,\u201d she said. \u201cBut still there is always trouble in the house.\u201dRoshan had followed the sequence of events with satisfaction. These women, he said, were trying to show that they could exist without the community. When he heard that the girl was gone, he smiled.\u201cSlowly, slowly, they will understand our power,\u201d he said.Around the hearths of the Nat women, the ones who had agreed to resign their jobs, pressure was building. They wanted to be loyal to the community elders but by September, stripped of the 200 rupees a day that had been supporting their families, they were running out of money.Geeta\u2019s neighbor, an imposing woman known as Big Suman, surveyed the homesteads one by one with the experienced eye of a general. She had disapproved of Geeta\u2019s rebellion, but she grumbled about having to give up her income. One morning, a moneylender stormed down the lane, bellowing, \u201cGive me my money or I will take your bicycle!\u201dOn one of her rounds, Big Suman spotted something peculiar: A widow with grown children was trudging back from the nearest town with a sack of flour balanced on her head. Big Suman did a double-take. She knew what begging looked like. This was an activity \u2014 \u201cspreading your hands before strangers\u201d \u2014 that the Nats were trying to leave behind.The widow\u2019s story was what she expected. She had run out of flour two days earlier. The thought of going deeper into debt terrified her, so she did not want to approach Roshan, who would lend money but charge interest. She wept, and then she went to beg.That morning, Big Suman decided the time had come to end it. She visited all the women who had resigned from the factories, stopping by at times when they would not be overheard by Roshan. They agreed that they would break into small groups, leaving when the men slept, and take their case to the one person who could clear the way for them to work again.When Mr. Mewati, the Muslim politician from down the road, saw the crowd of women enter his courtyard, he perked up. Local elections were two months away and he was feeling lively, like a bear coming out of hibernation. Several days later, at 7:30 one September morning, he bumped down the road in his decrepit Maruti Gypsy jeep, its suspension squeaking as it hit ruts in the road.He moved with purpose. His shirt was clean and crisply ironed. He parked the Gypsy in front of Roshan\u2019s homestead, and a series of Mr. Mewati\u2019s male cousins unfolded themselves from the back seat, assuming positions in Roshan\u2019s yard. The two headmen sat down on a rope cot, exchanging compliments.\u201cI am with you with all my heart,\u201d Mr. Mewati said.\u201cI know you are,\u201d Roshan said.\u201cEven if I die, I will support you,\u201d Mr. Mewati said.\u201cI can die, but I cannot fight against you,\u201d Roshan said.Mr. Mewati assembled the villagers and informed them that the Indian Constitution guaranteed equality under the law. Women could not be prevented from working, and Geeta and her friends should be forgiven. Then he withdrew 3,000 rupees in folded bills from his pocket, enough to cover the fine for Geeta\u2019s disobedience, and handed it to Roshan.\u201cTake care of this mess,\u201d he said.The machinery of compromise cranked into motion. Roshan\u2019s brother sprinkled sugar on the ground outside the temple, reversing the rite of ostracism. Geeta and her friends lined up and their neighbors embraced them gingerly, barely grazing one another with their arms. Geeta gathered the women to celebrate, and a shoe dangled on a pole above her house, in an ancient symbol of contempt for her accusers.The matter was unfinished. Some tension flickered in the night. Dharmender, livid at his father\u2019s lenience, grabbed Roshan by the shoulders and tried to shove him out of the town square.\u201cYour mind is not working,\u201d he said.It was late at night, two nights later, that the police stationed at Kharkhauda received a report of violence from the village of Peepli Khera.The officer on duty was Subinspector Ankit Chauhan, a babyfaced 28-year-old. Striding down the center lane into the settlement, heavy loops of khaki braid hanging from each shoulder, the subinspector noted that there were few men present, only a gaggle of women who had, he deduced, spent the last hours exchanging terms of abuse. He recalls examining \u201cscratches and bruises,\u201d nothing serious.Finally, because he saw the necessity for some kind of action, he detained a short, excitable man, one of several who had been named in a complaint from Geeta, a female resident of the village.He then gathered the villagers and reminded them that it was necessary to embrace modern life. Subinspector Chauhan recorded this encounter as a constructive, civil one. Then, satisfied that he had performed his duty, he got back into his service vehicle and left the village.Those who remained could hear the familiar sound as the police car bumped away down the rutted dirt road. Chup chup chup chup chup.At night, the settlement is engulfed in darkness, oceans of darkness.The electricity flickers on for a few hours a night, creating pools of light from single bulbs suspended inside each house. Beyond that, for miles around, there are only crickets, stars and sugar cane fields.Jackals, gray and ghostly, dart in and out of the croplands.When the sound of the police car had become faint enough, Dharmender and his brothers and his cousins and uncles came back out of the sugar cane field.Premwati watched them advancing across the village square, some two dozen men closing in. When bricks began to fly, she and her friends ducked inside a house and braced their bodies against the door. Seated on the floor by the light of a candle, Premwati could see the faces of her neighbors, some pressed up against the grill on a window: Those she loved, those in her family, those she had known since childhood.\u201cThey have put a black mark on us,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will stay as long as we live together.\u201dPinki, whose 4-year-old daughter was trapped outside with the crowd, had begun to sob.\u201cThey said, \u2018By morning you will come out,\u2019\u201d Pinki recalled. \u201cThey said, \u2018We will sit here all night for you.\u2019\u201dKarim Khan, a Muslim neighbor, rushed over from his sundries shop when he heard about the melee, certainly more excitement than he had gotten from the Nat village in a long time.\u201cThose women peed their pants from fear and it was running out onto the floor,\u201d he chortled. \u201cThey peed their pants! All these men were standing outside and banging on their doors, abusing them. They knew if they fought again, they would be killed.\u201dInside the tiny house, Geeta\u2019s friends watched as she dialed the cellphone again and again that night. But the government was not available. Mr. Mewati remained in his compound, about a mile away. He claimed later that his phone\u2019s battery had died and he had been unable to receive calls.Subinspector Chauhan, for his part, was not in a hurry to return to this corner of his precinct twice in the same night. He found the reports of serious injury to be dubious. Where the Nats were concerned, he reasoned, injuries could be caused by any number of things.\u201cThese people are all drunkards,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are so drunk that even if you push one of those guys into a drain, he will fall down. These women try to exaggerate, they say, \u2018This person attacked us, that person attacked us.\u2019\u201dMr. Siddiqui, their defense lawyer, saw no need to report the incident to the magistrate who had issued the restraining order. Sometimes, he said, it is better to allow a community to settle its own differences rather than initiate a laborious investigation. Anyway, he added, the police are very busy.\u201cThis is a country with 1.4 billion people,\u201d he said. \u201cThe police can\u2019t stand behind every single person.\u201dThe women were alone. When it became clear that Geeta\u2019s friends were securely barricaded, Dharmender gathered a few men and made his way to the other end of the village.Coursing through him, he explained later, was a certain kind of anger that he associated with being part of a mob. He had felt it before; it is gone after 15 minutes. But for that period, anger can make ordinary men strong enough to flip over a truck. Geeta had already called the police, and Dharmender saw no further reason to avoid violence.Geeta\u2019s husband, Sanjay, was in his undershirt at a neighbor\u2019s house, watching a television serial, the children asleep under mosquito nets. When he looked up he saw that the door was blocked by bodies. He recalls the sight of his niece, slumped beside a drain, crying, and a heavy blow to the back of his head, and then nothing.Dharmender felt pity as he beat Geeta\u2019s husband: Sanjay was a poor boy, a decent boy. It was not his fault.\u201cIf he was a bad person, we would feel O.K. that he had gotten hurt. But he\u2019s a good guy,\u201d Dharmender said. But the beating was necessary, he said, with a heavy sigh. \u201cUntil someone gets hurt, people don\u2019t learn.\u201dThe crowd dispersed some time later, leaving Sanjay unconscious in a pool of blood, with a deep cut on his arm, a slit snaking across a cheekbone, and a red knot on his forehead. His neighbors recalled seeing him lying unconscious on a woodpile. The police, when they finally arrived, recommended that he be taken to the hospital.Sanjay would spend five days in a hospital bed. He had always been a small and quiet man, but when he returned to the village, he was somehow smaller and quieter. He took to slipping in and out in the half-light, trying to avoid crossing paths with the men who had beaten him.\u201cAnyone who has beaten you in the night can do it again,\u201d he said.Geeta, too, had lost her swagger. When people asked about Sanjay, she told them that he had fallen off the roof. She denied that she had been trapped in the house with the other women. She was no longer eager to boast about her campaign against the village council.\u201cThey are powerful,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are stronger. They beat us up like dogs.\u201dOn the day Sanjay was discharged, Roshan was lounging with his male relatives on a rope cot outside the temple. The heat was soporific, and beside them, two buffaloes nosed through a pile of dung, quietly grunting.All told, it had been an expensive night, Roshan said. To avoid criminal charges, he had had to pay 3,000 rupees for Sanjay\u2019s medical care and an additional 4,000 to ensure there would be no investigation. But it was worth it, they all agreed.Even Roshan\u2019s concession \u2014 allowing the women of the village to return to work in the factories \u2014 had turned out in his favor. Though the Nat women had headed out almost immediately, nearly all of the factories were now shuttered: China had closed its markets to Indian meat, and Brazil\u2019s currency had declined so sharply that its meat was now cheaper than Indian buffalo.So that was that. No one was hiring.Roshan could not help preening a little. \u201cSee, in our community, a woman is a woman and a man is a man,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is what it is here. Women have lower status and men have higher status.\u201d If any more women propose to challenge that principle, he said, \u201cwe will quietly, politely tell them this is not a good thing.\u201dAnd that night, as the sun slipped down over the sugar cane, Roshan and the others laughed and laughed.This story was reported over a five-month period by Ellen Barry in Peepli Khera, Meerut, Alipur, Atrara and Ganeshpur, India.

{"Headline": "Iranian Oil Shipper Hopes to Make Up for Lost Time as Sanctions End", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported by\u201cWe are in close contact with our foreign ministry,\u201d said Mr. Sardashti, explaining how the party could be arranged on such short notice. \u201cWe told our contacts: \u2018Come. Come to Iran. The sanctions will be lifted right before our party.\u2019 We were lucky. It happened.\u201dIn many ways, though, the celebration for the National Iranian Tanker Company, known as N.I.T.C., was more of a reunion than a session to get acquainted, as the global shipping industry welcomed back a partner \u2014 not from bankruptcy, but from one of the strictest sets of sanctions ever.For decades, the company, which owns 69 oil tankers, shipped crude around the world. Its English-speaking staff was in daily contact with brokers in all of the major financial markets, proud of the company\u2019s high standards and excellent reputation in a highly competitive industry.\u201cWe really missed them on the market,\u201d said Edwin Remeeus, a team leader at Vopak, a shipping agent based in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, that also stores and handles crude oil and natural gas. Vopak was forced to sever ties with N.I.T.C. in 2012, after having been its agent for over 30 years.\u201cEvery year, they would send us Christmas cards,\u201d Mr. Remeeus said. \u201cYou\u2019d think they would be upset, but they understood it wasn\u2019t personal.\u201dIn 2012, the United States Treasury Department identified 58 of the company\u2019s vessels and 27 of its corporate affiliates as extensions of the Iranian state, and it threatened actions against Western companies that used any of those services.For N.I.T.C., business, long solid, unraveled in a couple of months. First, insurers started excusing themselves, saying that they could no longer work with the Iranian company. Major oil companies, including Royal Dutch Shell, Total of France and Repsol of Spain, all longtime clients, said they needed to clear payments before giving new orders, but they complained that banks were preventing them from doing so.At N.I.T.C. headquarters here, committees were formed to devise ways around the sanctions. First, they changed insurers, using local brokers instead, but their foreign clients refused to deal with them. Then Malta, one of the most accommodating flags to sail under, cut ties, and the company had trouble finding new partners. At first it worked with the microstate of Tuvalu, and it eventually reflagged the entire fleet under Tanzania, widely regarded as a substandard \u201cflag of convenience.\u201dThe ships\u2019 names were also changed, dropping references to their country of origin. The Iran Astaneh became Neptune, the Iran Damavand just Damavand. Before long, the pride of the Iranian fleet was sailing under names like Amber, Horizon and Success.Mr. Sardashti did not want to go into details, but he dismissed the whole period under sanctions as \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201cmean.\u201d\u201cWe had to change our standards; it was painful,\u201d he recalled, adding that he was grateful for the countries and companies that had been willing to help N.I.T.C. in those tough times. Even so, he acknowledged, \u201cgradually, we lost our biggest clients.\u201dThe government started meddling with the company, and many industry insiders were surprised when Hamid Behbahani, a former minister of roads and transportation, was appointed chief executive \u2014 even though he had been impeached for falsifying a university degree. He was replaced after a year by Ali-Akbar Safaei, who is still at the helm.In 2014, when the company was exclusively serving China and five other Asian nations still buying some Iranian oil \u2014 limited sales were allowed under the sanctions \u2014 it had a glimmer of success when a European Union court ruled that the sanctions against the company were illegal. Still, until the sanctions were lifted, N.I.T.C. gained no new customers.On Saturday, Iran made its first oil sale to a European company since the sanctions were lifted. But Mr. Sardashti said he had not yet received a call from the buyer, Hellenic Petroleum, to ship it to Greece. When he does, he says, he will have plenty of oil at hand. With the current global oil glut, several of his tankers are being used as floating storage, waiting for buyers.So far, though, not a single ship had set sail for Europe. \u201cWe are waiting for our first assignment,\u201d Mr. Sardashti said.\u201cWe all hoped that one day the sanctions would be gone,\u201d said Wictor Mansson of the shipping company Affinity in London. \u201cOther companies picked up their share, but in the end we have less tonnage to transport the oil, so their return might push prices down.\u201dSome obstacles remain, however. Despite sanctions being lifted, financing has been slowed by international banks\u2019 fears of penalties from the United States Treasury Department over sanctions it imposed decades ago for Iran\u2019s state sponsorship of terrorism.\u201cAll our crews have been updated, our standards are still high, we are ready for business,\u201d Mr. Sardashti said. \u201cNow, we hope the others are, too.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Akira Amari, Japan\u2019s Economic Revitalization Minister, Resigns Amid Scandal", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byAkira Amari, the minister for economic revitalization, announced his resignation after markets closed in Japan. It was both a surprise and an embarrassing setback for Mr. Abe, who has used monetary easing by the Bank of Japan and other economic measures \u2014 a package known as Abenomics \u2014 to reverse the deflation and lackluster economic growth that have beleaguered the country for much of the past quarter-century.\u201cI feel responsible for appointing him, and I apologize to the Japanese people for this matter,\u201d Mr. Abe said after Mr. Amari\u2019s resignation.Mr. Abe called the economy his \u201ctop priority,\u201d and he immediately appointed to the post Nobuteru Ishihara, a former environment minister and the secretary general of Mr. Abe\u2019s party, the Liberal Democrats, which has been in power throughout most of Japan\u2019s postwar history.On Friday, the Bank of Japan lowered its benchmark rate to -0.1 percent beginning Feb. 16. The bank said the step was needed to help stimulate the economy and hit its target of 2 percent annual inflation. Mr. Amari had been expected to travel to New Zealand next week for a signing ceremony for the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Mr. Abe, while crediting Mr. Amari for his work on the trade accord, said the resignation would not affect the deal, as its provisions were \u201calready basically agreed.\u201dThe scandal that led to Mr. Amari\u2019s downfall unfolded quickly.But a follow-up piece in the magazine on Thursday quoted a company official, Takeshi Isshiki, as saying that Mr. Amari had twice pocketed envelopes containing \u00a5500,000 in cash \u2014 at his ministerial office in Tokyo in November 2013 and at his office in Kanagawa Prefecture in February 2014. It claimed that further unrecorded payments were made, for a total of tens of millions of yen.The magazine also reported salacious details concerning two aides to Mr. Amari. According to the magazine, Mr. Isshiki accompanied them to bars and nightclubs in the Ginza area of Tokyo, where he covered the expenses. One aide took \u00a53 million and used it for personal purposes, according to a report disclosed during Mr. Amari\u2019s news conference on Thursday.Mr. Amari acknowledged at that news conference that his aides had acted improperly, citing the investigation by an independent lawyer whom Mr. Amari had hired to look into the matter. The two aides have resigned.Mr. Amari also acknowledged that Mr. Isshiki had brought cash to his office, but he said that he had told an aide to properly record the money as a political donation.He strongly denied the magazine\u2019s account that he had placed the envelope with the money in his pocket. \u201cPutting money in my suit pocket in front of a visitor,\u201d he said, \u201cwould be lacking dignity as a human being.\u201dMr. Amari said that he was resigning for the good of the country, and he noted that he had stayed on the job while battling tongue cancer.\u201cI was appointed as the commander of Abenomics by Prime Minister Abe, and I was in charge of steering the Japanese economy, and I have been working on national service by risking my life for the last three years,\u201d Mr. Amari said. \u201cWithout rest and sleep, I worked hard to break away from deflation, revive the economy and restore fiscal health, reform the social security and tax system, and move ahead on the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\u201dMr. Abe, who served a previous term as prime minister in 2006-7 before winning the job again in 2012, has seen his current tenure marred by several resignations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fran\u00e7ois Hollande Aims 2 Billion Euro Plan at France\u2019s Economic \u2018Emergency\u2019", "Date": "2016-01-18", "News": "Supported byCritics immediately seized on the measure as having more political than economic meaning. And they questioned whether the new steps, a package worth about $2.2 billion, would have any more measurable impact than previous stimulus plans Mr. Hollande has announced in his yearslong effort to revive France. Despite being the second-largest eurozone economy after Germany, it has struggled to bounce back from the slowdown that befell much of Europe after the global financial crisis of 2008.Mr. Hollande has vowed repeatedly not to run for a second presidential term unless there is a downturn in unemployment, which has risen to an 18-year high of 10.6 percent, from around 9.7 percent since he came to power in 2012.The economy recently began to emerge from three years of stagnation, but it has failed to create enough jobs to reduce the pool of 3.5 million people seeking work. Youth unemployment in France, at 25.7 percent, is among the highest in Europe, adding to social precariousness in the marginalized banlieues \u2014 suburban enclaves heavily populated by Muslim residents.Unemployment is above 40 percent in some banlieues, where young people face particularly high hurdles in finding permanent work.With little more than a year to campaign for France\u2019s presidential elections in 2017, the president is facing a growing challenge from rivals. Despite the fact that Mr. Hollande posted improved poll ratings for his handling of the terrorist attacks, Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Front, has gained ground against him by hammering the twin themes of nationalism and economic weakness.Ms. Le Pen posted a party statement on Twitter on Monday dismissing the plan as \u201cineffective\u201d and an election ploy, and warned that unemployment would not decline without a \u201creindustrialization of France.\u201dIn his remarks on Monday, Mr. Hollande acknowledged that the economy, now growing at an annual pace of a little more than 1 percent, remained too weak to reduce France\u2019s unemployment rate, which is more than twice Germany\u2019s rate of 4.5 percent.The French economy created only 40,000 private sector jobs last year, although many more jobs were destroyed during the downturn, France\u2019s labor minister, Myriam El Khomri, told French newspapers this month. \u201cThat means that although the economy is taking off again, growth is still too timid,\u201d she said.Business investment remains weak despite \u20ac40 billion in tax breaks approved by Mr. Hollande in 2014 in an effort to spur corporate profitability. Consumer spending, which has also failed to revive, took an extra hit after Islamic State militants killed 130 people in a coordinated terror spree in November.Mr. Hollande\u2019s newest measures, on top of similar initiatives unveiled in the last two years, aim to bolster employment.The blueprint provides a new layer of subsidies for small and midsize businesses \u2014 this time a bonus of \u20ac2,000 for companies that hire and retain a full-time employee for more than six months. Last summer, Mr. Hollande unveiled an aid plan of \u20ac4,000 for single-person businesses that hired their first worker on a yearlong contract.More controversial is a plan to put 500,000 unemployed people into vocational training programs this year, on top of 150,000 announced in October \u2014 an action that would, at least temporarily, remove more than half a million people from the unemployment rolls.The government also wants to reduce youth unemployment, in part by putting tens of thousands of young people to work in so-called civic service volunteer programs. In 2015, 60,000 young people were enrolled in civic service programs; this year, the government wants to more than double it to 150,000.Still, political rivals quickly questioned whether the incentives amounted to little more than putting a bandage on a gaping wound. Last week, for example, the manufacturing giant General Electric announced plans to cut up to 6,500 jobs globally, including 765 positions in France.Critics also attacked Mr. Hollande\u2019s plan as a naked grab to salvage his candidacy at a time when even some members of his Socialist party have suggested that he not automatically be their main candidate heading into next year\u2019s elections.\u201cPresident Hollande is starting the year with a lie to the French,\u201d \u00c9ric Woerth, a member of the conservative Republican party, which is led by former President Nicolas Sarkozy, said on Monday. \u201cEven if 500,000 people can get training, you need 500,000 jobs to hire them into,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise it\u2019s back to the unemployment line the day after\u201d the program ends.Mr. Hollande was already facing his party\u2019s opposition to more far-reaching, centrist economic proposals that he had announced in the last year. A so-called responsibility pact, in which the government granted tax breaks in exchange for job-creation pledges by businesses, was opposed by unions, which said the pact gave too many concessions to employers.Mr. Hollande has also sought to loosen restrictive labor practices, making it easier for companies to lay off employees in some cases and to cut workers\u2019 pay and hours when times are hard. So far, though, those measures have had a limited impact.On Monday, he gave reassurances that the latest measures were not a \u201cstatistic artifice\u201d aimed solely at lowering the numbers of unemployed people.\u201cWe can\u2019t correct statistics,\u201d he said. Employment, he added, is \u201cthe only issue that goes beyond the need to assure the security\u201d of France.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stock Market Ends Sharply Lower as Worries About Economy Surface", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byIt may be time for everyone to take the markets seriously again.As stock prices started tumbling in the first trading days of the year, many Wall Street professionals were tempted to describe the declines as the sort of adjustment that the market has gone through in recent years before moving higher.But that optimism evaporated this week as the selling intensified. Concerns are now growing that the markets are signaling that the United States economy, despite its recent bright spots, is on the verge of a slowdown.The fear is that economic problems in China have set off negative reactions around the world that could ultimately weigh on American households and corporations.On Friday, stocks in the United States touched their lowest levels since late August. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, the main benchmark for the United States market, is now down 8 percent for 2016 and nearly 12 percent below its benchmark high reached last year.In the face of the market turmoil, investors are showing signs that they are again seeking out safe-haven investments like government bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which falls as its price rises, declined to 2.05 percent from 2.09 percent on Thursday, after earlier falling below 2 percent for the first time since October.\u201cThere is just a broad reassessment of risk right now.\u201dA bear market occurs when stocks are down more than 20 percent from a high. The Russell 2,000, a measure of small-cap stocks, is actually down 23 percent from its peak. It fell 1.75 percent on Friday.On the one hand, it is important not to read too much into market moves. Markets often misinterpret what is really going on in the economy. The stock market came roaring back from sharp declines in 2011 and, more recently, from a rout last summer.Also, since the financial crisis of 2008, the United States economy has displayed the ability to power through rough patches in financial markets.Analysts note that the world\u2019s central banks can always increase their stimulus policies if the economies they watch over start to sag again.The global sell-off in stocks started in China, where the main Shanghai index dropped 3.6 percent on Friday. The index has fallen more than 20 percent from its December high. Stocks in London ended down 1.93 percent. Stocks in Frankfurt closed down 2.54 percent.The S.&P. 500 ended Friday down 41.51 points, or 2.16 percent. The much narrower Dow Jones industrial average fell 390.97 points, or 2.39 percent. The Nasdaq composite index declined 2.74 percent.Investors were quick to sell companies that appear most vulnerable to a drop in global growth.Shares of Intel, the giant chip maker, for instance, plummeted over 9 percent on Friday. When reporting earnings Thursday afternoon, Stacy J. Smith, Intel\u2019s chief financial officer, made comments about future sales that unsettled investors. \u201cThis outlook represents a soft start to the year as we remain cautious on the level of economic growth, particularly in China,\u201d Mr. Smith said.Investors also shunned shares of companies that had soared in 2015. Netflix, which fell 2.8 percent on Friday, is now down 20 percent from its high in 2015.The turbulence in the markets is causing pessimism over the economy to grow. And economists say they are taking seriously some of the signals they see in markets. Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, asserted that the markets that, in effect, predict interest rates and inflation appear to be doing a better job than, say, officials at the Fed.Such markets have in recent months been more pessimistic, predicting lower interest rates and inflation, both of which can act as an early warning of lower economic growth ahead.\u201cHere\u2019s where I believe the market has it right,\u201d Mr. Bernstein said.A month ago, investors in an interest rates futures market were predicting a nearly 90 percent chance that the Fed would increase interest rates in April, according to Bloomberg. Now that market is predicting only a 32 percent chance.The United States economy is expected to grow 2.5 percent this year, according to a poll by Reuters of over 90 economists. A year ago, they were forecasting growth of 2.8 percent.One school of pessimists asserts that the central banks\u2019 policies used to stimulate slowing economies since the crisis are losing effectiveness. Such policies stoked huge increases in debt that borrowers will now struggle to pay back, causing broader stress on large economies. This threat seems particularly large in China, which unleashed a credit binge after 2008, but the defaults in the United States energy industry are also a sign of how debt-fueled growth can backfire.A less gloomy camp contends that markets are just getting used to a world that is going to grow more slowly than in the past. Stock markets may struggle for a time, they say, but they are not going to crash and they are not signaling a severe global recession.A lukewarm economic outlook could be heard in the comments from the executives of United States banks that are reporting their fourth-quarter earnings.\u201cThere are pockets of strength,\u201d John Stumpf, the Wells Fargo chief executive, in a call with analysts. \u201cI am not going to say it is robust.\u201dThe bank\u2019s executives expect lower gas prices to bolster growth more broadly, as consumers and businesses enjoy smaller energy bills. Still, Mr. Stumpf added, consumers \u201chave not spent a lot of their gas savings.\u201dLikewise, Mr. Fink of BlackRock expressed concern that low energy prices here and abroad were not feeding through into the real economy.\u201cWe have just not seen the consumer consuming,\u201d he said. \u201cAt some point we will find a bottom in energy, and then things will stabilize.\u201dLower global economic activity can cause prices to fall in the United States, which can erode the profitability of American companies and make their shares less attractive to investors.Shares of Citigroup were down far more than those of other large United States banks on Friday, falling more than 6 percent.Investors are now on tenterhooks as they wait for data that might clarify the strength of the United States economy and the stance of central banks.\u201cThe market is acting as if China is already in recession and is dragging the U.S. into recession and there is nothing we can do about it,\u201d Mr. Orlando said, \u201cand there is nothing you can do to refute it until there are more data points.\u201dAn article on Saturday about the United States stock market\u2019s recent decline referred incorrectly to the Russell 2,000. It is an index of companies with small market capitalizations; it is not a broad measure of the stock market.Reporting was contributed by Landon Thomas Jr., Michael Corkery, Neil Gough and Stanley Reed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bank of Japan, in a Surprise, Adopts Negative Interest Rate", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byAs Japan\u2019s economic doldrums have lingered, its leaders have tried a number of tricks over the years, from increasing government spending to flooding the financial system with cash.With the global economy looking increasingly fragile, Japan is now taking a more aggressive step by cutting interest rates below zero on Friday.The policy \u2014 which means banks are essentially paying for the privilege of parking their money \u2014 represents a last resort for a country that has struggled through a quarter-century of weak growth. In theory, negative rates will push banks to lend more to companies, which would then spend and hire.The Bank of Japan is following other central banks in going negative on rates, a sign of the continuing global trouble from plummeting low oil prices, stalling international trade and slowing growth in China. Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is seeking new ways to break the country\u2019s cycle of decline.Mr. Abe has championed a system of temporary tax cuts and heavy government spending to spur growth and stoke inflation. But Japan, the world\u2019s third-largest economy, has moved in and out of recession under his administration, sowing doubts about his policies.The bank\u2019s policy makers, who voted 5-4 to approve the measure, took great pains to say the rate cut was based on global conditions, not the Japanese economy itself. The decision surprised financial markets, which moved higher in Asia trading.The Japanese central bank was also uncommonly blunt in mentioning the economy of another country, China, as one of the factors that could damage Japan\u2019s economy.\u201cWe saw risks from China\u2019s and other emerging countries\u2019 economies as well as the oil price decline,\u201d the central bank\u2019s governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, said in a news conference Friday evening. \u201cSince the beginning of the year, the financial market has been reflecting such an unstable situation.\u201d\u201cWhat is most important is that there is a growing possibility of its making negative impacts on Japanese enterprises and people\u2019s mind-set to get away from deflation,\u201d he added. \u201cFor those concerns, we will respond without any hesitation.\u201dMoving to negative rates reflects a measure of desperation on the part of central banks. Their traditional tools have been largely exhausted, as most countries\u2019 interest rates have been pushed to almost nothing.With weak prospects for economic growth in many countries, businesses are reluctant to borrow for practically any new projects. And if deflation becomes a problem, with prices falling for a wide range of goods, then repaying even a loan at an interest rate near zero could become difficult.Three other countries, Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland, already have negative interest rates. Deposits held by the European Central Bank have a negative rate: minus 0.3 percent.Japan\u2019s new negative interest rate, minus 0.1 percent, will take effect on Feb. 16. It will be assessed only on balances that commercial banks deposit at the central bank in excess of regulatory minimums.The move buoyed markets in the region on Friday. The Nikkei 225 index of shares in Tokyo ended the day with a gain of 2.8 percent. After months of losses, the Shanghai market rebounded by 3.1 percent.Despite the drastic move on Friday, the Bank of Japan could have gone even further, said Thomas Lam, the chief economist for industrialized countries at RHB Securities Singapore.The central bank could have opted to expand its already considerable purchases of bonds, in a bid to drive near-zero interest rates in debt markets even lower. Not going that route could indicate a hope on the part of some Japanese central bankers that Mr. Abe\u2019s government will also adopt fiscal measures to help the economy.\u201cThis should at least be nudging the Abe administration toward more aggressive measures and positive fiscal initiatives,\u201d Mr. Lam said.And in a global marketplace, Japan\u2019s decision could have ripple effects, further clouding the outlook for the world economy.The move to negative rates, for example, weakens the yen. That, in turn, creates a potential problem for China as Beijing struggles to contain outflows of money and prop up its own currency.The People\u2019s Bank of China, the country\u2019s central bank, said last month that it was shifting away from pegging the value of its currency, the renminbi, closely to the dollar. Instead, it preferred to link the renminbi to a basket of currencies, with the yen playing one of the largest roles after the dollar. If it ends up doing so, it could result in a weaker renminbi, as the yen falls.A parade of Chinese officials has reassured financial markets in recent days that Beijing will not tolerate any further depreciation of the currency. Beijing\u2019s leaders, in part, are trying to stem a wave of outflows; Chinese companies and individuals have been sending large sums of money out of the country, fearing a repeat of the 4 percent devaluation of the renminbi last August.But the pressure is swelling. By Friday evening, the yen was trading at 120.91 to the dollar, off 1.76 percent.Hisako Ueno contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

As we honor the extraordinary life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., it\u2019s important not only that we remember what he stood for, but that we pledge to continue his vision to transform our country. As we look out at our country today, what the American people understand is we have an economy that\u2019s rigged, that ordinary Americans are working longer hours for lower wages, 47 million people living in poverty, and almost all of the new income and wealth going to the top one percent.SANDERS: And then, to make a bad situation worse, we have a corrupt campaign finance system where millionaires and billionaires are spending extraordinary amounts of money to buy elections.This campaign is about a political revolution to not only elect the president, but to transform this country.HOLT: Senator, thank you.(APPLAUSE)And Governor O\u2019Malley, your opening statement, sir.O\u2019MALLEY: Thank you. My name is Martin O\u2019Malley, I was born the year Dr. King delivered his \u201cI Have A Dream\u201d speech.And I want to thank the people of South Carolina, not only for hosting our debate here tonight, but also for what you taught all of us in the aftermath of the tragic shooting at Mother Emanuel Church.You taught us, in fact, in keeping with Dr. King\u2019s teaching, that love would have the final word when you took down the Confederate flag from your state house; let go of the past and move forward.Eight years ago, you brought forward a new leader in Barack Obama to save our country from the second Great Depression. And that\u2019s what he\u2019s done. Our country\u2019s doing better, we\u2019re creating jobs again.But in order to make good on the promise of equal opportunity and equal justice under the law, and we have urgent work to do, and the voices of anger and fear and division that we\u2019ve heard coming off of the Republican presidential podiums are pretty loud.We need new leadership. We need to come together as a people and build on the good things that President Obama has done.That\u2019s why I\u2019m running for president. I need your help, I ask for your vote, and I look forward to moving our country forward once again.Thank you.HOLT: All right. And Governor, thank you.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: All right, to our first question, now. The first question, I\u2019ll be addressing to all of the candidates.President Obama came to office determined to swing for the fences on health care reform. Voters want to know how you would define your presidency? How would you think big? So complete this sentence: in my first 100 days in office, my top three priorities will be \u2014 fill in the blank.Senator Sanders.SANDERS: Well, that\u2019s what our campaign is about. It is thinking big. It is understanding that in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, we should have health care for every man, woman, and child as a right that we should raise the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour; that we have got to create millions of decent- paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure.So, what my first days are about is bringing America together, to end the decline of the middle class, to tell the wealthiest people in this country that yes, they are going to start paying their fair share of taxes, and that we are going to have a government that works for all of us, and not just big campaign contributors.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Secretary Clinton, same question, my first 100 days in office, my top three priorities will be.CLINTON: I would work quickly to present to the Congress my plans for creating more good jobs in manufacturing, infrastructure, clean and renewable energy, raising the minimum wage, and guaranteeing, finally, equal pay for women\u2019s work.I would also...(APPLAUSE)I would also be presenting my plans to build on the Affordable Care Act and to improve it by decreasing the out-of-pocket costs by putting a cap on prescription drug costs; by looking for ways that we can put the prescription drug business and the health insurance company business on a more stable platform that doesn\u2019t take too much money out of the pockets of hard-working Americans.And third, I would be working, in every way that I knew, to bring our country together. We do have too much division, too much mean- spiritedness. There\u2019s a lot we have to do on immigration reform, on voting rights, on campaign finance reform, but we need to do it together. That\u2019s how we\u2019ll have the kind of country for the 21st century that we know will guarantee our children and grandchildren the kind of future they deserve.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Governor O\u2019Malley, same question.O\u2019MALLEY: Thank you. First of all, I would lay out an agenda to make wages go up again for all Americans, rather than down. Equal pay for equal work, making it easier rather than harder for people to join labor unions and bargain collectively for better wages; getting 11 million of our neighbors out of the underground shadow economy by passing comprehensive immigration reform, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, however we can, wherever we can.Secondly, I believe the greatest business opportunity to come to the United States of America in 100 years is climate change. And I put forward a plan to move us to a 100 percent clean electric energy grid by 2050 and create 5 million jobs along the way.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Thank you. You\u2019ve all...O\u2019MALLEY: Finally \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, that was second, Lester.O\u2019MALLEY: And third and finally, we need a new agenda for America\u2019s cities. We have not had a new agenda for America\u2019s cities since Jimmy Carter. We need a new agenda for America cities that will invest in the talents and skills in our people, that will invest in CBVG transportation, infrastructure and transit options, and make our cities the leading edge in this move to a redesigned built clean green energy future that will employ our people.HOLT: All right governor thank you.We\u2019ve all laid out large visions and we\u2019re going to cover a lot of the ground you talked about as we continue in the evening. The last couple of weeks of this campaign have featured some of the sharpest exchanges in the race. Let\u2019s start with one of them, the issue of guns.Senator Sanders, last week Secretary Clinton called you quote, \u201ca pretty reliable vote for the gun lobby.\u201d Right before the debate you changed your position on immunity from lawsuits for gun manufacturers, can you tell us why?SANDERS: Well, I think Secretary Clinton knows that what she says is very disingenuous. I have a D-minus voting record from the NRA. I was in 1988, there were three candidates running for congress in the state of Vermont, I stood up to the gun lobby and came out and maintained the position that in this country we should not be selling military style assault weapons.I have supported from day one and instant background check to make certain that people who should have guns do not have guns. And that includes people of criminal backgrounds, people who are mentally unstable. I support what President Obama is doing in terms of trying to close the gun show loop holes and I think it should be a federal crime if people act as dormant (ph).We have seen in this city a horrendous tragedy of a crazed person praying with people in the coming up and shooting nine people. This should not be a political issue. What we should be doing is working together.And by the way, as a senator from a rural state that has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am in an excellent position to bring people together to fight the sensible...HOLT: Senator, but you didn\u2019t answer the question that you did change your position on immunity from gun manufacturers. So can you...SANDERS: What I have said, is that gun manufacturer\u2019s liability bill has some good provisions among other things, we\u2019ve prohibited ammunition that would\u2019ve killed cops who had protection on. We have child safety protection work on guns in that legislation. And what we also said, \u201cis a small mom and pop gun shop who sells a gun legally to somebody should not be held liable if somebody does something terrible with that gun.\u201dSo what I said is, \u201c I would re-look at it.\u201d We are going to re- look at it and I will support stronger provisions.HOLT: Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond to Senator Sanders.CLINTON: Yes look, I have made it clear based on Senator Sanders\u2019 own record that he has voted with the NRA, with the gun lobby numerous times. He voted against the Brady Bill five times. He voted for what we call, the Charleston Loophole. He voted for immunity from gunmakers and sellers which the NRA said, \u201cwas the most important piece of gun legislation in 20 years. \u201cHe voted to let guns go onto the Amtrak, guns go into National Parks. He voted against doing research to figure out how we can save lives. Let\u2019s not forget what this is about, 90 people a day die from gun violence in our country. That\u2019s 33,000 people a year.One of the most horrific examples not a block from here where we had nine people murdered. Now, I am pleased to hear that Senator Sanders has reversed his position on immunity and I look forward to him joining with those members of congress who have already introduced legislation. There is no other industry in America that was given the total pass that the gun makers and dealers were and that needs to be reversed.HOLT: All right, Governor O\u2019Malley, you signed tough gun control measures as governor of Maryland and there are a lot Democrats in the audience here in South Carolina who own guns. This conversation might be worrying many of them. They may be hearing, \u201cyou want to take my guns. What would you say to them?O\u2019MALLEY: This is what I would say Lester, look see, I\u2019ve listened to Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders go back and forth on which of them has the most inconsistent record on gun safety legislation and I would have to agree with both of them. They\u2019ve both been inconsistent when it comes to this issue.O\u2019MALLEY: I\u2019m the one candidate on this stage that actually brought people together to pass comprehensive gun safety legislation. This is very personal to me being from Baltimore. I will never forget one occasion visiting a little boy in Johns\u2019 Hopkins Hospital, he was getting a birthday haircut, the age of three when drug dealers turned that barbershop into a shooting gallery and that boy\u2019s head was pierced with a bullet. And I remember visiting him, it did not kill him - I remember visiting him and his mother in Johns Hopkins Hospital. He was getting a birthday haircut, the age of three when drug dealers turned that barbershop into a shooting gallery, and that boys head was pierced with a bullet.And, I remember visiting him, it did not kill him. I remember visiting him and his mother in Johns Hopkins Hospital. In his diapers (ph) with tubes running in and out of his head, same age as my little boy.So, after the slaughter of the kids in Connecticut last year, we brought people together. We did pass in our state comprehensive gun safety legislation. It did have a ban on combat assault weapons, universal background checks, and you know what? We did not interrupt a single person\u2019s hunting season.I\u2019ve never met a self respecting deer hunter that needed an AR-15 to down a deer. And, so...(APPLAUSE)... we\u2019re able to actually do these things.HOLT: Alright, Governor, thank you.Secretary Clinton, this is a community that has suffered a lot of heartache in the last year. Of course, as you mentioned, the church shootings. We won\u2019t forget the video of Walter Scott being shot in the back while running from police.We understand that a jury will decide whether that police officer was justified, but it plays straight to the fears of many African American men that their lives are cheap. Is that perception, or in your view, is it reality?CLINTON: Well, sadly it\u2019s reality, and it has been heartbreaking, and incredibly outraging to see the constant stories of young men like Walter Scott, as you said, who have been killed by police officers. Their needs to be a concerted effort to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.And, that requires a very clear, agenda for retraining police officers, looking at ways to end racial profiling, finding more ways to really bring the disparities that stalk our country into high relief.One out of three African American men may well end up going to prison. That\u2019s the statistic. I want people hear to think what we would be doing if it was one out of three white men, and very often, the black men are arrested, convicted and incarcerated ...(APPLAUSE)...for offensive that do not lead to the same results for white men.So, we have a very serious problem that we can no longer ignore.HOLT: You time is up.Senator Sanders, my next question is...SANDERS: ...Well, I \u2014 look...HOLT: ... It\u2019s actually \u2014 actually my next question is to you...SANDERS: ... Let me respond to what the secretary said. We have a criminal justice system which is broken. Who in America is satisfied that we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth, including China? Disproportionately African American, and Latino. Who is satisfied that 51% of African American young people are either unemployed, or underemployed? Who is satisfied that millions of people have police records for possessing marijuana when the CEO\u2019s of Wall Street companies who destroyed our economy have no police records.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Senator Sanders...SANDERS: ... We need to take a very hard look at our...HOLT: Senator. Senator Sanders...SANDERS: ... criminal justice system, investing in jobs, and education not in jails and incarceration .HOLT: ... Just over a week ago the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus endorsed Secretary Clinton, not you. He said that choosing her over you was not a hard decision. In fact, our polling shows she\u2019s beating you more than two to one among minority voters. How can you be the nominee if you don\u2019t have that support?SANDERS: Well, let me talk about polling.(LAUGHTER) SANDERS: As Secretary Clinton well knows, when this campaign began she was 50 points ahead of me. We were all of three percentage points. Guess what?In Iowa, New Hampshire, the race is very, very close. Maybe we\u2019re ahead New Hampshire.(CHEERING)SANDERS: In terms of polling, guess what? We are running ahead of Secretary Clinton. In terms of taking on my taking on my good friend, Donald Trump, beating him by 19 points in New Hampshire, 13 points in the last national poll that we saw.To answer your question. When the African American community becomes familiar with my Congressional record and with our agenda, and with our views on the economy, and criminal justice \u2014 just as the general population has become more supportive, so will the African American community, so will the Latino community. We have the momentum, we\u2019re on a path to a victory.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)O\u2019MALLEY: Lester, I (inaudible)HOLT: Governor, I\u2019m going to come to you in a second.Google searches for the words, \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d surpassed, \u201ccivil rights movement\u201d. And, here in South Carolina, \u201cblack lives matter\u201d was the number one trending political issue.HOLT: Governor O\u2019Malley, you\u2019ve campaigned on your record as governor of Maryland, and before that, the mayor of Baltimore. Last year, of course, Baltimore was rocked by violent unrest in the wake of the death of Freddie Gray.And right from the start of your campaign, you\u2019ve been dogged by those who blame your tough-on-crime, so-called zero tolerance policies as mayor for contributing to that unrest. What responsibility do you bear?O\u2019MALLEY: Yes, let\u2019s talk about this. When I ran for mayor in 1999, Lester, it was not because our city was doing well. It was because we were burying over 300 young, poor black men every single year.And that\u2019s why I ran, because, yes, black lives matter. And we did a number of things. We weren\u2019t able to make our city immune from setbacks as the Freddie Gray unrest and tragic death showed.But we were able to save a lot of lives doing things that actually worked to improve police and community relations. The truth of the matter is, we created a civilian review board. And many of these things are in the new agenda for criminal justice reform that I\u2019ve put forward.We created a civilian review board, gave them their own detectives. We required the reporting of discourtesy, use of excessive force, lethal force. I repealed the possession of marijuana as a crime in our state.I drove our incarceration rate down to 20-year lows, and drove violent crime down to 30-year lows, and became the first governor south of the Mason-Dixon line to repeal the death penalty.I feel a responsibility every day to find things that work...(APPLAUSE)HOLT: All right. Let\u2019s talk...O\u2019MALLEY: ... and to do more of them to reform our criminal justice system.HOLT: Let\u2019s talk more about policing and the criminal justice system. Senator Sanders, a few times tonight we\u2019re going to hear from some of the most prominent voices on YouTube, starting with Franchesca Ramsey, who tackles racial stereotypes through her videos. Let\u2019s watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FRANCHESCA RAMSEY: Hey, I\u2019m Franchesca Ramsey. I believe there\u2019s a huge conflict of interest when local prosecutors investigate cases of police violence within their own communities.For example, last month, the officers involved in the case of 12- year-old Tamir Rice weren\u2019t indicted. How would your presidency ensure that incidents of police violence are investigated and prosecuted fairly?(END VIDEO CLIP)HOLT: Senator Sanders.SANDERS: I apologize for not hearing all of that question.HOLT: Would you like me to read it back to you?SANDERS: Yes.HOLT: Prosecutors \u2014 \u201cI believe there\u2019s a huge conflict of interest when local prosecutors investigate cases of police violence within their communities. Most recently, we saw this with a non- indictment of the officers involved in the case of 12-year-old Tamir Rice. How would you presidency ensure incidents of police violence are investigated and prosecuted fairly?\u201dSANDERS: Absolutely. This is a responsibility for the U.S. Justice Department to get involved. Whenever anybody in this country is killed while in police custody, it should automatically trigger a U.S. attorney general\u2019s investigation.(APPLAUSE)Second of all, and I speak as a mayor who worked very closely and well with police officers, the vast majority of whom are honest, hard- working people trying to do a difficult job, but let us be clear.If a police officer breaks the law, like any public official, that officer must be held accountable.(APPLAUSE)And thirdly, we have got to de-militarize our police departments so they don\u2019t look like occupying armies. We\u2019ve got to move toward community policing.And fourthly, we have got to make our police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Secretary Clinton, this question is for you. Tonight parts of America are in the grip of a deadly heroin epidemic, spanning race and class, hitting small towns and cities alike. It has become a major issue in this race.In a lot of places where you\u2019ve been campaigning, despite an estimated trillion dollars spent, many say the war on drugs has failed. So what would you do?CLINTON: Well, Lester, you\u2019re right. Everywhere I go to campaign, I\u2019m meeting families who are affected by the drug problem that mostly is opioids and heroin now, and lives are being lost and children are being orphaned. And I\u2019ve met a lot of grandparents who are now taking care of grandchildren.So I have tried to come out with a comprehensive approach that, number one, does tell the states that we will work with you from the federal government putting more money, about a billion dollars a year, to help states have a different approach to dealing with this epidemic.The policing needs to change. Police officers must be equipped with the antidote to a heroin overdose or an opioid overdose, known as Narcan. They should be able to administer it. So should firefighters and others.We have to move away from treating the use of drugs as a crime and instead, move it to where it belongs, as a health issue. And we need to divert more people from the criminal justice system into drug courts, into treatment, and recovery.HOLT: And that\u2019s time. CLINTON: So this is the kind of approach that we should take in dealing with what is now...HOLT: Senator...CLINTON: ... a growing epidemic.HOLT: Senator Sanders, would you like to respond?SANDERS: Sure. I agree...(APPLAUSE)I agree with everything the Secretary said, but let me just add this, there is a responsibility on the part of the pharmaceutical industry and the drug companies who are producing all of these drugs and not looking at the consequence of it.And second of all, when we talk about addiction being a disease, the Secretary is right, what that means is we need a revolution in this country in terms of mental health treatment. People should be able to get the treatment that they need when they need it, not two months from now, which is why I believe in universal...HOLT: That\u2019s...SANDERS: ... healthcare with mental health...HOLT: ... time.SANDERS: ... a part of that.HOLT: We\u2019re going to get into all that coming up.O\u2019MALLEY (?): Lester, just ten seconds.HOLT: But we\u2019re going to take a break and we need to take a break...O\u2019MALLEY (?): Just 10 seconds. All of the things...HOLT: ... and when we come back, the anger brewing in America.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HOLT: Welcome back to Charleston. Let\u2019s turn to another area where there has been fierce disagreement \u2014 that would be health care.Senator Sanders and Secretary Clinton, you both mentioned it in your 100-day priorities.Let\u2019s turn to my colleague, Andrea Mitchell now to lead that questioning.MITCHELL: Thank you, Lester.Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders favors what he calls \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d Now, you said that what he is proposing would tear up Obamacare and replace it.Secretary Clinton, is it fair to say to say that Bernie Sanders wants to kill Obamacare?CLINTON: Well, Andrea, I am absolutely committed to universal health care. I have worked on this for a long time, people may remember that I took on the health insurance industry back in the \u201990s, and I didn\u2019t quit until we got the children\u2019s health insurance program that ensures eight million kids.And I certainly respect Senator Sanders\u2019 intentions, but when you\u2019re talking about health care, the details really matter. And therefore, we have been raising questions about the nine bills that he introduced over 20 years, as to how they would work and what would be the impact on people\u2019s health care?He didn\u2019t like that, his campaign didn\u2019t like it either. And tonight, he\u2019s come out with a new health care plan. And again, we need to get into the details. But here\u2019s what I believe, the Democratic Party and the United States worked since Harry Truman to get the Affordable Care Act passed.We finally have a path to universal health care. We have accomplished so much already. I do not to want see the Republicans repeal it, and I don\u2019t to want see us start over again with a contentious debate. I want us to defend and build on the Affordable Care Act and improve it.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: OK.MITCHELL: Senator Sanders?SANDERS: Secretary \u2014 Secretary Clinton didn\u2019t answer your question.(LAUGHTER)Because what her campaign was saying \u2014 Bernie Sanders, who has fought for universal health care for my entire life, he wants to end Medicare, end Medicaid, end the children\u2019s health insurance program. That is nonsense.What a Medicare-for-all program does is finally provide in this country health care for every man, woman and child as a right. Now, the truth is, that Frank Delano Roosevelt, Harry Truman, do you know what they believed in? They believed that health care should be available to all of our people.I\u2019m on the committee that wrote the Affordable Care Act. I made the Affordable Care Act along with Jim Clyburn a better piece of legislation. I voted for it, but right now, what we have to deal with is the fact that 29 million people still have no health insurance. We are paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, getting ripped off.And here\u2019s the important point, we are spending far more per person on health care than the people of any other country. My proposal, provide health care to all people, get private insurance out of health insurance, lower the cost of health care for middle class families by 5,000 bucks.That\u2019s the vision we need to take.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: But \u2014 Senator Sanders, if I can...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: You know, I have to say I\u2019m not sure whether we\u2019re talking about the plan you just introduced tonight, or we\u2019re talking about the plan you introduced nine times in the Congress. But the fact is, we have the Affordable Care Act. That is one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our country.(APPLAUSE)And we have already seen 19 million Americans get insurance. We have seen the end of pre-existing conditions keeping people from getting insurance.(APPLAUSE)We have seen women no longer paying more for our insurance than men. And we have seen young people, up to the age of 26, being able to stay on their parent\u2019s policy.SANDERS: But \u2014 what if we have...CLINTON: Now, there are things we can do to improve it, but to tear it up and start over again, pushing our country back into that kind of a contentious debate, I think is the wrong direction.SANDERS: It is \u2014 it is absolutely inaccurate.O\u2019MALLEY: I have to talk about something that\u2019s actually working in our state.MITCHELL: Governor \u2014 Governor Sanders...SANDERS: No one is tearing this up, we\u2019re going to go forward. But with the secretary neglected to mention, not just the 29 million still have no health insurance, that even more are underinsured with huge copayments and deductibles.Tell me why we are spending almost three times more than the British, who guarantee health care to all of their people? Fifty percent more than the French, more than the Canadians. The vision from FDR and Harry Truman was health care for all people as a right in a cost-effective way.We\u2019re not going to tear up the Affordable Care Act. I helped write it. But we are going to move on top of that to a Medicaid-for- all system.O\u2019MALLEY: Andrea \u2014 Andrea \u2014 Andrea.(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)O\u2019MALLEY: Instead of \u2014 Andrea, I think, instead of attacking one another on health care, we should be talking about the things that are actually working.In our state, we have moved to an all-payer system. With the Affordable Care Act, we now have moved all of our acute care hospitals, that driver of cost at the center, away from fee-for- service.And actually to pay, we pay them based on how well they keep patients out of the hospital. How well they keep their patients. That\u2019s the future. We need to build on the Affordable Care Act, do the things that work, and reduce costs and increase access.(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: And that\u2019s exactly what we are able to do based on the foundation of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 what Governor O\u2019Malley just said is one of the models that we will be looking at to make sure we do get costs down, we do limit a lot of the unnecessary costs that we still have in the system.But, with all due respect, to start over again with a whole new debate is something that I think would set us back. The Republicans just voted last week to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and thank goodness, President Obama vetoed it and saved Obamacare for the American people.(APPLAUSE)MITCHELL: Senator Sanders, let me ask you this, though...SANDERS: Yeah.MITCHELL: ... you\u2019ve talked about Medicare for all...SANDERS: Yes.MITCHELL: .. and tonight you\u2019ve released a very detailed plan, just two... SANDERS: Not all that detailed.MITCHELL: ... well, two hours before the debate, you did.SANDERS: Well.MITCHELL: But let me ask you about Vermont. Because in Vermont \u2014 you tried in the state of Vermont, and Vermont walked away from this kind of idea, of \u2014 of Medicare for all, single-payer, because they concluded it would require major tax increases...SANDERS: Well, that\u2019s \u2014 you might want to ask...MITCHELL: ... and by some estimates, it would double the budget. If you couldn\u2019t sell it in Vermont, Senator...SANDERS: Andrea, let me just say this.MITCHELL: ... how can you sell it to the country?SANDERS: Let me just say that you might want to ask the governor of the state of Vermont why he could not do it. I\u2019m not the governor. I\u2019m the senator from the state of Vermont.(LAUGHTER)But second of all \u2014 second of all...(APPLAUSE)... here is what the real point is, in terms of all of the issues you\u2019ve raised \u2014 the good questions you\u2019ve raised. You know what it all comes down to?Do you know why we can\u2019t do what every other country \u2014 major country on Earth is doing? It\u2019s because we have a campaign finance system that is corrupt, we have super PACs, we have the pharmaceutical industry pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into campaign contributions and lobbying, and the private insurance companies as well.What this is really about is not the rational way to go forward \u2014 it\u2019s Medicare for all \u2014 it is whether we have the guts to stand up to the private insurance companies and all of their money, and the pharmaceutical industry. That\u2019s what this debate should be about.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Well, as someone who \u2014 as someone who has a little bit of experience standing up to the health insurance industry, that spent, you know...(APPLAUSE)... many, many millions of dollars attacking me, and probably will so again, because of what I believe we can do building on the Affordable Care Act, I think it\u2019s important to point out that there are a lot of reasons we have the health care system we have today.I know how much money influences the political decision-making. That\u2019s why I\u2019m for huge campaign finance reform. However, we started a system that had private health insurance.And even during the Affordable Care Act debate, there was an opportunity to vote for what was called the public option. In other words, people could buy in to Medicare, and even when the Democrats were in charge of the Congress, we couldn\u2019t get the votes for that.So, what I\u2019m saying is really simple. This has been the fight of the Democratic Party for decades. We have the Affordable Care Act. Let\u2019s make it work.Let\u2019s take the models that states are doing. We now have driven costs down to the lowest they\u2019ve been in 50 years. Now we\u2019ve got to get individual costs down. That\u2019s what I\u2019m planning to do.HOLT: And that\u2019s time (ph). We\u2019re gonna take a turn now.Secretary Clinton, in his final State of the Union address, President Obama said his biggest regret was his inability to bring the country together. If President Obama couldn\u2019t do it, how will you?O\u2019MALLEY: Great question.CLINTON: Well, I think it\u2019s an important point the president made in his State of the Union. And here\u2019s what I would say. I will go anywhere, to meet with anyone, at any time to find common ground.That\u2019s what I did as a first lady, when I worked with both Democrats and Republicans to get the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, when I worked with Tom DeLay, one of the most partisan of Republicans, to reform the adoption and foster care system.What I did, working in the Senate, where I crossed the aisle often, working even with the senator from South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, to get Tricare for national guardsmen and women.And it\u2019s what I did as Secretary of State, on numerous occasions, and most particularly, rounding up two-thirds votes in order to pass a treaty that lowered the nuclear weapons in both Russia and the United States. CLINTON: So I know it\u2019s hard, but I also know you\u2019ve got to work at it every single day. I look out here, I see a lot of my friends from the Congress. And I know that they work at it every single day.Because maybe you can\u2019t only find a little sliver of common ground to cooperate with somebody from the other party, but who knows. If you\u2019re successful there, maybe you can build even more. That\u2019s what I would do.HOLT: That\u2019s time. Senator Sanders, response.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: A couple of years ago, when we understood that veterans were not getting the quality care they needed in the timely manner, I worked with folks like John McCain and others to pass the most comprehensive veteran\u2019s health care legislation in modern history.But let me rephrase your question because I think, in all do respect, you\u2019re expression. In all do respect, you\u2019re missing the main point. And the main point in the Congress, it\u2019s not the Republicans and Democrats hate each other.That\u2019s a mythology from the media. The real issue is that Congress is owned by big money and refuses to do what the American people want them to do.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: The real issue is that in area after area, raising the minimum wage to $15 bucks an hour. The American people want it. Rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, creating 13 million jobs, the American people want it. The pay equity for women, the American people want it. Demanding that the wealthy start paying their fair share of taxes. The American people want it.HOLT: That\u2019s time. But let me continue with the...SANDERS: The point is, we have to make Congress respond to the needs of the people, not big money.HOLT: Senator Sanders, let me continue, you call yourself a Democratic socialist...SANDERS: I do. HOLT: And throughout your career in politics, you\u2019ve been critical of the Democratic party, you\u2019ve been saying in a book you wrote, quote, \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a hell of a big difference between the the two major parties.\u201d How would you will a general election...SANDERS: Did I say that?HOLT: How will you win a general election labeling yourself a democratic socialist?SANDERS: Because of what I believe in what I was just saying. The Democratic party needs major reform. To those of you in South Carolina, you know what, in Mississippi, we need a 50-state strategy so that people in South Carolina and Mississippi can get the resources that they need.Instead of being dependent on super PACs, what we need is to be dependent on small, individual campaign contributors. We need an agenda that speaks to the needs of working families and low-income people. Not wealthy campaign contributors.HOLT: Yes, but senator, you can...SANDERS: We need to expand what the input into the Democratic party. I am very proud that in this campaign, we have seen an enormous amount of excitement from young people, from working people. We have received more individual contributions than any candidate in the history of this country up to this point.(APPLAUSE)O\u2019MALLEY: Yes, but senator you never came to campaign for Vincent Sheheen when he was running for governor. In fact, neither of you came to campaign for Vincent Sheheen when he was running for governor.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: We can talk all we want about wanting to build a stronger Democratic party, but Lester, the question you answered, it\u2019s no laughing matter.The most recurring question I get when I stand on the chair all across Iowa and talk with my neighbors is, how are you going to heal the divisions and the wounds in our country? This is the biggest challenge we face as a people.All my life, I brought people together over deep divides and very old wounds, and that\u2019s what we need now in a new leader. We cannot keep talking past each other, declaring all Republicans are our enemies or the war is all about being against millionaires or billionaires, or it\u2019s all against American Muslims, all against immigrants.Look, as Frederick Douglas said, we are one, our cause is one, and we must help each other if we are going to succeed. HOLT: And that is right.SANDERS: And I respectfully disagree.HOLT: Secretary Clinton, our next question is for you. Here\u2019s another quantitative problem.The New York Times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign.SANDERS: And I respectfully disagree with my friend over here. And that is, you are right. All of us have denounced Trump\u2019s attempts to divide this country: the anti-Latino rhetoric, the racist rhetoric, he anti-Muslim rhetoric.But where I disagree with you, Governor O\u2019Malley, is I do believe we have to deal with the fundamental issues of a handful of billionaires...O\u2019MALLEY: I agree with that.SANDERS: ... who control economic and political life of this country.O\u2019MALLEY: I agree.SANDERS: Nothing real will get happened. Unless we have a political revolution. Where millions of people finally stand up.HOLT: And we\u2019re going to get into that coming up. But Secretary Clinton, here\u2019s a question from YouTube. It\u2019s from a young video blogger who has over 5 million subscribers. He has a question about the importance of younger voters.FRANTA: Hi, I\u2019m Connor Franta, I\u2019m 23 and my audience is around the same age. Getting my generation to vote should be a priority for any presidential candidate.Now I know Senator Sanders is pretty popular among my peers, but what I want to know is, how are all of you planning on engaging us further in this election?HOLT: Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Well thanks for the question and congratulations on five million viewers on YouTube, that\u2019s quite an accomplishment. Look, this election is mostly about the future and therefore it is of greatest urgency for young people.I\u2019ve laid out my ideas about what we can do to make college affordable; how we can help people pay off their student debts and save thousands of dollars, how we can create more good jobs because a lot of the young people that I talk with are pretty disappointed the economic prospects they feel their facing. So making community college free, making it possible to attend a public college or university with debt free tuition, looking for ways to protect our rights especially from the concerted Republican assault; on voting rights, on women\u2019s rights, on gay rights, on civil rights, on workers rights.And I know how much young people value their independence, their autonomy, and their rights. So I think this is an election where we have to pull young people and older people together to have a strategy about how we\u2019re going to encourage even more American\u2019s to vote because it absolutely clear to me...HOLT: That\u2019s time...CLINTON: That turning over our White House to the Republicans would be bad for everybody especially young people.HOLT: A quick follow up \u2014 a thirty second follow up.Why is Senator Sanders beating you to 2 to 1 among younger votes?CLINTON: Look, I have the greatest respect for Senator Sanders and for his supports and I\u2019m going to keep working as hard as I can to reach as many people of all ages about what I will do, what the experience and the ideas that I have that I will bring to the White House and I hope to have their support when I\u2019m the Democratic nominee.HOLT: We\u2019re going to take...SANDERS: Is that your strategy...HOLT: We\u2019re going to take a break. When we come back; big banks, big business and big differences among the three candidates on the American Economy. We\u2019ll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HOLT: Welcome back from Charleston. Let\u2019s turn now to the economy.Senator Sanders, you released a tough new ad last week in which without mentioning Secretary Clinton by name, you talk about two Democratic visions for regulating Wall Street. \u201cOne says it\u2019s OK to take millions from big banks and tell them what to do. My plan, break up the big banks, close the tax loopholes and make them pay their fair share.\u201dWhat do you see as the difference between what you would do about the banks and what Secretary Clinton would do?SANDERS: Well, the first difference is I don\u2019t take money from big banks. I don\u2019t get personal speaking fees from Goldman Sachs. What I would do...(APPLAUSE)What I would do is understand that when you have three out of the four largest banks today, bigger than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have the six largest financial institutions having assets of 60 percent of the GDP of America, it is very clear to me what you have to do.You\u2019ve got to bring back the 21st century Glass-Steagall legislation and you\u2019ve got to break up these huge financial institutions. They have too much economic power and they have too much financial power over our entire economy. If Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, the old Republican trust buster, what he would say is these guys are too powerful. Break them up. I believe that\u2019s what the American people to want see. That\u2019s my view.HOLT: Secretary Clinton, help the voter understand the daylight between the two of you here.CLINTON: Well, there\u2019s no daylight on the basic premise that there should be no bank too big to fail and no individual too powerful to jail. We agree on that. But where we disagree is the comments that Senator Sanders has made that don\u2019t just affect me, I can take that, but he\u2019s criticized President Obama for taking donations from Wall Street, and President Obama has led our country out of the great recession. Senator Sanders called him weak, disappointing. He even, in 2011, publicly sought someone to run in a primary against President Obama. Now, I personally believe that President Obama\u2019s work to push through the Dodd-Frank...(LAUGHTER)The Dodd-Frank bill and then to sign it was one of the most important regulatory schemes we\u2019ve had since the 1930s. So I\u2019m going to defend Dodd-Frank and I\u2019m going to defend President Obama for taking on Wall Street, taking on the financial industry and getting results.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: OK. First of all...HOLT: Senator Sanders, your response.SANDERS: Set the record right. In 2006 when I ran for the Senate, Senator Barack Obama was kind enough to campaign for me, 2008, I did my best to see that he was elected and in 2012, I worked as hard as I could to see that he was reelected. He and I are friends. We\u2019ve worked together on many issues. We have some differences of opinion.But here is the issue, Secretary touched on it, can you really reform Wall Street when they are spending millions and millions of dollars on campaign contributions and when they are providing speaker fees to individuals? So it\u2019s easy to say, well, I\u2019m going to do this and do that, but I have doubts when people receive huge amounts of money from Wall Street. SANDERS: I am very proud, I do not have a super PAC. I do not want Wall Street\u2019s money. I\u2019ll rely on the middle class and working families...HOLT: That\u2019s time.Governor O\u2019Malley...(CROSSTALK)SANDERS: ... campaign contributions.HOLT: I have a question for you...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: You know, I think since \u2014 since Senator Standers followed up on this...HOLT: Thirty-second response.CLINTON: Your profusion of comments about your feelings towards President Obama are a little strange given what you said about him in 2011.But look, I have a plan that most commentators have said is tougher, more effective, and more comprehensive.O\u2019MALLEY: That\u2019s not true.CLINTON: It builds on the Dodd-Frank \u2014 yes, it is. It builds on the Dodd-Frank, regulatory scheme...O\u2019MALLEY: It\u2019s just not true.CLINTON: ... but it goes much further, because...O\u2019MALLEY: Oh, come on.CLINTON: ... both the governor and the senator have focused only on the big banks. Lehman Brothers, AIG, the shadow banking sector were as big a problem in what caused the Great Recession, I go after them.And I can tell you that the hedge fund billionaires who are running ads against me right now, and Karl Rove, who started running an ad against me right now, funded by money from the financial services sector, sure thing, I\u2019m the one they don\u2019t want to be up against.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Governor O\u2019Malley.O\u2019MALLEY: Yes, thank you. Yes, Lester, what Secretary Clinton just said is actually not true. What \u2014 I have put forward a plan that would actually put cops back on the beat of Wall Street. I have put forward a plan that was heralded as very comprehensive and realistic.Look, if a bank robber robs a bank and all you do is slap him on the wrist, he\u2019s just going to keep robbing banks again. The same thing is true with people in suits.Secretary Clinton, I have a tremendous amount of respect for you, but for you to say there\u2019s no daylight on this between the three of us is also not true. I support reinstituting a modern version of Glass- Steagall that would include going after the shadow banks, requiring capital requirements that would force them to no longer put us on the hook for these sorts of things.In prior debates I\u2019ve heard you even bring up \u2014 I mean, now you bring up President Obama here in South Carolina in defense of the fact of your cozy relationship with Wall Street.In an earlier debate, I heard you bring up even the 9/11 victims to defend it. The truth of the matter is, Secretary Clinton, you do not go as far as reining in Wall Street as I would.And the fact of the matter is, the people of America deserve to have a president that\u2019s on their side, protecting the main street economy from excesses on Wall Street. And we\u2019re just as vulnerable today.HOLT: Secretary Clinton, 30-second response.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Yes, well, first of all \u2014 first of all, Paul Krugman, Barney Frank, others have all endorsed my plan. Secondly, we have Dodd-Frank. It gives us the authority already to break up big banks that pose...O\u2019MALLEY: And we have never used it.CLINTON: That pose a risk to the financial sector. I want to go further and add to that.And, you know, Governor, you have raised money on Wall Street. You raised a lot of money on Wall Street when you were the head of the Democratic Governor\u2019s Association...O\u2019MALLEY: Yes, but I haven\u2019t gotten a penny this year... CLINTON: And you were...O\u2019MALLEY: ... so somebody please, go on to martinomalley.com...(LAUGHTER)O\u2019MALLEY: Go on to martinomalley.com, send me your checks. They\u2019re not giving me \u2014 zero.CLINTON: Yes, well, the point is that if we\u2019re going to be serious about this and not just try to score political points, we should know what\u2019s in Dodd-Frank, and what\u2019s in Dodd-Frank already gives the president the authority...(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: ... with his regulators to make those decisions.SANDERS: Let me give you an example of how corrupt \u2014 how corrupt this system is. Goldman Sachs recently fined $5 billion. Goldman Sachs has given this country two secretaries of treasury, one on the Republicans, one under Democrats.O\u2019MALLEY: Say it.SANDERS: The leader of Goldman Sachs is a billionaire who comes to Congress and tells us we should cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.Secretary Clinton \u2014 and you\u2019re not the only one, so I don\u2019t mean to just point the finger at you, you\u2019ve received over $600,000 in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs in one year.I find it very strange that a major financial institution that pays $5 billion in fines for breaking the law, not one of their executives is prosecuted, while kids who smoke marijuana get a jail sentence.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: That\u2019s time.Andrea.CLINTON: Well, the last point on this is, Senator Sanders, you\u2019re the only one on this stage that voted to deregulate the financial market in 2000, to take the cops off the street, to use Governor O\u2019Malley\u2019s phrase, to make the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission no longer able to regulate swaps and derivatives, which were one of the main cause of the collapse in \u201908.So there\u2019s plenty...SANDERS: If you want to...CLINTON: There\u2019s plenty of problems that we all have to face together.And the final thing I would say, we\u2019re at least having a vigorous debate about reining in Wall Street...HOLT: ... Senator...CLINTON: ... The Republicans want to give them more power, and repeal Dodd-Frank. That\u2019s what we need to stop...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Anyone who wants to check my record in taking on Wall Street, in fighting against the deregulation of Wall Street when Wall Street put billions of dollars in lobbying, in campaign contributions to get the government off their backs. They got the government off their backs.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.Turns out that they were crooks, and they destroyed our economy. I think it\u2019s time to put the government back on their backs.(APPLAUSE)MITCHELL: Senator Sanders \u2014 Senator Sanders, you\u2019ve talked a lot about things you want to do. You want free education for everyone, you want the Federal Minimum Wage raised to $15 an hour. You want to expand Social Security...SANDERS: ... Yeah...MITCHELL: ... benefits. You\u2019ve been specific about what you want, but let\u2019s talk about how to pay for all this. You now said that you would raise taxes today, two hours or so ago, you said you would raise taxes to pay for your health care plan. You haven\u2019t been specific about how to pay for the other things...SANDERS: ... That\u2019s true.MITCHELL: ... Will you tell us tonight?SANDERS: Good. You\u2019re right. I want to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, create 13 million jobs. We do that by doing away with the absurd loophole that now allows major profitable corporations to stash their money in the Cayman (ph) Islands, and not in some years, pay a nickel in taxes. Yes, I do. I plead guilty. I want every kid in this country who has the ability to be able to go to a public college, or university, tuition free. And, by the way, I want to substantially lower student debt interest rates in this country as well.How do I pay for it?(APPLAUSE)I pay for it through a tax on Wall Street speculation. This country, and the middle class, bailed out Wall Street. Now, it is Wall Street\u2019s time to help the middle class. In fact...O\u2019MALLEY: (inaudible)SANDERS: ... we have documented, unlike Secretary Clinton, I have documented exactly how I would pay for our ambitious agenda.O\u2019MALLEY: Andrea...MITCHELL: ... OK...O\u2019MALLEY: ... The only person on this stage who has...MITCHELL: ... Secretary Clinton, you mentioned earlier \u2014 Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?CLINTON: Well, I have actually documented every way that I\u2019m going to pay for what I\u2019m doing because I think the American public deserves to know. And, you can go to my website and actually see that.But, there are serious questions about how we\u2019re going to pay for what we want to see our country do. And, I\u2019m the only candidate standing here tonight who has said I will not raise taxes on the middle class. I want to raise incomes, not taxes, and I\u2019m going to do everything I can to make sure that the wealthy pay for debt free tuition, for child care, for paid family leave. To help us bring down student debt we\u2019re going to refinance that student debt, saving kids thousands of dollars.Yeah, and that will also come out of the \u2014 some of the pockets of people in the financial services industry...MITCHELL: OK, we\u2019re out of time. Senator Sanders,CLINTON: But I will tell you exactly how I pay for everything I\u2019ve proposed...(CROSSTALK)MITCHELL: Senator Sanders...SANDERS: ... Here is the main two points...MITCHELL: ... Senator Sanders, let me ask you a question about taxes. SANDERS: Yeah.MITCHELL: The most googled political issue...SANDERS: ... I got it.MITCHELL: In the last month was taxes. Now, in your healthcare plan, the plan you released tonight, you would not only raise taxes on the wealthy, but the details you released indicate you would raise taxes on the middle class also. Is that correct?SANDERS: What is correct, and I\u2019m disappointed that Secretary Clinton\u2019s campaign has made this criticism. It\u2019s a Republican criticism. Secretary Clinton does know a lot about healthcare, and she understands, I believe, that a medicare for all, single payer program will substantially lower the cost of healthcare for middle class families. So, what we have got to acknowledge, and I hope the Secretary does, is we are doing away with private health insurance premiums.So, instead of paying $10,000 dollars to Blue Cross, or Blue Shield, yes, some middle class families would be paying slightly more in taxes, but the result would be that that middle class family would be saving some $5,000 dollars in healthcare costs. A little bit more in taxes, do away with private health insurance premiums. It\u2019s a pretty good deal.(APPLAUSE)MITCHELL: Senator \u2014 Senator, let me just follow up on that.SANDERS: Yeah.MITCHELL: On Meet the Press on December 20th, you said that you would only raise taxes on the middle class to pay for family leave. And, having said that, now you say you\u2019re going to raise middle class taxes to pay for healthcare as well. Is that breaking your word?SANDERS: No, it is not breaking my word. When you are \u2014 it\u2019s one thing to say I\u2019m raising taxes, it\u2019s another thing to say that we are doing away with private health insurance premiums.SANDERS: So, if I save you $10,000 in private health insurance, and you pay a little bit more in taxes in total, there are huge savings in what your family is spending.O\u2019MALLEY: Senator, I\u2019m the only person on this stage that\u2019s actually balanced a budget every year for 15 years.SANDERS: I was mayor for eight years, I did that as well.(LAUGHTER)O\u2019MALLEY: OK. So, that was eight years. Yes. And Senator, but I actually did it during a budget down time \u2014 I mean, during a recession.And Andrea, the \u2014 I had to make more cuts than any governor in the history of Maryland, but we invested more in infrastructure, more in transportation. We made our public schools more in America more than five years in a row, and went four years in a row without a penny\u2019s increase to college tuition.The things that we need to do in our country, like debt-free college in the next five years, like making universal \u2014 like making national service a universal option in order to cut youth unemployment in half in the next three years, all these things can be done if we eliminate one entitlement we can no longer afford as a nation.And that is the wealthy among us, those making more than a million dollars, feel that they are entitled to paying a much lower marginal tax rate than was usual for the better part of these 80 years.And if we tax earnings from investments on money \u2014 namely capital gains \u2014 at the same rate as we tax sweat and hard work and toil, we can make the investments we need to make to make our country better.HOLT: We have got a lot to ground to cover here.Many Democratic voters are passionate about the need to do something to combat the threat of climate change, including the team of scientists from Youtube\u2019s MinuteEarth channel.Here\u2019s their take.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANNOUNCER: Hello from MinuteEarth. Fossil fuels have long kept our cars moving and our light bulbs lit.But we know that burning these fuels releases heat-trapping gases that are warming the planet, causing seas to rise and contributing to extreme weather events, like South Carolina\u2019s devastating flooding last year.Fighting human-caused climate change means giving up our global addiction to fossil fuels and shifting the bulk of the world\u2019s energy supply to alternative sources.Some countries have acted decisively to make this transition. But here at home, we still get a whooping 82 percent of our energy from coal, oil, and natural gas.In the U.S., political gridlock, pressure from industry lobbyists and insufficient R&D have made an already tough battle against climate change even tougher.(END VIDEO CLIP)HOLT: Senator Sanders, Americans love their SUVs, which spiked in sales last year as gas prices plummeted.How do you convince Americans that the problem of climate change is so urgent that they need to change their behavior?SANDERS: I think we already are. Younger generation understands it instinctively.I was home in Burlington, Vermont, on Christmas Eve, the temperature was 65 degrees. People in Vermont know what\u2019s going on. People who did ice fishing, where their ice is no longer there on the lake understand what\u2019s going on.I\u2019m on both the Environmental and Energy Committees. The debate is over. Climate change is real. It is already causing major problems. And if we do not act boldly and decisively, a bad situation will become worse.It is amazing to me, and I think we\u2019ll have agreement on this up here, that we have a major party, called the Republican Party that is so owned by the fossil fuel industry and their campaign contributions that they don\u2019t even have the courage, the decency to listen to the scientists.(APPLAUSE)It is beyond my comprehension how we can elect a president of the United States, somebody like Trump, who believes that climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese.(LAUGHTER)Bottom line is, we need to be bold and decisive, we can create millions of jobs. We must, for the sake of our kids and grandchildren, transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.I\u2019ve got the most comprehensive legislation in the Senate to do that. And as president, I will fight to make that happen.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Governor O\u2019Malley, 30 seconds.O\u2019MALLEY: Thank you.Lester, on this stage tonight, this Democratic stage, where we actually believe in science.(LAUGHTER)I would like to challenge and invite my colleagues here on this stage to join me in putting forward a plan to move us to a 100 percent clean, electric energy grid by 2050. It can be done.(APPLAUSE)With solar, with wind, with new technologies, with green buildings, this can happen, but in all \u2014 President Obama made us more energy independent, but in all of the above strategy didn\u2019t land us on the moon, we need American ingenuity and we need to reach by 2050 for the sake of our kids.HOLT: That\u2019s time. We\u2019re going to take a break.CLINTON: And let me...HOLT: When we return, the late-breaking developments regarding Iran. The threat of ISIS now more real than ever on U.S. soil. Americans in fear and hearing few good answers.We\u2019ll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)TODD: And we are back. I\u2019m Chuck Todd. We are just past the halfway mark in our NBC News YouTube Democratic Candidates Debate. Boy, this is one that has actually lived up to the billing.We\u2019ve seen some sharp exchanges on guns, health care and Wall Street \u2014 the debate, you could argue, that has been largely focused on all things Bernie Sanders.He was on the defensive early, Hillary Clinton getting, I think, some control on the gun issue. But on health care and on Wall Street reform, it was Hillary Clinton on the defensive, and was a very aggressive Bernie Sanders.One thing of note here: Bernie Sanders very much being the sort of revolutionary candidate, major change, and you\u2019ve heard a lot of Hillary Clinton saying things like she wants to build on the things that President Obama did, wrapping herself in President Obama.Let\u2019s go back downstairs and check in with our moderators, Lester and Andrea. So what\u2019s coming up next, guys?HOLT: Well, we\u2019ve covered a lot of ground already, but we\u2019re gonna be talking about ISIS. A threat to America, it\u2019s \u2014 always polls as one of the top concerns of Americans. And also some more late-breaking news.MITCHELL: We have all the news that has happened from Iran and the president\u2019s comments today, as well as what this means going forward for the War on Terror. What do we expect from Iran, and also what\u2019s happening in Syria? So a lot of foreign policy coming up.HOLT: A lot of debate to come. We\u2019ll be back in Charleston after this.TODD: You\u2019ve got it. Well, it\u2019s the commander-in-chief test \u2014 that\u2019s what\u2019s next. Stay with us \u2014 the debate resumes right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HOLT: Charleston, Andrea Mitchell has questions now starting with Iran.MITCHELL: Thank you Lester.Senator Sanders, the nuclear deal is now enforced. Iran is getting it\u2019s billions of dollars, several Americans who have been held are now going to be heading home. The president said today, \u201cit\u2019s a good day. It\u2019s a good day for diplomacy. It\u2019s a time now to restore diplomatic relations for the first time since 1979 and actually re- opened a U.S. Embassy in Tehran.\u201dSANDERS: I think what we\u2019ve got to do is move as aggressively as we can to normalize relations with Iran. Understanding that Iran\u2019s behavior in so many ways is something that we disagree with; their support terrorism, the anti-American rhetoric that we\u2019re hearing from of their leadership is something that is not acceptable.History suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.On the other hand, the fact that we\u2019ve managed to reach an agreement, something that I\u2019ve very strongly supported that prevents Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and we did that without going to war. And that I believe we\u2019re seeing a fall in our relationships with Iran is a very positive step. So if your question is, do I want to see that relationship become more positive in the future? Yes.Can I tell that we should open an embassy in Tehran tomorrow? No, I don\u2019t think we should. But I think the goal has go to be as we\u2019ve done with Cuba, to move in warm relations with a very powerful and important country in this world.MITCHELL: Your response Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, I\u2019m very proud of the Iran Nuclear Agreement. I was very pleased to be part of what the president put into action when he took office. I was responsible for getting those sanctions imposed which put the pressure on Iran. It brought them to the negotiating table which resulted in this agreement.And so, they have been so far, following their requirements under the agreement. But I think we still have to carefully watch them. We\u2019ve had one good day over 36 year and I think we need more good days before we move more rapidly toward any kind of normalization. And we have to be sure that they are truly going to implement the agreement. And then, we have to go after them on a lot of their other bad behavior in the region which is causing enormous problems in Syria, Yemen, Iraq and elsewhere.MITCHELL: You mentioned Syria. Let me ask you about Syria, all of you. Let\u2019s turn to Syria and the civil war that has been raging there. Are there any circumstances in which you could see deploying significant numbers of ground forces in Syria, not just specials forces but significant ground forces to combat ISIS in a direct combat role?Let me start with you Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Absolutely not.I have a three point plan that does not include American Ground forces. It includes the United States leading an air coalition which is what we\u2019re doing, supporting fighters on the ground; the Iraqi Army which is beginning to show more ability, the Sunni fighters that we are now helping to reconstitute and Kurdish on both sides of the border.I think we also have try to disrupt their supply chain of foreign fighters and foreign money and we do have to contest them in online space. So I\u2019m very committed to both going after ISIS but also supporting what Secretary Kerry is doing to try to move on a political diplomatic to try to begin to slow down and hopefully end the carnage in Syria which is the root of so many of the problems that we seen in the region and beyond.MITCHELL: Senator Sanders, ground forces yes or no? SANDERS: As everybody you know, this is incredibly complicated and difficult issue and I applaud. I know President Obama\u2019s been getting a lot of criticism on this. I think he is doing the right thing.What the nightmare is, which many of my Republican colleagues appear to want is to not have learned the lesson of Iraq. To get American young men and women involved in perpetual warfare in the quagmire of Syria and the Middle East would be an unmitigated disaster that as president, I will do everything in my power to avoid.O\u2019MALLEY: Andrea...MITCHELL: Governor O\u2019Malley?SANDERS: We should \u2014 we should learn \u2014 we should learn from King Abdullah of Jordan, one of the few heroes in a very unheroic place. And what Abdullah said is this is a war with a soul of Islam and that Muslim troops should be on the ground with our support and the support of other major countries. That is how we destroy ISIS, not with American troops in perpetual warfare.MITCHELL: Governor O\u2019Malley.O\u2019MALLEY: Thank you.(APPLAUSE)Andrea, governors have led us to victory in two world wars by doing what America does best, and that is by joining forces with others by acting in coalition. And I believe that President Obama is doing the right thing in this case.We need to learn the lessons from the past. We do need to provide the special \u2014 special ops advisers, we need \u2014 do need to provide the technical support, but over the long-term, we need to develop new alliances. We need a much more proactive national security strategy that reduces these threats before they rise to a level where it feels like we need to pull for a division of marines.And I also want to add one other thing here. I appreciate the fact that in our debate, we don\u2019t use the term you hear Republicans throwing around trying to look all vibrato (ph) and macho sending other kids \u2014 kids into combat, they keep using the term boots on the ground. A woman in Burlington, Iowa said to me, \u201cGovernor, when you\u2019re with your colleagues, please don\u2019t refer to my son who has served two tours of duty in Iraq as a pair of boots on the ground.\u201d Now, we need to be mindful of learning the lessons of the past.(APPLAUSE)MITCHELL: I have a question. I have a question for Senator Sanders. Did the policies of the Obama administration, in which Secretary Clinton of course was a part, create a vacuum in Iraq and Syria that helped ISIS grow?SANDERS: No. I think the vacuum was created by the disastrous war in Iraq, which I vigorously opposed. Not only did I vote against it, I helped lead the opposition. And what happened there is yes, it\u2019s easy to get rid of a two-bit dictator like Saddam Hussein, but there wasn\u2019t the kind of thought as to what happens the day after you get him and what kind of political vacuum occurs. And who rises up? Groups like ISIS.So I think that President Obama made a promise to the American people when he ran, and he said you know what, I\u2019m going to do my best to bring American troops home. And I supported what he did. Our job is to train and provide military support for Muslim countries in the area who are prepared to take on ISIS.And one point I want to make here that is not made very often, you have incredibly wealthy countries in that region, countries like Saudi Arabia, countries like Qatar. Qatar happens to be the largest \u2014 wealthiest country per capita in the world. They have got to start putting in some skin in the game and not just ask the United States to do it.(APPLAUSE)MITCHELL: Secretary Clinton, I want to talk to you about red lines, because former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said in a recent interview that President Obama\u2019s decision to stand down on planned missile strikes against Damascus after Assad had used chemical weapons hurt the president\u2019s credibility. Should the president have stuck to his red line once he drew it?CLINTON: Look, I think that the president\u2019s decision to go after the chemical weapons once there was a potential opportunity to build on when the Russians opened that door resulted in a very positive outcome. We were able to get the chemical weapons out.I know from my own experience as secretary of State that we were deeply worried about Assad\u2019s forces using chemical weapons because it would have had not only a horrific affect on people in Syria, but it could very well have affected the surrounding states, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, Turkey. So getting those chemical weapons out was a big deal, but...MITCHELL: But should he \u2014 should he have stuck to his...CLINTON: Well \u2014 but \u2014 but...MITCHELL: ... line? Did it hurt U.S. credibility? CLINTON: I think, as commander in chief, you\u2019ve got to constantly be evaluating the decisions you have to make. I know a little bit about this, having spent many hours in the situation room, advising President Obama.And I want to just add to something that Senator Sanders said, the United States had a very big interest in trying to help stabilize the region. If there is any blame to be spread around, it starts with the prime minister of Iraq, who sectarianized his military, setting Shia against Sunni.It is amplified by Assad, who has waged one of the bloodiest, most terrible attacks on his own people: 250,000-plus dead, millions fleeing. Causing this vacuum that has been filled unfortunately, by terrorist groups, including ISIS.So, I think we are in the midst of great turmoil in this region. We have a proxy conflict going on between Saudi Arabia and Iran. You know, one of the criticisms I\u2019ve had of Senator Sanders is his suggestion that, you know, Iranian troops be used to try to end the war in Syria...MITCHELL: Your time is up.CLINTON: ... and go after ISIS, which I don\u2019t think would be a good idea.SANDERS: Let me just...MITCHELL: Senator....CLINTON: But overall, a lot of the forces at work in the region are ones that we cannot directly influence, but we can...MITCHELL: You\u2019re out of time.SANDERS: OK. Let me suggest...(CROSSTALK)MITCHELL: Senator Sanders.SANDERS: Where Secretary Clinton and I think, I agree with most of what she said. But where I think we do have an honest disagreement, is that in the incredible quagmire of Syria, where it\u2019s hard to know who\u2019s fighting who and if you give arms to this guy, it may end up in ISIS\u2019 hand the next day. We all know that.And we all know, no argument, the secretary is absolutely right, Assad is a butcher of his own people, man using chemical weapons against his own people. This is beyond disgusting.But I think in terms of our priorities in the region, our first priority must be the destruction of ISIS. Our second priority must be getting rid of Assad, through some political settlement, working with Iran, working with Russia.But the immediate task is to bring all interests together who want to destroy ISIS, including Russia, including Iran, including our Muslim allies to make that the major priority.O\u2019MALLEY: But in all of that senator and secretary, I think we\u2019re leaving out something very important here. And that is that we still don\u2019t have the human intelligence: overt, in terms of diplomatic intelligence or covert, to understand even what the heck happens as the secondary and tertiary effects of some of these things.We are walking through this region, Andrea, without the human intelligence that we need. And we need to make a renewed investment as a country in bringing up a new generation of foreign service officers, and bringing up a new generation of business people and actually understanding and having relationships in these places.So we have a better sense of what the heck happens after a dictator topples and can take action to prevent another safe haven and another iteration of terror.MITCHELL: Your time is us. Lester.HOLT: Senator Sanders mentioned Russia a moment ago. Secretary Clinton, you famously handed Russia\u2019s foreign minister a reset button in 2009. Since then, Russia has annexed Crimea, fomented a war in Ukraine, provided weapons that downed an airliner and launched operations, as we just did discuss, to support Assad in Syria. As president, would you hand Vladimir Putin a reset button?CLINTON: Well, it would depend on what I got for it and I can tell you what we got in the first term, we got a new start treaty to reduce nuclear weapons between the United States and Russia. We got permission to resupply our troops in Afghanistan by traveling across Russia.We got Russia to sign on to our sanctions against Iran and other very important commitments. So look, in diplomacy, you are always trying to see how you can figure out the interest of the other to see if there isn\u2019t some way you can advance your security and your values.When Putin came back in the fall of 2011, it was very clear he came back with a mission. And I began speaking out as soon as that happened because there were some fraudulent elections held, and Russians poured out into the streets to demand their freedom, and he cracked down. And in fact, accused me of fomenting it. So we now know that he has a mixed record to say the least and we have to figure out how to deal with him.HOLT: What\u2019s your relationship with him?CLINTON: Well, my relationship with him, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s interesting.(LAUGHTER)It\u2019s one, I think, of respect. We\u2019ve had some very tough dealings with one another. And I know that he\u2019s someone that you have to continuingly stand up to because, like many bullies, he is somebody who will take as much as he possibly can unless you do.And we need to get the Europeans to be more willing to stand up, I was pleased they put sanctions on after Crimea and eastern Ukraine and the downing of the airliner, but we\u2019ve got to be more united in preventing Putin from taking a more aggressive stance in Europe and the Middle East.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: We to want turn right now to the issue of balancing national security concerns with the privacy rights of Americans. That brings us to YouTube and this question.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BROWNLEE: Hi, my name Marques Brownlee, and I\u2019ve been making YouTube videos about electronics and gadgets for the past seven years.I think America\u2019s future success is tied to getting all kinds of tech right. Tech companies are responsible for the encryption technology to protect personal data, but the government wants a back door into that information.So do you think it\u2019s possible to find common ground? And where do you stand on privacy versus security?(END VIDEO CLIP)HOLT: So, Governor O\u2019Malley.O\u2019MALLEY: Thank you.I believe whether it\u2019s a back door or a front door that the American principle of law should still hold that our federal government should have to get a warrant, whether they want to come through the back door or your front door.(APPLAUSE)And I also agree, Lester, with Benjamin Franklin, who said, no people should ever give up their privacy or their freedoms in a promise for security.So we\u2019re a collaborative people. We need collaborative leadership here with Silicon Valley and other bright people in my own state of Maryland and around the NSA that can actually figure this out.But there are certain immutable principles that will not become antique things in our country so long as we defend our country and its values and its freedoms. And one of those things is our right to be secure in our homes, and our right to expect that our federal government should have to get a warrant.I also want to the say that while we\u2019ve made some progress on the Patriot Act, I do believe that we need an adversarial court system there. We need a public advocate. We need to develop jurisprudence so that we can develop a body of law that protects the privacy of Americans in the information and digital age.HOLT: That\u2019s time.You have all talked about what you would do fighting ISIS over there, but we\u2019ve been hit in this country by home-grown terrorists, from Chattanooga to San Bernardino, the recent shooting of a police officer in Philadelphia. How are you going to fight the lone wolves here, Senator Sanders?O\u2019MALLEY: Yes, Lester, year in and year out I was the leader of the U.S. ...HOLT: That\u2019s a question to Senator Sanders. I wasn\u2019t clear, I apologize.SANDERS: OK. I just wanted to add, in the previous question, I voted against the USA Patriot Act for many of the reasons that Governor O\u2019Malley mentioned. But it is not only the government that we have to worry about, it is private corporations.You would all be amazed, or maybe not, about the amount of information private companies and the government has in terms of the Web sites that you access, the products that you buy, where you are this very moment.And it is very clear to me that public policy has not caught up with the explosion of technology. So yes, we have to work with Silicon Valley to make sure that we do not allow ISIS to transmit information...HOLT: But in terms of lone wolves, the threat, how would you do it?SANDERS: Right. What we have got to do there is, among other things, as I was just saying, have Silicon Valley help us to make sure that information being transmitted through the Internet or in other ways by ISIS is, in fact, discovered.But I do believe we can do that without violating the constitutional and privacy rights of the American people.(CROSSTALK)HOLT: We have to go to a \u2014 we have to go to a break, and when we come back, we\u2019re going to get to some of the burning questions these candidates have yet to answer and are totally eager to talk about.CLINTON: Oh, we\u2019re breaking? OK.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HOLT: And welcome back to Charleston.As we were going to a break, Secretary Clinton, I cut you off. I\u2019ll give you 30 seconds to respond on the issue of lone wolves.O\u2019MALLEY: Can I get 30 seconds, too?(LAUGHTER)SANDERS: Can I get 50 seconds?HOLT: Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Well, I wanted to say, and I\u2019ll do it quickly, I was very pleased that leaders of President Obama\u2019s administration went out to Silicon Valley last week and began exactly this conversation about what we can do, consistent with privacy and security.We need better intelligence cooperation, we need to be sure that we are getting the best intelligence that we can from friends and allies around the world. And then, we\u2019ve got to recognize our first line of defense against lone wolf attacks is among Muslim Americans.And it is not only shameful, it is dangerous for the kinds of comments you\u2019re hearing from the Republican side.We need to be reaching out and unifying our country against terrorist attacks and lone wolves, and working with Muslim Americans.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: And Andrea has a follow-up.O\u2019MALLEY: And Andrea \u2014 Andrea \u2014 Andrea...MITCHELL: Just a \u2014 just a quick follow-up, though, Secretary Clinton. Just a moment, Governor.O\u2019MALLEY: Andrea, when can I get my 30 seconds?MITCHELL: But \u2014 but \u2014 Secretary Clinton, you said that the leaders from the intelligence community went to Silicon Valley, they were flatly turned down. They got nowhere.CLINTON: That is not what I\u2019ve heard. Let me leave it at that.O\u2019MALLEY: Andrea, I need to talk about homeland security and preparedness.Ever since the attacks of September 11th \u2014 30 seconds.(LAUGHTER)Ever since the attacks of September 11th, my colleagues, Democratic and Republican mayors, Democratic and Republican governors, made me their leader on homeland security and preparedness.O\u2019MALLEY: Here in the homeland, unlike combating ISIL abroad, we\u2019re almost like it\u2019s \u2014 your body\u2019s immune system. It\u2019s able to protect your body against bad bugs, not necessarily because it outnumbers them, but it\u2019s better connected \u2014 the fusion centers, the biosurveillance systems, better prepared first responders.But there\u2019s another front in this battle, and it is this. That\u2019s the political front, and if Donald Trump wants to start a registry in our country of people by faith, he can start with me, and I will sign up as one who is totally opposed to his fascist appeals that wants to vilify American Muslims. That can do more damage to our democracy than any...(CROSSTALK)HOLT: All right, that\u2019s time, and \u2014 and we do...(APPLAUSE)... we do have to move on.Secretary Clinton, this is the first time...SANDERS: Can I get a \u2014 can I just get a very brief response? Very brief.HOLT: Thirty \u2014 30 \u2014 30 seconds, Senator.SANDERS: OK. One \u2014 and I agree with what the secretary said, and what Governor O\u2019Malley said. But here\u2019s an issue that we also should talk about. We have a $600 billion military budget. It is a budget larger than the next eight countries\u2019.Unfortunately, much of that budget continues to fight the old Cold War with the Soviet Union. Very little of that budget \u2014 less than 10 percent \u2014 actually goes into fighting ISIS and international terrorism. We need to be thinking hard about making fundamental changes in the priorities of the Defense Department.HOLT: All right. Secretary Clinton...(APPLAUSE)... this is the first time that a spouse of a former president could be elected president. You have said that President Clinton would advise you on economic issues, but be specific, if you can. Are you talking about a kitchen-table role on economics, or will he have a real policy role?CLINTON: Well, it\u2019ll start at the kitchen table, we\u2019ll see how it goes from there. And I...(APPLAUSE)... I\u2019m going to have the very best advisers that I can possibly have, and when it comes to the economy and what was accomplished under my husband\u2019s leadership and the \u201990s \u2014 especially when it came to raising incomes for everybody and lifting more people out of poverty than at any time in recent history \u2014 you bet.I\u2019m going to ask for his ideas, I\u2019m going ask for his advice, and I\u2019m going use him as a goodwill emissary to go around the country to find the best ideas we\u2019ve got, because I do believe, as he said, everything that\u2019s wrong with America has been solved somewhere in America.We just have to do more of it, and we have to reach out, especially into poor communities and communities of color, to give more people their own chance to get ahead.HOLT: Senator sanders, a 30 second response, sir.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Great ideas, Governor O\u2019Malley, Secretary Clinton, but here\u2019s the truth. If you have an administration stacked with Wall Street appointees, it ain\u2019t going to accomplish very much.So here\u2019s a promise that I make \u2014 and I mentioned a moment ago how corrupt the system is \u2014 Goldman Sachs, paying a $5 billion fine, gives this country, in recent history, a Republican secretary of treasury, a Democratic secretary of treasury.Here\u2019s a promise. If elected president, Goldman Sachs is not going to have \u2014 bring forth a secretary of treasury for a Sanders administration.(APPLAUSE)MILLER: Senator Sanders, let me ask you a question. You called Bill Clinton\u2019s past transgressions, quote, \u201ctotally, totally, totally disgraceful and unacceptable.\u201d Senator, do you regret saying that?SANDERS: I was asked a question. You know, one of the things, Andrea, and I \u2014 that question annoys me. I cannot walk down the street \u2014 Secretary Clinton knows this \u2014 without being told how much I have to attack secretary Clinton, want to get me on the front pages of the paper, I\u2019d make some vicious attack.I have avoided doing that. Trying to run an issue-oriented campaign.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: I was asked a question.MILLER: You didn\u2019t have to answer it that way, though. Why did you?SANDERS: Well \u2014 then if I don\u2019t answer it, then there\u2019s another front page, so it\u2019s yes (ph).(LAUGHTER)And I mean this seriously. You know that. We\u2019ve been through this. Yes, his behavior was deplorable. Have I ever once said a word about that issue? No, I have not. I\u2019m going to debate Secretary Clinton, Governor O\u2019Malley, on the issues facing the American people, not Bill Clinton\u2019s personal behavior.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: We will take a break. We\u2019ll continue from Charleston right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) HOLT: Welcome back everybody. Finally, before we go tonight, we set out here to understand points of differences between you. We believe we\u2019ve learned a lot here, but before we leave, is there anything that you really wanted to say tonight that you haven\u2019t gotten a chance to say.And, we\u2019ll start with Governor O\u2019Malley.(LAUGHTER)HOLT: Didn\u2019t see that coming, did you?O\u2019MALLEY: Yes, but we\u2019re going to have to get 20 minutes to do it, so.(LAUGHTER)MITCHELL: ...too long (ph).O\u2019MALLEY: I believe there are many issues. I have 60 seconds for this?HOLT: Sixty seconds, we\u2019d appreciate it.O\u2019MALLEY: There are so many issues that we haven\u2019t been able to discuss here. We have not fully discussed immigration reform, and the deplorable number of immigrant detention camps that our nation\u2019s now maintaining. We haven\u2019t discussed the shameful treatment that the people of Puerto Rico, our fellow Americans, are getting treated with by these hedge funds that are working them over.(APPLAUSE)O\u2019MALLEY: We haven\u2019t discussed the fact that in our hemisphere we have the danger of nation-state failures because of drug traffickers; and Honduras, and Guatemala and El Salvador.I guess the bottom line is this, look we are a great people the way we act at home and abroad based on the beliefs that unite us. Our belief in the dignity of every person, our belief in our own common good. There is now challenge that is too great for us to overcome provided we bring forward in these divided times, new leadership that can heal our divides here at home and bring our principles into alignment abroad.We\u2019re on the threshold of a new era of American progress and I believe we have only need to join forces together and cross that threshold into a new era of American prosperity.HOLT: And that\u2019s time.O\u2019MALLEY: Thanks a lot.HOLT: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well Lester, I spent a lot of time last week being outraged by what\u2019s happening in Flint, Michigan and I think every single American should be outraged. We\u2019ve had a city in the United States of America where the population which is poor in many ways and majority African American has been drinking and bathing in lead contaminated water. And the governor of that state acted as though he didn\u2019t really care.He had request for help and he had basically stone walled. I\u2019ll tell you what, if the kids in a rich suburb of Detroit had been drinking contaminated water and being bathed in it, there would\u2019ve been action.So I sent my top campaign aide down there to talk to the mayor of Flint to see what I could to help. I issued a statement about what we needed to do and then I went on a T.V. show and I said, \u201cit was outrageous that the governor hadn\u2019t acted and within two hours he had.\u201dHOLT: And that\u2019s time.CLINTON: I want to be a president who takes care of the big problems and the problems that are affecting the people of our country everyday.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Thank you.Senator Sanders?SANDERS: Well, Secretary Clinton was right and what I did which I think is also right, is demanded the resignation of governor. A man who acts that irresponsibly should not stay in power.Now, we are a great nation \u2014 and we\u2019ve heard a lot of great ideas here tonight. Let\u2019s be honest and let\u2019s be truthful. Very little is going to be done to transform our economy and to create the kind of middle class we need unless we end a corrupt campaign finance system which is undermining American democracy.We\u2019ve got to get rid of Super PACs, we\u2019ve got to get rid of Citizens\u2019 United and what we\u2019ve got to do is create a political revolution which revitalizes American democracy; which brings millions of young people and working people into the political process. To say loudly and clearly,\u201d that the government of the United States of America belongs to all of us and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.\u201dHOLT: All right. Well thank you and thanks to all of you for being here tonight shedding light on some of the differences as Americans get ready to vote.I also want to thank the Congressional Black Caucus Institute and certainly my friend and colleague, Andrea Mitchell. This has been great. It\u2019s been a great spirited conversation and American people appreciate it.Let me turn it over to my friend Chuck Todd now. Chuck?TODD: Lester thank you and a terrific job moderating this debate tonight, Andrea as well. What a lively substantive debate. We thought there were going to be fireworks, there certainly were.You heard sort of the sharp disagreements when it comes to guns, when it comes to Wall Street Reform, when it comes to health care and even a few things on foreign policy. We\u2019re going to break all of it down here in a few minutes but we\u2019re going to try to sneak in a short break.And when we come back, instant analysis. We\u2019ll see if we can find out what the campaigns are doing. We\u2019re live right here in the spin room in Charleston, South Carolina.ENDAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Conservative Case for Solar Subsidies", "Date": "2016-01-05", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorTO many skeptics, particularly on the right, the spectacular failure of the solar-panel manufacturer Solyndra in 2011, after receiving a $535 million loan guarantee from the Department of Energy, demonstrated the industry\u2019s shaky future and the danger of government efforts to subsidize it to success.Fast forward to today. Solar energy prices have continued to fall rapidly, twice as many Americans work in the solar industry as in coal mining, and last year one-third of new electricity generation came from solar power.Solar, long viewed through the lens of crony capitalism, has shown the ability to inject real market competition in energy distribution, one of the last monopolies in the energy sector, while improving the efficiency of the grid and putting more dollars in the pockets of middle-class Americans. Conservatives, in other words, need to take another look at solar.The case for solar isn\u2019t limited to prices and jobs. Consumers want choice. Unfortunately, in most markets around the country, electricity is still one of the few areas where we have virtually no choice over our supplier. Imagine you want to buy a G.M. car, but you were told you can buy only a Toyota. You\u2019d be outraged \u2014 yet this is how almost all Americans are forced to procure their electricity.Again, to borrow an automotive analogy, you wouldn\u2019t buy a new car just for those few days you had extra errands. Instead, you\u2019d call an Uber or rent a Zipcar. That\u2019s the same role rooftop solar panels can play for our energy challenges \u2014 instead of building another huge plant for a few peak hours, we can build just as much solar capacity as we need.Critics of solar have often said that it produces only \u201cwhen the sun is shining,\u201d and that is true. Fortunately, we need energy most during the daytime \u2014 making rooftop solar a smart choice for consumers while adding energy to the grid when we need it most.And while challenges of storage and metering policies remain, both technology and regulatory models have made significant strides. States like California are considering metering policies that incentivize solar consumers to reduce their demand at peak hours and enable them to sell energy back into the grid when the grid needs it most. Technologies like Google\u2019s Nest \u201csmart\u201d thermostat and Tesla\u2019s home battery are making it easier for consumers to monitor their energy consumption and better store renewable energy when the sun isn\u2019t shining.Of course, conservatives will respond that their core objection remains: Solar functions only because of government subsidies. But there are a couple of issues to consider.For one thing, not all subsidies are created equal, and the government actually has a good track record in promoting new energy technologies. New developments often face two market gaps that can potentially delay or even kill them: the \u201ctechnological valley of death,\u201d in which promising advances hit a technical brick wall, and the \u201ccommercialization valley of death,\u201d in which an effective technology can\u2019t get to market. Government research labs and subsidies have supported a number of forms of energy \u2014 from nuclear energy, to hydraulic fracturing, to photovoltaic solar \u2014 through these troughs.Furthermore, the solar investment tax credit is pretty smart. It\u2019s structured so that as solar power becomes more efficient, the effect of the credit on each watt produced becomes smaller. Ideally, we would let markets decide the winners on their own, but so long as government is intervening in markets, it should do so in an evenhanded way. Similarly, any government support for the solar industry should be impartial, rather than having government bureaucracy pick and choose favored companies as it does through its loan guarantee program. The solar investment tax credit comes close to that ideal.And there\u2019s nothing in free-market economic theory that precludes government support. Markets tend to underproduce what economists call positive externalities \u2014 that is, the broad social benefits, like a cleaner environment, that aren\u2019t captured on a company\u2019s balance sheet.Solar panels, and the companies that make them, are replete with such benefits: They eliminate redundant power plants that otherwise lie idle, empower consumer choice and have fewer negative consequences than most other forms of energy. But markets don\u2019t always reflect these, which is why it makes sense for subsidies to enter the picture.The kerfuffle over the Solyndra collapse aside, many conservatives already agree, and have for years. When I was at the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush, we believed that an across-the-board energy policy was by far the best approach \u2014 and that included solar. From both a market and an environmental point of view, supporting the solar industry should make sense, no matter which side of the aisle you come from.Ben Ho is an economics professor at Vassar and Columbia.\u00a0He served as the lead energy economist for the White House Council of Economic Advisers from 2006 to 2007.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Donald Trump\u2019s Shadow Looms Over Davos", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsDonald Trump\u2019s presence will be felt at the World Economic Forum this year, even though he isn\u2019t actually expected to attend.The populism driving the real estate developer\u2019s unlikely campaign for the presidency finds its roots in the inequality that the annual gathering in Davos, Switzerland, represents \u2013 and which the world business and political leaders in attendance will, again, talk about solving.Mr. Trump is the most imposing of a long line of politicians who, particularly since the great financial crisis that began in 2008, have rallied voter discontent in ways that are upending the establishment.The disruption that Mr. Trump and his ilk represent can, theoretically, be a good thing. A corrupt status quo with entrenched political and corporate interests will, over time, erode faith in democratic institutions. History suggests that can lead to economic instability, even violent revolution. Certain types of populist movements, however, carry their own, equally frightening risks.\u201cThe history of populism in democracy is not great, and it\u2019s not self-correcting in a lot of cases,\u201d said Kenneth M Jacobs, chairman and chief executive of the international investment bank Lazard during a Breakingviews Predictions panel discussion last week. \u201cYou only have to look to Europe between the two wars and to a number of the Latin American countries prewar and postwar to see that.\u201dAll variations of modern populism share a similar root: disaffection with the social contract, and an abiding sense that the benefits of economic progress are not just asymmetrically distributed but potentially no longer available to ordinary citizens.On this front, the charity Oxfam, in its regular party-pooper report ahead of the World Economic Forum, provides some startling evidence that this may indeed be the case today. It\u2019s not just in the United States, which holds a presidential election in November, but across the globe.Just 62 individuals \u2013 53 of them men \u2013 control the same amount of wealth as 3.5 billion people, or the poorer half of the human race, according to Oxfam\u2019s findings. Just five years ago, 388 individuals controlled that level of wealth. Moreover, the riches of these 62 people have nearly doubled since 2010, reaching an absolute figure of $542 billion.The billionaires, chief executives and prime ministers convening in Davos from Wednesday to Saturday are acutely aware of the underlying problem of wealth and income inequality, as they have been since the financial crisis.The program this year is actually dedicated to \u201cMastering the Fourth Industrial Revolution,\u201d a nod to forces like technology and automation that are intensifying the wealth divides, and peppered with sessions like \u201cPolitics of Inequality\u201d and \u201cThe Inequality Challenge.\u201dIt\u2019s a shame that populism isn\u2019t specifically on the agenda, even if it can be diagnosed as a byproduct of inequality. Not all forms of mass insurrection are bad. Spain\u2019s political system, for example, has reformed since the emergence of the \u201cindignados\u201d movement a few years ago, which gave rise to parties like Podemos and Ciudadanos. This has beneficially challenged a two-party system \u2013 not to mention monarchy \u2013 long calcified by corruption.Scholars have argued that relatively bloodless reforms, like America\u2019s New Deal nearly a century ago and China\u2019s shift toward a market economy over the last two decades, were at heart populist movements. Both represented huge shifts in the established order and had the effect of lifting millions of people out of poverty and into the middle class.The belief that whatever compact existed as a result of the New Deal and its many more recent derivatives has shattered is a factor leading to the seemingly unstoppable rise of Mr. Trump in the race for the Republican nomination. A similar phenomenon is happening in the Democratic Party, where Senator Bernie Sanders has taken the front-runner Hillary Clinton by surprise.Both have engaged in the sort of scapegoat tactics that often characterize the bad form of populism. Mr. Sanders rails against the moneyed elite \u2013 basically Davos Man. Mr. Trump focuses on Muslims and Mexican immigrants, linking the woes of his base, the underemployed American with authoritarian inclinations, to globalization, which is a precondition for the very existence of the World Economic Forum.The central difference is that Mr. Sanders\u2019s targets are amply endowed to rebut or undermine his assertions. That\u2019s not the case with the voiceless, mostly poor, immigrants that Mr. Trump, and his emerging nemesis in the G.O.P., Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, have sought to vilify. With his targets lacking any ability to push back publicly, Mr. Trump is able to whip up the angry and undereducated in ways that worryingly echo the worst populist movements of the recent past, particularly National Socialism in Germany.\u201cThe contract around American capitalism used to be pretty simplistic \u2013 it was basically \u2018I don\u2019t mind you getting rich as long as I have the chance to get rich,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Jacobs, who will be among this week\u2019s World Economic Forum attendees. \u201cThe challenge for us right now is whether that has fundamentally broken down. The sense that I can\u2019t make it next is pervasive.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Vinyl,\u2019 Backed by Martin Scorsese and Mick Jagger, Looks at 1970s Rock", "Date": "2016-01-20", "News": "Supported byIt is no accident that, from its opening minutes, \u201cVinyl,\u201d with its mixture of grimy reality, nostalgia for 1970s New York and a throbbing rock \u2019n\u2019 roll soundtrack, feels like a Martin Scorsese movie. Mr. Scorsese, the Academy Award-winning filmmaker, is an executive producer of the series and directed its two-hour pilot episode.Should that pedigree feel insufficient for a narrative about bad behavior, existential crises and the redemptive power of music, Mr. Scorsese is joined on \u201cVinyl\u201d by Mick Jagger, the lead singer of the Rolling Stones and a fellow executive producer on the series, which has its debut on Feb. 14.With a cast that includes Olivia Wilde, Ray Romano and Juno Temple, and an aesthetic that mixes fictional characters with actors playing real-life music stars (like David Bowie, Elvis Presley and Lou Reed), the series is ambitious, expensive and \u2014 to its creative team \u2014 the closest proposition to a sure thing this side of a Led Zeppelin reunion.As its show runner, Terence Winter, said, when he was invited to participate on the project: \u201cI remember pitching it to myself and going, \u2018All right: Martin Scorsese. Mick Jagger. Rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. I don\u2019t care what it is \u2014 there\u2019s no way I wouldn\u2019t watch this.\u2019\u201dFor HBO, which is now the network of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d \u201cSesame Street,\u201d Jon Stewart and Bill Simmons, \u201cVinyl\u201d is an important addition to its lineup: a way to keep people like Mr. Scorsese and Mr. Jagger in its talent stable, and to guard against encroachments from cable competitors like Showtime and streaming services like Netflix, which are preparing 1970s period series of their own.To succeed, \u201cVinyl\u201d will have to fulfill the promise of its sexy subject matter and its superstar producers. And it will have to find a coherent, compelling narrative in a heartfelt if abstract idea about how music defined people\u2019s lives in that era.As Mr. Scorsese explained earlier this month at the Television Critics Association press tour, to have grown up with rock \u2019n\u2019 roll means \u201cyou see life around you played to that music.\u201dThe goal for \u201cVinyl,\u201d he said, is \u201cthat music becomes part of the narrative, but the whole narrative is like a piece of music.\u201dBy focusing on the 1970s in \u201cVinyl,\u201d Mr. Jagger explained in an interview, the series could depict a thrilling, uncertain time in music, when a declining metropolis provided a crucible for punk, disco and hip-hop.\u201cNew York was broke,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of poverty, a lot of rich people and a lot of disparity \u2014 all these scenes going on against a background of quite tough and grimy cityscapes.\u201dAlso, Mr. Jagger added: \u201cI forgot about the silly clothes. Some of them were ridiculous, and some were kind of sharp.\u201dMr. Winter, an Emmy Award-winning producer of \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d and show runner of \u201cBoardwalk Empire,\u201d was among the screenwriters who worked on \u201cThe Long Play.\u201d But in 2008, he said, \u201cThe world economy dropped out, and suddenly the phone stopped ringing.\u201d\u201cThe studio was like, \u2018Eh, this is maybe not the time to do a three-hour epic period piece,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Winter, who also wrote \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d for Mr. Scorsese.Taking a page from \u201cBoardwalk Empire,\u201d HBO\u2019s costly Prohibition-era gangster drama (which ran five seasons and drew about two million to three million viewers an episode), Mr. Winter reshaped the rock project as a cable-TV pilot.At an early table read, as he performed one of Rosetti\u2019s increasingly violent scenes, Mr. Cannavale recalled, \u201cMarty starts giggling \u2014 giggling, giggling, giggling.\u201dWhen Rosetti beat another character to death in the scene, Mr. Cannavale said Mr. Scorsese \u201clost it \u2014 he was crying with laughter and hitting me on the leg.\u201d\u201cHe said to me, \u2018You\u2019re a big guy, and you put your hands all over people,\u2019\u201d Mr. Cannavale recalled. \u201cEvery time I would go near him, I could feel him pull back a little bit. He said: \u2018I want you to keep that. I want Richie to be like that.\u2019\u201dMs. Wilde, a veteran of TV shows like \u201cHouse\u201d and \u201cThe O.C.,\u201d also sought input into her character, Devon, who is Richie\u2019s wife and a one-time denizen of New York\u2019s decadent art scene.In conversations with the \u201cVinyl\u201d producers, Ms. Wilde said: \u201cI am already a fan. But in order to sign up for it, I need to know that you\u2019re not asking me to be the long-suffering housewife. I want to make sure there\u2019s something there.\u201dMs. Wilde said she was satisfied not only by the back story for Devon, a former muse and confidant to Andy Warhol, but also by the producers\u2019 attitudes of openness and collaboration.\u201cThis was not a case of, \u2018There\u2019s an auteur whose words you are to speak, and you must dot every i,\u2019\u201d she said.Other co-stars just seemed happy for the opportunity to see themselves reimagined in wide lapels and luxuriant facial hair.Mr. Romano, the comic star of \u201cEverybody Loves Raymond,\u201d who plays Richie\u2019s record-label partner Zak Yankovich, said that when he submitted his audition tape to Mr. Scorsese, the response he got back was, \u201cHe\u2019s never heard of you.\u201dStill, said Mr. Romano (who has since appeared on shows like \u201cParenthood\u201d and \u201cMen of a Certain Age\u201d): \u201cIt ended up being a blessing. He didn\u2019t have any preconceived notions of me.\u201dProduction for the \u201cVinyl\u201d pilot began in the summer of 2014 and ran 35 days, during which time Mr. Winter said he left Mr. Scorsese to his work.(During the making of the \u201cBoardwalk Empire\u201d pilot, Mr. Winter said, he approached an assistant director to give Mr. Scorsese a creative note. \u201cI said, \u2018How do I do this?\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd he said: \u2018I don\u2019t know. No one\u2019s ever given him a note before.\u2019\u201d)Mr. Cannavale, who worked 16- to 17-hour days, five or six days a week, playing a frantic and frequently coked-up executive, said the commitment to Mr. Scorsese was worthwhile. \u201cThis is what I\u2019ve always wanted to do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could have been twice as long.\u201dSince being picked up as a series, \u201cVinyl\u201d has become a significant undertaking for HBO, occupying some 11,400 square feet of stage space at Steiner Studios in Brooklyn, where the offices of American Century, about 6,400 square feet alone, have been created in intricate detail.It is a sprawling workplace filled with vintage album covers, ashtrays, Rolodexes and typewriters, and filled with a simulated low-level haze of (presumably) cigarette smoke. On floors above the stages are the show\u2019s production offices and estimable costume department, occupying real estate inherited from \u201cBoardwalk Empire,\u201d which concluded in 2014.No one would comment on production costs for \u201cVinyl,\u201d which uses enough new and licensed music that HBO plans to release a soundtrack album for each episode. But Mr. Winter said he told HBO, \u201cYeah, there\u2019s going to be a big price tag, but the payoff is awesome.\u201d (He added an expletive for emphasis.)Mr. Winter, who wrote the \u201cVinyl\u201d pilot with George Mastras (\u201cBreaking Bad\u201d), acknowledged a criticism frequently leveled against \u201cBoardwalk Empire,\u201d that the show took its time setting up characters and plot lines before it came to explosive fruition.\u201c\u2018Boardwalk\u2019 was a slow burn, but it was a completely different story,\u201d Mr. Winter said. On \u201cVinyl,\u201d he said: \u201cYou\u2019re shot out of a cannon. It should feel like you\u2019re strapped onto a rocket, and it just goes.\u201dShould \u201cVinyl\u201d draw comparisons to a series like \u201cMad Men,\u201d the AMC drama about a conflicted, hard-living New York executive in an era of social and cultural upheaval, Mr. Winter could only shrug.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. People work in offices. It\u2019s New York City.\u201dDespite a drumbeat of competition, including coming shows like Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Get Down\u201d (whose creators include Baz Luhrmann, and which is also set in 1970s New York) and Showtime\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m Dying Up Here\u201d (set in the Los Angeles comedy scene of that era), Mr. Winter was unconcerned.\u201cI\u2019m not going to pay attention to any of those other projects,\u201d he said.For Mr. Jagger, the ongoing production of \u201cVinyl\u201d has been his introduction to one of very few showbiz experiences he has never had before, and a continual lesson in how much to be involved in the process.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to spend every minute of your life on this \u2014 that\u2019s not your job,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s your baby, and you don\u2019t want to give it away. Without getting to be obsessive, you have to keep your hand on the tiller.\u201dMr. Winter said that \u201cVinyl\u201d had been another chapter in Mr. Scorsese\u2019s cultural education, too, in learning how to apply a rock fan\u2019s ear to a visual medium and bring his cinematic skills to television.Reflecting on an early conversation about \u201cBoardwalk Empire,\u201d Mr. Winter recalled explaining to Mr. Scorsese the difference between a mini-series and an ongoing series.\u201cI said, \u2018A mini-series is a finite amount \u2014 six, eight, 10 episodes, and that\u2019s it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Winter said. \u201c\u2018A series is, you do the pilot, and then it continues.\u2019\u201dSlipping into an affectionate imitation of Mr. Scorsese\u2019s rapid-fire delivery, Mr. Winter continued: \u201cHe goes, \u2018So the pilot is the movie, and what happens in the series is after the movie? I get it. I\u2019ll do the movie, and then you do the series.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iowa\u2019s Heartland Beyond the Campaign Trail", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "With the caucuses weeks away, a road trip reaffirms that our nation, beginning with Iowa, is full of unsung surprises.Supported byOn a Monday morning in early December I drove a rental car out of Des Moines and eventually made my way down a slender country road that cut a forthright path through cattle pastures and cornfields not yet glazed by snow. My destination was Winterset, the county seat of Madison County, whose covered bridges Robert James Waller immortalized more than 20 years ago in his best seller, \u201cThe Bridges of Madison County.\u201d Mr. Waller\u2019s treacly love fable is not my personal favorite, but I confess to detouring at the sign for Hogback Bridge and being stirred by the lonely spectacle of that wooden sentry crouched over the North River in an unprepossessing crease of Middle America.My reasons for visiting Winterset, however, were more political than sentimental. Donald Trump had descended on the town a few months back, reportedly making a \u201cyuuge\u201d impression on the local Republican kingmakers, and also wowing a gathering of working-class locals with the promise that if elected president his hairstyle would most likely be a casualty, as he would be too busy \u201cworking my ass off\u201d to fuss with it.The venue for Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks had been the John Wayne Birthplace and Museum, which another presidential candidate, Rick Santorum, would soon be visiting. I wasn\u2019t so much interested in joining Mr. Santorum\u2019s \u201cTake Back America\u201d tour as I wished to bask in the magnetic force that Winterset\u2019s favorite son, the former Marion Michael Morrison, exerted on political hopefuls. And so I conducted my own hourlong tour of the small but strangely affecting museum, with its fake-blood-stained cowboy costume and movie posters of blockbusters (\u201cTrue Grit\u201d) and duds (\u201cBig Jake\u201d) alike. Tender and affable though the sendup was, the myth being evoked \u2014 that of the rugged individualist galloping to the world\u2019s rescue \u2014 remains as politically potent as any in America.12 PhotosAfter departing that temple of crinkly-eyed, taciturn masculinity, with a \u201cRooster Cogburn\u201d Christmas ornament in hand, I saw that it was lunchtime. Nearby was the local Pizza Ranch, an Iowa chain mysteriously popular among G.O.P. politicos, where Mr. Santorum would be hosting a town hall the next day. Hunched in the booths around mine in the brightly lit restaurant were a dozen or so men quietly discussing the weather and grain prices in between trips to the pizza buffet station. With their flannel shirts, wind-beaten cheeks and factual manner of speech, they struck me as agrarian replicas of the Duke himself. I found myself wondering what a politician like Mr. Santorum might say to men like these, given that soon \u2014 sooner than anyone else in America \u2014 they would say their piece at the ballot box.It\u2019s again that season, occurring once every four years, when men and women who imagine themselves as the next president of the United States are obliged to make their case to the public in quiet swaths of America\u2019s midsection that they would otherwise never deign to visit. Accompanying these candidates are campaign strategists and members of the political press who themselves are strangers to what some sneeringly refer to as \u201cflyover country.\u201d The collision of the two worlds is often abrupt and ghoulish \u2014 diners under siege, a crazed network of boom mikes, a staged \u201cmoment\u201d in search of actual momentousness. But it can also be salient, an opportunity for the nation\u2019s elite to confront their own ignorance as they see the expressions and hear the stories of people whose ordinary lives are directly affected by the bloodless everyday machinations of Washington.This ritual encounter begins in Iowa \u2014 blessedly so, I might add, despite the frequent lament that the state\u2019s Republican voters are too conservative, that its caucus system is too arcane and exclusionary. Let\u2019s put all that to the side for the moment. Iowa is not just a reminder that America is more than the sum total of its skyscrapers and safe spaces. It also reaffirms that our nation, beginning with Iowa, is full of unsung surprises.Iowa is what we have in mind when we speak of America\u2019s heartland: situated between the nation\u2019s East and West Coasts, owing little cultural debt to either; economically driven for the most part by the blue-collar sectors of agriculture and manufacturing; and possessing both a gently undulating land mass (56,272 square miles) and population (3.1 million) that statistically place the state in the nation\u2019s middle. As with elsewhere in America, Iowans are increasingly urban, and the state\u2019s capital and largest city, Des Moines (with over 200,000 inhabitants), possesses an eclectic, upwardly mobile vibe akin to that of Seattle or Austin. But Iowa as a whole is essentially white, working-class and right-of-center \u2014 though, true to its middling status, ranks 24th among America\u2019s 50 states when it comes to self-identified conservatives.Some may suggest that there are better times of the year to visit the state than in winter. But since my migratory patterns are keyed to the reporting I do during the election cycle, I associate Iowa with steely skies, skeletonized trees, humans bundled up like Michelin men and campaigning like it\u2019s 1999.Des Moines, to me, is the convivial bar in the lobby of the downtown Marriott, where the traveling press can reliably be spotted decompressing after filing their gaffe-of-the-day stories. It is Centro, the sleek and always-full Italian restaurant that has supplanted the city\u2019s grand steakhouse, 801, as the place to spot candidates. It is Raygun, the self-described \u201cprinting, design and clothing company owned and operated by extremely attractive Midwesterners,\u201d where this year\u2019s featured T-shirt is a montage of grimacing Bernie Sanders images. (Mr. Sanders gamely submitted to a YouTube moment alongside a child who was wearing the shirt.)Des Moines is also the Continental, a dark and dignified restaurant around the corner from Raygun in the city\u2019s East Village. I spent a recent evening there sipping a whiskey-and-egg-whites-based drink called the Filibuster with the G.O.P. communications specialist Tim Albrecht \u2014 formerly with Mitt Romney in 2008 and 2012, now with Jeb Bush \u2014 while he wistfully recalled Mr. Romney\u2019s last campaign rally before Election Day: \u201cTen thousand people waiting for him at the airport. We thought we had it in the bag.\u201dAnd Des Moines is Carl\u2019s, a boisterous dive in the Sherman Hill neighborhood where Ronald Reagan once lived while working as a sportscaster for WHO Radio. Both the bar and the neighborhood are nowadays heavily populated by Democrats, I was told by a member of the loyal opposition, a longtime Iowa G.O.P. strategist named Grant Young, whom I found beside a steaming pot of chili drinking a Coors Light with a shot of whiskey and cinnamon \u2014 and who, in midexplanation, fist-bumped an arriving patron, Matt Paul, the state director of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.I woke up the next morning after that boozy evening and shuffled over to the edge of downtown, where Carly Fiorina was conducting a town hall in the conference room of an insurance company. The candidate\u2019s \u201cBlueprint to Take Our Country Back\u201d would prove to be \u2014 and I say this with gratitude \u2014 the lightest fare of the day. Iowans are great innovators when it comes to caloric multiplier effects. In the town square of Oskaloosa later that morning, I stopped for a latte at Smokey Row Coffee, a theatrical cafe where, above one special table, an actual movie marquee announces who is sitting directly beneath it. (\u201cHappy birthday, Senator Grassley!\u201d) The soup of the day was cheeseburger chowder \u2014 literally, a burger half-submerged in a small ocean. I forewent this delicacy because I knew I would soon be having lunch in Iowa City, at the famed Hamburg Inn No. 2, a scruffily hip diner festooned with they-were-here photos of candidates \u2014 Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and others. My server there advised me to follow my cheeseburger with something called a pie shake \u2014 \u201cTry the pumpkin, it\u2019s in season.\u201d True to its description, the experience was akin to drinking a pumpkin pie, complete with crust.Just outside Iowa City, in the sleepy town of West Branch, is the presidential museum of its native son Herbert Hoover. The tourist site, housed in a building not far from the two-room cottage where Hoover spent his earliest days before becoming orphaned at the age of 9, is notable for its sparseness. Unlike the edifices dedicated to more recent or more beloved presidents, a visitor can stroll through the life of our nation\u2019s 31st chief executive without anyone else around, lending poignancy to Hoover\u2019s experience as the man widely blamed for failing to prevent the Great Depression. To its credit, the museum devotes significant space to Hoover\u2019s fall from grace following his landslide loss to Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932, and subsequent despondency, while reminding visitors that he ultimately regained his status as a statesman, working with President Harry S. Truman to help resuscitate Europe\u2019s economy following World War II. Here in Iowa was another great national motif \u2014 that of America as the land of second chances.I was now in the eastern side of the state, with no set itinerary. As a native Texan, I am not one for driving in snow. But the weather was merciful and the rural roads well paved, offering a near-seamless tableau of shorn acreage upon which the occasional silo or farmhouse materialized in a state of heartbreaking isolation. Just outside Kalona on Route 1, I came upon a profusion of buggies ferrying Amish families. But traffic was otherwise nonexistent, and so I made my way unharried, in a kind of fugue state, until a beeping notified me that I was almost out of gas. I had just enough to get me to tiny Keota \u2014 where, at the town\u2019s one high school, Martin O\u2019Malley was describing trickle-down economics to a mildly interested crowd of about 200. A reporter for the local paper told me where to find the nearest gas station, adding with a sweet smile, \u201cI know it means a lot to the folks who organized this event that you came all this way.\u201d A few minutes later, as I meandered through Keota, she flagged me down on the street and gently advised me that I would find what I was looking for in the opposite direction.Less than an hour from Keota, I found the turnoff to Vedic City \u2014 or, rather (as a sign proclaimed it), \u201cMaharishi Vedic City: Capital of the Global Country of World Peace.\u201d Iowa, as it turns out, boasts one of America\u2019s foremost Transcendental Meditation temples, shimmering on the plains like an alien spaceship. The filmmaker David Lynch was a habitu\u00e9; Oprah Winfrey had paid a visit; Jim Carrey gave a commencement speech to the 2014 graduating class at Maharishi University of Management in Fairfield. The community\u2019s other main attraction is the Raj, a rather sumptuous spa where the ancient healing rites of Ayurveda are practiced. I was tempted to book a room, but the Raj requires a three-day commitment, and with my reporter\u2019s laptop and ever-buzzing iPhone, I seemed a dubious fit anyway. Instead, I found a hotel in neighboring Fairfield, a new-agey city ominously self-described in one sign as \u201ca cast of 10,000 as themselves.\u201d Ron Paul, I was later told, had a strong following in Fairfield.Western Iowa\u2019s unofficial corn corridor is Route 141, an Uberless world of uneven cellphone reception and agrarian infinity, gorgeous in its forlornness. In Coon Rapids, a quiet town of 1,300 astride the Middle Raccoon River, I went searching for the farm that an agriculturally curious Soviet premier, Nikita S. Khrushchev, came to visit in 1959. After a few fruitless turns, I pulled into the main square and walked into the newspaper office of the Coon Rapids Enterprise. A yellow Labrador puppy joyfully assaulted me as I walked in. \u201cThat\u2019s Margaux,\u201d the paper\u2019s editor, Charlie Nixon, informed me as he restrained his pet. \u201cWe name all of our dogs after wines we can\u2019t afford.\u201dThe newsroom\u2019s walls featured several vintage photos of prominent Iowa politicians, which Mr. Nixon narrated for me with a string of appropriate profanities. He then showed me a framed photo of the bald Soviet leader standing beside a white-haired farmer. \u201cRoswell Garst owned a big seed company,\u201d he said, adding that the Iowan had visited the U.S.S.R. to study its farming techniques at the behest of Khrushchev, who shared Mr. Garst\u2019s interest in preventing famine.The editor directed me to the old Garst farmstead, a rustic, two-story, wood-framed structure on a 5,000-acre land trust that is now a bed-and-breakfast replete with plaques and photographs memorializing the rather astounding 1959 summit of the Garst and Khrushchev families, one that had earned Mr. Garst the epithet of \u201cCommunist sympathizer\u201d rather than the capitalist visionary he actually was. Like the Maharishi temple in Vedic City, the Garst property utterly belied the political caricature of Iowa as an ecosystem of rural rigidity.A few miles west of Coon Rapids, another wrinkle in the Iowa tapestry came into view: Templeton, home of one of the country\u2019s most skilled Prohibition-era bootleggers, so goes the legend. Near the little town\u2019s center, I beheld a Christmas tree made entirely of whiskey barrels and realized that I had discovered the tasting room of Templeton Rye. The walls inside its handsome tasting room were covered with old newspaper articles describing how Al Capone favored the smooth moonshine crafted by this community of farmers, who had apparently turned to the illegal pastime when corn prices went south. Today, Templeton Rye\u2019s bottles bear the signature of Deirdre Capone, the mobster\u2019s grandniece who has a promoting agreement with the company.\u201cWe don\u2019t dabble in politics \u2014 just in our right to make whiskey,\u201d the tasting room operator, Lisa Halbur, proclaimed as she poured me a shot of the now-legal stuff. That right, she admitted, was still prohibited in the \u201ccontrolled state\u201d of Iowa. As a result, her company\u2019s whiskey is in fact distilled in Lawrenceburg, Ind., and later bottled in Templeton. \u201cI guess we could use a good lobbyist,\u201d Ms. Halbur said.I asked her if there was anyplace else in Templeton where one could find remnants of Iowa\u2019s bootlegging trade. Her answer led me to a small cemetery outside the town\u2019s one Catholic church. After wandering among the graves for a few minutes, I discovered the attraction in question. It was a monument to a former parish priest, a Father Schulte, with a little door on the tombstone featuring a chalice into which one would ordinarily place candles and pictures of the Virgin Mary \u2026 but which in Templeton was where customers knew to look to find their treasured bottle of hooch.I returned to my day job, and to the suburbs of Des Moines, that afternoon. Hillary Clinton would soon be hosting a town hall in Urbandale, and denouncing Mr. Trump\u2019s denunciation of Muslim refugees to an overflow crowd, just a few hundred yards from where I had begun the day dining on pecan pancakes among a gathering called the Westside Conservative Club, while those present grilled the speaker, a Republican mayor, about his tax cuts. (Short version: He could stand to cut more.) After Mrs. Clinton fielded a few softball questions with a shortstop\u2019s aplomb, I headed off to dinner to meet with a G.O.P. strategist, then to quiz a prominent local Democrat at Wellman\u2019s, a watering hole that in the previous two cycles was legendarily overstuffed with Obama campaign staffers. The Democrat in question was as skilled a storyteller as he was proficient a drinker. Still, I had an early flight to catch the next morning, to that other early decider in the presidential sweepstakes, New Hampshire \u2014 a state that is much remarked on by the political class for its flinty local interrogators and for the pride they seem to take in negating the referendum delivered by Iowans a week earlier.But as I drove back to my hotel that night, I could not stop thinking of the many quirks I had encountered throughout my week in Iowa: a self-made cowboy, a remade statesman, a farmer who welcomed the world\u2019s leading Communist into his home, Maharishi followers and bootleggers, pie shakes and cheeseburger chowder. This was the Iowa I had not known, the America I knew in my bones was there all along. Its votes came first for good reason.The cover article on Jan. 17, about going beyond politics in Iowa, misspelled the name of a town visited by the writer. It is Oskaloosa, not Oscaloosa. And the article, and an accompanying picture caption, characterized incorrectly buggies outside of Kalona, Iowa. They are Amish buggies, not Mennonite \u2014 although Mennonites do live in the area.An earlier version of a caption for picture No. 1 in an accompanying slide show misidentified the city in Iowa where the Hamburg Inn 2 restaurant is located. It is in Iowa City, not Des Moines.Robert Draper is a contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine and National Geographic.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Obama\u2019s Legacy May Hinge on Endurance of His Achievements", "Date": "2016-01-10", "News": "Supported byLetter from WashingtonRepublicans say that President Obama is too passive on foreign policy. A few Democrats see him that way when it comes to politics. The president, however, is planning an aggressive finale.The one-year countdown to the end of his time in office begins with his final State of the Union address on Tuesday. Although this is an election year and the political environment is poisonous, Mr. Obama envisions a couple of major legislative achievements, notably the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement and an overhaul of the criminal justice system. There will also be executive actions, beginning with the one on gun control he announced last week, which he could follow with decisions on controversial issues, such as closing the detention center at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba.And, like all presidents, Mr. Obama is looking for some foreign policy successes. He will fully leverage his last year of access to Air Force One to traverse the globe.\u201cYou saw how strongly the president came out of the blocks,\u201d said Denis McDonough, the White House chief of staff, referring to the gun initiative. \u201cHe wants this next year to be about the future and sees big opportunities.\u201dOnly a little more than a year ago, after his party\u2019s drubbing in the midterm elections, Mr. Obama was dismissed as largely irrelevant when Republicans took control of Congress. Yet he scored notable legislative victories in 2015, including bipartisan backing for transportation and educational measures.On foreign policy, he reached a nuclear accord with Iran, re-established diplomatic relations with Cuba and reveled in a global climate-change agreement in December. The Supreme Court handed the White House significant victories by rejecting a challenge to the Affordable Care Act and legalizing same-sex marriage.Many legislative budget matters for 2016 essentially are settled. Most Republicans \u2014 and a few Democrats \u2014 support the Asia trade pact. And the recent financial turmoil in China, which isn\u2019t a party to the TPP, strengthens the case for the agreement. Criminal justice reform has to overcome opposition from right wingers.Mr. McDonough insists that the president won\u2019t shy away from controversies such as finding a way to shutter Guant\u00e1namo: \u201cHe feels a responsibility to resolve this.\u201dPresidents who don\u2019t face re-election usually want to go out with signature achievements, though events often interfere. In 1960, President Dwight D. Eisenhower envisioned a breakthrough in relations with the Soviet Union. But then an American U-2 spy plane was shot down over the Soviet Union and a subsequent summit meeting collapsed over the incident.Eight years later, in 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson was frustrated by the lack of progress in settling the Vietnam War and saw his hopes for an arms treaty fall apart when Soviet tanks rolled into Czechoslovakia that summer. In 2000, President Bill Clinton\u2019s dream of a final status agreement between Israel and the Palestinians proved to be impractical.One of the few final-year successes was President Ronald Reagan, who won ratification of an Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with the Soviets.Mr. Obama joins his two predecessors in leaving office while still relatively young, notes the presidential scholar Michael Beschloss: \u201cThey want a legacy in their last year, but it also sets the stage for their post-presidency.\u201dThere\u2019s real potential for setbacks for Mr. Obama this year: The battle against the Islamic State, the threat of more terrorist attacks and a plummeting global economy.But successes or failures in 2016 might only marginally alter the Obama legacy. If the Iran nuclear deal and the Affordable Care Act fail, he will be seen more as an interesting president than as a significant one. If, however, these achievements \u2014 along with the recovery from the financial crisis \u2014 are viewed as enduring successes, Mr. Obama will have a chance to be remembered as a near-great president.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "African Economies, and Hopes for New Era, Are Shaken by China", "Date": "2016-01-25", "News": "Supported byJOHANNESBURG \u2014 Years of rapid economic growth across sub-Saharan Africa fueled hopes of a prosperous new era. To many, the world\u2019s poorest continent was finally emerging, with economies that were no longer dependent on the fickle global demand for Africa\u2019s raw resources.\u201cWe can see what drove the growth in Africa when demand goes away,\u201d said Greg Mills, the director of the Brenthurst Foundation, a Johannesburg-based economic research group. \u201cWell, demand has gone away, and it\u2019s not pretty.\u201dMany economists expect South Africa, the continent\u2019s most advanced and diversified economy, to slide into a recession this year, a projection disputed by the government. As Africa\u2019s biggest exporter of iron ore to China, South Africa is suffering from a slump in mining, as well as in other sectors like manufacturing and agriculture.Nigeria, Africa\u2019s biggest economy and oil producer, is reeling from the crash in crude prices, at the same time President Muhammadu Buhari tries to deal with Boko Haram, the Islamic extremist group that has long terrorized the nation. With oil accounting for 80 percent of government revenue, the government may also lack the resources to quell potential unrest in the Niger Delta, the source of the country\u2019s oil.Nigeria\u2019s currency, the naira, collapsed to record lows this month after Nigeria\u2019s central bank placed restrictions on the sale of American dollars to protect its shrinking foreign reserves. The currency fell to about 300 naira to the dollar in Nigeria\u2019s black market, down from about 240 early last month.Weakening currencies will make it harder for Nigeria \u2014 and many other African governments \u2014 to repay China for loans used to build large infrastructure projects. The tumbling naira and China\u2019s downturn are also reverberating across private businesses, large and small.Happiness Awonegbe, a businessman in Lagos, Nigeria, whose companies import paper, tires and other goods from China, said the restrictions on the dollar had made it difficult for him to place orders with Chinese suppliers. When he can place an order, his Chinese suppliers now take 50 days to fill it instead of 30, apparently because of reductions in their work force, Mr. Awonegbe said.\u201cWe are feeling so much this spillover effect,\u201d said Mr. Awonegbe, who employs 50 people. \u201cWhat happens in China affects Nigeria.\u201dBut experts also see bright spots on the map. While previously high-flying commodity exporters, like Angola and Zambia, have been hit hardest by China\u2019s slowdown, other countries are showing greater resilience.\u201cThe \u2018Africa rising\u2019 narrative wasn\u2019t true, but neither is the diametrically opposed argument that Africa is no longer rising,\u201d said Simon Freemantle, a senior political economist at Standard Bank, a South African bank. \u201cThe truth is obviously in between.\u201d\u201cWhat we\u2019re going to see going forward is far more fragmentation and divergence across the continent,\u201d Mr. Freemantle added. \u201cAnd what\u2019s going to determine that divergence is how prudent countries have been during the good times. Have they embedded macro reforms? Have they saved?\u201dMr. Freemantle said East African countries, including Kenya and Ethiopia, which have been forced to diversify their economies in part because of their dearth of commodities, will probably continue to enjoy robust growth.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.Critics say Zambia could have taken advantage of the boom by negotiating better terms with Chinese companies, including securing technology transfers or employment for infrastructure projects. Zambia used revenue from copper to increase the salaries of civil servants but did not invest in potential growth industries, like tourism and agriculture.Edith Nawakwi, a former finance minister in Zambia and now leader of an opposition party, said large infrastructure projects were often wasted opportunities that failed to lead to economic development. African leaders, Ms. Nawakwi said, could have asked the Chinese to build infrastructure that would have furthered regional integration, business and trade.\u201cWhat we need is a change in the way we approach China,\u201d Ms. Nawakwi said. \u201cYou get from China what you ask for.\u201dBut with the impact on Africa of China\u2019s downturn and a growing trade imbalance \u2014 China exported $102 billion to Africa last year but imported only $67 billion from the continent \u2014 skeptical voices are increasing.\u201cThe Chinese are not romantic anymore about their relations with Africa \u2014 far from it,\u201d said Ibbo Mandaza, a political analyst and businessman in Zimbabwe. \u201cFor them, it\u2019s purely economic.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Greece\u2019s Populism, Precious Lessons for Europe", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byThe glue that holds Greece\u2019s paradoxical coalition together, and which we see across Europe, is populism. Not some coherent ideology that puts the people\u2019s interests first, but a policy based on opportunism, on cultivating a grandiose sense of national identity and then presenting that identity as being threatened by domestic and foreign enemies. It uses current problems to undermine efforts at solutions, and conjures past and future utopias rather than trying to keep up with dizzying change.Greece has been plagued by domestic divisions for most of its modern history. It is easy to see foreign creditors\u2019 supervision of our economy, and their pressure on our political system, as a new chapter in a national epic of resistance.Similar forces are at play, to some extent, in Poland, Hungary, Portugal and Spain \u2014 wherever foreign domination or domestic dictatorships still loom large in national narratives. In France, the National Front sees Brussels and immigrants as the enemy. Demagogues are able to claim that they represent the people against foreigners and their lackeys in the local political and media elites, especially when European institutions and local politicians do not seem to have easy solutions to problems.A chasm separates the social liberalism and internationalism of Syriza from the Christian Nationalism of its right-wing partner, the Independent Greeks. When the government presented a law allowing civil partnerships of same-sex couples, it was passed with votes from Syriza and opposition parties; most Independent Greeks voted against it.Demagogues oversimplify things by making false promises and excessive accusations. They \u2014 and, through them, their supporters \u2014 are always in the right, no matter how mixed up reality may be. At the same time, they complicate things needlessly, often employing primitive conspiracy theories so that no one can understand what must be done.In Greece, the populist narrative was that the local and foreign elites ran up huge debts that the citizens were then forced to pay through reduced incomes, higher taxes and unemployment. Instead of noting that the Greek state was spending beyond its means and had to be reformed, Syriza argued that simply by voting for it, citizens could end the pain, and all the measures of the past few years would be reversed.This kind of populism makes partnerships extremely difficult. It creates a climate of suspicion and ill will. In Greece, the more our partners and creditors press for compliance with the bailout agreements, the more they are seen as impinging on our sovereignty, stoking further resistance. At the same time, Greek reluctance or inability to achieve something is seen as a direct affront to its partners.Populist demagogy is a highly effective way of gaining power and consolidating it. Playing the people against elites, dividing citizens into patriots and quislings, seeing the world as \u201cus versus them\u201d and oversimplifying issues in a complex, pluralistic world provide the illusion of national determination and an outlet for public anger.But however effective populism is in domestic politics, it\u2019s a dead end: Countries that give in to its charms cannot find the strength to reform, and are alone when facing the problems that inspired their inward turn in the first place. In Greece, a rising wave of anger at inevitable reforms signals the failure of easy promises. In the globalized world, economic competitiveness, climate change, mass migration, terrorism and other challenges can only be dealt with collectively \u2014 no matter how much any nation, party or citizen may feel that isolation is an option.Advertisement"}

The rat- and roach-infested apartments. And the tense interactions between the neighborhood\u2019s largely black population and the police.And the highest crime rate of the city\u2019s five police precincts was in the Fourth Precinct covering North Minneapolis, which reported 1,428 violent crimes last year through November, including 18 murders.\u201cClearly there are deep divisions and divides and gaps between white people and people of color in the city of Minneapolis,\u201d said Betsy Hodges, the first-term Democratic mayor, who is white. \u201cIt is job No. 1 for the health of us as a community and for growth and prosperity to eliminate those gaps.\u201dThat divide plays out starkly in a roughly five-square-mile area on the north side, where nearly half of residents are black. The area is not lined with high-rise projects or blighted by abandoned parcels. But as Willesha Moorehead, who came here from Chicago a dozen years ago, can attest, struggle is baked into its streets.Seven of her friends or members of her family, including the father of her first child, have died from gun violence in North Minneapolis. She has struggled to get work, in part because she could not find child care for her two daughters, she said. And for the past three years she has bounced between the homes of friends and family because she could not find affordable housing.Since the summer, Ms. Moorehead, 24, estimates, she and a friend have applied for 50 apartments. Most of the better units have been outside North Minneapolis, but the landlords have asked that they earn two or three times the annual rent, far more than they can cover with money from public assistance and her job at a beauty supply shop. All of the approximately 10 units they have viewed in North Minneapolis were run down, she said.Ms. Moorehead caught a break in November when she was approved for a Section 8 subsidized housing voucher after years of waiting. She must live in neighboring St. Paul for a year with the voucher, she said, after which she can move anywhere. She has not decided whether to return to the north side, where she works.\u201cI love North Minneapolis,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes it just be too much.\u201dThe unrest, which drew hundreds of National Guard troops to the city, left dozens of businesses along Plymouth and other north side streets burned, and it hastened white flight to the suburbs.Today, residents of the north side lament that many of the problems from five decades ago remain.Yet downtown has many well-developed blocks, with packed bars and restaurants, and glittering office and residential towers with floor-to-ceiling windows.Public transportation is poor, residents say, and though local officials are planning to spend more than $1 billion on a light-rail line, North Minneapolis residents have been critical because it will run through downtown and the suburbs but skirt their community.Even the food choices are limited, with fast-food restaurants dominating. Sammy McDowell\u2019s cafe, Sammy\u2019s Avenue Eatery, is a notable exception.Since Mr. McDowell, who is black, opened it four years ago, the restaurant has become a gathering place where chance meetings over meals have led to job offers. But that is not enough, Mr. McDowell, 39, said.\u201cWe need to bring in more businesses so we can have more jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise, we will never compare to the other areas of the city.\u201dJohn Elder, a spokesman for the Minneapolis Police Department, acknowledged a fractured relationship with black residents. But he said a program started three years ago by Chief Jane\u00e9 Harteau, requiring officers to engage more with residents, had helped.\u201cThere historically has been distrust,\u201d Mr. Elder said. \u201cI believe that from where it\u2019s been to where it\u2019s at now is light-years better. Is it where we want it to be? Absolutely not. We have room to grow.\u201dOne lifelong resident, Angela Avent, 36, is sticking it out even though she has lived in a house that was struck by bullets and destroyed by a tornado. In September, one of her daughters witnessed a fatal shooting outside the brick flat where they now live.\u201cYou have to not only talk about it, you have to be about it,\u201d she said, \u201cand be willing to go out there and stand and take action.\u201dSarah Cohen contributed reporting from New York.

{"Headline": "Saudi Arabia\u2019s Dangerous Sectarian Game", "Date": "2016-01-04", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorWHEN Saudi Arabia executed the Shiite cleric and political dissident Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr on Saturday, the country\u2019s leaders were aware that doing so would upset their longtime rivals in Iran. In fact, the royal court in Riyadh was probably counting on it. It got what it wanted. The deterioration of relations has been precipitous: Protesters in Tehran sacked Saudi Arabia\u2019s embassy; in retaliation, Saudi Arabia severed diplomatic ties. More severe fallout could follow \u2014 possibly even war.Why did Saudi Arabia want this now? Because the kingdom is under pressure: Oil prices, on which the economy depends almost entirely, are plummeting; a thaw in Iranian-American relations threatens to diminish Riyadh\u2019s special place in regional politics; the Saudi military is failing in its war in Yemen.In this context, a row with Iran is not a problem so much as an opportunity. The royals in Riyadh most likely believe that it will allow them to stop dissent at home, shore up support among the Sunni majority and bring regional allies to their side. In the short term, they may be right. But eventually, stoking sectarianism will only empower extremists and further destabilize an already explosive region.Over the past decade, Saudi rulers have turned to Iran and Shiites every time they needed an easy scapegoat. Anti-Iranian and anti-Shiite sentiments have long existed among religious extremists in the kingdom, but today they are at the heart of Saudi Arabia\u2019s national identity. This development is dangerous for Saudi Arabia\u2019s Shiite community, estimated at 10 to 15 percent of the population, and for the entire Middle East.This is hardly the first time Saudi Arabia\u2019s Shiites have come under fire. Sectarianism under Saudi rule dates back to the early 20th century. But until recently, the kingdom\u2019s leaders have balanced strong-armed tactics with efforts to accommodate community leaders, seeking to minimize the dangers of sectarianism.After the 2003 invasion of Iraq unleashed a new wave of Sunni-Shiite tension across the Middle East, Riyadh started to shift course. But in 2011, as the Arab world exploded in popular protests, the Saudi government cemented its commitment to sectarian confrontation. The Shiite majority population in neighboring Bahrain rose up against the Sunni-dominated monarchy. The Shiite minority in Saudi Arabia also took to the streets, protesting for political reform.Invoking Iran and Shiites as a terrifying menace, Saudi rulers framed everything from domestic protests to intervention in Yemen in sectarian terms and in the process sought not only to demonize a minority group, but also to undermine the appeal of political reform and protest.Sheikh Nimr had a long history of challenging the Saudi ruling family, but it was his post-2011 activism that led to his execution. After speaking defiantly about anti-Shiite discrimination, he was chased and arrested by Saudi police in July 2012. The police who apprehended him claimed that he had fired on them. Officially, Sheikh Nimr was executed for sedition and other charges. More likely, he was executed for being critical of power. He was not a liberal, but he gave voice to the kinds of criticisms the Saudi royals fear most and tolerate least.Still, Sheikh Nimr\u2019s execution was more important for what it communicated to the kingdom\u2019s domestic allies and to potential future dissidents. The emergence of anti-Shiite sentiment over the past decade has not only been used to stamp out efforts by the Shiite minority to gain more political rights. In quashing calls for democracy originating from the Shiite community, Riyadh has also undermined broader demands for political reform by casting protesters as un-Islamic. Many Sunni reformers who cooperated with Shiites in the past have since stopped.The Saudi authorities have good reason to be concerned about new calls for reform. About a week before Sheikh Nimr\u2019s execution, the kingdom announced that it was facing an almost $100 billion deficit for its 2016 national budget. Declining oil revenues may soon force the kingdom to slash spending on social welfare programs, subsidized water, gasoline and jobs \u2014 the very social contract that informally binds ruler and ruled in Saudi Arabia. The killing of a prominent member of a loathed religious minority deflects attention from impending economic pressure.The danger in Saudi Arabia\u2019s ongoing sectarian and anti-Iranian incitement \u2014 of which Sheikh Nimr\u2019s execution is just one part \u2014 is that it is uncontrollable. As is clear in Syria, Iraq and even further afield, sectarian hostility has taken on a life beyond what the kingdom\u2019s architects are able to manage. This has already proved to be the case in Saudi Arabia, where terrorists aligned with the Islamic State have carried out several suicide bombings on Shiite mosques in the past year.The real problem is not just that Saudis are willing to live with violent sectarianism. They are now beholden to it, too. That the kingdom\u2019s leaders have embraced sectarianism so recklessly suggests that they have little other choice. This should be frightening, considering more is likely to be in store. But it should also be clarifying for those who believe that Saudi Arabia is a force for stability in the Middle East. It is not.Toby Craig Jones is a professor of history at Rutgers University and the author of \u201cDesert Kingdom: How Oil and Water Forged Modern Saudi Arabia.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Falling Deficit to Reverse Course in 2016 as U.S. Ages", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported byBudget analysts had already forecast that annual deficits would begin growing again as the nation confronts the health and retirement costs of its aging population, but the shift was expected to happen after 2018. The budget office now says the reckoning will arrive sooner, in large part because Congress and President Obama agreed late last year to permanently extend a raft of tax cuts for corporations and individuals.The deficit for this fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, is projected to be $544 billion \u2014 $105 billion more than last year, and $130 billion more than the budget office had projected last August. Over 10 years, through fiscal year 2025, deficits would add up to $1.5 trillion more than the budget office had predicted.After small increases in deficits over the next two years, the budget office said, they will go up more sharply after 2018 and begin exceeding 3 percent of the nation\u2019s total economic output, or gross domestic product. That is the limit that economists generally consider sustainable in a growing economy.The deficit last year was equal to 2.5 percent of gross domestic product, down three-quarters from the start of Mr. Obama\u2019s administration. It is expected to rise to 2.9 percent this year.By 2026, the final year of the budget office\u2019s 10-year outlook, the annual deficit would surpass $1 trillion for the first time since the recession and financial crisis that Mr. Obama inherited \u2014 reaching $1.4 trillion, or 4.9 percent of gross domestic product. The budget office said about half of the higher adjustment in its deficit projections reflected revenue losses from the compromise tax cuts. The rest are attributable to changes in its economic forecast and technical assumptions.The tax compromise last month made permanent some breaks for businesses and individuals that were supposed to be temporary but have been repeatedly extended, some for decades. Making the so-called tax extenders permanent could make budgeting more honest, because for the first time their cost is reflected in long-term forecasts like the latest one by the budget office. But budget watchdog groups had pressed for Congress to offset the costs with other savings to avoid adding to deficits.\u201cThis is a more accurate reflection of what the real long-term outlook is like, but that just highlights the fact that we couldn\u2019t afford to continue those extenders,\u201d said Ed Lorenzen, senior adviser to the centrist Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.Mr. Obama had proposed paying for the tax cuts by raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans, but the Republicans who control Congress refused.\u201cThat would have been not just the fairer thing to do, it would have been better for the economy. It also would have improved the fiscal situation of the country,\u201d the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, said on Tuesday.Democratic presidential candidates, including Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have proposed spending increases for a range of domestic initiatives. They would pay for the new initiatives by raising taxes on the rich, making such tax increases unavailable for deficit reduction.Republican presidential candidates face bigger questions in light of the new fiscal outlook, since most have proposed new, deep tax cuts, especially for the wealthy and corporations. The most generous by far is the plan of the leading Republican candidate, Donald J. Trump, which nonpartisan analyses have estimated to cost about $10 trillion over 10 years. That would double the total deficit increase projected over the next decade.The tax cut plans are \u201cprofoundly irresponsible,\u201d said Steve Bell, senior director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, and a Republican who headed the Senate Budget Committee staff in the Reagan era. \u201cIt just leaves guys like me speechless.

{"Headline": "U.S. Pledges to Ease Pain of Closing Coal Mines in Shift to Cleaner Energy ", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byAs Mr. Obama has sought a legacy in tackling climate change, his top target has been the burning of coal for electricity \u2014 the nation\u2019s largest source of planet-warming emissions. New rules could freeze construction of new coal plants, shutter existing plants, limit United States investment in foreign plants \u2014 and with Friday\u2019s move, keep coal in the ground.Interior Secretary Sally Jewell announced that her agency would begin a three-year review intended to overhaul the federal government\u2019s program for leasing coal on public land, with an eye to raising the costs paid by coal companies to mine on public land, and ultimately to slow down production. The agency also announced a moratorium on new federal coal leases while those reviews and changes take place.The latest move comes as the coal industry contends with plunging natural gas prices that have offered electric utilities a cheap coal alternative. Over the past six months, at least half a dozen major coal companies have declared bankruptcy. Employment in the coal mining industry is at a 20-year low.The moratorium could have a profound effect on the coal industry since about 40 percent of the nation\u2019s coal is mined on public lands. Under the new plan, companies can continue to mine on existing leases, which contain about a 20-year supply of coal, according to the Interior Department. But the move sends a clear signal to markets that the future of United States coal may be limited.\u201cNow we\u2019ve got to accelerate the transition away from old, dirtier energy sources,\u201d he said. \u201cRather than subsidize the past, we should invest in the future, especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels. We do them no favor when we don\u2019t show them where the trends are going.\u201dThe goal of the administration\u2019s new coal plan is to extract more money from coal companies for mining on federal land and invest that revenue back into coal communities to help them train and prepare for new jobs.But in many coal-heavy but relatively remote areas, such as West Virginia, eastern Kentucky, Wyoming and Montana\u2019s Powder River Basin, job options are limited. And the federal government\u2019s efforts to help communities transition from a dying industry to more vibrant ones have met limited success, as steel towns in the Midwest and tobacco towns in the south attest.\u201cLook at Youngstown, Ohio,\u201d said Phil Smith, a spokesman for the United Mine Workers of America. \u201cOur great concern is if government policy is going to move us away from coal the way government policy moved those communities away from steel, we don\u2019t want to end up the same way.\u201dLawmakers from coal regions savaged Mr. Obama\u2019s proposal.\u201cWhen rural America says President Obama has contempt for their lives and livelihoods, they mean decisions like today\u2019s announcement,\u201d said Senator John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican who has been a leading critic of the Obama administration\u2019s climate change policies. \u201cA moratorium on federal coal leasing effectively hands a pink slip to the thousands of people in Wyoming and across the West.\u201dAdministration officials did not exactly disagree.\u201cWe recognize many coal communities are in transition and struggling,\u201d Shaun Donovan, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said Friday in a conference call with reporters.The spending bill that Congress passed last month included $10 million to support new economic development programs in Appalachia, and Mr. Donovan said Mr. Obama\u2019s budget request for the 2017 fiscal year would include $1 billion over five years for programs to reclaim and redevelop retired coal mines for different economic activities.\u201cThe work we accomplished in December is a down payment on the assistance of coal communities,\u201d Mr. Donovan said.That is not a large group. There are only 64,000 direct jobs in the coal mining industry, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Administration officials appear determined to squeeze more money from coal companies mining on public land. In 2014, leases, royalties and other fees from mining coal on public land generated about $1.2 billion for the federal government.A 2015 analysis by the firm Headwaters Economics concluded that changes to the federal coal mining program could increase annual revenues by $139 million to $512 million.But coal miners say even if those totals materialized and went straight to the communities, they would not come close to meeting the needs of the thousands of coal miners who could face unemployment in the coming decades.\u201cThe magnitude of the problem is tremendous,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cThe proposals that are on the table are a drop in the bucket.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018We Will Not Apologize\u2019: Chronicling the Defiant Women of India", "Date": "2016-01-30", "News": "Supported byEight months ago, on one of my first visits to the village of Peepli Khera, India, I saw a scene that captivated me, the way a character in a novel can sometimes captivate me.I was writing an article about a village that had bitterly split over the question of whether women should be allowed to work in factories. Seven women who refused to resign from factory jobs had been made outcasts. I had been sitting with their neighbors, who were passing on terrible rumors about the women. I was taking notes.As this was happening, one of the outcast women, Geeta, strode into the middle of the circle with her chin up, fiercely. She raked over the neighbors with her eyes, then turned to me and said, loud enough for the whole village to hear, \u201cWe will not apologize.\u201dI had been in the village long enough to recognize the powerful force of collective punishment; there were times when I was interviewing a woman about the factory dispute roiling the village and, midsentence, she would change her answer and begin to voice the opposite view, just because one of the village elders had walked into earshot.But Geeta, the leader of the band of outcasts, was not afraid. I could not understand it.I realized quickly after my arrival that it would be virtually impossible to do my job. As an outsider, a white person from the United States, I created a frenzy every time I set foot in the village. (Some people decided I was an albino.)When I arrived to do interviews, children would be sent to fetch an older man, someone with the authority to speak to me. Someone would drag over a chair, an honor reserved for dignitaries or bureaucrats. And those I wanted to speak with, the women, would slide down onto the ground, which was the only place they could sit when older men were present, or disappear into the dark interior spaces where they did their chores. It was like trying to interview a ball of mercury.I found myself more interested in the reverse of that story: What kept the women inside in the first place? How did women spend their lives?At this point I delved into a world of shocking statistics. Despite India\u2019s prolonged economic expansion, the percentage of women in the work force remains dismally low \u2014 lower than in any country in the G-20 other than Saudi Arabia \u2014 and it is dropping. More than 70 percent of women say they have to ask permission from a parent, husband or in-law if they want to leave home to visit a health center or to see a friend in the neighborhood.Peepli Khera seemed like a good place to learn why this state of affairs had persisted. Life there was being rearranged in tangible ways by economic growth \u2014 specifically, a booming buffalo meat export industry. Last summer, the increase in female employment in the village had erupted into a raw power struggle, with the conservative male caste leaders demanding that the women resign from their jobs. I thought we \u2014 the photographer, Andrea Bruce; the interpreter, Ravi Mishra; and I \u2014 would merely plant ourselves there and watch them duke it out.This was easier said than done. In the end we made nine reporting trips to the village, staying until late at night \u2014 when the whiskey kicked in \u2014 and arriving before dawn. We collected firewood with the women, accompanied them as they went looking for work, and tagged along on court dates. We spent so much time in the village that the people there began to regard us with sincere pity.Then they began to ignore us. This is when the work began to bear fruit. We became professional eavesdroppers. Four months into our reporting, we were in the village for a series of tense, clamorous late-night meetings, in which the elders grudgingly decreed that the women could return to work.That night, the headman, Roshan, pushed us out of the village with his hands pressed against our backs; later he admitted that he had done so because he did not want us to witness violence. We returned to New Delhi and almost immediately learned that a large group of villagers had assaulted Geeta and her friends, also leaving her husband badly injured. We returned to find our subjects utterly changed \u2014 unhurt for the most part, but humiliated and shrunken. One teenage girl never forgave us for failing to protect her.In real life, stories do not have crisp endings, and the battle of Peepli Khera was no different: When we returned this month, it looked as though Geeta and her friends had gotten much of what they had wanted. They had held on to their jobs and avoided begging for forgiveness or paying a fine.Roshan was very sick, with what seemed to be tuberculosis, and carried out long, expletive-laced conversations with the goddess Kali over his magic necklace. \u201cHow are you coming? Are you coming on a horse cart? Are you coming on the wind?\u201d he said to the goddess, then paused to wait for her response. After a moment had passed, he remarked, \u201cThey can go to hell.\u201dGeeta, meanwhile, is rebuilding her house a full story above street level so that she can look out of her windows and over her neighbors\u2019 roofs. I started to explain that the article was going to appear in the newspaper, but she was busy collecting a debt for the local women\u2019s lending collective and had no time talk.\u201cI\u2019ll say to her face, bring her in front of me and I\u2019ll say it to her face \u2014 two months have passed and she will have to give the money up,\u201d she was snapping into her cellphone. She waved goodbye as we made our way down the dark lane \u2014 every inch the cheerful, ruthless village power broker. That is the last image I had of her.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Looking for Signs That Apple\u2019s Runaway Growth Is Waning", "Date": "2016-01-24", "News": "Supported byAlready, some investors have begun to treat Apple in a new way: as a \u201cvalue\u201d stock, a label typically attached to companies that generate predictable business results or a reliable dividend, rather than ones that deliver runaway revenue growth. Value stocks often command much lower valuations than growth stocks.\u201cPeople were in love with Apple because hits like the iPod and iPhone created phenomenal growth,\u201d said Ernesto Ramos, a fund manager at BMO Global Asset Management, which manages $18 billion and counts Apple as its largest holding. \u201cAs investors shifted their minds around the fact that it\u2019s no longer going to deliver the same sort of huge growth over the next five years, the stock became a value play.\u201dMr. Ramos says his firm still owns Apple in some of its growth funds, but began including the stock in value funds in mid-2013.Switching from being a growth stock to being a value stock can also be a long and painful process. Growth investors need to sell a company\u2019s shares and drive down the price until it is low enough to tempt value investors, who buy stocks they think are cheap compared with the intrinsic value of the company. In the tech industry, a shift from growth to value also often signals to investors that a company is facing newer competitors with more innovative products, raising the question of how relevant the company can remain.\u201cInvestors don\u2019t like to see the words tech and value combined because when growth slows at a tech company, it usually means that something essentially is not working,\u201d said Angelo Zino, a senior analyst at the research firm S&P Capital IQ.A spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment.Any change would have repercussions beyond Apple because its soaring performance in recent years helped lift the broader market. If Apple shares were removed from the equation, the performance of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index in five of the last seven years would drop by about 1 percentage point, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices. In 2014, for instance, the index rose 13.7 percent with Apple and 12.9 percent without Apple.The Apple effect is even more pronounced when technology names are isolated. For tech stocks on the S.&P. 500 as a group, annual gain in 2009 declined by 6 percentage points when Apple shares were not included, dropping to 56 percent from 62 percent.The effect was more muted last year as Apple\u2019s growth decelerated, according to the data.Investors have turned to Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet, which owns Google \u2014 collectively referred to as the FANG stocks \u2014 for growth. Those companies are each expected to show annual revenue gains of 23 to 40 percent for the last three months of 2015, while Apple is projected to deliver 3 percent revenue growth, according to Bloomberg data.Mr. Ramos says companies like Amazon have bigger growth potential for his fund than Apple, though he plans to continue owning Apple shares. \u201cAmazon will see about 20 percent revenue growth, and earnings per share are expected to jump considerably,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a very strong growth story.\u201dApple shares have already been buffeted in recent months because of worries about the slowing economy in China, which the company counts as one of its largest markets. Half a dozen companies that provide parts for the iPhone also blamed weak demand from Apple for lower-than-expected earnings, causing worries about the company\u2019s sales trajectory.\u201cIf you wanted to outperform the market, the FANG stocks did better,\u201d said Jonathan Krinsky, an analyst at MKM Partners, though he added that Apple remained a must-watch stock because it composed such a large part of many stock indexes.Investors may still someday reanoint Apple as a growth stock, especially if the company can create a best-selling new product that drives up its sales rate. Wall Street analysts cite Microsoft as an example of a business that lost steam and then made the adjustments necessary to deliver strong revenue growth again.Apple has been reclassified as a value stock before. FTSE Russell, which makes several closely followed stock indexes, found in 2013 that Apple no longer met its criteria to be treated purely as a growth stock. Some of the company\u2019s enormous market capitalization was reallocated to the Russell Value Index, as well as being in the Russell Growth Index. A year later, when the company\u2019s sales had risen strongly with the introduction of the iPhone 6, FTSE Russell placed Apple solely back in the growth index.Tom Goodwin, FTSE Russell\u2019s senior research director, said that stock price, sales growth and analyst expectations determine whether a company is placed in the growth or value index, or in both. About a third of the stocks that Russell tracks are included in both indexes, he said.But until Apple reveals another hit or shows a significant pickup in iPhone sales growth, Apple should be viewed as a value-oriented name, Mr. Zino said.\u201cHistorically Apple was the name to own if you wanted to outperform the market,\u201d he said. \u201cNow there are other places to look.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Minutes Show Some Concern on Economic Outlook", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byOfficials are focused on the persistence of sluggish inflation. While rising prices are unpopular, central bankers see benefits in moderate inflation.For some of those officials, the decision to raise rates was a \u201cclose call,\u201d the meeting account said. It added that \u201cmany participants remained concerned about the downside risks attending the outlook for inflation.\u201d And it described general agreement among the 17 officials who make up the Fed\u2019s policy-making body, the Federal Open Market Committee, to keep a close eye on prices.Fed officials forecast in December that they were likely to raise rates by one percentage point in 2016, most likely in four quarter-point increments. Referring to that prediction in an interview on CNBC Wednesday, Stanley Fischer, the Fed\u2019s vice chairman, said that \u201cthose numbers are in the ballpark.\u201dNot everybody is necessarily in line with that thinking, though. The meeting account, released after a standard three-week delay, did not address the issue directly, but its description of the internal debate underscored differences on the timing and frequency of future moves.In particular, it raised the question of how much further Fed officials are willing to raise rates without clear evidence the pace of inflation is also rising.Most Wall Street analysts predict the Fed will not raise rates at its next meeting, in late January, but they generally expect the Fed to raise its benchmark rate at the following meeting, in March.Laura Rosner, an economist at BNP Paribas, said the minutes provided less information than she expected about the Fed\u2019s plans, but she still put the odds of a March increase at 80 percent. She said she did not expect the questions about inflation to be resolved by then, but she wrote on Wednesday that \u201cinflation data released leading up to the March meeting are unlikely to increase worries.\u201d Ms. Yellen and her allies have already demonstrated they are willing to raise rates despite the uncertainty.Other analysts, however, said they were surprised by the Fed\u2019s emphasis on its inflation concerns.\u201cGiven all their worries about inflation, it\u2019s a wonder they even hiked at all,\u201d wrote Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase. \u201cAbsent from this discussion was any sense that further tightening in the labor market would bolster their confidence in the inflation outlook. Instead, they wanted proof: not only expected progress, but also \u2018actual\u2019 progress on their inflation objective.\u201dMr. Feroli said a March raise now depended, in his judgment, on data showing increased inflation.The minutes described Fed officials as optimistic that the economy would continue its steady, but slow, growth this year. They generally predicted the strength of the domestic economy, fueled by increased consumer spending, would outweigh the weakness of the global economy, which has limited foreign demand for American products.They also expected growth to be strong enough to drive continued improvement in labor market conditions \u2014 fewer people without jobs, fewer people in jobs that they do not like and, perhaps most important, more workers able to obtain raises.As employment increases and wages rise, the Fed expects inflation to rise more quickly, in keeping with a longstanding pattern. A majority of Fed officials, led by Ms. Yellen, view this pattern as sufficiently reliable that they decided to start raising rates before it actually happened.\u201cNearly all participants were now reasonably confident that inflation would move back to 2 percent over the medium term,\u201d the minutes said. And because the influence of monetary policy is gradual, they worried that waiting to raise rates would risk driving economic growth to unsustainable heights or fostering a speculative bubble.The Fed, however, has repeatedly forecast that inflation would rise, and it has repeatedly been wrong. Some officials are concerned the central bank is once again overestimating the economy.Lael Brainard, a Fed governor, has argued that her colleagues are underestimating the potential deflationary impact of global economic weakness. The minutes, describing this view, said a couple of officials \u201cworried that a further strengthening of the labor market might not prove sufficient to offset the downward pressures from global disinflationary forces.\u201dThe Fed has taken comfort in the stability of inflation expectations, which show Americans have not changed their views about the likely level of future inflation. But that blanket has been fraying for some time. Measures of expectations derived from asset prices are far weaker than survey measures, and in recent months, some of the survey measures have also shown signs of declining.The minutes said several officials expressed \u201cunease\u201d about that decline, while others saw benign explanations, arguing that lower oil prices, for example, were exerting an influence that would soon fade once the energy market stabilized and began to rise.So far, that has not happened.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Drug Overdoses Propel Rise in Mortality Rates of Young Whites", "Date": "2016-01-16", "News": "Supported byDrug overdoses are driving up the death rate of young white adults in the United States to levels not seen since the end of the AIDS epidemic more than two decades ago \u2014 a turn of fortune that stands in sharp contrast to falling death rates for young blacks, a New York Times analysis of death certificates has found.The rising death rates for those young white adults, ages 25 to 34, make them the first generation since the Vietnam War years of the mid-1960s to experience higher death rates in early adulthood than the generation that preceded it.The Times analyzed nearly 60 million death certificates collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 1990 to 2014. It found death rates for non-Hispanic whites either rising or flattening for all the adult age groups under 65 \u2014 a trend that was particularly pronounced in women \u2014 even as medical advances sharply reduce deaths from traditional killers like heart disease. Death rates for blacks and most Hispanic groups continued to fall.While the death rate among young whites rose for every age group over the five years before 2014, it rose faster by any measure for the less educated, by 23 percent for those without a high school education, compared with only 4 percent for those with a college degree or more.The drug overdose numbers were stark. In 2014, the overdose death rate for whites ages 25 to 34 was five times its level in 1999, and the rate for 35- to 44-year-old whites tripled during that period. The numbers cover both illegal and prescription drugs.\u201cThat is startling,\u201d said Dr. Wilson Compton, the deputy director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. \u201cThose are tremendous increases.\u201dRising rates of overdose deaths and suicide appear to have erased the benefits from advances in medical treatment for most age groups of whites. Death rates for drug overdoses and suicides \u201care running counter to those of chronic diseases,\u201d like heart disease, said Ian Rockett, an epidemiologist at West Virginia University.In fact, graphs of the drug overdose deaths look like those of deaths from a new infectious disease, said Jonathan Skinner, a Dartmouth economist. \u201cIt is like an infection model, diffusing out and catching more and more people,\u201d he said.Yet overdose deaths for young adult blacks have edged up only slightly. Over all, the death rate for blacks has been steadily falling, largely driven by a decline in deaths from AIDS. The result is that a once yawning gap between death rates for blacks and whites has shrunk by two-thirds.\u201cThis is the smallest proportional and absolute gap in mortality between blacks and whites at these ages for more than a century,\u201d Dr. Skinner said. If the past decade\u2019s trends continue, even without any further progress in AIDS mortality, rates for blacks and whites will be equal in nine years, he said.There is a reason that blacks appear to have been spared the worst of the narcotic epidemic, said Dr. Andrew Kolodny, a drug abuse expert. Studies have found that doctors are much more reluctant to prescribe painkillers to minority patients, worrying that they might sell them or become addicted.\u201cThe answer is that racial stereotypes are protecting these patients from the addiction epidemic,\u201d said Dr. Kolodny, a senior scientist at the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University and chief medical officer for Phoenix House Foundation, a national drug and alcohol treatment company.Not many young people die of any cause. In 2014, there were about 29,000 deaths out of a population of about 25 million whites in the 25-to-34 age group. That number had steadily increased since 2004, rising by about 5,500 \u2014 about 24 percent \u2014 while the population of the group as a whole rose only 5 percent. In 2004, there were 2,888 deaths from overdoses in that group;\u00a0in 2014, the number totaled 7,558.Mortality rates, said Mark D. Hayward, a professor of sociology at the University of Texas at Austin, are one of the most sensitive measures of quality of life.By that measure, said Anne Case, a Princeton economist, \u201cthere\u2019s a real rumbling that bad things are coming down the pike.\u201d Dr. Case made the original observation with her husband, the Nobel laureate Angus Deaton, in a published paper that showed death rates for middle-aged whites rising in contrast to those in every other rich country.For young non-Hispanic whites, the death rate from accidental poisoning \u2014 which is mostly drug overdoses \u2014 rose to 30 per 100,000 from six over the years 1999 to 2014, and the suicide rate rose to 19.5 per 100,000 from 15, the Times analysis found. For non-Hispanic whites ages 35 to 44, the accidental poisoning rate rose to 29.9 from 9.6 in that period. And for non-Hispanic whites ages 45 to 54 \u2014 the group studied by Dr. Case and Dr. Deaton \u2014 the poisoning rate rose to 29.9 per 100,000 from 6.7 and the suicide rate rose to 26 per 100,000 from 16, the Times analysis foundDrug deaths have surged in nearly every U.S. county.But deaths from the traditional killers for which treatment has greatly improved over the past decade \u2014 heart disease, H.I.V. and cancer \u2014 went down.Drug abuse, of both illegal drugs like heroin and prescription painkillers, has become a part of the American political discourse as never before in this country, with some presidential candidates, including Jeb Bush and Carly Fiorina, telling stories of addiction in their own families.Sad stories abound.Maline Hairup died of a heroin overdose on Aug. 24, 2014. She was 38 and a Mormon, engaged to be married in the Salt Lake City Temple, near her home. Her religion taught her to spurn addictive substances \u2014 no alcohol, no caffeine. But that night, after years of taking prescription narcotics for chronic pain complicated by mental illness, she tried heroin, her sister Mindy Vincent said. Ms. Vincent believes it was the only time her sister used that drug.There are men like Steve Rummler, who lived in Minnesota and died of a heroin overdose at age 43, taking the drug after becoming addicted to OxyContin, which was initially prescribed for a back injury. \u201cHe didn\u2019t understand the risks,\u201d said his mother, Judy Rummler.Researchers are struggling to come up with an answer to the question of why whites in particular are doing so poorly. No one has a clear answer, but researchers repeatedly speculate that the nation is seeing a cohort of whites who are isolated and left out of the economy and society and who have gotten ready access to cheap heroin and to prescription narcotic drugs.\u201cThere are large numbers of people who never get established in the economy, who live outside family relationships and are on the edge of poverty,\u201d Dr. Hayward said. Many end up taking prescription narcotics, he added.\u201cPoverty and stress, for example, are risk factors for misuse of prescription narcotics,\u201d Dr. Hayward said.Eileen Crimmins, a professor of gerontology at the University of Southern California, said the causes of death in these younger people were largely social \u2014 \u201cviolence and drinking and taking drugs.\u201d Her research shows that social problems are concentrated in the lower education group.\u201cFor too many, and especially for too many women,\u201d she said, \u201cthey are not in stable relationships, they don\u2019t have jobs, they have children they can\u2019t feed and clothe, and they have no support network.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not medical care, it\u2019s life,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are people whose lives are so hard they break.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Progressive Way to End Corporate Taxes", "Date": "2016-01-12", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorWashington \u2014 JUST about every American chief executive has the same dream: to get out from under the corporate income tax. For many, that means lobbying Congress to change the tax code. But for a growing number, it also involves increasingly creative \u2014 and successful \u2014 tricks to avoid their liability.The latest fad is inversion. Over the last few years, some of the country\u2019s largest companies have arranged to be taken over by smaller companies, conveniently headquartered in the Bahamas or some other tax haven. A company then has to pay tax only in the tax haven; it escapes American corporate income taxes altogether. For example, Pfizer, the pharmaceutical company, is being taken over by a much smaller company with headquarters in low-tax Ireland.Though the United States has the highest statutory corporate income tax in the developed world, write-offs and loopholes have eroded the government\u2019s take for decades. Corporate income taxes were just 1.9 percent of gross domestic product in 2014. That is down from an average of 2.6 percent in the 1970s, even though profits are near a postwar high as a share of national income.The Obama administration is trying to crack down on inversions, but it\u2019s a losing battle. Other tricks will be found. Which leaves us with two paths forward. If we get less money from corporations, we have to make up the shortfall from other sources of revenue. Or we can come up with a radically new approach to corporate taxation.The tax avoidance game is an enormous waste of resources and energy. We would like to see Pfizer focused on developing better drugs, not figuring out how to lessen its tax liability. The corporate sector as a whole devotes an enormous amount of money and brainpower to tax gaming, which contributes zero to the economy. Many of the financial wizards designing these schemes get very rich in the process, making tax gaming a factor in income inequality.For these reasons we should be looking for better ways to extract a share of corporate profit for public uses. Fortunately, there is an old idea that could do the job.Suppose that, instead of taxing corporate profits, we required companies to turn over an amount of stock, in the form of nonvoting shares, to the government. We can fight over the percentage later (we\u2019d want to match what we ideally get from corporate income taxes now, so presumably between 17 and 35 percent). But first we can focus on the principle.The shares would be nontransferable, except in the case of mergers or buyouts, but they otherwise would be treated just like any other shares. If the company paid a dividend to its other stockholders, then it would pay the same per share dividend to the government. If it bought back 10 percent of its shares, then it would buy back 10 percent of the government\u2019s shares at the same price. In the event of a takeover, the buyer would have to pay the same per-share price to the government as it did to the holders of other shares.This way, there is no way for a corporation to escape its liability. A portion of whatever profit it makes will automatically go to the government. It also eliminates the enormous cost and waste associated with complying with or avoiding the corporate income tax (there would be some start-up and monitoring costs, of course, but nothing like what current enforcement requires). And federal revenues will go up, because companies will have incentive to do what is most profitable, not what minimizes their tax liability.If we currently had this system in place and Pfizer decided to move to Ireland, its buyer would have to purchase the government\u2019s stake at whatever price it paid for the rest of Pfizer\u2019s shares. Since we would presumably also require that foreign companies making a substantial portion of their profit in the United States grant shares, the Irish company would effectively still be paying taxes here as well.Ideally, replacing the income tax with stock issuance would be mandatory. But it could be done on an optional basis. We could give companies a choice of paying the current income tax or turning over the designated percentage of shares to the government. If we pick the right number, many companies will go with the share option. This both gets us much of the way there, but also makes it easier for the Internal Revenue Service to focus on the companies that didn\u2019t take the deal. They have told us with their actions that they think they can escape their tax liability.This isn\u2019t a new idea, per se: It\u2019s been a popular \u201cwhat if\u201d among academic economists for years. But no one has brought it into the light of policy discussions, because until recently, the corporate-tax system worked reasonably well. You don\u2019t have to be a committed left-winger to recognize that, increasingly, that\u2019s not the case.The switch from a corporate income tax to ownership of shares wouldn\u2019t be good news for the tax avoidance industry, or for leading tax-avoiding corporations. But it would be a huge gain for just about everyone else.Dean Baker is co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Star Wars,\u2019 and How a Force Helps the Federal Reserve", "Date": "2016-01-11", "News": "Supported byMoney IllusionThis is a story about \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens\u201d\u2026 and the Federal Reserve. Wait! Keep reading. Some cheap tricks are entertaining.The movie, as of Sunday, had collected more money from American audiences than any other film in American history. In less than a month, its domestic box office receipts have totaled $812 million.This is a record. It is also a great example of \u201cmoney illusion,\u201d the human tendency to take nominal prices more seriously than actual value.Yet the nominal record strikes people as more interesting and important than the inflation-adjusted rankings. When I tweeted about the real rankings earlier this week, several people responded that I was a party-pooping pedant. Disney, which released the movie, is celebrating; the media is trumpeting the news; and the hullabaloo is likely to draw even more people to see \u201cStar Wars\u201d because, after all, everyone loves a winner.This emphasis on nominal records is successful because people prefer to pretend the value of money is constant. Research suggests we don\u2019t even realize that we\u2019re doing it.In a 1997 study, two-thirds of respondents judged that a worker who got a 5 percent raise during a period of 4 percent inflation would be happier than a worker who got a 2 percent raise during a period of zero inflation.(Some economists refuse to believe that people are tricked by inflation, or at least that they err on a scale sufficient to affect economic patterns. These economists prefer to believe that people behave rationally, a belief that, in a wonderful instance of irony, happens itself to be irrational.)And now comes the part you\u2019ve been waiting for: The money illusion doesn\u2019t just help Hollywood. It also helps the Federal Reserve.Inflation also increases the Fed\u2019s ability to stimulate the economy by cutting borrowing costs. Let\u2019s say short-term interest rates are at 5 percent and inflation is at 2 percent when the economy falls off a cliff. If the Fed cuts rates to zero, while inflation remains at 2 percent, the cost of borrowing drops to negative 2 percent, increasing the impact of the stimulus.But on top of all of this, it turns out that the confusion caused by inflation \u2014 the money illusion \u2014 also has some important benefits. During economic downturns, businesses are often reluctant to cut wages, delaying necessary economic adjustments, because workers hate wage cuts. Inflation helps the medicine go down. Holding nominal wages steady, or raising wages more slowly than the pace of inflation, offers a more palatable route to gradually reducing the value of those wages.And, during good times, the money illusion helps to fuel what John Maynard Keynes memorably called the \u201canimal spirits.\u201d By inflating economic measures, it creates the appearance of greater prosperity, encouraging people to borrow more, spend more, risk more.It sends a clear message: Join the party, you must.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fears About China\u2019s Economy Fester at Davos", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "Supported byDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 At the World Economic Forum here, chief executives and investors are blaming China for a slump in global markets.Fears about the country\u2019s downshift, as its official growth slowed to a quarter-century low, have dominated high-level discussions, both during public debates and in smaller, private meetings.The financier George Soros said at a dinner on Wednesday night that a \u201chard landing is practically unavoidable,\u201d adding that China is the root of the current financial crisis.But behind the gloom and doom a more complex picture is emerging among the global elite in this Alpine ski resort. Some of it is coming from those who have lived or worked in China.China\u2019s most influential executives could be seen this week in Davos, including Zhang Xin, the chief executive of the real estate developer SOHO China; Ya-qin Zhang, the president of the search engine giant Baidu; Jiang Jianqing, the chairman of the Industrial and Commercial Bank; and Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba. These leaders have stepped in to argue for a more nuanced view on China.Some have defended China\u2019s potential for growth as Western participants voiced concerns and doubts. Neil Shen, a veteran venture capitalist and one of China\u2019s most successful entrepreneurs, told one panel discussion about the evolution of Chinese industry, that Chinese companies were already competing in their own right in industries like smartphone manufacturing.Within the arena of financial markets, Chinese and Western leaders alike argued that the fears demonstrated in rocky markets were overstated. Last week, stocks moved into bear market territory \u2014 which occurs when stocks are down more than 20 percent from a high \u2014 in large part on the news of China\u2019s disappointing 2015 growth domestic product figures.Yet many cited the larger concerns that remained over China\u2019s slowing economy and whether its government will manage its transition from an economy focused on industry and exports to one that derives most of its growth from consumption. And many worried that an unintended consequence of President Xi Jinping\u2019s anticorruption campaign would be continued disruption of the financial markets.Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, touched on these points during a debate at the start of the conference. China\u2019s biggest problem today was how its government communicated with the rest of the world, Ms. Lagarde said.\u201cI would say also that given those massive transitions that are undertaken pretty much at the same time and accepted as such, there is a communication issue,\u201d Ms. Lagarde said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s something that markets do not like.\u201dLast summer, unexpected actions by the Chinese government started a global sell-off in the markets. Some of those measures nearly brought the market to a standstill. At one point in July, a third of the stock market was frozen. Investors with big stakes in stocks were prohibited from selling those stakes. Hedge funds were raided and short-sellers investigated for what the government called \u201cmalicious\u201d activity, according to state media reports. The government even organized large-scale purchases of stocks by government-linked brokerages and investment funds to prop up the plunging market.Many of these interventionist actions in the market were \u201cthe exact replicas that many other countries, including the United States, have done in certain parts of their modern history,\u201d Gary D. Cohn, president of Goldman Sachs, said.\u201cThe communication is really what\u2019s important here; communicating what the Chinese market is going to be and sticking with that theory no matter how painful it is in the transition,\u201d Mr. Cohn added.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.Speaking at the same event, Fang Xinghai, the vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, told a packed room, \u201cWe are learning. We are doing it.\u201dThis message, however, was still lost on some of the more cynical China watchers.Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard economist who has long warned of a potential financial crisis in China, remained skeptical. \u201cThere is a big propaganda push to say everything is good, everything is fine.\u201dEarlier in the week he told attendees at the forum that China\u2019s large accumulation of government debt would one day be a shock to a financial system that \u201camplifies shocks.\u201dOthers with bearish views on China have kept their claws out. Jim S. Chanos, who once said China was \u201con a treadmill to hell,\u201d said he remained deeply concerned. His hedge fund, Kynikos Associates, estimated that China\u2019s nominal gross domestic growth in 2015 was 5 percent compared with 15 percent just five years earlier.\u201cChina\u2019s debt problems still lie ahead of it,\u201d Mr. Chanos said on Thursday, referring to concerns about the extent to which China\u2019s seeming economic growth is actually fueled by borrowing.As for Mr. Soros, he told an audience at the Panorama Restaurant in the Seehof Hotel in Davos this year that the Chinese had waited too long to properly address the transition of its growth model. Asked by a Bloomberg reporter if there was a risk of repeating 2008, Mr. Soros said the market was in a similar time of financial crisis.\u201cBut the source of the disequilibrium is different,\u201d Mr. Soros said, adding that in 2008, the main cause was the United States subprime crisis. \u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201cthe root cause is basically China.\u201dMichael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Mr. Obama is increasingly competing with the presidential candidates for public attention, even as he looks to burnish his legacy.\u201cRight now, I want people to remember how far we\u2019ve come,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThe reason I want to remind people is not because I\u2019m on the ticket, it\u2019s because I want America to have confidence in where we can go.\u201dHis message encapsulated an oft-repeated narrative of his tenure: that the country has risen from the grim early days when the economy was on the brink of a depression to the current period of job growth and recovery. Mr. Obama is likely to return to this theme often this year in an attempt to help write the history of his presidency, and to rebuke the Republicans who opposed his moves.\u201cWhen you hear people \u2014 I won\u2019t say who \u2014 but when you hear people claiming that America is in decline, they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about, they\u2019re peddling fiction during a political season,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThey\u2019ll just come up with stuff. They\u2019re racing to see who can talk down America the most.\u201dWhile the president did not mention any candidate by name or utter the word \u201cRepublicans,\u201d he said the critics were \u201cthe same folks who would have let this industry go under\u201d and had denounced the auto bailout as \u201cthe road to socialism.\u201dHe said that in a meeting at the White House on Tuesday, he told Karen Weaver, Flint\u2019s mayor, that \u201cwe are going to have her back, and all of the people of Flint\u2019s back, as they work their way through this terrible tragedy.\u201d In an interview with CBS News to be aired on Sunday, Mr. Obama called the crisis \u201cinexplicable and inexcusable,\u201d adding that \u201csometimes, we downplay the role that an effective government has to play in protecting public health.\u201d Mr. Obama did not visit Flint on Wednesday, although he declared an emergency there on Saturday, making about $5 million available to state and local authorities. His administration directed a federal health official to help coordinate the response.But Mr. Obama has resisted calls to declare a disaster in Flint \u2014 which would yield tens of millions of additional federal dollars \u2014 given that the crisis is not the result of a natural disaster.But even as he reveled in the successes of an industry that was on the brink of collapse when he took office, the president was looking toward the day when he will leave office.\u201cI already drive in a great American car, which we affectionately know as the Beast,\u201d Mr. Obama said, referring to the armored Cadillac limousine he uses. \u201cNext year, I\u2019ve got to give it up. I\u2019m saying goodbye to the Beast, so I figure that I\u2019ve got to do a little browsing now.\u201d\u201cWe should make sure that if folks lose their job, that the system works for them,\u201d he said, arguing that laid-off workers should receive retraining assistance in addition to unemployment insurance. Mr. Obama is also calling for wage insurance, which would allow workers who lose their jobs to receive subsidies if they take new jobs that pay less.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Follow Your Conscience Without Losing Your Shirt", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byInvesting can sometimes seem heartless. If whatever makes money is your mantra, you may find that you have put your cash into enterprises with which you fundamentally disagree.That is where so-called socially responsible \u2014 also known as environmental, social and governance, or E.S.G. \u2014 mutual funds come in. These funds have been around for years, but these days, more investors are committing money to them and more investment companies are rolling out offerings. EPFR Global in Cambridge, Mass., said funds and exchange-traded funds in the sector had increased assets under management sixfold since the beginning of 2008, though they still represent less than 1 percent of assets invested in stocks in the United States.Even the index funds in the niche are harder to parse than some conventional competitors inasmuch as they are based on more obscure indexes. Without digging into a fund\u2019s full list of holdings, which can number in the hundreds, investors may have difficulty knowing precisely what they are getting.\u201cThe sector is not as simple as it used to be,\u201d said David J. Kathman, a senior fund analyst at Morningstar. \u201cInstead of just excluding a few things, the idea is you want to own the best companies judged by positive E.S.G. criteria. So it\u2019s more nuanced, but it\u2019s also tougher to look at a portfolio and tell how socially responsible it is.\u201dAll Parnassus funds avoid investments in companies that derive significant revenue from making alcoholic beverages, tobacco products or weapons, from gambling or from business in Sudan. Yet even those strictures require qualification. \u201cWith certain things, like Sudan, there\u2019s zero tolerance,\u201d Mr. Ahlsten said. \u201cWith others, we have a 10 percent revenue threshold. Say you\u2019re Whole Foods, and you\u2019re just selling wine, not making it. You can still be in the portfolio.\u201dParnassus also assesses positive performance on dozens of environmental, social and governance measures \u2014 \u201cevery one of those levers boils down to risk management,\u201d Mr. Ahlsten said. Companies with strong environmental records, for example, should be less likely to run afoul of regulators, he said.Their approach created a template for the field: Decide what you disdain and shun it. Over time, the list of common no-nos grew to include things like adult entertainment and genetically modified organisms. Many fund managers \u2014 even those at Pax World \u2014 came to conclude that approach was too restrictive, thus they increasingly mix screening out a few companies with overweighting others based on financial, environmental, social and governance factors.\u201cWe still don\u2019t invest in weapons and tobacco,\u201d Mr. Keefe said. \u201cBut for the most part, we\u2019ve shifted to sustainable investing, which we define as fully integrating E.S.G. factors into portfolio construction.\u201dA diversity of approaches brings a wealth of choices for investors but also, potentially, bewilderment.Consider the opposing ways two social-fund specialists view General Electric. Mr. Alhsten of Parnassus won\u2019t invest because of what he calls \u201clegacy environmental issues.\u201d G.E., for example, only recently said it had completed the dredging of a stretch of the Hudson River that was polluted decades ago by two of its plants.In contrast, John H. Streur, chief executive of Calvert Investments in Bethesda, Md., says his company\u2019s analysts rate G.E. as a buy. \u201cThe business focus there is all about sustainability,\u201d he said. \u201cOur research says G.E. is doing a lot of important work on renewable energy and its nuclear exposure isn\u2019t what the public\u2019s impression of it is.\u201dEven as socially minded investors disagree about which companies count as exemplary citizens, their funds, as a group, tend to favor growth-oriented sectors of the market, like technology, over value-oriented ones, like energy and utilities.\u201cYou\u2019re getting a different set of exposures to the economy than you would with an S.&P. 500 index fund,\u201d said Dan D. diBartolomeo, president of Northfield Information Services, an investment analytics company in Boston. That is not necessarily bad for investors, Mr. diBartolomeo said. They should just understand that, when the energy sector sizzles, their fund might not keep up.A criticism long leveled against socially minded funds is that they can\u2019t, by their very construction, keep pace with the broader market. This reasoning says that if you limit the sorts of stocks you invest in, you limit your potential return and add to the riskiness of your investment.The KLD wasn\u2019t any riskier than the S.&P., Mr. diBartolomeo said. The average annual total return for the MSCI KLD from the end of 1991 to Nov. 30, 2015, was 9.4 percent, compared with 9.1 percent for the S.&P. 500 for the same period.Mr. diBartolomeo reconciles the findings with conventional investment wisdom by pointing out that not all constraints bind. \u201cIn real life, if I constrain myself from having five martinis, that\u2019s not going to hurt me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if I go from 500 to 400, that\u2019s still plenty of stocks to invest in.\u201dRodney Comegys, a principal in the investment management group at Vanguard, said a fund that barred so many different sorts of stocks might not work as a core holding for many people. Although managed passively, it is analogous to an active bet because its holdings have different characteristics from broad market indexes like the S.&P. 500, he said. Financial stocks, for example, account for about a quarter of the FTSE index but only 15 percent of the S.&P. (Only about 10 percent of the retirement plans Vanguard administers offer it as an option.)\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be perfect for everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a compromise because you don\u2019t believe a typical core holding is right for you.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It is a plan that tries to respect both the ecology and the economics of the region. The groups involved have remained actively engaged in implementing the plan.

They cornered one protester and started beating him.Thousands of police officers patrolled the streets of Cairo and public squares, and a crackdown by security forces leading up to Monday\u2019s anniversary saw civil society activists rounded up, art houses closed and the administrators of opposition Facebook pages detained.The efforts seemed unnecessary: Since 2013, tens of thousands of Egyptians have been jailed, including journalists and secular activists; the leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood is in exile or in prison; and many ordinary Egyptians say they are too weary, or fearful, to take to the streets again.Several people said that, after years of wrenching political turmoil, they were grateful for the stability that Mr. Sisi had brought. \u201cWe were sad about the destruction that was taking place,\u201d said Sawsan Hasan, a grandmother who traveled 140 miles from Minya, south of Cairo, to the capital with eight of her family members. \u201cThings are starting to get better.\u201dOther Egyptians in Tahrir Square noted the chaos shaking Arab countries like Syria and neighboring Libya, and railed against perceived Western meddling in Egypt. Several people accused President Obama of secretly supporting the Muslim Brotherhood \u2014 a claim that is frequently aired on Egyptian television.(Western human rights groups, for their part, say the Obama administration is too indulgent of Mr. Sisi, and the United States should use the $1.3 billion in annual aid to Egypt to encourage political reforms.)On the fringes of the Tahrir crowd, a small, quiet group had assembled not to celebrate or protest, but to commemorate the bitter disappointments of the 2011 uprising. \u201cI left my flag at home because the demands of the revolution have not been met,\u201d said a man who could only identify himself as Bakr before the police moved him along.Despite the government\u2019s anxiety, the anniversary on Monday passed largely without serious violence. Local news media reported that two people had been killed by security forces in a raid on an apartment in a Cairo. Across the country, police broke up several small protests, mostly led by the Muslim Brotherhood, and officials said they had defused a bomb in the port city of Alexandria.Five years after the protests that ended his three-decade long rule, Mr. Mubarak remained in his hospital room at the Maadi Military hospital in a Cairo suburb. The legal basis for his stay there is unclear, with him having completed a three-year prison sentence.Political analysts say Mr. Mubarak\u2019s release could embarrass Mr. Sisi, but the president\u2019s most immediate challenges are economic. Egypt\u2019s weak economy is suffering from inflation, high unemployment and a declining tourist sector crippled by attacks from Islamist insurgents.By midafternoon Monday in Tahrir Square, the police had decided that they had enough and, forming a human chain, they gently cleared the square by calling out in Arabic \u201cYalla\u201d \u2014 \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dAmina Ismail contributed reportingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For House Democrats, Support for Obama Agenda Came at a Cost", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byBut as Mr. Obama spoke at this year\u2019s retreat here Thursday, he stood before a smaller and less popular audience: 188 Democratic lawmakers in a minority caucus with virtually no chance of moving back into power in the November elections.In brief remarks to the members, Mr. Obama sought to buck them up, declaring himself proud of the work they have done together during his presidency and vowing to strive to cement their joint legacy.\u201cWe hold ourselves to higher standards\u201d than the Republicans, Mr. Obama said. \u201cIf we stay true to those principles, our party\u2019s not just going to have a good year, America is going to have a good year.\u201dMore than seven years into his presidency, Mr. Obama and House Democrats, led by the onetime speaker Nancy Pelosi, remain united against Republicans who have seized control of Congress. Last year, that partnership helped pass new top-line spending limits, block conservative social legislation and defend the nuclear deal with Iran.At the retreat, at the Hyatt Regency here, lawmakers presented Mr. Obama with a gift: a ceramic bowl with an inscription that said: \u201cWe got your back.\u201dThe allegiance, however, has come at a steep political cost. The much-diminished House Democratic caucus is no longer able to force through major legislation, as it did when Ms. Pelosi used her majority to help a new president stimulate the economy, overhaul health care and impose new rules on financial institutions. That has forced Mr. Obama to repeatedly assert his executive authority in the face of a sometimes dysfunctional Republican-led Congress.Some Democrats hold Mr. Obama responsible for that, saying their party\u2019s lawmakers took the blame for the president\u2019s aggressive and often unpopular agenda to revive the economy and adopt sweeping health care legislation in his first two years in office. Some say Mr. Obama showed indifference to the political circumstances of rank-and-file lawmakers and missed an opportunity to seize on the undercurrents of populism and anti-establishment sentiment that began coursing through the electorate after the partisan battle over health care.\u201cThe main Democrat nationally, and the only one who could be heard, was silent on the huge structural issues that more and more Americans were facing,\u201d said Stanley Greenberg, a veteran Democratic pollster who blames Mr. Obama for Democratic House losses in 2010 and 2014. \u201cHis silence on those things left the voters without much motivation to vote.\u201d\u201cWe will look at those two years as enduring,\u201d he said. But he said Mr. Obama\u2019s legacy would also include the political death of Ms. Pelosi\u2019s once-powerful majority. \u201cPart of his legacy is the off-year elections,\u201d he said.Administration officials reject that critique, noting the historic pattern of losses that a president\u2019s party often sustains in off-year elections and the eight House seats Democrats regained when Mr. Obama was on the ballot in 2012. They said Mr. Obama was a prolific fund-raiser and a frequent campaigner for Democratic candidates when asked; the president hosted 17 fund-raising events across the country in 2013 and 2014, they said.Some congressional Democrats said it was not enough \u2014 not necessarily because Mr. Obama could have done more but because there could never be enough fund-raising given the nature of modern political campaigns. \u201cIf the president had allocated 50 more of his days to raising money,\u201d Representative Brad Sherman, Democrat of California, said at a reception to mark the start of the retreat in Baltimore, \u201cwe would have more Democratic members here.\u201dIn a speech here, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. expressed optimism if the party draws sharp contrasts. \u201cI think we can win; I think the House we can win,\u201d Mr. Biden said.White House aides said they recognized the pressure lawmakers faced.\u201cEverybody can take pride in the very difficult and necessary votes that were taken in 2009 and 2010 to make sure the country got back on its feet,\u201d said David Simas, Mr. Obama\u2019s political director. \u201cPeople recognized at the time that they weren\u2019t the most popular votes they could take. But few people would look back and say that wasn\u2019t the right thing to do.\u201dMr. Simas said the president was committed to campaigning \u201cup and down the ticket\u201d for Democratic candidates. \u201cThat\u2019s what we are going to do,\u201d he said.White House officials also insist that the relationship between Mr. Obama and House Democrats has grown stronger over the years as Ms. Pelosi and the president have worked closely to counter the Republican agenda.Ms. Pelosi delivered the votes of a nearly unanimous Democratic caucus during budget negotiations in October, helping Mr. Obama clinch a spending deal. Ms. Pelosi personally led the effort to support Mr. Obama\u2019s Iran policy, delivering daily lists to the president of members he needed to pressure with a call.The House Democrats in 2015 also stood firm against Republican efforts to strike funding for Planned Parenthood, overturn the president\u2019s immigration executive actions and curb the Environmental Protection Agency.That cooperation will be important in the last year of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency if he hopes to make further progress. In an Oval Office meeting with Ms. Pelosi and Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the minority leader, on Tuesday, Mr. Obama plotted possible targets of opportunity.The three discussed approval of the president\u2019s Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and agreed to push bipartisan legislation to bail Puerto Rico out of bankruptcy. They also agreed to pursue a criminal justice overhaul, as well as efforts to cure cancer, confront the opioid epidemic and improve the provision of mental health services.But other parts of his agenda have had to be pared back, in part because of the losses in the House and the Senate.Congressional Democrats do not dispute that they have paid a political price for Mr. Obama\u2019s hardest-fought victories, especially passage of the Affordable Care Act, and an array of other legislation. But some Democrats said that Republicans, and their rhetoric, were a far greater factor than Mr. Obama in the current perception of House Democrats.Representative Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n of New Mexico, who is chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said Mr. Obama was working aggressively in support of Democratic candidates. \u201cThe president has helped out, and he is working hard,\u201d Mr. Luj\u00e1n said. An earlier version of this article and a capsule summary accompanying it misstated the number of Democrats in the House. There are 188, not 177.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York City", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "Supported byThe ShortlistWhence Manhattan\u2019s famous rectilinear grid \u2014 that \u201cold inconceivably bourgeois scheme of composition and distribution,\u201d as Henry James put it, that for two centuries has shaped city life so profoundly? Historians have answered this question in two ways. In one telling, the grid is the product of the republican revolution: In place of royal irregularity, New Yorkers substituted a democratic spatial order in which all blocks were equal. In the other, the grid is simply an engine for property development and speculation.Koeppel, a historian, offers a third possibility: The plan for the famous grid, announced in March 1811, was rather \u201can excuse for a plan, arrived at with little thinking and with time running out.\u201d Its origins lie in an earlier plan that divided the Common Lands of mid-Manhattan into five-acre parcels, cut by three broad north-south thoroughfares (the forerunners of Park, Fifth and Sixth Avenues) as well as 60-foot-wide east-west streets. A decade later, the State Legislature empowered a three-man commission to pre-empt private street development. But the commissioners were slow to engage in their work and fell back on the Common Lands grid. The plan, Koeppel argues, \u201cwas simply not something that had been deeply thought out.\u201dNone of this exactly contradicts the familiar tales of commercial ambition and republican predilection for order and equality. What Koeppel does instead is to give us the best account to date of the process by which an odd amalgamation of democracy and capitalism got written into New York\u2019s physical DNA.Poor John Lindsay. His first day as mayor, in 1966, the transit workers went on strike, bringing city life to a crawl. \u201cThis is a fun and exciting city even when it\u2019s a struck city,\u201d Lindsay claimed. The \u201cFun City\u201d tag would stick, but sardonically, conjuring up the variety of urban ills \u2014 municipal service disruptions, street crime, snarled traffic \u2014 that Lindsay couldn\u2019t seem to do much about. By the end of Lindsay\u2019s first term, plans for a civilian police review board and community control of schools had stoked a powerful white backlash.For a season, Deveney shows in this rollicking book, New York\u2019s upstart sports teams helped break this civic fever. Led by the hedonistic slinger Joe Namath, the Jets shocked the football world with their Super Bowl III upset of the Baltimore Colts in 1969. That autumn, the once-risible Mets won the World Series. The Knicks capped off one of the greatest sports seasons any city had ever enjoyed when they took the N.B.A. title the following spring. \u201cThe Jets, Mets and Knicks didn\u2019t fix New York,\u201d Deveney writes, \u201cbut for a stretch, at least, their successes .\u2008.\u2008. brought together a divided city in which residents seemed increasingly unable or unwilling to understand each other.\u201dThere is an interesting story to be written about the emergence of sports as big business in New York\u2019s late-20th-century transformation. One suspects that, like Lindsay\u2019s, it is a poignant one.\u201cA crow thieves; a fox cheats; a weasel outwits; a man diddles,\u201d Poe wrote. \u201cTo diddle is his destiny.\u201d But if the impulse to live well by means less than fair is perhaps universal, the social contexts within which these hustles and cons unfold are ever changing, offering up a mirror to the city.Hustlers and cons are \u201csage opportunists,\u201d the sociologists Williams and Milton write, \u201cbecause they are able to match their abilities exactly to the opportunities presented by the city\u2019s shifting economy.\u201d A handful of case studies show us where those opportunities lie: Otis sells pirated DVDs that otherwise would be out of his buyers\u2019 price range; Lee peddles water at busy intersections, believing \u201cthis is all there is for young men like him.\u201d If \u201cThe Con Men\u201d lacks the depth and focus of a work like Mitchell Duneier\u2019s \u201cSidewalk,\u201d it makes up part of the margin in breadth of coverage.\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to live in a world where you couldn\u2019t be conned,\u201d Williams and Milton note (quoting the illusionist Ricky Jay). But who would want to be a con? Williams and Milton, following up with their informants to see what they are doing now, were unable to track down a majority of them. But they did locate Lee, the water salesman, who now teaches modern dance at a city middle school.Alexiou begins this, the first full account of the Gowanus Canal\u2019s history, with Thomas Wolfe\u2019s ode to wafting scents of \u201cmelted glue, burned rubber, and smoldering rags, the odors of a boneyard horse, long dead, the incense of putrefying offal, the fragrance of deceased, decaying cats, old tomatoes, rotten cabbage, and prehistoric eggs.\u201d How did the residents of South Brooklyn stand it? Wolfe asked. \u201cWell, one gets used to it.\u201dBefore it was the Gowanus Canal, it was Gowanus Creek, a tidal estuary known for its oysters. In the mid-19th century, Brooklynites turned the quiet inlet into a bustling shipping canal \u2014 as well as a \u201cconduit for sewage and storm water.\u201d The Gowanus served as such into the mid-20th century, when the displacement of shipping by automotive transport cut deeply into its use. The nadir came in the mid-1960s when, for mysterious reasons, the Gowanus flushing tunnel \u2014 which pumped fresh water into the canal \u2014 broke down, rendering the canal entirely stagnant.By the end of the 20th century, mercifully, the city installed a new flushing tunnel, relieving the worst of the stench. (\u201cPrior to the flushing tunnel, a dead dog would just float back and forth with the tides between Third Street and Carroll for maybe a week,\u201d a man told The Times.) Alexiou ends with the fascinating struggle for control of the continuing cleanup effort. This is a loving and skillfully rendered portrait of an important and oddly charming part of New York.Mason B.

{"Headline": "Deregulating Corporate America", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported byEditorialIf you think Congress is hopelessly divided on party lines on every issue, think again. When it comes to regulating \u2014 more precisely, deregulating \u2014 corporate America, Republicans and Democrats are all too eager to find common ground.This week a bipartisan group of senators \u2014 four Republicans, three Democrats and one independent \u2014 is expected to introduce legislation that would slow and complicate the already laborious process by which federal regulations are issued and enforced.The winners would be big banks and big businesses. The losers would be ordinary Americans who would be deprived of timely and effective protection from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other bank regulators, as well as from agencies that oversee consumer product safety, nuclear safety, investor safeguards, workplace rights and a host of other issues and activities. These agencies are supposed to work independently, with Congress providing oversight. Under the legislation, however, Congress would actively interfere in the rule-making process.One provision would require that the Congressional Budget Office review and approve the costs and benefits of proposed rules. The C.B.O. has no particular expertise in regulation; its reviews could indefinitely delay the process. Besides, the rule-making process already allows for public comment on proposals as well as legal challenges to final rules.Another provision would establish a commission of political appointees to advise Congress on regulations that should be modified or repealed. That would undermine the authority of regulators because it would effectively create a political hit list. It\u2019s important to review regulations that are on the books \u2014 and regulatory agencies routinely do so. Such reviews are aimed not only at relieving unnecessary burdens but also at strengthening regulations where necessary. Much of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, for example, is devised to create or improve rules authorized before the financial crisis but never properly developed or enforced. A regulatory review commission whose aim is to curtail or end regulation would be a step backward.This is not what Americans need. Regulation is essential in today\u2019s complex economy, as demonstrated by the financial crisis and by a number of corporate failures \u2014 fatal ignition switches, poisoned food, environmental pollution, invasions of privacy. Proponents of deregulation invariably claim that regulation kills jobs, but lack of regulation has killed more jobs and people than regulation ever has.The Democrats behind the effort are Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Mark Warner of Virginia and Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, joined by Angus King Jr., an independent from Maine. The Republicans are Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Rob Portman of Ohio, James Lankford of Oklahoma and Roy Blunt of Missouri. The group is trying to recruit more co-sponsors, especially among Democrats.In an election year, it is tempting to take a tough line against regulation because it is an easy way to please corporate contributors. But an indiscriminate effort to delay and undermine the regulatory process is a public disservice, unworthy of support.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Will the Candidates Start Talking About the Economy?", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorSIDELINED by homeland security, foreign policy and immigration, the economy is about to become a major topic in the race for the White House. Since the start of the year we have seen precipitous drops in the stock market and oil prices, combined with the threat that a slowing global economy may drag the United States down with it.While political campaigns are rarely the best forum to achieve policy clarity, the spotlight this year\u2019s race will cast on economic issues will bring some needed debate about two pressing questions: Why is the United States still so economically insecure? And can we shore up that insecurity before the next downturn arrives?The economy has repeatedly failed to achieve the liftoff that it is capable of. Despite the creation of six million jobs in the last two years, wage growth has been anemic, inequality has worsened and too many Americans lack the agility to adapt to structural changes, including those driven by technological innovations.The success of the post-recession employment recovery and the uneven growth since then can be attributed to a single factor: After Congress\u2019s initial bailouts to stanch the bloodletting in 2008, the burden of economic policy making fell almost entirely on the Federal Reserve.Having succeeded in helping the United States and the rest of the world avert a multiyear depression in 2008-9, the Fed pivoted to using unconventional monetary measures to pursue broader objectives. It did so through a combination of zero interest rates and large-scale purchases of securities to repress market volatility and increase asset prices, hoping to encourage consumption and investment.This worked, to some extent. But it created a sizable wedge between artificially supported asset prices and rather sluggish fundamentals. And ultimately, these tools can buy time only until the political system delivers a broader policy response, which it hasn\u2019t.Now time is running out.Thanks to mounting internal contradictions and operational stress, central banks are increasingly unwilling (like the Federal Reserve) or unable (like the People\u2019s Bank of China, the Bank of Japan and, soon, the European Central Bank) to borrow financial returns from the future. As a result, financial volatility is rising.What follows is up to us. One road \u2014 where continued political dysfunction further sidelines a holistic policy response \u2014 could lead to recession. The other \u2014 a broadening policy response turbocharged by innovation and the productive deployment of corporate cash \u2014 could unleash high and inclusive growth.Assuming that the presidential season clarifies these choices, the campaign\u2019s winner will face another challenge next year: how to deal with a Congress that has failed to handle even its most basic economic functions. Given the outlook for both a shaky global economy and higher financial volatility, the new administration will need to find a way to get Congress to implement measures in four specific areas, some of which already command bipartisan support.The first covers long-overdue structural reforms. Guided by the administration, Congress needs to overhaul a tax system littered with anti-growth provisions, invest more in infrastructure, expand labor-market retraining and modernize our education system. The lack of such reforms, and the insecurity generated, is one main reason the private sector has held back from spending the enormous cash reserves on its balance sheets; encouraging that money to flow into productive activities, rather than share buybacks, would boost the economy.America also needs a more responsive fiscal policy. This means, above all, redirecting resources that essentially subsidize the better-off segments of society, including the excessively low taxation of carried interest and other budgetary measures to help reduce the economic drag that inequality creates through reduced consumer demand.Politicians must also act soon to avert the growing problem of student debt, a major obstacle for the incoming generation of workers. The government needs to increase the transparency of loan disclosures, enlarge steppingstone programs like community colleges, and make it easier for students to pay off their debt without sacrificing career opportunities.Finally, the United States needs to push for critical reforms in the global finance infrastructure. It took embarrassingly long for the world to agree on modest changes in the governance of the International Monetary Fund, largely because Congress was disengaged. The next steps should include further reallocation of voting power from Europe to developing economies, consistent with today\u2019s global economic realities.While I.M.F. reform might seem arcane, it could be vital to averting another global crisis \u2014 without changes, the fund\u2019s credibility will continue to be questioned, especially in the eyes of emerging economies, undermining global policy cooperation and increasing the risk of currency wars and other damaging coordination failures.There\u2019s little that is surprising about most of these items. What is surprising is that too few politicians, let alone presidential candidates, seem to grasp the need for them within the first year or so of the next administration. Even then, the risk of another recession will not be eliminated; that\u2019s the nature of business cycles. The point is to reduce the risk as much as possible, in the United States and abroad \u2014 and to lay the groundwork for high long-term and inclusive growth.Mohamed A.

{"Headline": "Stock Prices Sink in a Rising Ocean of Oil", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byThe oil glut \u2014 the unsold crude that is piling up around the world \u2014 is a quandary and a source of investor anxiety that once again rattled global markets on Friday.As prices have dropped, the amount of excess production has been cut in half over the last six months. About one million barrels of extra oil is now being dumped on the markets each day.But that means the glut is still continuing to grow, and it could take years to work through the crude that is being warehoused, poured into petroleum depots or loaded onto supertankers for storage at sea.The shakeout will be painful, taking an even bigger toll on companies, countries and investors.Global stocks sank sharply on Friday, as the price of oil slipped below $30 a barrel. The glut was at the heart of the tumult, as investors worried that the demand from China would drop and supplies from Iran would grow.A glut of crude oil on the markets is pushing the price of oil down to levels not seen since the global financial crisis.\u201cThe glut is the 800-pound gorilla in the room,\u201d said Steve McCoy, vice president for drilling contracts at Latshaw Drilling, an Oklahoma service company that prospered in recent years from the American shale boom. \u201cThe world simply produced too much, and now we have to use it up or many oil-producing countries and some oil companies may drown.\u201dJust a couple of years ago, producers and petro-states were making vast fortunes drilling and pumping relentlessly to fuel expanding middle classes in Asia, Latin America and Africa. But suddenly they are producing more than anyone needs at a time when China and other rapidly growing economies, once hungry for energy, are pulling back.The extra oil has sent the price of crude into a tailspin, down more than 70 percent over the last 18 months.That, in turn, has helped depress stock markets around the world, as investors worry about global growth. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is off around 8 percent in just the first two weeks of the year; European shares are down even more. Chinese stocks have dropped 20 percent from their December peak, putting the market in bear territory.\u201cWhat was once viewed as a gift is now viewed similarly to the gift of the monkey\u2019s paw,\u201d said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for Oil Price Information Service. \u201cGlobal financial damages trump the benefits of cheap oil at anything under $30 a barrel.\u201dIt could get worse.The nuclear deal with Iran should allow the country to start exporting far more oil, once sanctions are lifted, potentially in a matter of days. Iran could add as much as 500,000 barrels a day to the global markets.Tentative progress in negotiations between warring factions in Libya, battling for control of oil and export terminals, could unleash another flood. And Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq continue to maintain a pumping frenzy to grab Asian markets.The United States is slowly cutting production. Major oil companies have dropped their rig count, and dozens of small businesses have gone bankrupt. But the industry cannot simply flip the switch on big projects, like deepwater production projects in the Gulf of Mexico, that require companies to keep pumping to cover their costs. Smaller companies have to keep producing from shale fields, even at a loss, to keep paying their lenders.\u201cSheikhs and shale caused this,\u201d said Scott Tinker, director of the Bureau of Economic Geology at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cThey are both producing more oil. That is the fundamental driver.\u201dA million to two million barrels a day of excess production may not seem like much in a world market that requires 94 million barrels daily. But the amount of daily oversupply in recent months is the largest since oil prices collapsed in the late 1990s.Back then, the price dropped below $10 a barrel, on an inflation-adjusted basis. Oil from new fields flooded the market just as the Asian financial crisis was roiling emerging markets.Most of the glut today can be explained by a near doubling of American domestic oil production since 2008. The shale boom added roughly three million barrels a day to the global market.In the past, when markets got out of kilter, Saudi Arabia and its partners in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries slashed production to support prices. But this time, the Saudis and other big producers increased output to try to preserve market share and undercut higher-cost competitors like those drilling in the shale fields of Texas and North Dakota.Even as prices slipped through 2015, global production climbed. The Energy Department projects that overall inventories will rise by an additional 700,000 barrels a day in 2016.The balance of oil supply and demand can swing abruptly, along with price, as they did in the early 2000s. Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.At the time, the Chinese and other emerging-market economies went into overdrive just as production in the United States and Mexico was declining and big producers like Venezuela and Nigeria were facing political turbulence. By mid-2008, the price of oil had risen to nearly $150 a barrel.That is the possibility that many analysts are now contemplating, even if not at a price that high. An unexpected drop in supply or rise in demand could create a floor for prices, ease the glut and eventually lead to a slow recovery.On the supply side, if tensions erupting between Saudi Arabia and Iran lead to armed conflict or an insurrection, the excess production could quickly disappear.The boom in Iraqi oil production faces multiple threats, including Islamic State terrorism. The government is falling behind in its payments to international oil companies, water is running low for pumping to revive aging oil fields, and northern Kurdish fields are short on pipelines.Low oil prices have already constrained exploration and production investment around the world.American oil producers are in retreat; companies have decommissioned more than 60 percent of their rigs in the last year or so. Since peaking at 9.7 million barrels a day early last year, domestic oil production has fallen by more than half a million barrels. Rosneft, Lukoil and Western companies are also dropping big projects in Russia.Some analysts also say that the concerns about slowing demand in emerging markets, a byproduct of the economic weakness, are overblown. China and India, for example, are working hard to build up enormous strategic reserves, which adds to the demand.RBC Capital Markets, a division of Royal Bank of Canada, estimates that China\u2019s needs will continue to grow as it places an additional 65 million to 70 million barrels in its reserves this year. India began amassing a strategic reserve only last year, and it has a goal of storing roughly 330 million barrels over the next several years.\u201cIncreased demand can certainly help,\u201d said Michael Tran, an RBC commodity strategist. \u201cBut the growing supply glut is what ultimately got us below $30-a-barrel oil, and significant supply cuts are what will ultimately have to dig us out.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Video Review: Chevy Volt Impresses With Tech, Design and Driving Pleasure", "Date": "2016-01-21", "News": "Supported byDrivenTHE concept of the first Chevrolet Volt was simple \u2014 drive 40 miles or so on battery power alone and then continue the journey with a gas-powered generator. In short, driving to Duluth could be a drop-of-the-hat decision. From Anchorage.Numbers are dry, but the new Volt\u2019s are notable. Starting at $33,995 (before a $7,500 federal tax credit) it easily costs $1,000 less than its predecessor and drops some 350 pounds. The government-rated battery range of 53 miles is 25 percent more efficient, rated at 106 miles per gallon equivalent. It\u2019s more fuel-efficient too, rated at 42 m.p.g. on standard grade gas.The bulk of this article could be stuffed with details of the all-new Voltec system, from a larger, lighter four-cylinder to dual electric motors using far less rare earth material and a smaller, more powerful lithium-ion battery spanning the car\u2019s spine. But the most impressive attribute of the new Volt is this: It looks and operates like a normal car.Luddites could simply plug it in at night (my grandmother did that in northern Minnesota with her Ford LTD during the winter) and, other than its eerie silence, they may never care (or know) that it\u2019s a plug-in hybrid. No funky transmission joystick, no fear of being marooned. Chevy even got rid of the cabin\u2019s Tomorrowland touch panel for honest-to-goodness buttons and knobs.With 149 horsepower and 294 pound-feet of torque, the Volt feels fast, reaching 30 miles an hour in about 2.5 seconds. Velocity is less urgent afterward, with 60 m.p.h. arriving in 8.5 seconds, half a second faster than the first-generation Volt. It\u2019s hardly a Tesla Model S in Ludicrous mode.Volt comfortably snakes through turns with measurable road feel. The low-mounted battery improves the center of gravity, though its substantial mass is felt in hard cornering. Coasting and braking send voltage back to the pack. Gifted from the Cadillac ELR, a paddle on the back of the steering wheel activates aggressive power regeneration. When the car is driven thoughtfully, the brake pedal is seldom used.Spent batteries charge in 13 hours on 110-volt current or in four and a half hours on 220 volts. Temperatures in the 30s during my week with the Volt reduced the performance of the pack to 45 miles in city slogging, 40 at freeway speeds. My guess on gas-only fuel economy is 40 miles a gallon.Chevy\u2019s attractive dual cockpit interior is made of hard but quality plastics. The Premier model, tested at $40,225 (again, before tax credits), offers lane keep assist, low-speed automatic braking and a heated steering wheel \u2014 features found only on luxury cars five years ago. Volt helps with the chores, too, being a practical hatchback.Tempering the most-excellent Volt experience is a sparsely trimmed back seat that remains snug. Cheap gasoline doesn\u2019t quite lure shoppers into the showrooms. But when the Volt becomes available nationwide this spring, take a test drive. It is fun to drive and also offers a painless way to (mostly) reduce fossil fuel use.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "President Obama to Focus on American Potential in 2016", "Date": "2016-01-11", "News": "Supported byOn WashingtonAware of the limited options that exist as he and the Republican-led Congress prepare to endure one last year together, Mr. Obama will try to use his speech to reach beyond the traditional recitation of legislative initiatives \u2014 measures likely to fail \u2014 to talk about the nation\u2019s long-term challenges and how taking them on can benefit both the American economy and the nation\u2019s psyche.His top advisers say he will also emphasize the need to bridge the political divisions that have thrown the House and Senate into dysfunction and to build upon the signs of life that Congress exhibited late last year in approving a compromise budget deal along with major transportation and education legislation.And Denis McDonough, the White House chief of staff, said the president would offer an optimistic contrast to the darker vision of an America in decline that is currently being offered by Republican presidential candidates in Iowa and New Hampshire. The president, Mr. McDonough said in an interview, will instead focus on American potential and \u201cwhat the country can do when we get everybody engaged in the system, everybody engaged in the democracy.\u201dTo that end, Mr. Obama, hoping to strike an inspirational tone reminiscent of his 2008 campaign and the 2004 keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention that established him as a rising star, is expected to urge Americans to join in reinvigorating the political system to find consensus solutions. Broader civic engagement, Mr. McDonough said, can dilute the mounting influence of big donors and special interests.A call by Mr. Obama for Americans to seek a path out of the partisan swamp is in many ways an admission that his own oft-made pledge to change the tone in Washington has not been realized. It is also a recognition that while he is speaking to the nation, the address represents a last chance for the president to make his case directly to lawmakers from both parties who will be gathered before him in the House chamber.Seated behind Mr. Obama for the first time will be a man who will have a lot to say about any future progress in Washington \u2014 Speaker Paul D. Ryan. Mr. Ryan will make his debut in the traditional tableau with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a pairing of one man easing out of elected public life after more than four decades and another one coming into his own as a national figure.Here is a look back at some of the issues President Obama addressed in his annual speeches before a joint session of Congress and the actions, or inaction, that followed in those areas.Mr. Ryan does not seem likely to be moved no matter how soaring Mr. Obama\u2019s words are. Asked last week what he would advise Mr. Obama to say, the speaker essentially urged the president to apologize for his tenure.\u201cI take it all back,\u201d Mr. Ryan offered as to what he would like to hear from Mr. Obama. \u201cHealth care was wrong. We shouldn\u2019t have done Dodd-Frank. I want to actually lower tax rates, clear out crony capitalism and restore the Constitution to its rightful place in American life.\u201dThat view about sums up Mr. Obama\u2019s relationship with the Republicans who now rule Capitol Hill \u2014 fundamental disagreement virtually across the board.Mr. Obama and his Democratic allies believe that Republicans have stubbornly dug in against the administration for nearly eight years, out of animosity for the president and to protect more affluent Americans at the expense of the working class. Republicans believe that an inexperienced president, frustrated and stymied by Congress, has engaged in a monumental abuse of executive power on immigration, health care and regulatory matters while bungling foreign policy.Given that yawning divide, Mr. Obama will hardly be able to fix that relationship in one speech. His immediate goal seems to be to set the table for the 2016 elections and to remind both the American public and Congress what his goals were originally and what it will take to achieve them even after he is gone.But Mr. Obama and his advisers are not writing off the year when it comes to business on Capitol Hill. The details of the administration\u2019s legislative agenda will be contained in the budget proposal due next month, and White House officials would like to see some progress.\u201cI think last year was important in terms of re-establishing some muscle memory as to how the institution works,\u201d said Mr. McDonough, referring to the year-end achievements. \u201cWe think it would be important for Congress to do some other things.\u201dAmong them, he said, was approving a new authorization for the use of military force in the Middle East, making Congress more of a partner in the administration\u2019s strategy against the Islamic State. The president would also like to sign into law a major criminal justice overhaul that would cut mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent criminal offenders. To underline that priority, he has invited as a guest at the speech a former prison inmate from Arizona who started a nonprofit organization to help others readjust to society after time behind bars.Both initiatives would be significant achievements in the final year of what has been a tortured relationship between the Obama White House and Republicans in Congress. But any real repair work will have to wait until Mr. Obama has left office.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Elections Have Consequences", "Date": "2016-01-04", "News": "Supported byAnd what these tables show is that elections really do have consequences.You might think that this is obvious. But on the left, in particular, there are some people who, disappointed by the limits of what President Obama has accomplished, minimize the differences between the parties. Whoever the next president is, they assert \u2014 or at least, whoever it is if it\u2019s not Bernie Sanders \u2014 things will remain pretty much the same, with the wealthy continuing to dominate the scene. And it\u2019s true that if you were expecting Mr. Obama to preside over a complete transformation of America\u2019s political and economic scene, what he\u2019s actually achieved can seem like a big letdown.But the truth is that Mr. Obama\u2019s election in 2008 and re-election in 2012 had some real, quantifiable consequences. Which brings me to those I.R.S. tables.For one of the important consequences of the 2012 election was that Mr. Obama was able to go through with a significant rise in taxes on high incomes. Partly this was achieved by allowing the upper end of the Bush tax cuts to expire; there were also new taxes on high incomes passed along with the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare.So the 2012 election had major consequences. America would look very different today if it had gone the other way.In other words, the 2012 election didn\u2019t just allow progressives to achieve some important goals. It also gave them an opportunity to show that achieving these goals is feasible. No, asking the rich to pay somewhat more in taxes while helping the less fortunate won\u2019t destroy the economy.So now we\u2019re heading for another presidential election. And once again the stakes are high. Whoever the Republicans nominate will be committed to destroying Obamacare and slashing taxes on the wealthy \u2014 in fact, the current G.O.P. tax-cut plans make the Bush cuts look puny. Whoever the Democrats nominate will, first and foremost, be committed to defending the achievements of the past seven years.The bottom line is that presidential elections matter, a lot, even if the people on the ballot aren\u2019t as fiery as you might like. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Federal Reserve Started 2010 With Hope, Then Fear and Fitful Activism", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byBy the time the year ended, the Fed was pumping a further $75 billion a month into the financial system by buying bonds, aiming to keep the young expansion from falling apart. And though they did not know it at the time, Fed officials were on the path toward another half-decade of zero interest rates and creating trillions of dollars from thin air.During the eight meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee that year, plus two unscheduled emergency conference calls, Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and his colleagues concluded that the economy was in greater peril than it had seemed at the start of the year. They agreed upon fresh actions intended to guard against a new recession or falling into a deflationary trap.Janet L. Yellen, the current chairwoman who served in two senior roles in 2010, emerged as a major ally of Mr. Bernanke and an early voice in favor of more activism.\u201cGiven the tenuous state of business and consumer confidence, I consider it critical at this juncture that this committee not be perceived as falling behind the curve, being unwilling to act, or being out of touch with the mounting concerns we see in the markets and on Main Street,\u201d Ms. Yellen, then the president of the San Francisco Fed, said at the Aug. 10 policy meeting. \u201cThe data show a considerable slowing of the economy during the summer, and the near-term outlook has been marked down appreciably.\u201dThe start of QE2 \u2014 Mr. Bernanke hated that term, he made clear in one meeting, as he unsuccessfully urged his colleagues to refer to the program by what as he viewed as the more technically precise \u201clarge-scale asset purchases\u201d \u2014 was a controversial move inside and outside the Fed.After the decision, which coincided with an election that swept a Republican Congress skeptical of government intervention into power, the Fed faced sharp criticism from conservative lawmakers and from Germany and Brazil, among other countries. Objections included the ways bond buying could distort financial markets and foreign exchange prices, and the burden the Fed was taking on itself to right an economy with problems that went deeper than insufficiently easy monetary policy.Transcripts from Federal Reserve meetings in 2010 show, in real time, how the central bank under chairman Ben S. Bernanke came to the conclusion that the economy was in greater peril than it had initially seemed.What was less well understood at the time, but is made plain by the new transcripts, is how the internal debate at the Fed resembled the external one, with many of the objections outsiders raised to the Fed\u2019s monetary activism also articulated behind closed doors at the central bank\u2019s Washington headquarters.\u201cMy views are increasingly out of step with the views of most people around this table,\u201d Kevin M. Warsh, a Fed governor who was a close adviser to Mr. Bernanke on financial market matters, told his fellow policy makers at the November meeting. \u201cThe path that you\u2019re leading us to, Mr. Chairman, is not my preferred path forward,\u201d he continued. \u201cI think we are removing much of the burden from those that could actually help reach these objectives, particular the growth and employment objectives, and we are putting that onus strangely on ourselves rather than letting it rest where it should lie.\u201dHe added: \u201cThe benefits strike me as small and fleeting. The risks strike me as unknown, uncertain, and potentially large.\u201dMr. Warsh ultimately voted for the action, saying he would dissent if not for personal loyalty to Mr. Bernanke and because \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to undermine at this important moment the chance that this program could be successful.\u201dSeveral other supporters of the action were also uneasy. \u201cThis is a difficult decision for me, and I think it was a difficult decision for most of you,\u201d said Daniel K. Tarullo, another Fed governor. \u201cThe only people I worry about are the people who think that the decision was easy, whether to do nothing or to do precisely this, because I do think that, as many people have pointed out, there are nontrivial costs and nontrivial benefits.\u201dAt the same time, the transcripts contain a couple of prescient references to the action setting the stage for \u201cQE3,\u201d as a round of bond buying that would commence in September 2012 was frequently called.\u201cQuantitative easing is like kudzu for market operators,\u201d said Richard W. Fisher, then president of the Dallas Fed. \u201cYou\u2019re familiar with this analogy because you\u2019re a Southerner, Mr. Chairman. It grows, and it grows and it may be impossible to trim off once it takes root in the minds of market operators.\u201dAfter all the officials had spoken, Mr. Bernanke, who often displayed a collaborative style that aimed to unite officials, set up the final vote with this reminder: Nonaction is a type of action, too. \u201cAny action we take or don\u2019t take is going to expose us to the judgment of history if we make the wrong decision,\u201d he said. \u201cNot taking action is a risky step, just as taking action is a risky step.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Search of Japan\u2019s Hidden Culinary Revolution", "Date": "2016-01-20", "News": "From Tokyo to Kanazawa in this food-obsessed nation, sampling the culinary wizardry of a new wave of creative chefs.Supported byI was on the Shinkansen bullet train and roaring north toward the Japan Sea at 125 miles per hour when I passed through the wormhole in space-time. The wormhole was on the far end of a long, unlit tunnel. Three-quarters of an hour earlier, in the midst of a sunny winter\u2019s day, I\u2019d boarded the train at the loud, insanely complex and many-leveled Tokyo main station, accompanied by my friend Bob Sliwa. We were bound for the coastal town of Kanazawa, sometimes known as the hidden pearl of the Japan Sea and famed for the freshness and variety of its fish-based cuisine.The trip there last winter was to be the climax of my weeklong attempt to find the hidden culinary truth of Japan, beyond the reach of guidebooks or the well-intentioned efforts of such celebrity investigators as Anthony Bourdain. My secret weapon in this was Bob himself, a man embedded in Japan for 30 years, deeply conversant in the ways and cuisines of the country and, by great good fortune, my college roommate.We exited the tunnel into a crash of white light. On the far side was a winterscape of deep snow, mountain vistas and blowing wind. The day we\u2019d been traveling through until then had been dry and mild, and the sudden atmospheric shift made it seem that we might, in fact, have just rocketed through a rift in space-time. Bob, stroking his goatee, laughed out loud at my confusion.\u201cWe were climbing in the dark in that tunnel the whole time \u2014 didn\u2019t you feel your ears pop?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat you see here is the result of the steady wind blowing off the Japan Sea from China, picking up the moisture of the ocean along the way and throwing it against the mountains as snow \u2014 and lots of it. Think of the Continental Divide, Japan-style.\u201dI lowered my eyes from the Alpine visuals and back to my notes on the previous days\u2019 eating and drinking. The pages, which were thick with arrows and exclamation points, seemed only to get more densely crosshatched as time went on, and for good reason. The dozen or so meals I\u2019d had in Tokyo had been a marvel of consistent variation, ringing fluid changes of texture and flavor on those three little words that define the cuisine of this island nation at its heart: iso no aji, or \u201ctastes like ocean spray.\u201dBy agreement, the majority of places Bob and I had gone to so far were chosen to illustrate the point that the most creative cooking in Japan is no longer being done in A-list restaurants. Those places, which continue to serve up superb food, belong to the days when the country was still riding high atop the mighty economic surge that carried it from the ashes of World War II all the way to the forefront of the global market. They\u2019re relics of the time when the Japanese, so expert at mimicry, sent their best young chefs to the high-end restaurants of France and Italy where their work ethic ensured them a rapid rise up the kitchen ladder, and upon their return, the creation of perfect interpretations of their previous employers\u2019 cuisine.It\u2019s no accident that Tokyo has the highest number of Michelin-starred restaurants of any city in the world. But rather than sampling the wares of these warhorses, I\u2019d arrived to try the second culinary wave, a quiet in-house revolution that is afoot all over the country. Driven by chefs mostly in their late 20s and early 30s, its inspiration was the collapse of that same economic surge in the early 1990s, followed by the now famous stagnation or \u201c20 lost years,\u201d as it\u2019s referred to in the foreign press. As the country entered a period of soul-searching, these young chefs took the opportunity to throw off what Bob calls the \u201clegacy exoskeleton\u201d of manners and slavish obedience to groupthink and instead to begin advancing the cause of native ingredients, prepared with great care and what seems at times almost freakish originality.Exhibit A: the plate of smoked salted cod roe sprinkled with red chile pepper flakes at a restaurant called N-1155 in the hip, hilly Tokyo neighborhood of Nakameguro. The smoking and salting produced a deliciously bespoke version of fish jerky, whose peppery marine tang married perfectly with a chilled glass of sauvignon blanc.Exhibits B and C: a flash-cold-smoked sea perch sashimi, and a bagna cauda, both served at the same restaurant. Flash cold smoking, done in the kitchen just before plating, imparts a tangy, cooked woodland savor to the raw flesh of the fish that makes for a delicious cognitive dissonance in the mouth. The bagna cauda was upgraded by having its oil mostly replaced with cream, creating a rich bath into which produce from the restaurant\u2019s own farm in southern Japan \u2014 thin-cut yellow carrot, mustard green, lotus root and kohlrabi \u2014 was dipped and then removed, leaving its bright, vegetal essences enrobed in unctuous garlic.The next day, a few blocks away, it was the turn of a place called Harbor Bar. Modeled vaguely on a Venetian wine bar and boasting fish from the Sanriku Coast region of northern Japan, the tiny restaurant has a cheerfully casual D.I.Y. atmosphere that channels Bushwick. But there\u2019s nothing casual about the food in the least.The opener was a plate of super-fresh scallop sashimi, enlivened with a ginger sauce whose citrus notes gave the dish the feel of a mollusk ceviche. This was followed up by a serving of raw botan shrimp \u2014 as large as langoustines \u2014 which arrived paired with a spicy r\u00e9moulade of cured carrots. While we ate, Bob and I continued to catch up. Unusually for a Westerner who has been living long-term in Japan, he\u2019s lost none of his youthful enthusiasm and manifests the same manic glee he once did as a jazz-mad, art-crazed undergraduate.\u201cSome people live here and want to be Japanese,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t. Not only is it impossible, but I don\u2019t want to be treated the way Japanese treat themselves. I love Japan, but I sell myself as a foreigner who\u2019s willing to break the rules and say what\u2019s wrong.\u201d\u201cAnd what is wrong?\u201d I asked.Bob, who works in Japan as an industrial designer, rubbed his hand over his shaved skull and said: \u201cTwo words define Japanese culture. One is \u2018monozukuri,\u2019 or \u2018the Japanese way of making things.\u2019 The other is \u2018omotenashi,\u2019 or \u2018the Japanese way of hospitality.\u2019 If the country rebuilt itself into such a buff economic specimen after World War II, it did so partly out of its belief in the superiority of both of these things to any other country\u2019s. But then the bubble economy burst, the 21st century happened, and the country lost its way. I call it a nationwide case of the rope-a-dope. Whole industrial sectors have fallen asleep. Remember the Walkman? How\u2019s that working out for you, Sony?\u201dBefore I could answer the rhetorical question, my attention was distracted by the arrival of something called an iwagaki rock oyster.Ah, that oyster. It was the largest bivalve I\u2019ve ever seen, with a shell approximately the size and shape of my foot. \u201cYou freeze it while alive and then slow-cook it at low temperatures,\u201d the waiter explained, bowing. \u201cThat makes the umami come out.\u201d The monster was dressed in a brightly acid dill-based mignonette and disproved the axiom that larger versions of anything taste worse: It was a briny, exquisite splash of sea in the mouth.I was still finishing it when the owner of the restaurant, alerted by my exclamations of joy, came over to talk. His name was Akira Matsuoka and he\u2019s part of a restaurant consortium that oversees several venues in Tokyo. Rail thin, with high cheekbones, black jeans and alt-rock facial hair, he answered my question as to how he invents his dishes by explaining: \u201cMy partners and I think of ourselves as a food think tank. We don\u2019t care about Michelin rankings. First we come up with the concept, and then we invent the dishes to fit it, sometimes collectively and sometimes individually. Rather than a star chef, we make the food the star.\u201d He smiled and circled a finger in the air to indicate the small space crammed with diners. \u201cAnd it seems to be working.\u201dOver the next few days, the culinary wizardry of Tokyo chefs remained unflagging. Yet, of all the entrees and appetizers I tried (the rice paper tubes of crab flash-fried so that the crunchy, starchy surface held a core of molten raw crustacean; the cod ovaries baked in Gorgonzola that scattered delicious marine bursts of garlic across the palate; the tiny fish called an ayu, or \u201csweet fish,\u201d which is fermented in the dregs of sake for three years to make the bones grow edibly soft) \u2014 all of it, no matter how odd, gross or wonderful, would pale next to the one dish that remained dangling, like the holy grail, just out of reach. People spoke of it as the greatest white-fleshed sashimi in the world.Back on the train, I heard Bob say, \u201cWe\u2019re almost here,\u201d and I slowly raised my eyes from my notebook. The fish was the legendary kanburi, or winter yellowtail, which abounds in the waters off Kanazawa, and after a couple of hours on the train, we were finally sliding into Kanazawa Station.But before food, a drink. Several, actually. Drinking in Japan is a crucial social and professional lubricant in a country where ritualized courtesies can easily harden into walls, and Bob, a teetotaler in college, had successfully adapted. Kanazawa, like most Japanese cities of a decent size, has a distinct \u201cdrinking district,\u201d honeycombed with tiny bars, and not long after checking in to our hotel, we found ourselves in a stand-up bar called Choikichi.Stand-up means exactly what it sounds like, and the long counter of this former ice cream parlor was crowded on a late afternoon with regulars watching sumo wrestling on television. As titans clashed thunderously on the screen above us, the locals chatted happily with one another, and I had the sense of having wandered into a tiny Japanese analogue of Cheers, the famously chummy bar \u201cwhere everybody knows your name.\u201d We ate edamame and delicious rakkyo (pickled onions) and drank a fairly common but tasty sake.Bob, a habitu\u00e9 of these places, was welcomed everywhere we went with shouts. The shouts were particularly loud later that night at a bar named, hilariously, Pub Dylan (as in Bob). There I was served a very expensive sake called Dassai, whose cool, perfect balance gave me the impression of drinking a dipperful of outer space. It was also at this place that Bob (my friend) brought down the house by correctly identifying the Japanese rock band playing on the big-screen TV as the Atomic Bomb Masturbation.After a quick, delicious tempura dinner I returned to my dwarf hotel room, only moderately worse for alcoholic wear, and asked myself the obvious question: Is Japan the most food-crazed nation on earth? Evidence for \u201cyes\u201d is pretty thick on the ground. Tokyo has a staggering 80,000 restaurants, as opposed to the 15,000 of New York or the 6,000 of London. But more to the point: Where else on the planet would a country\u2019s biggest boy band have its own cooking show? What other nation would stage a televised competition in which they brought in challengers to try to better a master sushi chef\u2019s technique and scanned the resulting sushi pieces with an MRI to compare the ratio of rice to air? What other place could possibly, under any circumstances, have invented the operatic and off-the-wall \u201cBattle of the Iron Chef\u201d?The very next day, as if in answer to these questions, Japan served me the best seafood meal of my life. It did so at a small, easily missed, relatively modest-looking restaurant called Yamashita.Yamashita is on no foreigner\u2019s must-see lists, and there wasn\u2019t an English language word in sight. But the restaurant, located by Bob, is a temple of sorts where the eponymous owner and chef Mitsuo Yamashita is referred to by his employees as the Master, and boss and staff work as one to pluck the freshest, purest products from the nearby ocean and put them on your plate with minimal interference.The meal began with a pictorially perfect tray of amuse bouches: thin-cut strips of yellowtail stomach dressed in a vinegar-miso sauce, which tasted smoked though they weren\u2019t, along with a small pile of herrings fermented in the dregs of sake, and a handful of fresh snap peas, each dabbed with tiny blobs of black sesame pesto.A sake, painstakingly engineered by Mr. Yamashita in consultation with local brewers, partnered these refined salty nibbles perfectly. But all this was a mere prelude to that moment when a waitress, smiling, brought in plates heaped high with the prized kanburi sashimi.Why has this fish been elevated to the very top spot among sashimi lovers? Because kanburi uniquely fuses two qualities that are almost never found in the same animal. Take maguro, the tuna whose sashimi is most recognizable to Americans. There\u2019s the red meat, or akami, version, with its firm texture and relatively mild flavor, and the pinker version known as otoro that is filled with delicious oils and fats. The problem is that the tasty otoro has a crumbly, falling-apart texture in the mouth likened disdainfully by Bob to \u201ceating sashimi marshmallows.\u201d Because texture, along with temperature and flavor, are part of the \u201cmouth moment\u201d of Japanese cuisine, the challenge is to find a firm fish that is also rich in oil.Enter kanburi, which for that brief, miraculous period every winter, is both those things. The fish, in thick slabs, now lay fanned out on the plate before me, glistening with oil \u2014 oil that had leached out of it because the Master had intentionally let the fish \u201crest,\u201d or cure for a day or so. Mind you, fish oil like this has nothing \u201cfishy\u201d about it. The kanburi was silky, pliant, yielding and tasted of a distilled, superclean essence of the sea. It seemed to exemplify everything that was best about Japanese cuisine, and mouthful by mouthful it put me into a kind of trance.Suddenly the Master poked his head in again and barked some machine-gun Japanese at Bob, who translated it with a single word: squid. It was being offered as our next course, and there was no question of not taking it. One would as soon have refused an audience with the pope.This would turn out to be something called \u201cspear squid.\u201d Freshly caught and still alive in the kitchen, it was killed, masterfully julienned and brought to the table as sashimi, along with a sauce made of fermented bonito guts, a condiment of pickled wild wasabi flowers, a heated stone and some stern admonitions from the Master as to exactly how to cook the squid \u2014 barely \u2014 and what the precise protocol was for eating it. Dishes like this belong to a category known for its hazawari, or \u201ctooth feel,\u201d and produce a dazzling mix of ocean flavor notes while offering an old-fashioned popcorn-like crunch in the mouth.By the end of such a meal, something has happened to you, something close to the psychic euphoria produced by yoga or meditation. You\u2019ve entered a zone of food satori, mystically zonked by the punch of a culture that has been perfecting its culinary subtleties for thousands of years. What to do?After an elaborately choreographed goodbye, we took a digestive stroll in the seaside air, passing through the gaudy Kanazawa downtown with its Ginza-style flashing lights, its kuru kuru (conveyor belt) sushi restaurants (Japanese is rich in onomatopoetic words, and \u201ckuru kuru\u201d is the sound of a conveyor belt; say it fast and you\u2019ll understand), its knickknack shops, bars and omnipresent FamilyMart convenience stores.Our destination was the beautiful old wood-fronted part of town called Higashi Chaya-Gai. (Kanazawa shares with Kyoto the distinction of being one of the few large Japanese cities not bombed by the Allies during World War II). There, we entered a sleekly minimalist bar called Teriha and seated ourselves among the drinkers, conscious that it was our last evening out.I had spent a full week living inside a kind of tone poem of fish and alcohol, enriched by unflagging conversation with a dear old friend. But a vague perception had been weighing on me constantly during the trip, and suddenly, in the dark bar, that perception sharpened into words: I\u2019ve never been to so foreign a place before that felt so deeply familiar.Differently from an Asian country like India, where I\u2019ve also spent time, the social iconography of Japan is profoundly recognizable to an American. Despite the culture\u2019s insularity and remoteness from us, the Japanese often dress and style themselves in a way that clearly states their social membership in categories of rocker, matron, intellectual, etc., and these identities can be easily \u201cread\u201d by a tourist from the United States. This fact, a product of the longstanding symbiotic relationship between the countries, produces a visual halo effect, in which one is always observing roles and mores on several levels at once. Exhausting on the one hand, it\u2019s endlessly, compulsively fascinating on the other.Back in the bar, the lights suddenly dimmed further, and the conversations ceased. Rain started to fall, visible out the windows. Shrouded in darkness at the end of the bar, the owner, an ex-geisha named Yaeko Yoshigawa, began playing a flute. It was a bamboo flute called a shinobue, much used in Noh and Kabuki theater music and part of the essential \u201ckit\u201d of the geisha. The slow, wavering tones, played without obvious melody but filled with richness, lack the forward propulsive quality of Western music. Instead, individual notes are held until they\u2019re mere wisps of sound, acoustic vapor.For several minutes, quietly, the flute music continued, threading the air in the darkness. It wavered, seemed about to stop and then, surprisingly, went on, moving forward without resolution, a little bit like the beautiful, perplexing country of Japan itself, whose mix of ceremonial gravity and hidden culinary wonders had given me a week of the very best eating of my life. There was a pause that extended until we could hear the rain pattering on the roof and a single last note, after which Ms. Yoshigawa removed the flute from her mouth with a bow. The recital was finished. The tone poem was over. In the semi-darkness, Bob raised his glass in a last toast. It was time to go home.This particular trip was dedicated to eating, not lodging. In both Kanazawa and Tokyo there are abundant \u201cbusiness hotels,\u201d found under that term on the Internet, where for usually less than $100 a night, or 11,390 yen at 114 yen to the dollar, one sleeps in a luxuriously appointed room the size of a large refrigerator. These are typically squeaky clean and have all modern conveniences, including, often, a washer-dryer and, incredibly, a pants press.A beautiful wood-paneled restaurant in one of the hipper districts of Tokyo that serves innovative, exquisitely prepared seasonal food. Much of the produce is from the restaurant\u2019s own organic farm in southern Japan. An English-language menu is a plus. Dinner and drinks start at about 5,000 yen.Hipster interiors and a crowd right out of Bushwick fill up this small, very tasty seafood shop. The place is modeled loosely on a Venetian fish restaurant and has a decent Italian wine selection, but the superfresh and very creative dishes are straight from the Sanriku Coast, north of Tokyo. Dinner and drinks from about 4,000 yen on up.This world-class fish mecca is unostentatiously small and bare. Its stern, somewhat forbidding owner runs a very tight ship, and no English is spoken. But animated pointing at display cases will probably do the trick. Dinner and drinks, about 4,000 yen.Located in the historic wood-fronted district of the city, this wine bar with its beautiful, minimalist interior tends to fill up fast with the local A-list crowd. The owner, a former geisha, speaks some English. If you beg her for a shinobue (flute) recital, she may oblige. Drinks begin at 500 yen.This small, friendly, deeply atmospheric watering hole is found in the city\u2019s Shintenchi bar quarter. A rowdy crowd tends to form by late evening, and chatting is encouraged in whatever language you happen to speak. The Dassai sake (2,000 to 3,000 yen a glass) is out of this world. Other drinks begin at about 500 yen. Cash only.This is old-school working-class Japan. A single standing-only counter, jars of pickled bar food and local workers sighing over sumo wrestling on TV. The owner is often referred to as Mom (in Japanese, of course) by the clientele. No English spoken. Snacks and drinks start at 200 and 300 yen respectively.The cover article on Jan. 24, about a culinary tour of Japan, misspelled part of the name of a section of the city of Kanazawa. It is Higashi Chaya-Gai, not Higasha Chaya-Gai.The cover article on Jan. 24 about the hidden culinary scenes of Japan misstated the address of Pub Dylan, a bar in Kanazawa. It is at 2-3-23 Katamachi, not 3-25 Katamachi. The article also misstated the price of a glass of Dassai sake at the bar. It is 2,000 to 3,000 yen, not 9,110 yen.Eli Gottlieb\u2019s most recent novel, \u201cBest Boy,\u201d was published in August 2015.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China G.D.P. Growth at Slowest Pace Since 2009, Data Shows", "Date": "2016-01-18", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s growth slowed further last year, adding to the troubling economic picture that is unsettling investors around the world.The Chinese economy grew at a 6.8 percent pace in the fourth quarter, according to data released on Tuesday. It was the lowest quarterly expansion since the global financial crisis in 2009.Uncertainty about the Chinese economy \u2014 and whether the government can manage a slowdown \u2014 has been weighing heavily on global markets in recent weeks. Investors, in part, are trying to determine if China\u2019s slump will spread, dragging down the rest of the world.The latest data is not likely to reassure investors that all is well in China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy.The quarterly growth rate was lower than analysts expected. For the full year, China expanded at 6.9 percent, just below the government\u2019s target of 7 percent.It is a pace that would be the envy of many developed countries. But the figure represented China\u2019s slowest expansion since 1990, when foreign investment shriveled in the year after the government\u2019s deadly crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square.\u201cSigns of growth bottoming out are nowhere to be seen,\u201d said Li-Gang Liu, the chief economist for greater China at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Groups. \u201cInstead, we will see at least another two years of further growth slowdown.\u201dAfter decades of double-digit growth, the Chinese economy is entering a new era of more muted growth. While the government\u2019s leaders have said they are comfortable with this shift, the slowdown creates a host of unexpected challenges.China\u2019s growth is decelerating as its traditional industrial businesses struggle with excess capacity and dwindling demand. A slump in new housing construction is hurting consumption of building materials including steel, cement and glass, even as home prices show signs of a rebound.China\u2019s export base in lower-end manufacturing, once a powerhouse that drove growth and created jobs, has been hollowed out. Factories churning out goods like garments and furniture are losing competitiveness because of lower wages in Southeast Asia and South Asia.Although consumer spending and more innovative private sector companies are expected to help China\u2019s economy expand in the future, analysts worry that their development will be too slow to offset the current and painful industrial slowdown.And the government\u2019s response could add to the challenges. The government has rolled out a raft of stimulus measures to help bolster the economy. But that only threatens to leave already struggling companies even deeper in debt.Taken collectively, China\u2019s results could spell more trouble for global growth, even as the economy in the United States shows resilience.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.Separate monthly data released on Tuesday offered no sign that China\u2019s slowdown was bottoming out. In December, industrial production rose 5.9 percent from a year ago, retail sales increased 11.1 percent and investment rose 10 percent \u2014 all of which were slightly below economists\u2019 forecasts.In a news release on Tuesday, China\u2019s state statistics agency said the growth rate last year was challenged by a \u201ccomplicated international environment and increasing downward pressure on the economy.\u201d However, it added that the economy \u201cachieved moderate but stable and sound development.\u201dThe weakness in China has reverberated around the world, as investors try to dissect what\u2019s actually happening in the country\u2019s economy. The plunge in Chinese stocks, which are now in bear territory, only clouds the outlook.Global investors worry about what these dramatic stock swings say about the health of China\u2019s economy. But analysts note that the frequent gyrations of Chinese stocks are often unrelated to what is happening on the ground in China.\u201cThere does seem to be a disconnect there between equities in mainland China and how the economy is actually performing,\u201d said Julian Evans-Pritchard, a China economist at Capital Economics.He cited the example of a huge rally in the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets in the first half of last year\u2014 which gathered steam even as the economic data emerging from the mainland suggested a sharpening slowdown.\u201cA lot of what goes on is driven by perceptions of what policy makers are going to do in terms of market support, rather than what\u2019s happening in the real economy,\u201d said Mr. Evans-Pritchard.Asian markets seemed unmoved by the G.D.P. figures, as Shanghai closed up 3.25 percent, and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index finished the day up about 0.6 percent. In Europe, the FTSE Euronext index rose nearly 2 percent at the open.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Republican Debate, Taunts and Quips as Rivals Battle", "Date": "2016-01-14", "News": "Supported byNORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014 Donald J. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas sharply attacked each other on Thursday night over the Canadian-born Mr. Cruz\u2019s eligibility to be president and Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cNew York values,\u201d shedding any semblance of cordiality as they dominated a Republican debate less than three weeks before the Iowa caucuses.Their exchanges showcased the intense and unpredictable new phase of the race as polls tighten and 11 candidates jockey for political advantage \u2014 not only over issues like imposing tariffs on Chinese goods and fighting the Islamic State, but also over matters of character and integrity that drew some of the hardest punches of the race so far.In many ways, it was the darkest debate of the campaign, as the Republicans tried to paint the grimmest possible portrait of an America in decline economically, despite rapid job growth, and militarily, though they praised service members. The ferocity onstage reflected the pressure in the race as it distills into a contest between the anti-establishment Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz, followed by other candidates like Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey.Mr. Rubio and Mr. Christie, along with Jeb Bush and John Kasich, are vying to emerge as the leading candidate of mainstream Republicans, yet they struggled to be heard on Thursday night.Mr. Cruz, who has gained ground against Mr. Trump recently and is now virtually tied with him in the polls in Iowa, charged that Mr. Trump was turning desperate because his standing as front-runner had turned shaky.After months as Mr. Trump\u2019s closest ally in the race, Mr. Cruz pointedly noted that Mr. Trump had dismissed questions in the fall about Mr. Cruz\u2019s constitutional eligibility given his birth to an American mother living in Calgary, Alberta.\u201cThe Constitution hasn\u2019t changed, but the poll numbers have,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cDonald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.\u201d Mr. Cruz added that the law was on his side, noting that Senator John McCain, while born in the Panama Canal Zone, was eligible to run for president. By Mr. Trump\u2019s standard, Mr. Cruz asserted, Mr. Trump himself might not be eligible to run for president because his mother was born in Scotland.\u201cBut I was born here \u2014 big difference,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Mr. Cruz gave his most aggressive performance so far as he sought to protect the support he has built among social conservatives and evangelical Christians. He was relentless in trying to put Mr. Trump in his place, in part to appeal to establishment Republicans who are deeply uncomfortable with Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy.The debate turned from a reality show into a comedy as Mr. Trump mused that if he chose Mr. Cruz as his running mate, Democrats would sue to challenge Mr. Cruz\u2019s eligibility \u2014 as they would, he said, if Mr. Cruz won the presidential primary.\u201cIf you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?\u201d Mr. Trump said.Mr. Cruz, a pugnacious, polished debater as a Princeton undergraduate, gave no quarter.\u201cI\u2019m not going to take legal advice from Donald Trump,\u201d he said to laughter. And he offered to make Mr. Trump his running mate, so he could assume the presidency if a theoretical legal challenge against Mr. Cruz\u2019s eligibility were successful.Mr. Rubio, seeing an opening to position himself above the spat, eventually interjected, mocking his rivals.\u201cI hate to interrupt this episode of \u2018Court TV,\u2019 \u201d he said, drawing laughs and applause. He then sought to refocus the conversation on President Obama\u2019s shortcomings and what he said was a need to revive the country, safe terrain for Republican primary voters.Neither Mr. Rubio, who spent most of the debate delivering rehearsed lines that seemed to come out of speeches, nor the other four Republicans on the debate stage left nearly as big an impression during the night as Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz.Mr. Cruz seemed more comfortably in command with his needling of Mr. Trump, who was booed frequently. But then he was asked to elaborate on his suggestion earlier in the week that Mr. Trump embodied \u201cNew York values.\u201dMr. Cruz stood by it, saying Americans outside New York City understood the reference.\u201cI think most people know exactly what New York values are: socially liberal, pro-gay marriage, pro-abortion, focused on money and the media,\u201d he said.But Mr. Trump, in an uncharacteristically calm and measured answer that built to a powerful conclusion, recalled the way that New Yorkers suffered, grieved and recovered from the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks \u2014 drawing applause even from Mr. Cruz.\u201cThe people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, even the smell of death \u2014 no one understood it,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everyone in the world watched and loved New York and New Yorkers. And I\u2019ll tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.\u201d\u201cThis would be devastating for our economy,\u201d said Mr. Bush, a former governor of Florida. He added, \u201cWe need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.\u201dMr. Trump shot back, \u201cAnd we don\u2019t need a weak person being president of the United States \u2014 and that\u2019s what we would get with Jeb.\u201d\u201cWhy didn\u2019t they call the police?\u201d Mr. Trump asked of the couple\u2019s neighbors and others.The New York Times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign.\u201cOn Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama, and it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing,\u201d Mr. Christie said, adding that American alliances were in bad need of repair and that adversaries needed to understand \u201cthe limits of our patience.\u201dThe candidates also sought to find provocative new ways to tar Mrs. Clinton.\u201cIf she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse,\u201d Mr. Bush said, drawing applause.Mr. Rubio sought to top that. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t just be a disaster,\u201d he said. \u201cHillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.\u201d Over applause, he continued, \u201cSomeone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief, and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.\u201dMr. Rubio also seized an opportunity to challenge Mr. Christie\u2019s conservative credentials on a host of issues important to party activists.\u201cI like Chris Christie, but we cannot afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core,\u201d he said, referring to the education standards. \u201cWe cannot afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.\u201dSaying Mr. Christie had also contributed to Planned Parenthood and backed Justice Sonia Sotomayor\u2019s appointment to the Supreme Court, Mr. Rubio added: \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country. It cannot be someone that agrees with his agenda.\u201dMr. Christie responded with ridicule, recalling that Mr. Rubio had repulsed an attack from Mr. Bush at an earlier debate by suggesting that Mr. Bush had been told to criticize him out of desperation.Though Mr. Christie ridiculed senators as all talk, no accountability, he largely avoided responding with specific critiques of Mr. Rubio\u2019s views \u2014 though he recalled that Mr. Rubio had once lauded him as a \u201cconservative reformer that New Jersey needed.\u201dAccording to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.\u201cThat is not consistent conservatism,\u201d Mr. Rubio said. \u201cThat is political calculation.\u201dMr. Cruz replied with mockery. \u201cI appreciate your dumping your oppo research folder on the debate stage,\u201d he said, referring to the compilation of vulnerabilities campaigns keep on their rivals. He said Mr. Rubio\u2019s accusations were \u201cflat-out false,\u201d drawing boos from a crowd friendly to Mr. Rubio, and then invoked a cast of politicians well-known to Republican primary voters.\u201cMarco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty,\u201d he said. \u201cI stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King,\u201d two immigration hard-liners in Congress.Mr. Cruz, faced with a question about his failure to disclose a large loan in his 2012 Senate race, attacked The New York Times and called the lack of disclosure \u201ca paperwork error.\u201d\u201cThe entire New York Times attack is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate that was a public filing, but it was not on a second filing with the F.E.C.,\u201d he said, referring to the Federal Election Commission. \u201cBoth of those filings were public.\u201dNear the end of the debate, the disputes took a turn toward the substantive as Mr. Rubio, unbidden, targeted a business tax proposal by Mr. Cruz, calling it a value-added tax. Mr. Cruz countered that Mr. Rubio\u2019s tax plan would leave the Internal Revenue Service in place.Mr. Rubio shot back, \u201cThere has to be some agency that\u2019s going to collect your VAT tax.\u201dAfter one exchange between Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio, Mr. Christie saw an opportunity.\u201cI\u2019d like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate,\u201d he said, pointing out that the original question had been about entitlements.Mr. Rubio sought to retake the floor, but Mr. Christie cut him off.\u201cYou already had your chance, Marco,\u201d Mr. Christie said. \u201cYou blew it.\u201dJonathan Martin reported from North Charleston, and Patrick Healy from New York.\u00a0Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shifting Who Bails Out Troubled Banks in Europe", "Date": "2016-01-03", "News": "Supported byPolitical EconomyThe European Union entered a brave new world of bank \u201cbail-ins\u201d at the start of 2016. Europe has wasted so much taxpayer money in bailing out banks in recent years that it is right to try to get investors to help foot the bill. However, the tough program carries big political risks.The crucial new rule is that no bank can be bailed out with public money until creditors accounting for at least 8 percent of the lender\u2019s liabilities have contributed. A bail-in typically means wiping out creditors\u2019 investments, slashing their value or converting them into shares in the bank. Uninsured depositors could get caught, along with professional investors.Moreover, within the eurozone, the national authorities will no longer be responsible for dealing with failed banks because the job has been transferred to the new Single Resolution Mechanism.During the global financial crisis, bailouts were the normal way of shoring up failed banks. The European Commission approved 592 billion euros \u2014 $643 billion at the current exchange rate \u2014 of state aid to lenders between October 2008 and the end of 2012. This was justified on the grounds that if banks collapsed and depositors lost their money, there would be economic chaos.The trouble was that bailing out banks caused government debt to balloon and contributed to the euro crisis \u2014 hence the idea that investors, not taxpayers, should have to help pay the cost of rescuing or closing down banks, which has been the norm in the United States since the Great Depression.The theory is that shareholders should take the first hit because they know they are risking their money. If that isn\u2019t enough to stabilize the bank, subordinated bondholders should step up because they too should know such investments are risky. Next in line are senior bondholders. Finally, there are the uninsured depositors, or specifically, in the European Union, uninsured depositors with more than \u20ac100,000 in their accounts. The smaller depositors should not be touched.Unfortunately, bail-ins are harder in practice than in theory. A big test came during the Cypriot crisis of early 2013. The eurozone\u2019s initial instinct was to tax all depositors, big and small, to fill the gap in bank balance sheets. Although that bad idea was abandoned, large depositors suffered heavy losses, helping cause a steep recession.Other countries do not want to repeat the Cypriot experiment. No wonder that Italy and Portugal rushed to rescue some of their troubled banks before the tough new bail-in program started in January.Not that Rome and Lisbon had a free hand in what to do. Since mid-2013, the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, has said that public money could be used to bail out lenders only if shareholders and subordinated bondholders shared the burden. Still, this was not as tough as the new 8 percent rule, which could require senior bondholders and uninsured depositors to take a hit too.That said, applying the old rules caused a political rumpus. Italy used a new industry-funded bailout program to pump \u20ac3.6 billion into four small banks in November. The problem was that many of the subordinated bondholders who had to be bailed in were ordinary savers who had been sold these investments without appreciating their risk. One committed suicide.The Italian government has faced a backlash. It has also been forced to create a compensation fund for investors who were mis-sold the bonds and is considering how to stop this from happening again.In Portugal, the new leftist government lost its majority when its allies refused to back a \u20ac2.25 billion taxpayer-led rescue of Banco Internacional do Funchal, a midsize bank also known as Banif. The government survived only after the main opposition party abstained from voting on the budget, which contained the rescue.It\u2019s not clear exactly what would have happened if these banks had been rescued in 2016 instead, as there is some discretion in how to operate the new rules. Still, the worry is that if other banks get into trouble in the next few years and uninsured depositors face losses, as in Cyprus, the political repercussions will be even more severe than those in Italy and Portugal.The European Union authorities, though, don\u2019t have to just keep their fingers crossed. They could encourage banks to raise subordinated debt and other types of capital, faster than currently envisaged so that there is less risk that the 8 percent rule hits those lower in the pecking order.Bail-ins are right in principle but aren\u2019t an easy option. It would be a shame if the European Union\u2019s bold experiment came unstuck.Hugo Dixon writes a weekly column for Reuters Breakingviews.

{"Headline": "Stock Markets Shudder After Chinese Stock Plunge Forces a Trading Halt", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 The market turmoil in China spread around the world on Thursday, as global investors grew more anxious about the country\u2019s currency and the health of its economy.Major market indexes in the United States ended the day down more than 2 percent.Earlier, Chinese stocks plunged by more than 7 percent, forcing officials for the second time this week to halt trading for the day \u2014 in this case, after just 29 minutes.After the market mess, the Chinese authorities made a stark reversal, suspending a market mechanism \u2014 known as a circuit breaker \u2014 that halted trading when losses reached a threshold. The measure, put into effect just this week and intended to help stabilize stocks, may have instead intensified investors\u2019 concerns.The big question now is how much of the turmoil reflects rule changes and other policies at the Chinese stock market, and how much is based on broader economic fundamentals that might have a further impact on global growth.The market aftershocks spread to Europe and the United States. The benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index closed down 2.4 percent, to its lowest level since the start of October. For the last four days, the S.&P. 500 is down 4.9 percent, producing the worst start to a year in the history of the index.The narrower Dow Jones industrial average ended down 2.3 percent, while the Nasdaq composite index finished down 3.03 percent. The selling was in shares in nearly all industries.Still, American investors appeared to be less panicked than during a similar sell-off in August, also set off by concerns about Chinese growth. Market indexes in the United States are still above the lows they reached during the summer and many strategists have been arguing this week that the current problems in China are unlikely to become a major issue for the American economy.\u201cWe don\u2019t see this as an issue for a major sell-off in the markets,\u201d said Timothy M. Ghriskey, chief investment officer at the Solaris Group. \u201cPeople are responding like there is nothing new here.\u201dChina\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.It has been a rocky start to the new year in global markets. The big fear is that China\u2019s economy, the world\u2019s second-largest after the United States, is slowing down and crimping growth in other countries.Markets \u201care in a panic over what\u2019s happening in China,\u201d said Derek Halpenny, European head of global markets research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in London. \u201cPeople are saying, \u2018Whoa, growth is way worse than we were expecting this year.\u2019\u201dA downbeat Chinese manufacturing report sent stocks spiraling on Monday, previously prompting the country\u2019s market to close early. It also set off a global rout, with stocks in Europe and the United States getting hit.China\u2019s currency, the renminbi, continued to be a sore spot on Thursday.The Chinese government, which closely controls the renminbi, has been allowing the value of the currency to decline steadily as a way to bolster the economy. A weaker renminbi helps exporters, a key engine of growth.But it is a difficult process to manage. A falling currency is pushing companies and individuals to send money out of the country at a rapid rate, putting additional pressure on the renminbi and unsettling investors.On Thursday morning before the stock market opened, China\u2019s central bank set the rate for the renminbi at 6.5646 to the dollar, its lowest point in almost six years. When stock trading started, investors dumped shares, once again shutting down the market.\u201cPeople are worried about whether they are using currency depreciation to stimulate growth,\u201d said Steven Sun, head of China strategy and Hong Kong and China equity research at HSBC. \u201cAt the end of the day, the question is, do they have control? Everyone is asking that question.\u201dThe currency problems risk setting off a chain reaction.As the renminbi, also known as the yuan, keeps sliding day after day, traders start to expect ever greater declines. The falling currency can then propel further stock losses in China.That, in turn, can ripple through to the global markets. A surprise currency devaluation in August helped prompt a sell-off around the world.\u201cIt\u2019s getting into a stage where it is self-fulfilling \u2014 the weaker the yuan gets, the more selling there will be,\u201d said Hao Hong, the chief market strategist at Bank of Communications International.The price of benchmark West Texas intermediate oil continued to fall on Thursday, dropping to $33.27 a barrel, down over 2 percent. As recently as May, oil was trading at nearly $65.The eurozone\u2019s blue-chip Euro Stoxx 50 index fell 1.7 percent on Thursday. The FTSE 100-stock index in London was off 2 percent for the day.The impulse when the stock market falls hard for a few days in a row is to do something but it probably doesn\u2019t make much sense to overhaul an investment strategy based on a blip of market activity.Asian stocks broadly stumbled. Japan\u2019s benchmark Nikkei 225 index fell 2.3 percent, and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong shed 3 percent.The renminbi \u2014 and the global repercussions \u2014 will provide a crucial test for the Chinese government in coming months.In theory, a weaker renminbi addresses two of China\u2019s problems: It makes China\u2019s exports more competitive in foreign markets, offsetting part of the surge in the country\u2019s blue-collar wages over the last decade; and it makes foreign companies, houses and other overseas investments seem more expensive.The trick is preventing a gradual decline from turning into a rout.Managing the currency is becoming harder for China. Investors, most of them domestic, are moving money out of the country before the buying power of the renminbi slides further.China\u2019s enormous overseas spending has helped it displace the United States and Europe as the leading financial power in large parts of the developing world.China\u2019s economy has also been steadily slowing, making it a less attractive place to invest. Fourth-quarter growth, which will be reported this month, is expected to be 6.9 percent, although some economists have expressed skepticism about the reliability of such figures.The clearest indication of investor sentiment about the renminbi lies in the currency\u2019s value in unrestricted trading here in Hong Kong. Traders have been selling renminbi in Hong Kong for a significantly lower price than the bottom of the government-authorized trading range in Shanghai.The falling value of the renminbi in Hong Kong undermines confidence in the mainland\u2019s currency. It then puts pressure on the central bank to keep pushing down the official trading range.Taken together, the currency weakness, the economic slowdown and the stock market turmoil could force the government to take action. When stocks sold off last summer, China organized large-scale purchases by government-linked brokerages and investment funds.Some of those measures may have added to this week\u2019s pain, though.Under the circuit-breaker rule suspended later Thursday, trading was stopped for 15 minutes when losses hit 5 percent.Both times the circuit breaker was activated this week, the losses continued once trading resumed, taking stocks down 7 percent and forcing a stop in trading. On Thursday, trading was suspended after just 14 minutes. When it resumed 15 minutes later, the indexes almost immediately fell to the daily limit. Trading was then halted for the day.On Thursday, economic policy makers in China issued two statements meant to indicate that officials were taking matters in hand. First, the foreign exchange markets unit of the central bank said that \u201ccurrent conditions are supportive of a relatively stable\u201d exchange rate. The comment was interpreted by some traders and economists as signaling that the central bank might intervene more heavily in currency markets to support the renminbi. There were indications that it had already begun to intervene more to prop up the renminbi in Hong Kong trading.Subsequently, the China Securities Regulatory Commission announced that it was extending for three months a ban on stock sales by large shareholders. A previous ban, imposed in early July during a steep plunge in share prices at the time, had been scheduled to expire on Friday.Erwin Sanft, the head of China strategy at Macquarie Group, based in Sydney, Australia, predicted further declines in Chinese stocks, but he said that the fall might not continue for long. \u201cChina is quite good at defensive measures,\u201d he said.The options for the government go far beyond the market.To shore up the economy, China could further reduce interest rates so as to help the real estate market. It could also further increase its already considerable stimulus spending on infrastructure.Still, while such measures might help in the short run, they would only add to one of China\u2019s biggest problems in the long run: a huge overhang of debt that was used to finance poorly judged investments. Many of those investments, like high-speed rail lines built in smaller provincial capitals for political reasons, may struggle to generate enough of an economic return to cover the interest on the money that was borrowed to finance them.\u201cThe more you try to alleviate, the worse it gets in the long term,\u201d said Viktor Shvets, the head of Asian strategy at Macquarie.As for the broader effects of China\u2019s problems, Mr. Halpenny, the London analyst, said, \u201cThere has to be a point when the market sensitivity to Chinese devaluations declines.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t expect this degree of volatility to continue,\u201d Mr. Halpenny said. \u201cBut it looks like it\u2019s going to be an interesting year.\u201dNathaniel Popper contributed reporting from New York, and David Jolly from Paris.Advertisement"}

Yet Mr. Bagagnan\u2019s salary allows him to support his wife and three children, and he has even bought a home.But like the other men and women here who stand behind the counters of hotels and restaurants, warmly greeting their largely foreign and elite clientele, Mr. Bagagnan fears his line of work may suddenly thrust him onto the front lines of a war with armed militants who could attack at any moment.\u201cSure, I\u2019m scared,\u201d Mr. Bagagnan said on a recent evening as the Muzak version of \u201cStrangers in the Night\u201d played softly while foreign guests lined up for a buffet. \u201cBut there aren\u2019t many jobs here.\u201dUntouched pizzas and toppled bottles of Sprite still sit amid the cafe\u2019s broken glass and charred walls, testament to the sudden horror that unfolded here. Across the street were the charred remains of a dozen vehicles that had melted into the ground.On Monday afternoon, President Roch Marc Christian Kabor\u00e9 toured the carnage, accompanied by the president of Benin, Thomas Yayi Boni, who had come to offer sympathies.Since Friday\u2019s attack, employees across the city said they had been plotting escape routes should gunmen burst through the front door of their workplaces. The fear of attack was new to most of them, but none said they planned to quit \u2014 chiefly because nearly no one else is hiring.\u201cThis won\u2019t change our daily lives at all,\u201d said Isadore Tapsoba, a receptionist at Relax Hotel, a short drive from the Splendid. \u201cWhat it will change is life for foreigners here.\u201dIn establishments popular with expatriates, conversation has turned to balancing security risks with familiar food and the comforts of a four- or five-star hotel. One American couple with a life-is-short attitude arrived at the Laico for vacation on Sunday night, forging on with their Burkina Faso trip after learning of the attacks during a layover in Paris.Outside the Splendid on Monday morning, Viraj Dhumatkar, an information technology specialist from India, was trying to retrieve his luggage. It was still trapped inside as investigators combed through the hotel.He said he and a Burkinabe colleague, Lassane Kientega, were in his first-floor room preparing to go out for the night when the attacks began. They lay on the floor, peeking out a curtain from time to time as shots rang out for hours. Finally, French soldiers rescued them.Just one hour before the attack, Mr. Dhumatkar told receptionists at the Splendid that he planned to extend his stay in Ouagadougou. Now, he was planning to be on the next flight back to India.Local workers said they did not have the luxury of leaving. They must carry on in a suddenly changed environment where anxiety reigns.Just around the corner from the Splendid on Monday morning, Sali Nikiema, a 23-year-old waitress, confessed to feeling jittery as she opened the Brasserie Tino, another spot popular with foreigners. Ms. Nikiema was meeting her sister near the Splendid when the shooting began, and they ran for their lives.\u201cOh, I\u2019m very scared,\u201d she said. Ms. Nikiema, a university student, uses her paychecks to support her extended family. Now, she wants to switch careers and become a secretary, but she doubts she can find work in an office.For locals, securing capital to start a business is nearly impossible, even without the maze of bureaucratic permits required to legally set up shop. Most businesses are owned by foreigners. The Ukrainian owner of the Cappuccino Cafe lost three members of his family in the attacks, including a young son.Now, Mr. Kabor\u00e9 is in full-on crisis mode, and his economic initiatives are likely to be stalled. But some workers were still optimistic.\u201cThis won\u2019t happen again,\u201d said Aruna Sourou, a safari guide with an air of confidence designed to reassure foreign clients. \u201cThe government is doing its best.\u201dBut others were in a state of shock. Local newspapers offered phone numbers to call for psychological counseling, and hospital officials said they were treating dozens of people who were having trouble processing the attacks on the relatively peaceful country.Just outside the city, relatives of Ahmed Sigu\u00e9, a cashier at the Cappuccino Cafe who was still missing and presumed dead, sat on plastic chairs at his mud-brick home in near silence, greeting friends who came to offer condolences. It was a mourning ritual they had decided to carry out after extensive talks with investigators and a search of hospitals and the morgue turned up nothing.Mr. Sigu\u00e9\u2019s job offered him a salary that supported his wife and a sobbing infant inside the house. While the authorities have not named him as a victim, an official list of the dead describes one unknown body as only that of a black person followed by the words \u201cemployee, Cappuccino.\u201dThibault Bluy and Herv\u00e9 Takao contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sharing a Name With Barcelona, if Not Its Fortunes", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported by9 PhotosGUAYAQUIL, Ecuador \u2014 In his sparsely decorated corner office overlooking the field at Estadio Monumental, Juan Alfredo Cuentas sought to explain the power of the brand he has inherited as Barcelona Sporting Club\u2019s new vice president for finance. Outside, the once-manicured grass lay vacant for the off-season, slowly spoiling in the January heat.\u201cIt\u2019s on par with a Coca-Cola, a Samsung or a Pepsi,\u201d he said of his team. \u201cIt\u2019s the strongest and most talked about brand in the country, and it generates headlines every day.\u201dFor most soccer fans around the globe, the name Barcelona is synonymous with the likes of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Su\u00e1rez; huge financial resources; and Champions League triumphs that have often made Spain the king of the sport. But in Ecuador, the name Barcelona is usually associated with the 90-year-old soccer club founded here in Guayaquil, the country\u2019s largest city.The two teams are very different, of course, but in at least a few ways they are alike.For one thing, Barcelona Sporting Club, which was founded by Catalans, has a team logo modeled on that of its Spanish counterpart. And at least within Ecuador, how the immensely popular Barcelona Sporting Club does on the field resonates around the country in the same manner that the achievements and occasional failures of Messi & Company touch all of Spain.\u201cFor all the people who say that in Spain exists the great Barcelona, the original Barcelona, here in Ecuador, the name Barcelona is something very sacred within our own football,\u201d said Carlos V\u00edctor Morales, a popular soccer commentator in Guayaquil.\u201cPeople love, hate, suffer, cry and celebrate according to Barcelona\u2019s results,\u201d he added.Ronald Ladines, who covers the Ecuadorean version of Barcelona for El Comercio, one of the country\u2019s largest newspapers, was succinct in his appraisal of the team\u2019s significance, saying, \u201cBarcelona is football in Ecuador.\u201dHe added, for good measure, and maybe with a little exaggeration, \u201cA championship game without Barcelona isn\u2019t a championship.\u201dBy most accounts, Barcelona Sporting Club first rose to prominence in 1949, when the soccer landscape in Ecuador was largely dominated by amateur provincial clubs. In August of that year, Barcelona Sporting Club faced off against the Colombian team Millonarios, then considered to be one of the world\u2019s premier professional clubs, in a charity match to support the victims of an earthquake in the Andean city Ambato.Barcelona, which at the time featured only Ecuadorean players, upset Millonarios, 3-2, drawing national attention.\u201cThis was a time when Ecuadorean football was more accustomed to landslide defeats,\u201d said Ricardo Castellano, a soccer historian who is affiliated with the Barcelona Sporting Club museum here. The victory over Millonarios, he said, marked the beginning of something new.The top Ecuadorean league (later known as the Serie A) took shape in the late 1950s. As Barcelona Sporting Club began to recruit foreign players regularly in the early 1960s, it solidified itself as the top force in the league, and, to date, it has won a league-leading 14 championships, although only one in the last 18 years.Other international matches also contributed to Barcelona\u2019s rising popularity in Ecuador, including a 1962 game against Pel\u00e9 and his Brazilian club Santos, and multiple appearances in the Copa Libertadores, the Latin American club championship.Over the years, the two Barcelonas have occasionally crossed paths on and off the field. In late 2012, Spain\u2019s Barcelona tried to register its brand in Ecuador for marketing and other purposes, throwing into question Barcelona Sporting Club\u2019s rights to its own name and logo. But an agreement was reached between the teams in 2014 that allowed for the brands to coexist in Ecuador. The clubs have also played each other three times, though not since 1988. Each team has a victory and a draw.But as F.C. Barcelona has emerged as one of the most successful clubs in the world over the past decade, Barcelona Sporting Club \u2014 which is run as a nonprofit \u2014 has found itself struggling through a litany of financial problems and poor performances on the field that would be unimaginable for its Spanish counterpart.The heart of the Ecuadorean team\u2019s problems is a significant debt burden accrued by successive management groups since the early 2000s. Barcelona\u2019s financial woes turned into a crisis in the 2015 season (in Ecuador, the season runs within a calendar year, currently February to December) when management, then led by Antonio Noboa, a member of one of Ecuador\u2019s most prominent business families, failed to make several months\u2019 worth of salary payments to its current players. That prompted the Ecuadorean Football Federation to dock the team points.Morale among the players ran low, and Barcelona sputtered to a distant fourth-place finish in the Serie A. To make matters worse, the team\u2019s chief rival, Emelec, won its third straight championship and 13th over all, pulling one back of Barcelona.\u201cThe difficult economic situation reflected itself in the team\u2019s performance on the field last season,\u201d Guillermo Almada, Barcelona\u2019s manager, said in an interview in R\u00edo Verde, on the northern coast of Ecuador, where the team is holding its preseason training camp. \u201cI have no doubt.\u201dIn October, the club\u2019s nearly 4,000 members \u2014 they pay a monthly fee to maintain that status \u2014 voted for a change in leadership, electing Jos\u00e9 Francisco Cevallos as its president. A highly regarded former player nicknamed the Hands of Ecuador for his goalkeeping success with Barcelona during the 1990s and for his play in the World Cup and Copa Libertadores, Cevallos had previously served as the country\u2019s minister of sport.Cevallos\u2019s first major step was to pay salaries owed to the players and staff for July, August and September, restoring a modicum of confidence in the team\u2019s leadership.\u201cHe understands the world of football from the perspective of the players,\u201d said Iv\u00e1n Hurtado, who heads the country\u2019s players\u2019 union \u2014 la Asociaci\u00f3n de Futbolistas del Ecuador \u2014 and is a former teammate of Cevallos\u2019s on the national team. \u201cWe have faith that he can restore Barcelona as a model for others.\u201dPutting the team on a path to financial stability is likely to be a long-term project.In an interview with Ecuadorean media in December, Cevallos cautioned that the team\u2019s finances remained \u201cin intensive therapy.\u201dCuentas, the new vice president for finance, said the debt currently stood between $15 million and $20 million, equivalent to about one and a half times the club\u2019s annual revenue. Servicing the debt is expected to account for as much as 20 percent of the team\u2019s 2016 budget, he added. In addition, low oil prices are threatening Ecuador\u2019s economy, which could, in turn, hold down attendance and diminish team revenue.With all this in mind, Barcelona has hired two outside firms to begin reviewing financial documents and putting together a multiyear payment plan. The club also plans to vastly expand its membership base, hoping to add 10,000 members per year over the next four years to generate additional revenue.The new management demonstrated its commitment to frugality this off-season, passing up splashy signings in favor of more modest tinkering with the roster. And in an attempt, perhaps, to compensate for the lack of a high-profile international signing, Barcelona is trying to add some sizzle to its preseason festivities. The club has arranged for the fading Brazilian star Ronaldinho, who was once a beloved player at F.C. Barcelona in Spain, to play for Barcelona Sporting Club in an exhibition game.For the team\u2019s management, getting Ronaldinho into a Barcelona S.C. jersey, if only for one game, is a publicity coup and a chance to demonstrate success in an area in which prior club administrations failed. In 1997, for instance, an effort to attract another global star nearing the end of his career \u2014 Diego Maradona \u2014 never panned out.Ronaldinho would be the second player to play for both Barcelonas. The first was Carlos Medrano, an Argentine who played for Barcelona Sporting Club in the early 1970s after an earlier stint with the Spanish club.In R\u00edo Verde, the team\u2019s struggles did little to deter hundreds of fans from attending a recent practice. Manuel Espinosa, 47, sat on concrete bleachers coated with dust and swatted away flies as he watched his favorite team settle into the rhythms of its third practice of the day. Dressed in the team\u2019s neon yellow jersey, Espinosa expressed optimism that Cevallos could help return Barcelona to its past glory, and professed his loyalty through the current down period.\u201cFor me, Barcelona is my idol, my life passion,\u201d he said. \u201cIt runs in my blood.\u201dBack at the team\u2019s headquarters, Cuentas said the new management was setting its own high expectations.\u201cOur goal is to restore the name of Barcelona, nationally and internationally, to the status that it always was,\u201d he said, arms folded on his desk. \u201cAs the best team in Ecuador.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about the Barcelona Sporting Club soccer team in Ecuador misspelled, in two instances, the name of a Brazilian soccer player who played for F.C. Barcelona in Spain and is expected to play in an exhibition for Barcelona Sporting Club. As the article correctly noted elsewhere, he is Ronaldinho, not Ronaldhino.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Failed Talks Raise Specter of Biggest Default in Puerto Rico Crisis", "Date": "2016-01-23", "News": "Supported byThe creditors blamed the utility, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, or Prepa, for scuttling the talks, saying Prepa officials had decided to let a critical expiration date pass without taking action. But Prepa said it was the creditors\u2019 fault for trying to impose a requirement that Prepa had already rejected.\u201cThey had no incentives whatsoever to be efficient,\u201d the president of Puerto Rico\u2019s Senate, Eduardo Bhatia, said of Prepa in a recent interview. \u201cThis is incredible. Our power plants look like the cars in Cuba.\u201dThey run like old cars, too, and one goal of the restructuring was to provide money for a long-awaited modernization.The creditors released a statement at midnight on Friday, as soon as the expiration date had passed, saying the hard-won deal was off. They did not say whether they would now declare Prepa in default. Doing so could have major repercussions.In August, Puerto Rico missed a $58 million payment on what it called \"moral obligation bonds,\" saying it did not have any legal obligation to make the scheduled payment on that type of debt. On Jan. 1, it defaulted on $163 million worth of payments to a low-ranking type of bond, in order to save cash to pay its highest ranking general obligation bonds. Insurers of the affected bonds have filed lawsuits, which in turn prompted Puerto Rico to intensify its pleas to take shelter in bankruptcy court, which would require an act of Congress.Prepa does not take in enough cash to cover its costs, and it has a debt payment of about $400 million due to bondholders on July 1. It also owes about $700 million to two institutions that finance the shipments of fuel that Prepa burns to produce energy. The utility does not have the resources to make those payments.Prepa issued its own statement early Saturday, saying that even though its restructuring deal had \u201cterminated,\u201d it remained willing to pick up the pieces and try to get a new deal. It said the talks broke down because the creditors had said they were willing to roll back the expiration date from Friday to Feb. 12, but tried to impose new requirements in exchange. \u201cPrepa had rejected these same conditions in December 2015,\u201d the utility said in its statement.The negotiations have been underway since 2014, when Prepa ran out of cash, precipitating a crisis, and creditors agreed to refrain from enforcing their claims. As part of their forbearance agreement, they allowed Prepa to dip into prepaid reserves to make bond payments, something that could otherwise be considered an event of default.The Puerto Rico Legislature also needed to approve the deal. Some lawmakers said Prepa and its creditors were rushing to close the deal before the island\u2019s new public utility commission \u2014 the first independent regulator in Prepa\u2019s 75-year history \u2014 could properly review it.The creditors expected the Legislature to approve the deal in December. When that did not happen, they said they would wait until Jan. 22. The creditors also offered to buy an additional $115 million of bonds from Prepa to help cover the cost of a debt-service payment that the utility made on Jan. 1.But as the deadline loomed this week, lawmakers said they were still not ready to approve the agreement. One person familiar with the negotiations said the creditors were willing to wait until Feb. 12 for the enabling law, but tried to make the $115 million financing mechanism contingent on the new public-utility commission signing off on the increase in the base rate by then. The person, who spoke anonymously, said the commission could not work that quickly because it had not been set rates before and would probably need until May.The Prepa creditors said they could not wait that long because, among other things, the Federal Reserve was nudging up interest rates, and the deal had a fixed interest rate that would soon fall behind. Their statement said, \u201cIt was our desire to be as supportive of the legislative process as possible,\u201d and added that they found it \u201cextremely disappointing and perplexing that Prepa has chosen to take this stance.\u201dThe creditors said that they remained open to resuming talks.Prepa\u2019s statement quoted Ms. Donahue as being disappointed as well. \u201cPrepa remains willing to continue discussions,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Rio, the Work Goes in Before the Party Goes On", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Supported byPursuitsNear midnight on a steamy weeknight in January, midsummer in Brazil, a stretch of Estrada do Gale\u00e3o in Rio de Janeiro was closed to traffic. On the crowded sidewalk, in the ghoulish light of streetlamps and shadows, vendors sold beer in bottles and meats on sticks. Above the graffiti-marked doors of storefronts shuttered until morning, silhouettes stood on balconies and in windows.Drums, hundreds of them, pulsed to life. A slow wave of smiling, dancing people snaked slowly down the street, bursting into a song that they had practiced for months.In four weeks, Uni\u00e3o da Ilha, one of the most respected samba schools in Rio, would perform in the world-famous Carnaval at the Samb\u00f3dromo a few miles away. The skinny, half-mile-long arena would be filled with more than 72,000 people. Millions would watch on television.Uni\u00e3o da Ilha\u2019s 3,400 performers \u2014 dancers, singers, drummers \u2014 and its six large, themed floats would be examined by judges in the arena and countless critics everywhere else, then ranked among 11 other top-division samba schools.Only one can win Carnaval. Uni\u00e3o da Ilha never has.But in the evening, back in the quiet of the neighborhood, it was time for Uni\u00e3o da Ilha to rehearse this year\u2019s song, \u201cOlympic in Nature,\u201d a theme chosen for the Summer Games that are coming to Rio in August.\u201cIlha! Raz\u00e3o do meu viver!\u201d (\u201cIsland! Reason I live!\u201d) everyone shouted, arms waving in unison, at the song\u2019s end. With barely a pause in the drums or a breath for the singers, the song repeated, echoing relentlessly through the neighborhood on a 90-minute loop. At Carnaval, schools have 82 minutes to parade, meaning that songs are performed in succession roughly 30 times.The rehearsal parade moved slowly down the street, each of the school\u2019s 31 sections (about 100 people assigned to each) distinguished by matching T-shirts or other rehearsal gear, like the African-influenced headscarves on the older, whirling women called baianas. When it came time for Carnaval, they would don enormous hoop skirts, 6.6 yards in circumference at the ankles and weighing more than 80 pounds.The song\u2019s melody came from ukulele-like cavaquinhos, overwhelmed by a battery of drummers banging furiously on an array of percussive instruments. The basslike surdo, the heartbeat of any samba song, set the pace. The plate-size, tinny tamborim, struck rapidly with a stick \u2014 often two-pronged, like a snake\u2019s tongue \u2014 escalated the volume and chaos.A truck loaded with speakers trailed the procession, pushing it along with the high-decibel octane of 10 singers shouting into microphones.Eduardo Cerqueira, Uni\u00e3o da Ilha\u2019s Carnaval director, has the job of keeping the disparate parts of the operation on track. Every year, every school spends millions of dollars and thousands of hours preparing for their one pass through Samb\u00f3dromo. Every year, every school wonders if it has done enough to be ready.Every year, at some point, Mr. Cerqueira momentarily believes that Uni\u00e3o da Ilha will not make it. \u201cToday is that time,\u201d he said with a tired smile.Like soccer teams, each has a logo and colors. The biggest of the roughly 200 samba schools compete in Carnaval, the festival of celebration tied to the Lenten calendar, highlighted by the unique spectacle of its samba parades. This year, six first-division schools are to parade on Feb. 7, the other six on Feb. 8.The parades are an orgy for the senses \u2014 giant floats with moving parts, thousands of dancers in full costumes, earsplitting music, gut-thumping drums, heart-lifting choruses. Over most of a year, every school conjures a theme, writes a samba song and mashes it together into a circus of color and joy. And feathers. Lots of feathers.\u201cIf there are seven arts, with cinema being No. 7, then Carnaval is No. 8,\u201d said Milton Cunha, known in Brazil as an eccentric Globo television commentator and a former carnavalesco, the term for the samba school art directors widely recognized for their annual creations.On a recent Saturday afternoon, Mr. Cunha sat at the rail of a balcony at Mangueira, one of Rio\u2019s most popular schools \u2014 in a Rio de Janeiro soccer analogy, the Flamengo of samba. Mangueira\u2019s pink-and-green building, typical of samba schools, is a two-story fortress surrounding an enormous courtyard that serves as a dance hall.Below Mr. Cunha, more than a thousand people pulsed to the beat of a band on a stage. Conversation was nearly impossible over the music and the singing. Sweat dripped from even those standing still.The event was a feijoada, a fund-raiser common to all samba schools. More than 1,500 people came to Mangueira in the afternoon and were fed feijoada, a traditional stew of black beans, white rice and chunks of beef and pork. They stayed and danced deep into the night in a sweltering box.Mangueira\u2019s metal roof was retractable, and when it opened, like cracking a lid to let the steam out, it revealed Mangueira\u2019s backdrop, a hillside favela that envelops the school on three sides.\u201cSamba is the art of the poor people,\u201d said Aydano Andr\u00e9 Motta, a journalist who has covered Carnaval for decades and written books on the subject. \u201cIt is the one thing that is organized in their lives. It centers these neighborhoods.\u201dWhile the Carnaval parades look like slickly produced and choreographed undertakings, they are created and performed mostly by tens of thousands from Rio\u2019s poorest neighborhoods. Most practice their school\u2019s song at neighborhood rehearsals throughout the year, paid only with a costume. Others work at Samba City building floats and costumes.\u201cIt is a Broadway show, but with no rehearsal,\u201d said Paulo Barros, now the best-known carnavalesco, who creates the theme, writes the story, designs floats and costumes and oversees production. \u201cWe work all year for a show that happens one time, for a parade that last 82 minutes.\u201dMr. Barros\u2019s productions for various samba schools have won Carnaval three times. Top carnavalescos like Mr. Barros often move from school to school, like coaches of professional sports teams, and can command annual salaries of 1 million Brazilian reais (roughly $250,000 and sinking with Brazil\u2019s economy); this year he is working with Portela.In the months before Carnaval, they oversee roughly 200 workers creating floats and costumes. On a recent afternoon, Mr. Barros stood inside Portela\u2019s sweltering Samba City operation, consumed by the smells of glue and paint and the sounds of power tools and hammers.For Portela this year, Mr. Barros had chosen a time-travel theme, a trip through Earth\u2019s history led by the school\u2019s eagle mascot.There was a float that evoked Greek ruins, another for Egypt and another for Eldorado, the lost city of gold. There was Gulliver, about 100 feet long and lying on his back, wearing Converse All-Stars, and an archaeological dig in which dinosaurs, Mr. Barros said, will come to life midparade and eat the scientists. And there was a silver spaceship inspired by the television series \u201cLost in Space,\u201d circled with dozens of robot suits that will be filled by dancers during the parade. It was the only one of the floats that looked finished.\u201cMy goal is to be ready for Carnaval 15 days before,\u201d Mr. Barros said. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible in Brazil.\u201dTia Ben\u00e9 has been a twirling baiana at Uni\u00e3o da Ilha since 1953, when her husband and some friends formed the samba school. She is 85 now, her face deeply contoured. After the rehearsal parade on Estrada do Gale\u00e3o ended, she sat outside with friends who poured beer from bottles and munched on French fries from a nearby stand. They had been practicing for this Carnaval parade every Wednesday and Saturday night since June.\u201cAt the parade, there are fireworks to announce when the next school is coming,\u201d Ms. Ben\u00e9 said. \u201cAnd when I hear them, I still cry, even after all these years.\u201dSchools, open to visitors, have unique personalities. Salgueiro, a longtime samba power, feels relatively wealthy \u2014 the red-and-white walls of its dance floor are lined with electric sponsor signs, a gift shop sells souvenirs, and buses idle down the street, waiting to take tourists back to their beach-front hotels.Imperatriz, bathed in green, has more of a neighborhood vibe. On the spectrum of flash, the blue-tinged Portela sits somewhere between.The biggest schools have Carnaval budgets of roughly 10 million reais (about $2.5 million). The city and state of Rio de Janeiro give top schools 1 million reais in seed money, doubled this year to help the schools combat Brazil\u2019s collapsing economy. Globo, the media company, and Petrobr\u00e1s, the scandal-embroiled state oil company, pump support into the schools, too.But historically, an untold chunk of money for some schools has come from jogo do bicho (animal game), an underground lottery in many neighborhoods run by mafia-like kingpins. When Beija-Flor won for the first time in 1976, it brazenly portrayed jogo do bicho in its parade. Now it is a samba power.Some schools accept sponsorships in exchange for creative control. While commercial logos are not allowed in the parade, the food giant Danone paid Porto da Pedra to do a theme on the history of dairy products in 2012. Controversy erupted last year when Beija-Flor won with its theme on Equatorial Guinea, funded largely by the African dictatorship.While commercialism has invaded Carnaval (tourism officials claim an infusion of 3 billion reais into the economy), the samba schools still feel like mom-and-pop operations. It raises the question of why social clubs in poor Rio neighborhoods spend so much time, energy and money on something so seemingly frivolous as a parade.\u201cI have no answer for this,\u201d Andr\u00e9 Bonatti, the cultural director at Imperatriz, said with a laugh. He paused, then continued: \u201cYou don\u2019t think just about the financial investment. You think about the human investment. We have some professionals working here. But more important are the thousands of people in the parade. They don\u2019t have salaries. But they have love.\u201dBrazil\u2019s withering economy has forced schools to cut costs, even recycling feathers and fabric from last year\u2019s productions. Restraint may not be obvious during this year\u2019s spectacle, but most schools are using one or two fewer floats and a few hundred fewer people. Some have suggested that the effect on Carnaval might be a good thing.Jos\u00e9 In\u00e1cio dos Santos, one of samba\u2019s top composers under the artistic name Z\u00e9 Katimba, was a founder of Imperatriz in 1959. He misses the old days, when winning schools touched hearts with emotion rather than trying to dazzle eyes with production.But receding budgets mean fewer floats, fewer participants and a chance to slow the songs without worrying whether the beat will move the giant procession through Samb\u00f3dromo in the allotted time.\u201cThis year we\u2019ll have about 3,300 people, a bit smaller, so we don\u2019t have to hurry,\u201d said Z\u00e9 Katimba, whose song for Imperatriz this year is several beats per minute slower than usual. \u201cPeople can slow down, be more moved.\u201dHe began to sing \u201cIs Today the Day?,\u201d a Uni\u00e3o da Ilha song from 1982 considered a classic. It sounded like a lullaby.\u201cI wish we still had great samba songs like that,\u201d he said.Days later, on a steamy Sunday night, Uni\u00e3o da Ilha took its turn with its one allowed rehearsal inside the Samb\u00f3dromo. The floats and costumes were still at Samba City, under construction, but under bright fluorescent stadium lights, more than 3,000 people in 31 sections marched down the 800-meter strip, as wide as a two-lane road, with a dashed line down the middle.There were so many people shimmying down the track that the ones in front reached the end before the ones in back even began.In a few weeks, those same people would be festooned with costumes amid audacious floats. The stands would be packed. Judges would scour for missteps and sour notes. Cameras would send the images across Brazil and around the world.And when the fireworks go off to introduce Uni\u00e3o da Ilha, deep inside the section of baianas, an 85-year-old woman in a cumbersome hoop skirt might just shed a tear. It\u2019s only 11 miles from the samba school to the Samb\u00f3dromo, but it can feel much farther.Helena Rebello contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Subprime Reasoning on Housing", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsIT has become part of the accepted history of our time: The bursting of the housing bubble was the primary cause of a financial crisis, a sharp recession and prolonged slow growth. The story makes intuitive sense, since the economic crisis included a collapse in the prices of housing and related securities. The movie \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d which is based on a book by Michael Lewis, takes this cause-and-effect relationship as a given.But there is an alternative story. In recent months, Senator Ted Cruz has become the most prominent politician to give voice to the theory that the Federal Reserve caused the crisis by tightening monetary policy in 2008. While Mr. Cruz (who is an old friend of one of the authors of this article) has been criticized for making this claim, he shouldn\u2019t back down. He\u2019s right, and our understanding of the great recession needs to be revised.What the housing-centric view underemphasizes is that the housing bust started in early 2006, more than two years before the economic crisis. In 2006 and 2007, construction employment fell, but overall employment continued to grow, as did the economy generally. Money and labor merely shifted from housing to other sectors of the economy.This housing decline caused financial stress by sowing uncertainty about the value of bonds backed by subprime mortgages. These bonds served as collateral for institutional investors who parked their money overnight with financial firms on Wall Street in the \u201cshadow banking\u201d system. As their concerns about the bonds grew, investors began to pull money out of this system.In retrospect, economists have concluded that a recession began in December 2007. But this recession started very mildly. Through early 2008, even as investors kept pulling money out of the shadow banks, key economic indicators such as inflation and nominal spending \u2014 the total amount of dollars being spent throughout the economy \u2014 barely budged. It looked as if the economy would be relatively unscathed, as many forecasters were saying at the time. The problem was manageable: According to Gary Gorton, an economist at Yale, roughly 6 percent of banking assets were tied to subprime mortgages in 2007.It took a bigger shock to the economy to bring the financial system down. That shock was tighter money. Through acts and omissions, the Fed kept interest rates and expected interest rates higher than appropriate, depressing the economy. This point is easy to miss because the Fed lowered interest rates between September 2007 and April 2008. But raising rates is not the only route to tighter money.Between late April and early October, the Fed kept the interest rate over which it has most direct control, the federal funds rate, at 2 percent. But when the economy weakens, the \u201cnatural\u201d interest rate \u2014 the rate that keeps the economy on an even keel \u2014 falls. By staying in place, the Fed\u2019s target interest rate was rising relative to that natural rate. The gap between expected interest rates and the natural rate was rising even more. Fed officials spent the late spring and summer of 2008 warning that rates would have to rise to combat inflation. Futures markets showed a sharp increase in expected interest rates.Market indicators of expected inflation fell sharply that summer, a sign that the economy was getting weaker and monetary policy tighter. Nominal spending showed the change. After growing for years at a relatively steady rate, it began to drop.In their early August meeting, some Fed policy makers nonetheless anticipated that they would raise rates soon. Inflation expectations and nominal spending kept falling. In mid-September, shortly after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the Fed refused to cut interest rates further, citing the risk of inflation. (To his credit, Chairman Ben Bernanke subsequently admitted that not cutting rates then was a mistake.) It did not cut rates until weeks after the crisis had become undeniable.It was against this backdrop of tighter money that the financial stress of 2007 turned into something far worse in 2008. With nominal spending falling at the fastest rate since the Depression, households, businesses and banks all had incomes lower than they had expected. That made servicing debts and paying wages harder than expected. It also lowered asset values, since those were premised on expected streams of future income.And, of course, the crashing economy made the housing crisis worse, too. That\u2019s why the standard account of the crisis took hold. It\u2019s true, after all, that housing fell and then, along with the economy, plummeted. Untangling cause and effect is tricky. But the timeline is a better match for the theory that the Fed is to blame. The economy started to tank not right after housing began to fall, but right after money tightened.We could have had a decline in housing without a Great Recession. That\u2019s what we went through for two years. What we could not have had without a Great Recession was a decline in nominal spending. If it had cut rates faster, or merely refrained from talking up future rate increases, the Fed might have kept that decline from happening or at least moderated it. Australia had a housing boom and debt bubble, too, but kept a steadier monetary policy. The consequence was a mild correction, but nothing like our Great Recession.It took decades for the Fed\u2019s responsibility for the Great Depression to be widely accepted and it may take that long for most people to see its responsibility this time around. The Fed of 2008 feared inflation too much and recession too little. It placed too little weight on market expectations about future conditions and on how its behavior affected those expectations. If these mistakes go unrecognized, they could well be repeated.David Beckworth is a former economist at the Treasury Department and a visiting scholar at the Mercatus Center; Ramesh Ponnuru is a columnist for Bloomberg View and a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Lincoln Continental Reborn, Ford Renews Push Into China", "Date": "2016-01-12", "News": "Supported byDETROIT \u2014 Last April, Ford Motor announced with fanfare that it would reintroduce its storied Lincoln Continental luxury sedan, with an eye on sales in the expanding Chinese market.But now, as Ford prepares to put the Continental on the market, it faces a far different economic landscape.While the car is expected to bolster Ford\u2019s efforts to reinvigorate the Lincoln brand in the United States, its prospects in China are clouded by an upheaval in the stock market there and a general slowdown in auto sales.\u201cWe are in China for the long term,\u201d said Kumar Galhotra, the Ford executive in charge of the Lincoln division. \u201cIt\u2019s a very vibrant economy that\u2019s going to have short-term ups and downs.\u201dHe said Lincoln sales in China had grown steadily since the brand entered the market in November 2014. Last year, sales topped 11,000 vehicles, but Lincoln had limited recognition among most Chinese consumers.And despite the fluctuations in the Chinese stock market over the last six months and the ripple effect on wealthy car buyers, Mr. Galhotra said he had not seen any effect on the pace of sales.\u201cWe are ahead both in our volume targets and our dealership targets,\u201d he said.In the United States, where it will also go on sale this year, the sedan has a long history, having epitomized elegance in the 1960s before it faded into obscurity and went out of production in 2002.Ford sold 101,000 Lincolns in the United States last year, an increase of 7 percent from 2014.The model will be a notable addition to the brand\u2019s American lineup, but it is meant to be a linchpin in Ford\u2019s broader ambitions for the Lincoln in China.So far, the company has 33 Lincoln dealers in China, with a goal of 60 by the end of the year. With the addition of the Continental, Lincoln will have five models available in China, which Ford\u2019s chief executive, Mark Fields, called \u201cmeaningful progress\u201d for a fledgling brand.Because Ford dropped Continental from the Lincoln portfolio more than a decade ago, the company\u2019s designers had unusual freedom to update the vehicle\u2019s styling and image.To that end, Ford chose to create a car designed as a quiet sanctuary from the outside world. Its designers went to great lengths to include creature comforts that distinguish the Continental from others in the crowded luxury sedan market, like seats that have individual leg adjustments and can provide a massage with the touch of a button.Mr. Fields said the car would find its own niche among more established models sold by BMW and Volkswagen\u2019s Audi brand. \u201cWe are not trying to out-German the Germans,\u201d he said.One analyst said Lincoln could benefit from carving out a new identity in the luxury market.\u201cThere is absolutely a place in the market for a vehicle that promises quiet luxury,\u201d said the analyst, Eric Lyman of the research firm TrueCar. \u201cThe challenge for Continental will be awareness and perception of the Lincoln brand.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Desperate for Slumber in Delhi, Homeless Encounter a \u2018Sleep Mafia\u2019", "Date": "2016-01-18", "News": "Supported byDelhi Journal7 PhotosDELHI, India \u2014 When midnight approaches in Old Delhi and a thick, freezing fog settles over the city, the quilt-wallah Farukh Khan sits on his corner, watching the market for his services come to life.They shuffle up one by one, men desperate for sleep. The bicycle rickshaw pullers, peeling one of his 20-rupee, or 30-cent, quilts off a pile, fold their bodies into strange angles on the four-foot seats of their vehicles. The day laborers curl their bodies on the frigid sidewalk, sometimes spooned against other men for warmth.Those who cannot afford to pay Mr. Khan build fires, out of plastic if necessary, and crouch over them, waiting for the night to be over.The story of privatized sleep follows a familiar pattern in this city: After decades of uncontrolled growth, the city government\u2019s inability to provide services like health care, water, transportation and security has given rise to thriving private industries, efficient enough to fulfill the needs of those who can pay.The moral quandary of making this into a business is at the center of Mr. Sen\u2019s film, which had its premiere at a Mumbai film festival in November. One of his subjects, Ranjit, takes a protective attitude toward his regular \u201csleepers,\u201d as he calls them, allowing them to drift off to sleep watching Bollywood films for 10 rupees a night. Another, a hard-nosed businessman called Jamaal, increases his price to 50 rupees, from 30, when the temperature drops.In one scene, when a man pleads, \u201cSir, I am a poor man; I\u2019ll die,\u201d Jamaal chuckles and replies: \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to die. Even that will cost 1,250 rupees.\u201d\u201cLook, sleep is the most demanding master there is; no one can stop it when it has chosen to arrive,\u201d Jamaal says in the film. \u201cWe were the first to recognize the sheer economic might of sleep.\u201dLike many of this city\u2019s businesses, sleep vendors are both highly organized and officially nonexistent. In Mr. Khan\u2019s neighborhood, four quilt vendors have divided the sidewalks and public spaces into quadrants, and when night falls, their customers arrange themselves into colonies of lumpy forms. Some have returned to the same spot every night for years.A drunken man, his hair matted, stumbled up to Mr. Khan and begged. \u201cBrother, please,\u201d he pleaded, and Mr. Khan uttered a curse under his breath, then grabbed a quilt and thrust it at him.\u201cIf I don\u2019t give him the blanket, he will freeze to death,\u201d he said.Earlier in the week, this had happened, just a block away from Mr. Khan\u2019s spot. The morning street sweeper had tried to rouse a sleeping man from the sidewalk, but he pulled back the blanket and saw that the man\u2019s feet were stiff.The man, who was around 35, had been stumbling around drunkenly the night before. No one knew who he was; a police officer asked some other men to go through his pockets, in hopes of finding identification, but they were empty. He covered the body with a sheet, and it lay on the sidewalk until the mortuary workers came, at sunset.A cluster of \u201cpavement dweller\u201d deaths prompted India\u2019s Supreme Court to rule in 2010 that the country\u2019s large cities must provide shelter for 0.1 percent of the population. This winter, Delhi expanded its shelter system to accommodate more than 18,000, but the number of homeless is vast \u2014 likely more than 100,000, said Ashwin Parulkar, who researches homelessness at the Delhi\u2019s Center for Policy Research.The sleep vendors, Mr. Parulkar said, thrive where the government has failed.\u201cThey are exploiting them,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a slew of public policies for these people that are supposed to bypass this kind of exploitation.\u201dMr. Khan, who has been here for eight years, says he extends credit for regular customers to a limit of 100, or occasionally 200, rupees. (Several shivering men, who had spent the night around a smoldering fire nearby, snorted in disbelief upon hearing this.) He considers boundaries between vendors so sacred that he will not step across them. He makes regular payments to the police and street sweepers so they do not disturb his sleepers, and he maintains close relations with the local pickpockets so that he can tell them whom not to rob.\u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d he said, \u201cbut what would happen if I was not here? More people would die.\u201dHe added, \u201cI have the feeling that I am doing charity.\u201dAmong his clients are the inebriated and the insanely hopeful. Mohammad Sajid, one leg misshapen by polio, was sharing a quilt with a friend, also polio-stricken, whom he had met washing dishes at a food stall. The two men had lost their jobs two weeks earlier, and every day their store of money dwindled: 2 rupees to use public toilets, 5 rupees to bathe, 5 rupees for a half-cup of tea, 10 rupees for half a quilt.His friend was thinking of returning to his village, at least until the cold passed, but Mr. Sajid shook his head.\u201cI will go back,\u201d he said. \u201cBut first I want to make something of myself.\u201dMr. Khan knows better. Come back in five years, he said, and half of these guys will still be here.\u201cEverybody here is a sad story,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy would a happy story come to sleep here?\u201d He poured himself a plastic cup of whiskey. \u201cThey will get up in the morning, use the toilet, and they will be ready for work. The system never finishes.\u201dRavi Mishra contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cuomo Won\u2019t Face Federal Charges Over Moreland Ethics Panel", "Date": "2016-01-11", "News": "Supported byA statement the office released on Monday indicated that \u201cafter a thorough investigation,\u201d it concluded there was \u201cinsufficient evidence to prove a federal crime.\u201dMr. Cuomo had no immediate response, but his counsel, Elkan Abramowitz, thanked Mr. Bharara\u2019s office for acknowledging that no charges would be brought.\u201cWe were always confident there was no illegality here, and we appreciate the U.S. attorney clarifying this for the public record,\u201d Mr. Abramowitz said in a statement.Mr. Bharara\u2019s office also investigated allegations that Mr. Cuomo or others on his behalf had engaged in possible obstruction of justice or witness tampering after the governor ended the panel. Mr. Abramowitz added on Monday that his understanding was that Mr. Bharara\u2019s statement also covered \u201cany suggestion\u201d that wrongdoing had occurred after the panel was closed down.The unusual announcement comes at an opportune moment for the governor, as he is set to unveil ethics reform proposals in his State of the State address on Wednesday.It also brings to a close a bizarre chain of events that began in July 2013, when Mr. Cuomo empaneled the Moreland Commission, only to close it less than a year later. There had been high hopes for the panel, which included some of New York\u2019s most senior prosecutors. The governor promised the commission would be independent, free to chase any leads it found.That investigation found that Mr. Cuomo\u2019s aides repeatedly pressured the commission on where to direct its energies. It also found that the governor\u2019s office interfered with the commission when it was looking into groups that were politically close to him, and had a heavy hand in the writing and editing of the only report the commission ever issued.Albany watchdogs cautioned Mr. Cuomo against crowing too loudly over Mr. Bharara\u2019s decision not to prosecute, saying it did not mean the governor had acted responsibly or appropriately in his handling of the Moreland panel. Still, they said, the news strengthens the governor\u2019s position as he presses for ethics reforms.Still, he added: \u201cThat the U.S. attorney found no sufficient evidence to prosecute the case does not mean that the Moreland Commission was not mishandled or shut down too soon.\u201dMr. Bharara\u2019s statement on Monday said that his office would continue to investigate the cases left unfinished by the commission.\u201cWe continue to have active investigations related to substantive inquiries that were being conducted by the Moreland Commission at the time of its closure,\u201d the statement said.It is rare but hardly unprecedented for federal prosecutors to announce the closing of a criminal investigation without charges being filed, and when that occurs, the statements are typically brief and made in cases which have been previously publicized.Such statements may be seen as particularly important in the political context.\u201cIn circumstances where a cloud has been cast over a political figure, to not lift that cloud can actually mean that the democratic process, including the process of governing, may be warped,\u201d said one former Justice Department official with experience in public corruption cases, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicate nature of such cases.\u201cThe U.S. attorney\u2019s office is loath to cause that to happen when it does not believe a case can be brought,\u201d the official added, \u201cso I\u2019m sure they thought it was the fair and right thing to do for the governor, and for the people of New York, to come out with that statement.\u201dThe statement on Monday did not mention the Buffalo investigation.Susanne Craig, William K.

{"Headline": "Transcript: Preliminary Republican Presidential Debate", "Date": "2016-01-14", "News": "Supported byFollowing is a transcript of the preliminary Republican debate, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.ANNOUNCER: Tonight, the Republican candidates for president are looking to capture their moment. South Carolina has a history of making and breaking campaigns. And this week Charleston is the center of the political universe. Three days from now, the Democrats will debate just a few miles away.Here, in a city older than the country itself, from the Revolutionary War to the Civil War, to the \u201cwar by the shore,\u201d South Carolina prepares once again to take center stage. And the Republican candidates all hope that the spotlight of the Palmetto State would shine upon them.(APPLAUSE)TRISH REGAN, CO-MODERATOR: Good evening, and welcome to the North Charleston Coliseum and Performing Arts Center. Tonight we hear from 10 Republican candidates vying to become the next president of the United States.I\u2019m Trish Regan, along with my co-moderator Sandra Smith.SANDRA SMITH, CO-MODERATOR: This evening FOX Business is bringing you the sixth Republican presidential debate of the 2016 campaign. For the next hour, three of the candidates will be answering the questions voters want answered.REGAN: So let\u2019s introduce them. Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: And former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: This debate will last one hour. Each candidate will have up to 90 seconds to respond to each question, one minute for each follow-up.REGAN: When your time is up, you are going to hear this bell.(BELL RINGS)REGAN: All right. So let\u2019s begin.In Tuesday\u2019s State of the Union Address, the president said that our economy is strong. He cited the significant decline we\u2019ve seen in unemployment rate and the millions of jobs that have been created.What is your assessment of the economy right now? And I would like to hear from all of you on this one, beginning with Ms. Fiorina.CARLY FIORINA (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, thank you. Good evening. If I may begin by saying how honored I am to be standing here with two former Iowa Caucus winners.Governor, Senator.And how honored I am to be talking with all of you. You know, I\u2019m not a political insider. I haven\u2019t spent my lifetime running for office. The truth is I have had and been blessed by a lot of opportunities to do a lot of things in my life.And unlike another woman in this race, I actually love spending time with my husband.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)FIORINA: I\u2019m standing here because I think we have to restore a citizen government in this country. I think we have to end crony capitalism. The crony capitalism that starts with both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.You know, Hillary Clinton sits inside government and rakes in millions, handing out access and favors. And Donald Trump sits outside government and rakes in billions buying people like Hillary Clinton.The state of our economy is not strong. We have record numbers of men out of work. We have record numbers of women living in poverty. We have young people who no longer believe that the American dream applies to them.We have working families whose wages have stagnated for decades, all while the rich get richer, the powerful get more powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected get more connected.Citizens, it\u2019s time to take our country back.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Governor Huckabee, same question to you. Where do you see the country right now?MIKE HUCKABEE (R), FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I wish I saw the country in the same place that the president presented it to be the other night in the State of the Union. He talked about how great the economy was doing. And I guess for the people he hangs out with, it\u2019s probably doing great.But the president should\u2019ve stood in the line at the layaway counter at Walmart just before Christmas. He would have heard a very different story about the economy of America.HUCKABEE: I wish I could introduce him the lady who cleans the building where our campaign headquarters is located in Little Rock. Her name is Kathleen (ph). She works all day at a local hospital cleaning, and then she goes to the building where a bank, and our headquarters, and other offices are she spends another seven hours. She works 15 hours a day.I guarantee you she\u2019s not working 15 hours a day because she loves scrubbing toilets, and sweeping floors. She\u2019s working that many hours because that\u2019s what it takes for her to make it work.And, she\u2019s not alone. There are people all over this country who are working like that. Many of them working two jobs \u2014 and they used to have one job, and that would take care of them. But, because of wage stagnation, which we\u2019ve had for 40 years, because the fact that they\u2019re punished for working harder if they work that many hours. The government gets more of their second shift than they do.And, as a result there are a lot of people who are hurting today. I wish the President knew more of them. He might make a change in the economy and the way he\u2019s managing it.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Thank you Governor Huckabee. Senator Santorum?SANTORUM: Well, all he has to do is listen to the Democratic debate and find out how bad the economy is. All they do is complain about the hollowing out of the middle of America, and how America is struggling so badly, and have to make these radical changes in Washington.But they\u2019ve been in control for the last seven years, and what have we seen? The most important jobs, I believe, in this country are the ones that fill the middle. For the 74% of Americans who don\u2019t have a college degree between the age of 25 and 65 are manufacturing jobs. Your governor, and your legislature, and your team here have done an amazing job of bringing manufacturing jobs back to South Carolina.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)SANTORUM: Right here. Right here in Charleston, right down in the street in Boeing (ph). You\u2019ve done a great job, and what\u2019s happened? You\u2019ve grown this economy, you\u2019ve strengthened the center of your state, the middle. That\u2019s because you know that if you\u2019re really going to create wealth and opportunity, you got to get jobs, and good paying jobs for everybody.And, so what\u2019s happened? Two million jobs, manufacturing jobs, have left this country because of Barack Obama. Regulations, EPA, workplace regulations, things driving people off-shore all because of his number one priority, global climate change.Well, let me tell you this, Mr. President. For every dollar of GDP, China creates five times as much pollution as we do here. You want to \u2014 lower global climate change, bring those jobs back to America and let American workers do that job with less pollution.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Thank you, Senator Santorum. Thank you, candidates.Moving to the world stage. The middle east is on the brink of chaos. Iran continues to provoke the United States, North Korea claims it\u2019s tested a hydrogen bomb, and Afghanistan is in danger of falling back into Taliban hands. Critics of the administration say it\u2019s all due to lack of U.S. leadership.To you, Mrs. Fiorina, how do you see America\u2019s role in the world today?FIORINA: America must lead because when we do not lead, when this exceptional nation does not lead, the world is more dangerous and a more tragic place.Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, they all refuse to lead. Worse, they refuse to respond when this nation is provoked. Hillary Clinton famously asked what difference does it make how four Americans died in Benghazi?Mrs. Clinton, here\u2019s what difference it makes. When you do not stand up and say the truth, that this was a purposeful terrorist attack, when you do not say the United States of America will retaliate for that attack, terrorists assume it\u2019s open season.We have refused to respond to every provocation. The President wouldn\u2019t even mention the fact that Iran had taken two Navy boats and our sailors \u2014 hostage. He didn\u2019t mention the fact that they violated the Geneva convention. He didn\u2019t respond to the fact that Iran launched two ballistic missile just a short time ago, in direct violation of a deal they had just signed. We didn\u2019t respond to the fact that North Korea attacked Sony Pictures.When we refuse to respond over, and over to provocation and bad behavior, we will get more provocation and bad behavior. I know most of our allies personally. I have met many of our adversaries. I know our military and our intelligence capability, and I know this. When we will not stand with our allies, when we will not respond to our adversaries, when we do not lead in the world the world is a dangerous and tragic place. I will be a Commander in Chief who will lead.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Thank you.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Well, since we\u2019ve been talking about the Middle East, Senator Santorum, conflicts between Saudi Arabia and Iran have certainly escalated, amid accusations that Saudi Arabia bombed the Iranian Embassy in Yemen after the Saudi Embassy in Tehran was attacked.As we confront an increasingly unstable Middle East, how will you, as president, navigate this administration\u2019s promises to Iran while standing by our historic allies in the region?RICK SANTORUM (R-PA), FORMER SENATOR, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, the historic promises that we have made to \u2014 to Iran in this agreement need to be torn up on the first day in office of the next president.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: And let me tell you why, because Iran has already torn it up. Iran has not approved the agreement that President Obama has said that they have approved. They have approved a different agreement in their parliament.The fact of the matter is they have violated this agreement. Carly just mentioned some of those violations.They have launched ballistic missiles, tested them, in clear violation.And here\u2019s the pathetic part. The president announced that they were going to impose sanctions. And then President Rouhani went on Twitter and said there would be retaliation.And what did we do?We backed down.Ladies and gentlemen, there are 50 some Citadel cadets in this audience tonight.(APPLAUSE) SANTORUM: I would ask them to stand up if they will. And here\u2019s what I want to tell each and every one of them, as you stand. Here\u2019s what I want to tell them.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: Whether it\u2019s you\u2019re watching that movie this weekend that just came out when we abandoned our men and women in Benghazi, or whether it\u2019s we treat Iran, that gave courtesies to our sailors, as they made them record a hostage video, let me tell you this, if you choose to serve this country, I will have your back. I will not let America be trampled upon anymore by these radical jihadists.REGAN: Thank you, Senator Santorum.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Governor Huckabee, in Afghanistan, the Taliban is strengthening. Attacks are on the rise and thousands more civilians have been wounded or killed. Much of the Taliban surge can be attributed to the withdrawal of U.S. forces there.You have expressed skepticism with the war there, saying you see no end game in sight.What, then, is your solution to the growing conflict there?MIKE HUCKABEE (R-AK), FORMER GOVERNOR, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Let me put that in context. When I went to Afghanistan, I saw a land that looked like the land of the Flintstones. It was desolate. It was barren. It was primitive.And it\u2019s been that way for thousands of years. They want to take the world back to be just like that.We don\u2019t.We need to make a clear goal as to why we want to be anywhere in the Middle East, and I\u2019ll tell you why we want to be and need to be, is to destroy radical Islam and everything that threatens civilization. It\u2019s not just a threat...(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: \u2014 to Israel or to America, it\u2019s a threat to every civilized person on this Earth. And we need to be equipping not only the Kurds in Iraq, we need to be making sure that those who are willing to fight radical Muslims will do it, but we need to never ever spend a drop of American blood unless there is a clearly defined goal and we can\u2019t make sure we win unless we have a military that\u2019s the strongest in the history of mankind.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.We\u2019ve got to rebuild our navy. It\u2019s the smallest navy we\u2019ve had since 1915, when my grandfather got on a destroyer in World War I when he was in the U.S. Navy. We\u2019ve got young men in Air Force B-52s, one in particular, he\u2019s flying a B-52 that his father flew in the \u201980s and his grandfather flew in the \u201950s. Those planes are older than me.We\u2019ve got to have a military that the world is afraid of, use it sparingly, but when we do, the whole world will know that America is on their tail and they will be on their tail on the ground, never ever to rise up again.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Governor Huckabee, if I could just follow-up with that.Do we need to be in Afghanistan?HUCKABEE: Only if there is a concerted effort to destroy the advance of radical Islamists who are against us. As far as what are we going to make it look like. Frankly, I don\u2019t know what we can make it look like. You can\u2019t create for other people a desire for freedom and democracy.And frankly, that is not the role of the United States. The role of the United States military is not to build schools, it is not to build bridges, it is not to go around and pass out food packets.It is to kill and destroy our enemy and make America safe and that is the purpose we should be there if we\u2019re going to be there.REGAN: Thank you Governor Huckabee.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Ms. Fiorina, nearly 600 women say they were attacked in a German city on New Year\u2019s Eve by men of Arab or North African descent and 45 percent of those alleged attacks were sexual assaults. Twenty-two of those 32 men arrested so far are asylum-seekers. Are you worried about similar problems in the United States?FIORINA: Of course I\u2019m worried about similar problems in the United States. We can not allow refugees to enter this country unless we can adequately vet them and we know we can\u2019t. Therefore we should stop allowing refugees into this country.(APPLAUSE)FIORINA: And by the way, we do not need to be lectured about why we\u2019re angry and frustrated and fearful because we\u2019ve had an illegal immigration problem in this country for 25 years.(APPLAUSE)FIORINA: And we have every right to be frustrated about the fact that politicians stand up in election after election after election and promise us to fix the problem and yet, it has never been fixed.I offer leadership that understands that actions speak louder than words, that results count. We must secure our border. We must fix our broken immigration system. We must enforce a pro-American immigration system that serves our interests, not the rest of the world. I understand what it takes to translate goals into results and that is what I will do as president of the United States. Of course, we should be worried, for heavens sakes.This administration has now told us they don\u2019t know who has overstayed a visa. This administration has told us they don\u2019t even bother to check Facebook or Twitter to find out who\u2019s pledging allegiance to jihadis. We can do better than this, citizens. We need to take our country back.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: I want to stay with you on this. The world shares a common enemy right now in the way of ISIS. Russia, the European Union, Saudi Arabia, Iran, China, we all agree ISIS is a threat and it must be stopped.During World War II, the world partnered with Joseph Stalin, who was arguably one of the most formidable \u2014 despicable figures of the 20th century. But they partnered with him to fight the Nazis.Today, everyone seems to agree we need some kind of coalition to fight ISIS. Do you agree with that? And if so, would your coalition include possibly, Russia and Iran?FIORINA: We need to be very clear-eyed now about who are our allies and who are our adversaries. In the fight against ISIS, Saudi Arabia is our ally. Iran is our adversary. And despite Donald trump\u2019s bromance with Vladmir Putin, Vladmir Putin and Russia are our adversary. We can not...(APPLAUSE)FIORINA: We can not outsource leadership in the Middle East to Iran and Russia. We must stand and lead. The Kuwaitis, the Jordanians, the Saudis, Egyptians, Bahrainis (sic), the Emirates, the Kurds. I know virtually all of these nations and their leaders. And they have asked us for very specific kinds of support: bombs, material, arms, intelligence.We are not providing any of it today. I will provide all of it. We have allies who will stand up and help us deny ISIS territory, which is what we must do to defeat them. We must deny them territory. They will help us do this. And yes, we need a coalition.But only in the United States of America can lead such a coalition. I will lead it. But we must be clear-eyed through this fight. Iran is our adversary. Russia is our adversary. We can never outsource our leadership. Only the United States of America can lead to defeat ISIS. I will.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Ms. Fiorina, thank you.SMITH: All right, thank you, candidates. We\u2019re just getting started. Jobs, Homeland Security, gun rights, all those issues are coming up straight ahead. We\u2019re live from North Charleston and the Republican Presidential Debate. We\u2019ll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Welcome back, everyone, to the Republican presidential debate. On to the next round of questions \u2014 Sandra.SMITH: All right, let\u2019s get started. Senator Santorum, to you first. President Obama has urged technology leaders to make it hard for terrorists to use technology to escape from justice. Hillary Clinton says social media companies can help by swiftly shutting down terrorist accounts.The companies say that they\u2019re already working with law enforcement and any proposed legislation would do more harm than good. Should companies like Facebook and Twitter be required by law to more actively \u2014 be more actively engaged in fighting terror?SANTORUM: I would just say that if we were doing a better job within the government, we wouldn\u2019t need the private sector to do the things that we\u2019re asking them to do.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: I\u2019ve had a little experience in this in the private sector myself. And what I found was a government with layers and layers of bureaucracy, of people who had some technical expertise but they had no authority, number one.And one of the things I found out about in the bureaucracy is if a lot of people have authority, nobody has authority, number one. And number two, that if you don\u2019t do anything, you don\u2019t get fired.It\u2019s only when you do something and something goes wrong, you get fired. So they do nothing. And that\u2019s what is happening in our Defense Department right now. We have a capability that they\u2019re trying to develop to play defense.We have a lot of technologists that are very skilled. And they\u2019re trying to figure out how to play defense. But what we don\u2019t have is we don\u2019t have folks who are thinking about offense.We don\u2019t have war-fighters. We have technologists. Technologists are not war-fighters. Technologists are thinking, how do I protect cyber-security, how do I secure, how do I protect?SANTORUM: And we need to have a much more dynamic, how do we \u2014 how do we go after them?How do we respond?And we need leadership that\u2019s willing to make sure that when someone attacks us \u2014 and ladies and gentlemen, they\u2019re attacking us as we speak. They\u2019re attacking us all day every day, not just the government, but they\u2019re attacking private sector companies all day every day.They have to learn that we\u2019re going to pay \u2014 they\u2019re going to pay a price when they do so.And then right now, just like in every other aspect of our national security, people who attack us are not paying a price. We need a leader who will make sure that they know when they mess with America, they\u2019re going to pay a price.SMITH: Senator, would you \u2014 would you require anything of those companies like Facebook and Twitter if you were president?SANTORUM: Look, Facebook and Twitter can teach us things. We can cooperate with them. We can share ideas and information. But this is a \u2014 and this is a very dicey area for the government to go in and require the industry to do its job.It needs to develop that capability. We need to be \u2014 have responsible dialogue, but I don\u2019t think requirements are the order of the day.SMITH: Thank you, Senator.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Ms. Fiorina, the president has just issued an executive order to expand the gun laws and background checks. And none of you on stage agree with this.But recent polls show the majority of Americans are in favor of universal background checks.(BOOS)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not in this room.REGAN: It\u2019s the poll data.(CROSSTALK)FIORINA: And we all believe the polling data all the time, don\u2019t we?REGAN: So tell me...(APPLAUSE)REGAN: \u2014 why, in your view, is the president\u2019s proposal a problem?FIORINA: Oh, it\u2019s a problem for so many reasons.First of all, it is yet another lawless executive order. You see, he doesn\u2019t like the fact that Congress has rejected his ideas twice on a bipartisan basis, so he\u2019s decided he just gets to override them.Sorry, Mr. President, not the way \u201cThe Constitution\u201d works.Secondly...(APPLAUSE)FIORINA: \u2014 secondly, he basically admitted in that speech that he hasn\u2019t been paying much attention to enforcing the laws we have. He said, gee, we need a few more FBI agents. That would have helped, perhaps, stop a tragedy here in South Carolina with Dylann Roof, a guy who clearly never should have been sold a gun.In other words, Mr. President, you\u2019re right, we need to enforce the laws we have. Let\u2019s enforce the laws we have. There are criminals running around with guns who shouldn\u2019t have them. We don\u2019t prosecute any of them. Less than 1 percent.But I want to go back to the technology issue for a moment, if I may, as well, because in this regard, I disagree with Senator Santorum. Look, I come from the technology industry and I can tell you there is one thing that bureaucracies don\u2019t know how to do. They do not know how to innovate.We have come seven generations of technology since 2011. We have bureaucracies that are incapable of bringing in that innovation.So, yes, there are some very specific things that we should ask the private sector to help us with, including making sure we have the latest and greatest in algorithms to search through all these databases so that we find terrorists before they attack us, not after it\u2019s too late.And, finally, when a president who understands technology in the Oval Office. Mrs. Clinton, actually, you cannot wipe a server with a towel.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Ms. Fiorina, you\u2019ve said that was when you were CEO of HP, you actually worked with the government.FIORINA: Yes, and see...REGAN: \u2014 to try and combat some of these terrorist threats.FIORINA: As CEO of Hewlett Packard...REGAN: What did you do?FIORINA: As CEO of Hewlett Packard, I was asked very specifically for some very real help. The help I was asked to provide, this is now public information. So I am not revealing what \u2014 something that was \u2014 was classified.We had a very large shipment of equipment, software and hardware, headed to a retail outlet. And I was called by the head of the NSA, who had an urgent need for that capability, to begin laying out a program to track terrorists.History suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.We turned that truck around on a highway and it was escorted to the headquarters in San Jose.In World War II, our government went to the private sector and said, help us do things that we cannot do.The private sector has capabilities that the government does not have. There are some legal authorities that are required.The Sony attack could have been detected and repelled, had legal authorities been passed in Congress allowing private networks and public networks to work together.Those legal authorities have not yet been passed.Yes, I was asked to help.(RINGS BELL)FIORINA: I know the technology industry. They will help again. But they must be asked by a president who understands what they have.REGAN: Ms. Fiorina, thank you.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: All right, Governor Huckabee, you called President Obama\u2019s executive orders on gun control unconstitutional and completely insane.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: (LAUGHING) Yes, I did.SMITH: You even told gun store owners to ignore the President\u2019s orders.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Yet, innocent people are dying from gun violence in cities like Detroit, Chicago, and Charleston everyday. Is there anything that can be done at the federal level to prevent guns from falling into the hands of criminals?HUCKABEE: Well, why don\u2019t we start by making sure the Justice Department never does an idiotic program like Fast and Furious where the U.S. Government put guns...(CHEERING)HUCKABEE: ...in the hands of Mexican drug lords...(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: ...and end up killing one of our border agents. You know, they want to talk about law abiding citizens, I just find it amazing the President keeps saying the gun show loophole. There is no gun show loophole. I promise you I\u2019ve been to more gun shows than President Obama.SMITH: (LAUGHING)HUCKABEE: And, I\u2019ve bought more weapons at them, and you fill out forms. The President also says things that it\u2019s easier to get a gun now than it is to grow trees. Again, I purchase guns, and I can assure you that it is much more difficult to purchase a firearm than it is to get the ingredients of a salad at the supermarket.What the President keeps pushing are ideas that have never worked. Ideas that would not have stopped San Bernadino, Sandy Hook, Aurora, and at some point you wonder if you keep retrying things that don\u2019t work, maybe we should just see if we could resell all those used lottery tickets that didn\u2019t work real well because that\u2019s the logic of just keep doing the same thing, but something that has failed. Of course, we want to stop gun violence, but the one common thing that has happened in most mass shootings is that they happened in gun- free zones where people who would have been law abiding citizens, who could have stood up and at least tried to stop it and we\u2019re not allowed to under the law.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Thank you, Governor Huckabee.REGAN: Governor Huckabee, an American in San Bernardino murdered 14 people while terrorists with Belgian and French passports murdered 130 people. Were facing a threat within our borders, and from outside the United States. Those European terrorists, they could have come here at any time given that we have a visa waiver program that enables people to travel back and forth. It exists within those countries, and 36 others.In countries around the world, including many in Europe, cannot ensure that their citizens are not jihadists, why are we waiving the visa requirement at all?HUCKABEE: Well, we shouldn\u2019t be and that\u2019s one of the reasons that I think there a lot of voices in our country who are saying it\u2019s time to relook (ph) at the visa program. The European Union is a failure, it\u2019s not allowed for even the economic goals that they were trying to achieve.But, what we\u2019re not seeing is that it\u2019s making Europe less safe, and it\u2019s proven not to be exactly what they all thought it was going to be.Our first and foremost responsibility in this country, and the first responsibility of the President of the United States is protect America, and protect Americans. We have a President who seems to be more interested in protecting the reputation and image of Islam than he is protecting us. And, I want to be very clear...(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: ...that this President.(CHEERING)HUCKABEE: Makes comments like he did the other night, that we have to be so careful because we don\u2019t want to offend Muslims. He needs to read his own FBI crime stats from last year which would show him that of the hate crimes in the country, over 5,500, about 1,100 were religious hate crimes. And, of those, 58% were directed toward Jews. Only 16% directed toward Muslims.Maybe what the President should have talked about the other night is how we ought to be more careful in the anti-semitic comments that are going toward American Jews than toward Muslims because by three times as many...(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: ...they\u2019re being targeted for religious hate crime.REGAN: If you get the visa waiver program, does that shut down international commerce?HUCKABEE: It does not shut down international commerce, but it may slow it down. And, you don\u2019t want to slowdown commerce that is making us safer. It\u2019s worth it. This lady who came and joined with the San Bernardino killer had passed three background checks, and that\u2019s why a lot of Americans didn\u2019t buy it when the President said we\u2019ll bring in Syrian refugees, but don\u2019t worry we\u2019ll check them out.We have a lot of confidence in a president who told us that we could keep our doctor, we could keep our health insurance, and cost us less, and now the latest is if you like your gun you can keep it too, and frankly, we don\u2019t buy it. We don\u2019t believe it. He\u2019s lost his credibility, and his inept...(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: ...inability to work with Congress and pass legislation has led him to do what I never even imagined doing as a governor, and that\u2019s just going and doing it my own way.MOREHUCKABEE: That\u2019s why we elect a president, is to lead, is to be able to shepherd things through. And if I can do it with a 90 percent Democrat legislature in Arkansas, there is no excuse for any president not being able to lead in Washington if he knows what the heck he is doing when he gets there.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Thank you, Governor Huckabee.SMITH: Senator Santorum, many of our military leaders believe America\u2019s critical infrastructure is vulnerable to a terrorist attack. This is the power in our homes, the water we drink, the Internet and phone systems by which we stay connected.If attacked, these essential services that underpin American society could come to a grinding halt. Do you have a specific plan to protect us from this type of attack?SANTORUM: Well, the most devastating attack that could occur is an electromagnetic pulse attack, and that would be an attack that would be triggered by a nuclear explosion in the upper atmosphere of our country.The best way to stop that from happening is to make sure that those who contemplating and actually war-gaming and talking about using it, Iran, doesn\u2019t get a nuclear weapon so they can\u2019t explode that device.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: And the president of the United States has put Iran on a path to a nuclear weapon. And we have done nothing to do anything to harden our grid. There is actually a bill in Congress that would put money forward to try to put redundancy and harden our electric grid so it could actually survive an EMP.An EMP is a devastating explosion that sends a pulse that knocks out all electric, everything, everything that is connected to any kind \u2014 that is wired, that has a circuit board gets fried out. Everything is gone. Cars stop. Planes fall out of the sky.This is a devastating attack. And this president has done nothing, number one, to take the most probable person to \u2014 probable country to launch an attack and stop them, and has done nothing to try to defend us, particularly our electric grid. The bottom line is, I put the original sanctions on the Iranian nuclear program when I was in the United States Senate. I\u2019ve been fighting for 12 years with one thing in mind, that we must stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. And...(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: Because they\u2019re different than every other country. They do not want a nuclear weapon to defend themselves. They want a nuclear weapon to have theological ends to bring about their mahdi so they can control the world. And that is the most serious threat facing this country right now.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Senator Santorum, I want to stay with you on this, moving to jobs and the economy. In his State of the Union Address the other night, President Obama touted his record on jobs, citing more than 14 million new jobs and boasted of nearly 900,000 manufacturing jobs added in the past six years.Do you dispute his track record of creating jobs?SANTORUM: Well, the numbers just don\u2019t add up. I mean, they have not added manufacturing jobs. Manufacturing jobs have been lost in this country, 2 million of them. The bottom line is that this president has done more to take jobs away from the hard-working people who are struggling the most.And that\u2019s folks who are, as I said, the 74 percent of Americans who don\u2019t have a college degree. And they\u2019re out there talking about, well, we\u2019re going to provide free college for everybody. Well, who is going to pay for it? The 74 percent that don\u2019t have a college degree.They\u2019re not \u2014 nobody is focused. Let\u2019s just be honest, nobody is focused on the people who are struggling the most in America today. We talk about immigration. Talk about the president\u2019s immigration plan. He wants to bring in more and more people into this country. Let people who are here illegally stay in this country.Almost all of the people who are here illegally, and most of the people who came here legally over the last 20 years, they\u2019re working in wage-earning jobs. That is why wages have flat-lined.And we have unfortunately two political parties with most of the candidates in this field for some form of amnesty, some form of allowing people to stay here even though they\u2019re here illegally and for increasing levels of legal immigration.I\u2019m someone who believes that we need to be the party that stands for the American worker. And when we say we need to send people back, I mean we send people back.And let me just make one point. I was in Storm Lake, Iowa, the other day, near a Tyson\u2019s plant, 91 percent of the kids that go to the elementary school there are minority kids. And they said, well, what are you going to do with all of these people, their families, they\u2019ve lived here for a long time?I said, I\u2019m going to give them a gift. I\u2019m going to give them a gift of being able to help the country they were born in.Merge adds XXX were born in.SANTORUM: And I\u2019m going to export America, the education they were able to see. They learned English language. They learned about capitalism. They learned about democracy. You want to stop flow of immigrants?Let\u2019s send six million Mexicans, Hondurans, Guatemalans, El Savadorians...(BELL RINGS)... back into their country, so they can start a renaissance in their country so they won\u2019t be coming over here anymore.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Senator Santorum, thank you.SMITH: Governor Huckabee, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Admiral Mike Mullen, has said the greatest threat to our security is our national debt.Our national debt is now on pace to top $19 trillion. Yet, you as well as Ms. Fiorina have laid forward no plan to reform entitlements. How can you say you\u2019re going to pay down our country\u2019s debt without cutting Social Security or Medicare?HUCKABEE: Well, first of all, let\u2019s just remember that Social Security is not the government\u2019s money, it belongs to the people who had it taken out of their checks involuntarily their entire working lives.(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: For the government to say, well it is fault of working people that we have a Social Security problem, no. It is the fault of a government that used those people\u2019s money for something other than protecting those people\u2019s accounts. So let\u2019s not blame them and punish them.(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: But here is a fact, and I sometimes hear Republicans say well, we\u2019re going to have to cut this and extend the age. You know what I think a lot of times when I hear people say, well, let\u2019s make people work to their 70. That sounds great for white-collar people who sat at a desk most of their lives. You ever talk to somebody that stood on concrete floor for the first 40 years of their working life? Do you think they can stand another five years or 10 years, many of them will retired virtually crippled because they worked hard. And we\u2019re going to punish them some more? I don\u2019t think so. Here\u2019s the fact.(APPLAUSE)HUCAKBEE: Four percent economic growth, we fully fund Social Security and Medicare. Our problem is not that Social Security is just too generous to seniors. It isn\u2019t. Our problem is that our politicians have not created the kind of policies that would bring economic growth.And I still support strongly that we get rid of the 77,000 pages of the monstrous tax code...(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: ... pass the fair tax, supercharge this economy with the rocket fuel that happens with the consumption tax and we don\u2019t have to cut Social Security to any senior who has worked their lifetime for it.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Thank you, Governor Huckabee.SMITH: OK. We\u2019re going to continue this conversation. We\u2019re taking a quick break and then coming up, the candidates\u2019 plans for strengthening the middle class. We\u2019re live in North Charleston with the Republican Presidential Debate. We\u2019ll be right back.MORE(APPLAUSE)(COMMERICAL BREAK)REGAN: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate live from North Charleston.We want to jump right back in.Sandra is kicking it off.SMITH: All right, thanks, Trish.Well, let\u2019s get started with Ms. Fiorina.Today, the middle class represents about 50 percent of the U.S. population, down from about 61 percent back in 1971. That\u2019s according to Pew Research. The same research revealed a widening income gap in America. The rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer.What will you do to strengthen a middle class that is no longer the majority?FIORINA: For decades, the professional political class in both parties has been talking about the middle class. For decades, Republicans in particular have been talking about reducing the size and scope of government, spending less money, reducing the complexity.And yet, for 40 years, the government has gotten bigger and more expensive.We now have a 75,000 plus page tax code, although politicians have run for office for decades promising reform. And all the while, middle class incomes have stagnated.You see, when government gets bigger and bigger, more powerful, the rich get richer, the poor get poorer and the middle class gets squeezed.We need to understand who the job creators are in this country, because we need more jobs to grow the middle class and to grow the wages of the middle class.Who creates jobs?Small businesses, new businesses, family-owned businesses. (APPLAUSE)FIORINA: They create two thirds of the new jobs in this country and they employ half the people.I started out typing for a nine person real estate firm. My husband Frank started out driving a tow truck for a family-owned auto body shop. And we are crushing small businesses and destroying the middle class.So here\u2019s my blueprint to take back America. Let us first actually reform the tax code from 73,000 pages down to three. There\u2019s a 20-year-old plan to do exactly that.And then let us begin piece by piece to focus on every single dollar the government spends, so that we will spend less overall and still have enough for our priorities. And that requires the government to budget the way you do at home \u2014 examine every dollar, cut any dollar, move any dollar. The fancy term for that is zero- based budgeting, but I call it common sense.Citizens, we\u2019ve got to take our country back.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Thank you, Ms. Fiorina.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Governor Huckabee, you know it used to be you could graduate from high school and get a pretty good job at the local factory, enough to take care of your family and yourself. Those days seem to be gone. It\u2019s pretty hard to do that nowadays.Businesses are increasingly turning to automation to increase their productivity levels. It\u2019s happening right here, in fact, at the Boeing factory in North Charleston.The president says automation threatens workers\u2019 ability to get higher wages.Do you agree with that?And if so, do you have a solution?HUCKABEE: Let me go back to the reason so many people are having a hard time getting ahead. The tax system punishes them.Think about this. If you work really hard and you start moving up the economic ladder, you get bumped into a different tax bracket. So the government thinks it deserves more of your hard work than you do.And it\u2019s one of the reasons that no matter how many different reforms you have to a tax on people\u2019s productivity, you\u2019re still taxing their work, their savings. You\u2019re taxing their capital gains, inheritance, dividends, you\u2019re taxing everything that produces something.And it\u2019s way I really believe it\u2019s time to do something bold, not something minute. This is no time for a tap of the hammer, a twist of the screwdriver. It\u2019s time for something big. That\u2019s why the fair tax transforms our economy.(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: And we don\u2019t punish workers. It\u2019s the only way we\u2019re going to get middle class people moving ahead again, because the harder they work, the more they keep. No payroll tax deducted from their checks. They get their entire paycheck.(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: And, one of the most important parts, it\u2019s built on the common sense with which we raised our kids, and trained dogs. You reward behavior you want more of. And, you punish behavior you want less of. That\u2019s how I raise kids, it\u2019s how I trained our dogs, and folks, it\u2019s not that difficult.We now punish the behavior we say we want more of by taxing it, and we reward the behavior that we say we want less of, so if you make a good investment, we punish you with a tax. If you make a bad investment you can write that off and the rest of the taxpayers will help subsidize you, and bail you out.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Thank you very much, Governor Huckabee.Senator Santorum, 40% of babies born today are born to single moms. That\u2019s twice as high as reported back in 1980, and it\u2019s 11 times as high as in 1940. Studies show that children are always better off economically, most often \u2014 and emotionally, with two parents in a household. From a policy perspective, should the government be doing anything to encourage family formation?SANTORUM: You know, we\u2019ve had this debate about the economy, and we haven\u2019t talked the one issue now increasingly even the right, and even the are coming to agreement. I\u2019ve run around doing 300 town hall meetings talking about a book written by a liberal Harvard sociologist, not a normal thing for me to be talking about, but I now name Robert Putnam who wrote a book called, \u201cOur Kids\u201d.And, he wrote this book, I think, ostensibly to support the Democratic argument that the middle of America\u2019s hollowing out, and income gap is widening, and rich are getting richer. When he studied all the information as to what was going on, he realized that the biggest reason that we\u2019re seeing the hollowing out of the middle of America is the breakdown of the American family.The reality is that if you\u2019re a single parent \u2014 a child of a single parent, and you grew up in a single parent family neighborhood, you went to that single parent family school, the chance of you ever, ever reaching the top 20% of income earners is 3% in America. At least \u2014 I don\u2019t know about you, but that\u2019s not good enough. And, we have been too politically correct in this country because we don\u2019t want to offend anybody to fight for the lives of our children. (APPLAUSE)You want \u2014 You want to be shocked? You read the first few chapters of Mr. \u2014 Dr. Putnam\u2019 book. He talks about Port Clinton, Ohio and growing up there in the 1950\u2019s, and how poor kids actually survived and did well, even though they were poor and disadvantaged. But, then he goes to the towns today and these kids are failing, and failing miserably. They don\u2019t even have a shot, and we won\u2019t even have the courage to have leadership at the federal level \u2014 not with legislation, but the most powerful tool a president have, the bully pulpit to encourage each and everyone of you, churches and businesses, and educators, and community leaders to let\u2019s have a national campaign to rebuild the American family, and give every child its birthright which is a Mom and a Dad who loves them.That will change this economy.(CHEERING & APPLAUSE)REGAN: Thank you.SMITH: Thank you, Senator.We\u2019re not finished yet. More Republican Presidential Debate in North Charleston after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)SMITH: Welcome back, it\u2019s time for the closing statements. Candidates will each get one minute, starting with Senator Santorum.Thank you very much, I want to thank the people of Charleston, which has become a little bit of a second home to me, because I am very privileged to have two young men who go to the Citadel here and they\u2019re here tonight, my son John and my son Daniel.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: Ladies and gentlemen, America is frustrated and angry and looking for someone who\u2019s a fighter, but I also think they\u2019re looking for someone who\u2019s a winner. Somebody who can go out there and take on the establishment and make a difference. And take on someone who\u2019s going to be the person who\u2019s going to be between a Republican holding the presidency and that\u2019s Hillary Clinton.And there\u2019s one person on this stage, one person in the race who\u2019s done it and done it repeatedly. I\u2019ve taken on Hillary Clinton on the issues you care about. Partial-birth abortion.Go and google Rick Santorum and Hillary Clinton and there you\u2019ll see a five-minute debate. I\u2019ll let you decide who won the debate. I\u2019ll tell you who won, because we passed the bill and I know I\u2019m out of time but I\u2019m going to take some of Rand Paul\u2019s time here for a second.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: If you\u2019re looking for someone who fought Hillary Clinton on Iran\u2019s sanctions, she was one of four who voted \u2014 who\u2019s deciding vote who voted against Iran\u2019s sanctions, so we didn\u2019t get it in place as earlier as we should have.I\u2019ve fought battles against her. In 1994, I ran against the Clinton machine. James Carville and Paul Begala, ran the race against me when I took on the author of Hillary care.And each one of those battles, I won. You want a fighter, you want a winner, I\u2019d appreciate your vote. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Thank you, Senator Santorum. Governor Mike Huckabee.HUCAKBEE: Well, Rick, I\u2019m pretty sure I did also fight the Clinton machine because every election I was ever in in Arkansas, I assure you, they were behind it, helping finance and campaign for every opponent.And I share with you the understanding that it\u2019s going to be a tough battle. But I spent the first half of my adult life in the private and nonprofit sector, raising a family, understanding how tough it is for people to make it.And that first half of my life is what led me to believe that America needs a different kind of leadership, not people who spent their whole life running from one office to the next, and living off the government dime. And I got involved because I got sick of what I saw.I also believe that there\u2019s got to be some leadership that not only addresses the monetary and military issues of this country, but the moral issues of this country. At the end of every political speech, most of us say, God bless America.But how can he do that when we continue to slaughter 4,000 babies a day?(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: And I want to be the president that treats every person, including the unborn, as a person. And protect them under the 5th and 14th amendments of the constitution. I close with this word from a gentleman in East Texas named Butel Lucre (ph). He\u2019s 100 years old and I met him down in East Texas.HUCKABEE: And he said this to me. \u201cI sure wish, Mike, we had the days when The Ten Commandments were in all of our capitals and in every school, and we prayed again.You know, he may be 100 years old, but I believe some of those old ideas to get this country back where we unapologetically get on our knees before we get on our feet might be the best solutions we\u2019ve ever sought as a country.(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: And I ask for your support and your vote.Thank you.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Thank you, Governor.REGAN: Carly Fiorina?FIORINA: My husband Frank, that I mentioned, I love spending time with. He\u2019s down there. He was real excited the other day because in New Hampshire, he was introduced as my eye candy.(LAUGHTER)FIORINA: You know, everybody out there watching knows this. You cannot wait to see the debate between me and Hillary Clinton. You would pay to see that fight.(APPLAUSE)FIORINA: And that\u2019s because you know I will win. And that\u2019s important. We\u2019ve got to start by beating Hillary Clinton.All of my life, I have been told to sit down and be quiet. Settle. Settle. Don\u2019t challenge the system.That\u2019s what the American people are being told now and we have been told that for way too long \u2014 sit down and be quiet about our God, about our guns, about the abortion industry, settle for illegal immigration that\u2019s been a problem for decades, as so many of our problems have festered for decades. Accept a system of government and politics that no longer works for us.I will not sit down and be quiet. And neither will you.So I ask you to stand with me, fight with me, vote for me, citizens. It is time to take our future back, time to take our politics back. It is time to take our government back. Citizens, it is time. We must take our country back.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Thank you to all the candidates.(CROSSTALK)REGAN: That does it, everyone for the first debate right here in North Charleston.In just about two hours from now, at 9:00 p.m. Eastern seven more candidates are going to be taking to this stage.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Democratic Debate, Hillary Clinton Challenges Bernie Sanders on Policy Shifts", "Date": "2016-01-17", "News": "Supported byHillary Clinton targeted Bernie Sanders\u2019s electoral appeal with some of her strongest language yet in a debate on Sunday night, seizing on Mr. Sanders\u2019s recent policy shifts on universal health care and gun control to try to undercut his image as an anti-political truth teller.Mrs. Clinton also repeatedly aligned herself with a former political rival, President Obama, as she sought to portray her current one, Mr. Sanders, as a fringe candidate who did not stand with Mr. Obama on major issues like Wall Street regulation. Mr. Sanders, in turn, gave no quarter as he criticized Mrs. Clinton as dishonest in her attacks.With Mr. Sanders gaining on her before the Feb. 1 Iowa caucuses, Mrs. Clinton cast herself as the defender of Mr. Obama\u2019s record and Mr. Sanders as playing into Republican hands with proposals like replacing the Affordable Care Act with a single-payer plan, which Mr. Sanders describes as \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve accomplished so much already,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see the Republicans repeal it.\u201d\u201cThat is nonsense,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cWhat a \u2018Medicare for all\u2019 program does is finally provide health care for every man, woman and child as a right.\u201d He added that 29 million people still lack health insurance.Mrs. Clinton was pointed in her critiques of Mr. Sanders but relatively restrained in tone and words as she sought to raise doubts about what many liberals see as Mr. Sanders\u2019s greatest virtues: his integrity and consistency on policy issues.She chose not to accuse him of \u201cflip-flopping\u201d on gun control bills as she had earlier on Sunday, but rather said at the debate that she was \u201cpleased\u201d he had \u201creversed\u201d himself.For Mrs. Clinton, it was enough to note Mr. Sanders\u2019s changes in policy: By doing so, she raised doubts about his consistency, but stopped short of eviscerating his positions and potentially alienating a restless liberal base that largely favors Mr. Sanders.Her tactics left Mr. Sanders appearing frustrated at times, such as when he called her \u201cvery disingenuous\u201d on his gun record, or when he sighed audibly and rolled his eyes as she implicitly questioned his principles on health care.When Mrs. Clinton pushed on his health care plan, which she said would \u201ctear up\u201d the president\u2019s signature achievement, he shot back: \u201cNo one is tearing this up. We\u2019re going forward.\u201dThe competition to claim Mr. Obama\u2019s political mantle was the dominant theme of the night, given that the Democratic race has become so close in Iowa and New Hampshire.Mr. Obama remains widely popular among party members, particularly in the state that Mrs. Clinton now needs to win more than ever: South Carolina, which votes on Feb. 27. Should she lose the first two nominating contests, Mrs. Clinton and her team believe she can regain political momentum in the South Carolina primary, in part because of her strong support among African-Americans there.Mrs. Clinton repeatedly reiterated her support for Mr. Obama\u2019s agenda, while Mr. Sanders tried to present himself as the bolder choice to build on Mr. Obama\u2019s legacy. But she stymied him at times: When Mr. Sanders criticized Mrs. Clinton for accepting more than \u201c$600,000 in speaking fees\u201d from Goldman Sachs, she used the moment to portray Mr. Sanders as opposed to Mr. Obama on the issue of Wall Street regulation.The third candidate in the Democratic race, former Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley of Maryland, who is far behind in most polls, showed some new life at the debate as he reminded the audience that Mrs. Clinton had evoked the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks previously to explain her Wall Street donations when she was a senator representing New York.\u201cNow you bring up President Obama here in South Carolina in defense of the fact of your cozy relationship with Wall Street,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Malley said. If Mrs. Clinton was trying to make Mr. Sanders look less than qualified for the presidency, Mr. Sanders repeatedly tried to address doubts about his electability, which a new Clinton television advertisement has questioned. At one point, he rattled off some of his strong poll numbers, not unlike the leading Republican candidate, Donald J. Trump.\u201cWhen this campaign began, she was 50 points ahead of me,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were all of three percentage points. Guess what? In Iowa and New Hampshire, the race is very, very close.\u201dHe added, \u201cIn polling, we are running ahead of Secretary Clinton against my good friend Donald Trump.\u201dMr. Sanders did not break any new ground as he challenged Mrs. Clinton on policy, but instead tried to deepen his ongoing critique of her as an ally of wealthy and powerful interests: an argument that has resonated with many younger and liberal Americans in the early-voting states. He tried, for instance, to turn the debate over health care and the candidates\u2019 positions on Wall Street into a referendum on big money in politics, an implicit criticism of the \u201csuper PAC\u201d and wealthy donors supporting Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign.\u201cIt is whether we have the guts to stand up to the private insurance companies and all of their money, and the pharmaceutical industry,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what this debate is about.\u201dFor Mrs. Clinton, the debate was often as much about the past \u2014 the Obama years and, at times, her ties to her husband, former President Bill Clinton \u2014 as about her ideas for improving the lives of Americans. While Mr. Sanders repeated one or more of his liberal policy views at almost every turn, Mrs. Clinton tended to present herself as an inheritor of the Democratic Party\u2019s traditional agenda on the economy, social safety nets and foreign policy. Asked what role Mr. Clinton would play in her administration, and whether his advice would be official or take place at the kitchen table, Mrs. Clinton did not make much effort to present herself as the fresh-thinking independent figure that Mr. Sanders claims to be.\u201cWell, it will start at the kitchen table,\u201d she said of her husband. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how it goes from there.\u201dThe New York Times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign.While Mr. Sanders did not repeat his previous assertion that Mr. Clinton\u2019s sexual misconduct was \u201ctotally disgraceful and unacceptable,\u201d he did call it \u201cdeplorable\u201d when pressed by a moderator. He insisted that he would focus on the issues, despite what he cast as the news media\u2019s best attempts to insert scandal at every turn. \u201cThat question annoys me,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cI cannot walk down the street \u2014 Secretary Clinton knows this \u2014 without being told how much I have to attack Secretary Clinton.\u201dThe two candidates, both under exceptional pressure in their final debate before the Iowa caucuses, were a study in contrasts. Mrs. Clinton seemed careful to be impassioned but not overly aggressive, while Mr. Sanders was his typically emphatic self, waving his hands frequently as his unmodulated voice rose at times to a near-holler. He smiled a few times, but it felt awkward. Mrs. Clinton laughed a few times, but it felt forced.Pressed on his shifting position on a provision of Senate legislation that would have held gun manufacturers and sellers accountable for crimes committed with firearms, Mr. Sanders said that while he supported parts of the bill, \u201ca small mom-and-pop gun shop who sells a gun legally to somebody should not be held liable if someone does something terrible with that gun.\u201dMrs. Clinton criticized Mr. Sanders for his votes on several gun control measures, including the so-called Charleston loophole that allowed Dylann Roof, the gunman in the church attack, to purchase his weapon. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget what this is about,\u201d she said, her voice growing more impassioned. \u201cNinety people a day die from gun violence in this country.\u201d She continued, \u201cOne of the most horrific examples, not a block from here, where we had nine people murdered.\u201dShe also sought to damn Mr. Sanders with faint praise by saying she was \u201cpleased\u201d that he had reversed himself on supporting legal immunity for gun manufacturers and dealers. As she listed Mr. Sanders\u2019s past votes and jabbed at him over the immunity issues, Mrs. Clinton implied that her main opponent had not thought through his bank-busting domestic agenda.\u201cI have actually documented every way that I\u2019m going to pay for what I\u2019m doing because I think the American public deserves to know,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m the only candidate standing here tonight who has said I will not raise taxes on the middle class. I want to raise incomes, not taxes.\u201dMr. Sanders strongly denied that he was backtracking on his promise last month not to raise taxes to pay for his \u201cMedicare for all\u201d plan.\u201cNo, it is not breaking my word,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is one thing to say I\u2019m raising taxes; it\u2019s another thing to say we\u2019re doing away with private health insurance premiums.\u201d He added, \u201cThere are huge savings in what your family is spending.\u201dAt the end of the debate, Mrs. Clinton had her best moment of the night as she described the contaminated drinking water crisis in Flint, Mich., and sharply criticized the state government for being negligent in protecting the health of that predominantly poor and African-American city.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, if the kids in a rich suburb of Detroit had been drinking contaminated water and being bathed in it, there would\u2019ve been action,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said.Patrick Healy reported from New York, and Amy Chozick from Charleston, S.C.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How the Daily Fantasy Sports Industry Turns Fans Into Suckers", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byFeatureSince the start of this N.F.L. season, I have lost roughly $1,900 on DraftKings and FanDuel, the two main proprietors of daily fantasy sports (D.F.S.). I play pretty much every night. This requires me to pick a team of players \u2014 whether baseball, basketball, football, hockey or soccer \u2014 each of whom have been assigned a dollar amount, and fit them all under a salary cap. I base these lineups on reasonably educated hunches, something to the effect of: I\u2019ll play the Indiana Pacers point guard George Hill tonight, because he\u2019s going up against the New Orleans Pelicans, who have been a defensive train wreck this season, especially on the perimeter. Also, Monta Ellis, Hill\u2019s back-court partner, is sitting out, which means more of the usage load should fall to Hill. Sometimes, usually while walking the dog, I\u2019ll even sit down on a park bench and check to make sure that at least some of those facts are real. My bets range anywhere from $3 to $100. My losses in D.F.S. are not financially crippling, nor are they happening at a rate that should be cause for concern. But every gambler, whatever the size of the problem, wants to know that he or she has some chance of winning.The ads, I admit, are what got me. For the first 10 months of 2015, DraftKings and FanDuel spent more than a combined $200 million on advertising, a surge that peaked at the start of the football season, when a DraftKings ad ran seemingly every couple of minutes on television. In addition to the ads, many of which showed regular guys like me who had won, in the DraftKings parlance, \u201ca shipload of money,\u201d there were DraftKings lounges in N.F.L. stadiums, FanDuel sidelines in N.B.A. arenas and daily fantasy advice segments in the sports sections of newspapers and all over ESPN, which, during the first weeks of the N.F.L. season, felt as if it had been converted into a nonstop publicity machine for DraftKings. As of August, both companies had billion-dollar valuations and promised weekly competitions with huge payouts and fast and easy withdrawals.Initially, D.F.S. seemed harmless enough \u2014 on Sunday mornings, I would challenge a couple of my friends in California to head-to-head match-ups for $50 and put a few $20 entries into the million-dollar fantasy-football contest. Then, on Sunday, Sept. 27, Ethan Haskell, an employee at DraftKings, inadvertently published information that could have given him an edge over his competitors. That day, Haskell won $350,000 in prizes on FanDuel. (DraftKings later concluded, in an internal review conducted by a former United States attorney, that Haskell obtained the information after the deadline for submitting his lineup in the contest and couldn\u2019t use it for profit.) Haskell\u2019s accidental disclosure and subsequent bonanza caught the attention of several media outlets, including The Times, leading to a volley of articles and columns that placed the operations of daily fantasy sports under close scrutiny.Since the scandal broke, I have traveled to D.F.S. events, spent dozens of hours playing on DraftKings and FanDuel and talked to players and industry media figures. I initially intended to write an article about the bro culture that had sprouted up around D.F.S., which, from a distance, reminded me of the sweaty, sardonic camaraderie you typically see at high-stakes poker events. At the time, the crusade against D.F.S. felt a few degrees too hot \u2014 DraftKings and FanDuel struck me as obviously gambling sites, but the game itself felt sort of like homework. You research players. You build a spreadsheet. You project data and enter a team. You watch the team either fulfill or fall short of your projections. The next day, you start over again. The ruinous thrill of other forms of gambling \u2014 sports betting, blackjack, poker \u2014 just wasn\u2019t there.Instead, I came across a different sort of problem: a rapacious ecosystem in which high-volume gamblers, often aided by computer scripts and optimization software that allow players to submit hundreds or even thousands of lineups at a time, repeatedly take advantage of new players, who, after watching an ad, deposit some money on DraftKings and FanDuel and start betting. Both companies mostly looked the other way. And, when evidence of the competitive advantages enjoyed by these high-volume players became too overwhelming for the companies to ignore, DraftKings and FanDuel enacted rules that in the end are likely to protect the high-volume players rather than regulate them. In any case, a stricter ban on computer scripting would have been functionally impossible \u2014 because, as a representative of FanDuel told me, D.F.S. companies cannot reliably detect it on their sites.Each company took advantage of language in a federal law that allowed them to plug directly into two huge, overlapping populations \u2014 fantasy sports players and gamblers. Each company was able to raise hundreds of millions of dollars in venture capital funding and sponsorships, all of which created pressure to increase user bases, which, in turn, led to an advertising deluge this past fall. It takes years of testing, regulation and outside oversight to create a reliable betting market. But DraftKings and FanDuel rose to prominence \u2014 and now, seemingly, have become derailed \u2014 in the course of a single N.F.L. regular season.The betting economy that has been created is highly unstable and corrupt. One critic I spoke to was Gabriel Harber, a well-known D.F.S. podcaster and writer who has worked in the D.F.S. industry since its inception and goes by the handle CrazyGabey. He has come forward to discuss the rampant exploitation in D.F.S.\u2019s betting economy.\u201cThe idea that these sites exist so that regular guys can make a lot of money playing daily fantasy sports is a lie,\u201d Harber told me. \u201cFanDuel and DraftKings are optimized for power players to rape and pillage regular players over and over again.\u201dAbout a year after the passage of the U.I.G.E.A., Chris Fargis, a poker pro, wrote a post on his personal blog that explained a new business venture he had started called Instant Fantasy Sports. The idea, Fargis wrote, was to \u201ctake the time frame of season-long fantasy sports leagues and shrink it. \u2026 The site will look familiar to many of you who are reading this blog because it\u2019s set up a lot like an online poker site.\u201d\u201cGiven the current state of online gaming, the next logical question is, \u2018Is this site legal?\u2019\u201d Fargis continued. \u201cHappily, I\u2019m able to tell you that fantasy sports games are explicitly protected by the U.I.G.E.A. (the same law that has given online poker so much trouble in the U.S.A.). Instant Fantasy Sports is 100 percent legal in the U.S.A. and Canada.\u201dThe D.F.S. industry is still inextricably tied up in those poker roots. Players talk about \u201ctilting\u201d because of \u201cvariance,\u201d especially when a \u201cfish\u201d puts in a \u201cdonkey\u201d lineup that ends up going crazy. (In regular American English, this translates roughly to \u201cI am really mad because some idiot punched in some random lineup that ended up catching every conceivable break and beating me.\u201d) And it\u2019s not only the former poker players who talk like this \u2014 when I first spoke to Nigel Eccles, the C.E.O. and founder of FanDuel, he referred to the different denominations of D.F.S. games as \u201ctables,\u201d in the same way a pit boss at a casino might point you to the $10 blackjack or the $25 baccarat tables. Rotogrinders, by far the biggest site for D.F.S. discussion, commentary and content, was founded in part by Cal Spears, a former poker player from Tennessee who used to run an online forum for poker strategy called PocketFives. Jonathan Aguiar, DraftKings\u2019 director of V.I.P. services, is also a former poker player known as FatalError. Fargis, too, now works at DraftKings.Over the next few years, dozens of other gaming entrepreneurs started their own daily fantasy companies. There were DraftDay and DraftStreet, along with pretty much every possible portmanteau of \u201cdraft,\u201d \u201cfan\u201d and \u201cfantasy.\u201d The sites made no attempts to hide their connection to poker. They weren\u2019t big enough to warrant attention from law enforcement or regulators. Many of the contestants were career game players who all knew one another from the poker circuit. Prize pools rarely rose much higher than $10,000. The companies failed for all the obvious reasons that companies run by gamblers usually fail.Then, in March 2009, Nigel Eccles, a wiry, youthful entrepreneur from Northern Ireland and an alumnus of the management consulting firm McKinsey, started FanDuel. He had never played fantasy sports before. In Britain, Eccles, who holds an advanced degree in statistics, had started a company called Hubdub that hosted prediction markets on news stories. Readers who had just finished an article on, say, Hillary Clinton\u2019s chances in the New Hampshire primary could then put a wager on it using virtual currency. According to Eccles, Hubdub failed because it \u201cdidn\u2019t have a business model.\u201dBut in the burgeoning D.F.S. scene, Eccles saw a completely legal opportunity to make a huge amount of money. Initially, his investors weren\u2019t so sure. They believed D.F.S. was a niche product that would appeal only to a hard-core audience. But at FanDuel\u2019s first live final in December 2010, where all the qualifying players met up in Las Vegas, Eccles realized that the investors were wrong. The players who had qualified weren\u2019t all oddball quants and gamblers. \u201cThey were all mainstream sports fans,\u201d Eccles said. \u201cThat was the point where I was like, O.K., this is not niche. If we can convert a couple hundred, even a few thousand players, then we can probably convert millions of players. There\u2019s no difference between these players and the tens of millions of fantasy sports fans out there.\u201dEccles often talks about how FanDuel cultivates a sense of community among fans. There\u2019s some truth to what he says. D.F.S. can be a way to connect with people who live far away (I certainly used it that way), and, like Words with Friends or any card game, it can be a fun, low-investment excuse to talk smack with your friends. But on the whole, Fargis, in his introductory blog post, had it spot on: D.F.S. is the bastard child of online poker, with its dizzying prize pools, fast action and, perhaps most important, the dream of an easy living. The only difference is that poker, despite its seedy glamour, is associated with casinos and shady underground games. Fantasy sports, by contrast, evokes visions of dads sitting in basements with their college friends, yelling out the names of their favorite athletes.Here\u2019s how it works: Let\u2019s say you run D.F.S. Site A, and D.F.S Site B has just announced a weekly megacontest in which first place will take home $1 million. Now you have to find a way to host a comparable contest, or all your customers will flee to Site B to chase that seven-figure jackpot. The problem is that you have only 25,000 users, and the most you can charge them to enter is $20 per game (anything higher is prohibitively expensive). And you\u2019ll need $2 million or even $3 million in a prize pool if first prize is valued at $1 million (remember, you still have to pay second place, third place and beyond). So you need to somehow quadruple the number of entries. But how? You\u2019re already paying high cost-per-acquisition fees to sites like RotoGrinders, which charge, according to Harber, anywhere between $100 and $200 per person they refer to your site, and you\u2019ve already put your logo on every bus, trash can and ESPN screaming-heads show out there. You\u2019ve also kicked in some of your own money (known as \u201coverlay\u201d) to spice up the pot.The solution is simple: You let each contestant enter hundreds of times. But even given this freedom, a majority of people will enter only a few more times, which will help but probably won\u2019t get you all you need. If, however, you can attract a few high rollers who are willing to book several hundred or even several thousand entries apiece, the path to the $1 million first prize becomes a lot more manageable. And as long as you can make sure those players keep pouring in their thousands of entries, you can keep posting the $1 million first prize all over your ads. (Each company has instituted caps on the number of entries per player, but more enterprising high rollers have found ways around this.)Now, however, you have an even bigger problem: You need the high roller more than he needs you. You need his entry fees to gas up your prize pools, and you also need the roughly 10 percent service fee he pays for the hundreds of thousands of dollars he bets on the site. In big casinos, high rollers have been known to negotiate rules with the house. If, for example, a whale from China wants to play a variant of blackjack in which the dealer has to hit on soft 17, the casino, especially if it is struggling, will sometimes adjust to please the whale.D.F.S. high rollers similarly come with demands, and because there\u2019s no powerful regulatory body involved, DraftKings and FanDuel have been mostly free to set the parameters of play, which, as it turns out, is near anarchy, especially for the D.F.S. elite. High rollers want to be able to use third-party computer scripts that will allow them to enter thousands of lineups at once, something that your average player cannot do. High rollers can gain access into D.F.S.\u2019s inner circle, in which they get to be on first-name, texting basis with executives and employees at DraftKings and FanDuel. They can operate under the cover of plausible deniability \u2014 if other players complain that the high roller has been using tools that destroy competitive balance, he might expect the sites to stick up for him.The difference between the D.F.S. high roller and the blackjack whale, of course, is that the whale is trying to take millions from a multinational casino corporation and not from the honeymooners from Fresno who are betting away at the $5 tables.In the game lobbies of DraftKings and FanDuel, however, sharks are free to flood the marketplace with thousands of entries every day, luring inexperienced, bad players into games in which they are at a sizable disadvantage. The imbalanced winnings in D.F.S. have been an open secret since this past September, when Bloomberg Businessweek published an expos\u00e9 on the habits of high-volume players. The numbers are damning. According to DraftKings data obtained by the New York State attorney general\u2019s office, between 2013 and 2014, 89.3 percent of players had a negative return on investment. A recent McKinsey study showed that in the first half of the 2015 Major League Baseball season, 91 percent of the prize money was won by a mere 1.3 percent of the players.In their escalating legal battles, DraftKings and FanDuel have used these statistics to bolster their argument that D.F.S. is a game of skill, not of chance: How could a contest in which the same people win nearly all the time not be the ultimate test of skill? DraftKings and FanDuel have each tried to prove that the act of projecting player performance and selecting a lineup takes more thought and expertise than, say, playing a poker hand. In paperwork filed on Dec. 24 in Illinois, the latest state to question the legality of D.F.S. lawyers wrote that D.F.S. is \u201clike chess, Scrabble or crossword-puzzle tournaments in that they do not test athletic skill, but instead mental prowess.\u201d They went on to argue that \u201cthe success of a contest is not a matter of luck any more than was the success of the architects of the 1985 Super Bowl-winning Chicago Bears.\u201dWhile it\u2019s true that some of the skill required to win in DraftKings and FanDuel lies in statistical modeling, general sports knowledge and due diligence, it\u2019s also true that it\u2019s nearly impossible to make a net positive return on investment without bumhunting. You have to win roughly 53 percent of your bets to beat the \u201crake,\u201d another poker term for the roughly 10 percent service fee DraftKings and FanDuel take out of each wager. The most efficient way to hit that number is to play as many bad opponents as possible.For the 17 weeks I played D.F.S., whether at a $5 entry fee or for $100, I routinely was matched up against top players. But unless I examined win rates and researched the strengths and weaknesses of my opponents, I would never have known that I was being repeatedly bumhunted by high-volume players.On Dec. 16, for example, I entered three $20 N.B.A. head-to-head contests on DraftKings. My opponents were gunz4hire, Dinkpiece and Nadia4Fashion. Gunz4hire was then ranked 47th on the Rotogrinders players ranking and is generally considered one of the better players in the world. Dinkpiece, who was 20th on that same list, is the alias for Drew Dinkmeyer, a former stock trader whose winnings in D.F.S. have been so well publicized that he has his own Wall Street Journal stipple drawing.On Christmas, the biggest day in the N.B.A.\u2019s regular season, I entered 17 head-to-head contests on DraftKings for prices between $1 and $20. Once again, I was matched up against Dinkpiece and gunz4hire, along with a handful of other professionals.The next day, I entered three more $20 N.B.A. contests. I was able to avoid Dinkpiece and gunz4hire, but found myself in a $20 head-to-head against Birdwings, the 2nd-ranked player in the Rotogrinders rankings.In three days, I played three of the best D.F.S. players in the world.In December, I traveled to the FanDuel World Fantasy Football Championships in San Diego. The festivities, which would end with one player winning a staggering $3 million first prize, included an obstacle course in which Joe Montana and Dan Marino threw footballs at the qualifiers, as well as an extremely drunken couple in Patriots jerseys (those of Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski, of course) who kept screaming, \u201cWe\u2019re [expletive] rich!\u201d While the championships raged on, I asked Eccles about the gross imbalance of winners detailed in the McKinsey report. He said that baseball was not an accurate marker for how the site worked. The majority of D.F.S. novices only come to play football, and their sheer numbers and the natural variance in fantasy football distributes the money more equally. He admitted the Sunday Million, FanDuel\u2019s most-hyped N.F.L. tournament, was extremely difficult for the average player to win. He suggested, instead, that new players enroll in beginner leagues, which are open exclusively to players who have entered only a few contests, and in 50/50s, where several, even thousands of players pool their money together and reward the money to the players who finish in the top half, and head-to-head competitions, in which two players play one another, winner-take-all.On Sunday, Dec. 27, I took Eccles\u2019s advice and entered myself into 20 separate N.F.L. head-to-head contests with buy-ins ranging from $2 to $20. This time, I drew Mtom347, a high-volume player ranked 42 on the Rotogrinders leader board; David Potts, winner of the 2014 FanDuel Daily Fantasy Baseball Championship; and TwoSHAE, one of the 25 top ranked daily fantasy football players in the world.On Dec. 28, I had a phone conversation with Justine Sacco, FanDuel\u2019s director of communications. She told me that I must have misunderstood Eccles and that he was probably referring only to 50-50 match-ups, in which a large group of people enter a pool and roughly the top half wins the bottom half\u2019s money, and not head to heads, which were admittedly tough to beat. The next day, I entered an N.B.A. 50-50, once again for $20.There were 3,638 total entries in the 50-50 that day. Roughly two-thirds of these came from players who entered multiple lineups. Here is a small selection of those players and the number of lineups they entered:Maxdalury, generally considered the top player in the world: 100 lineups.Birdwings, the No. 2-rated player on the RotoGrinders rankings: 22 lineups.rayofhope, the screen name for Cory Albertson, a former poker pro, widely regarded as one of the best: 40 lineups.Kobe4MVP, the screen name for Eytan Jankowitz, also one of the best players in the world: 100 lineups.Youdacao, the No. 6 player on the RotoGrinders rankings: 100 lineups.Notorious, a regular contributor to the Rotogrinders site and the No. 24 player on their rankings: 40 lineups.Dinkpiece, my nemesis from the last two times: five lineupsIf we are going to talk about games of skill and the legal protection they deserve, we should acknowledge that much of the skill in D.F.S. lies in bumhunting. It\u2019s why maxdalury and Birdwings are slumming it in a $20 50-50 competition with me. It\u2019s how the top players ensure their profitability. In D.F.S., as in poker, the easiest way to win money is to turn a sucker into an A.T.M.Over the course of extensive phone conversations and correspondence this fall and winter, Harber explained that he had begun to turn against DraftKings and FanDuel when the companies were unresponsive to complaints from the D.F.S. community about the prevalence of scripting. Last March, when maxdalury, a player named Saahil Sud, used a script that enabled him to adjust most of his 400 lineups in less than an hour, the community took notice. Sud was reacting to the breaking news that Channing Frye, usually a reserve forward for the Orlando Magic, would be starting in place of the injured Nikola Vucevic. Sud won first, third, fourth and seventh place in a big DraftKings competition that night and took home hundreds of thousands of dollars. The speed with which he made the adjustments caused many within the D.F.S. community to protest. How could they be reasonably expected to compete if one of the players was using a tool that allowed him to both blanket the field with entries and avoid the work and hassle of manually adjusting his lineups to reflect late-breaking news? What\u2019s worse, these scripts were not supposed to be used under DraftKing\u2019s terms of service.In July, after months of review, instead of banning scripting, or at least forcefully regulating it, as the D.F.S. community would have liked, both DraftKings and FanDuel announced that they would change their policies to permit some scripting. The founder of DraftKings, Matt Kalish, who declined to comment for this article, told ESPN\u2019s David Purdum in July that the decision had been made to \u201cincrease and improve the experience for a couple of users, who I think were experiencing a very poor usability of the site.\u201d In other words, DraftKings had decided to accommodate players who wanted to modify the site to their own specifications. FanDuel, for its part, clarified its position on the practice and asked players to send in their scripts for \u201capproval.\u201d This, by definition, is a game played by different rules.Harber explained how his frustration with DraftKings and FanDuel reached a breaking point. \u201cPeople may wonder why I\u2019m coming forward now, and it\u2019s a good question,\u201d Harber wrote in one of two emailed statements to me. \u201cMy focus as a broadcaster in this industry for the last four years has been primarily as an ambassador to the community. The daily fantasy community has had very real concerns about competitive imbalances at FanDuel and DraftKings for quite some time now. I have publicly submitted simple questions in writing to both companies on numerous occasions, and both companies have completely ignored the community\u2019s concerns about the use of automated processes, sniping, multiaccounting and their own terms of service.\u201d\u201cYour average Joe sees a commercial for daily fantasy sports, signs up, plays and loses,\u201d Harber wrote. \u201cHe has no idea his games are being sniped by professional power users with access to automated processes and optimization software. He has no idea that the large-field tournament he\u2019s playing in features power users with hundreds of unique lineups, all optimized using third-party software. In truth, D.F.S. is more like the stock market, with athletes instead of commodities. No new player attempting to trade stocks has any shot at success without a sizable amount of training.\u201dHarber continued: \u201cI believe the major sites are fully aware of these competitive issues, yet they continue to do nothing about them because of the high amount of rake the power users are bringing in for them. As long as they can spend advertising money to bring fresh meat to the table, the power users will eat up the new players extremely fast by using their competitive advantages. No one is saying that better players should not win money off worse players, but it should not be at this rate and it should not be with misleading advertisements that prey on consumer confidence. Everyone does not have an equal chance, and everyone is not playing on the same field.\u201cThe major daily fantasy sites do not want attention drawn to these competitive issues because they are also afraid that doing so will increase the likelihood of negative legal consequences for them. Their rationale is that if the various attorneys general and prosecutors were to become knowledgeable about these competitive issues, they would be much more likely to outright ban daily fantasy.\u201dDraftKings and FanDuel have instituted rules to address some of these problems \u2014 each site has sections dedicated to new players, and FanDuel, at least, says that all scripts must be approved by the company. (DraftKings\u2019 terms of use permits \u201climited use of scripts\u201d and prompts users to email them for details.) But those measures only protect players from the worst excesses of bumhunting behavior.I asked Justine Sacco why FanDuel allowed scripting at all. She told me: \u201cYou want to allow people on the site to make their experience meaningfully better. So the idea that big players can\u2019t bring in features to improve their time, honestly \u2014 it feels a bit Orwellian.\u201dSacco emphasized that any script that was deemed \u201canticompetitive\u201d would immediately be banned, and that the company had caught and banned players for using scripts in the past, but she declined to release any specific names. She also estimated that FanDuel had approved approximately 30 scripts over all and that some of these were benign, voluntary devices used by sites like Rotogrinders to track the wins of their players. When asked if part of FanDuel\u2019s decision to allow scripts was based on a desire to keep players from taking more of their business to DraftKings, Sacco said, \u201cYou do have to take that into account \u2014 if someone is playing hundreds of thousands of dollars and comes and says, \u2018I have some ideas that would help me keep doing what I\u2019m doing,\u2019 only a bad business would not take that into consideration.\u201dSacco also said that one reason FanDuel allowed some scripting was that the company could not completely stop it. This confirms the suspicions of many in the D.F.S. community who believe that DraftKings and FanDuel do not regulate scripts because they have become so sophisticated that the companies simply don\u2019t know how to detect or disable all of them. (DraftKings, when asked for comment, said these \u201cassumptions\u201d were \u201cinaccurate.\u201d) When I asked Justin Park, maxdalury\u2019s business partner at RotoQL, a site that provides third-party tools, including a scripting program that plugs straight into the DraftKings interface, if he had asked DraftKings for permission to alter their site, he said he didn\u2019t know. He later remembered an email exchange with DraftKings. DraftKings could not confirm this.This amounts to gaming chaos \u2014 nobody really knows what the next guy might be doing, and everyone who should be making decisions that ensure fairness is afraid to punish power players for their indiscretions. There is no gambling hole in America, whether Atlantic City or Las Vegas or a riverboat in the Mississippi, that could put out a game like DraftKings or FanDuel without running straight into the state gaming commission.Knowledge about sports will always be the main sorting mechanism for the types of dudes (FanDuel reports that 95 percent of its contestants are male) who play games like D.F.S., and there\u2019s certainly nothing wrong \u2014 especially morally wrong \u2014 with putting some money on it, but there is a point where rampant bumhunting turns a gambling economy into a predatory market.There is, in theory, a version of D.F.S. that could work. All that\u2019s required is a transparent marketplace in which a player can reasonably expect to enter a head-to-head or 50-50 or even one of the big-money tournaments without going up against hundreds of lineups generated by professional gamblers who have been lying in wait for him.During my many conversations with Harber, we would often find ourselves talking about my D.F.S. match-ups for the night. Both of us love the N.B.A. above all things, and we would invariably start talking about DeMarcus Cousins and his sad six years in the N.B.A., or Gerald Green\u2019s shot volume, or whether we could trust Tony Parker to put up fantasy points anymore. These, I believe, are the sorts of moments the best of the D.F.S. community wants to promote \u2014 fantasy sports is essentially a way to turn the usual sports arguments into a game.At the start of the N.B.A. season, a couple of friends and I started a friendly league on DraftKings. Every night, we draft teams, watch the points accumulate and make fun of one another for our picks. On the first of each month, we pay one another what we owe. One of these friends creates N.B.A. player performance models. They help him escape the cynical demands of his job as a corporate lawyer. To date, I am down $350 to him.\u201cYes, yes, yes,\u201d Harber said when I told him about this league. \u201cThat\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to be.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incompletely to action against DraftKings and FanDuel. It was a judge\u2019s order telling the companies to stop accepting wagers \u2014 not an order by the New York attorney general \u2014 that was stayed on appeal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Opini\u00f3n: Mujeres, lleg\u00f3 la hora de saldar cuentas", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byAm\u00e9rica Aun as\u00ed, no podr\u00eda suceder aqu\u00ed en Estados Unidos. \u00bfO s\u00ed? Durante los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os, ha surgido una justificaci\u00f3n para la renta b\u00e1sica universal que podr\u00eda hacerla atractiva no s\u00f3lo para los pobres, que no suelen votar mucho, sino para las mujeres, que s\u00ed lo hacen.El argumento feminista a favor de la RBU es que se trata de una forma de remunerar a las madres y a otro tipo de cuidadores por la gran cantidad de trabajo que ahora hacen gratis. Alrededor de una quinta parte de los estadounidenses tienen hijos menores de 18 a\u00f1os. Muchos tambi\u00e9n cuidan de parientes enfermos o ancianos. Lo hacen por amor o por un sentido del deber y, pese a eso, en alg\u00fan momento durante el cambio de pa\u00f1al o la limpieza de la bacinilla, deben preguntarse por qu\u00e9 eso no se considera \u201ctrabajo\u201d. Incluso han de preguntarse por qu\u00e9 tienen que pagar por el privilegio de hacerlo, al reducir sus horarios laborales o abandonar sus empleos para hacerse cargo del hogar.Por supuesto, en su gran mayor\u00eda, estos cuidadores son mujeres. A pesar de que cada vez m\u00e1s hombres se quedan en casa, siguen siendo las madres quienes hacen la mayor parte del trabajo invisible de limpiar, ir de un lado a otro, organizar e incluso escuchar.En la medida en que el feminismo convencional ha puesto m\u00e1s atenci\u00f3n en los asuntos econ\u00f3micos durante las \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas, se ha concentrado en la brecha laboral, la ausencia de permisos de maternidad y la d\u00e9bil \u201cinfraestructura del cuidado\u201d, para citar la frase de Anne-Marie Slaughter. Hay aspectos de la vida laboral que son hostiles con el cuidado de la familia y que dificultan el \u00e9xito laboral de las mujeres que combinan su vida profesional con la maternidad. Pero el problema no es que los empleadores odien a las mujeres y los ni\u00f1os, sino que dan algo por hecho: que la maternidad es una elecci\u00f3n de vida, no un trabajo que merece un salario y s\u00f3lo los progenitores deben pagar por ello.\u00bfSueldos por criar a los hijos y hacer las tareas dom\u00e9sticas? Cuando un colectivo feminista hizo esa petici\u00f3n en la d\u00e9cada de 1970, casi fue expulsado de la segunda ola del movimiento feminista, cuyo prop\u00f3sito era que las mujeres formaran parte de la fuerza de trabajo, no que se les pagara por quedarse fuera de ella.Si las madres producen menos valor que quienes no son madres, se infiere que se aprovechan del trabajo de los dem\u00e1s. Esto puede conducir a tensiones entre colegas y tambi\u00e9n modifica la relaci\u00f3n entre los esposos proveedores y las esposas que se quedan en la casa, que evidentemente tienen menos poder en sus hogares.Pero se trata de exactamente lo contrario. En realidad, la sociedad es la que se aprovecha de las mujeres y de su contribuci\u00f3n no remunerada a la preservaci\u00f3n de la raza humana. Como lo habr\u00eda expuesto Marx de haber incluido la labor de las mujeres en su teor\u00eda del valor-trabajo (pero no crey\u00f3 que valiera la pena), el \u201ctrabajo reproductivo\u201d (como denominan las feministas a la creaci\u00f3n y conservaci\u00f3n de las familias y los hogares) es la base de la acumulaci\u00f3n del capital humano. Yo digo que ya lleg\u00f3 la hora de la indemnizaci\u00f3n.Podr\u00edan objetar que se trata de un tipo peculiar de indemnizaci\u00f3n, destinado tanto para los padres como para las madres, para quienes asumen responsabilidades como quien no. Pero consideren esta propuesta radical: la renta b\u00e1sica universal es una condici\u00f3n necesaria para una sociedad justa, pues reconoce el hecho de que la mayor\u00eda de nosotros (hombres, mujeres, padres y personas sin hijos) hacemos una gran cantidad de trabajo no remunerado para sustentar el bienestar general. De no estar criando ni\u00f1os, entonces estar\u00edamos yendo a la escuela o haciendo trabajo voluntario en el vecindario.Todo eso est\u00e1 muy bien, dicen los esc\u00e9pticos, pero la renta b\u00e1sica universal no deja de ser un riesgo moral. Si se le da dinero a la gente a cambio de nada, los vagos ser\u00e1n m\u00e1s vagos y el resto se ir\u00e1 a la quiebra.Pero parece que \u00e9ste no es el caso. Por el contrario: la RBU le da a los trabajadores menos razones para holgazanear en casa en comparaci\u00f3n con pol\u00edticas perversas como aquella en la que un d\u00f3lar ganado es un d\u00f3lar menos para el cheque de la asistencia social. La investigaci\u00f3n sugiere que, en lugar de disminuir la voluntad de trabajar, los desembolsos incondicionales y regulares le permiten a la gente administrar mejor sus carreras.En cinco estudios sobre el impuesto de renta negativo, que se llevaron a cabo en Estados Unidos y Canad\u00e1 en los setenta, la renta m\u00ednima s\u00ed logr\u00f3 reducir un poco las horas de trabajo, en parte porque los desempleados tardaron m\u00e1s en encontrar nuevos empleos. Los investigadores especulan que esperaban a que hubiera puestos que fueran m\u00e1s acordes con sus habilidades. En Estados Unidos, los hombres que aportan el ingreso principal del hogar disminuyeron casi un nueve por ciento al a\u00f1o. En Canad\u00e1, la reducci\u00f3n fue m\u00ednima. En ambos pa\u00edses, los adolescentes han seguido con sus estudios m\u00e1s tiempo. Y las mujeres con hijos pasaron hasta un treinta por ciento menos tiempo en el trabajo.La RBU tiene cr\u00edticas y seguidoras feministas a quienes no les agrada ese hallazgo. La RBU alentar\u00eda a las mujeres a abandonar la fuerza laboral, dicen, con lo que ceder\u00edan un terreno por el que el feminismo ha peleado tanto. Sin embargo, esta preocupaci\u00f3n me parece, digamos, paternalista. Las mujeres deber\u00edan tener m\u00e1s opciones, no menos. Y los hombres tambi\u00e9n. La igualdad entre sexos no deber\u00eda requerir que todos nos conformemos con los patrones tradicionalmente masculinos de empleo.Adem\u00e1s, se ha demostrado que las pol\u00edticas de ingreso b\u00e1sico alivian tipos de pobreza espec\u00edficamente femeninos.Aunque la verdad es que la RBU es, en efecto, una forma de redistribuci\u00f3n. S\u00f3lo podremos costearla cuando decidamos si vale la pena hacerlo. Eso es todo lo que tenemos que decidir. Deber\u00edamos hacer recortes al gasto militar, si es necesario, o aumentar impuestos a los ricos. La voluntad pol\u00edtica para una restructuraci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica de tal magnitud requerir\u00eda una revaloraci\u00f3n fundamental de la relaci\u00f3n entre el estado y el pueblo.La RBU tambi\u00e9n nos acercar\u00eda lentamente a un mundo con una mayor igualdad de g\u00e9nero. El efectivo adicional le facilitar\u00eda a un padre convertirse en el cuidador principal, si as\u00ed lo desea. Una madre que trabaja podr\u00eda pagar para que le cuiden a sus hijos y, a la vez, conservar\u00eda sus ingresos. Los progenitores que cuidan del hogar tendr\u00edan m\u00e1s dinero en el banco, m\u00e1s peso en la familia y el respeto ganado por comprometerse a llevar a cabo una empresa de valor medible. Y ya hemos dejado claro el principio de que el producto del amor no es invaluable en absoluto, sino algo que vale la pena pagar.Advertisement"}

The move, announced last Wednesday by China\u2019s central bank, is the most recent in a number of steps taken over the last few years by Beijing to make the renminbi more international.Automakers on Tuesday will report December sales of new vehicles in the United States, and they are expected to close out the best year in history with a bang. Analysts predicted that the industry sold at least 1.6 million vehicles during the month, which would push annual sales for 2015 past the record of 17.4 million vehicles in 2000.On Friday, at 8:30 a.m., the Labor Department will report on hiring and unemployment in December. This is the first jobs report since the Federal Reserve raised interest rates last month, and most economists expect the labor market to have shown continued strength.

{"Headline": "Budget Office Sharply Cuts Health Exchange Estimate", "Date": "2016-01-25", "News": "Supported byIn its annual report on the budget and economic outlook, the agency also lowered its estimate of the number of people who would receive subsidies, in the form of tax credits, to help pay premiums for insurance purchased through the marketplaces, or exchanges. The budget office now estimates that 11 million people a month, on average, will receive subsidies this year, down from its prior estimate of 15 million.The lower estimates are not necessarily bad news for President Obama\u2019s signature domestic accomplishment. Initially, C.B.O. analysts had expected exchange enrollment to swell in part because employers would drop insurance plans and push workers toward the marketplaces. To date, researchers say, that has generally not happened.\u201cMost of the unsubsidized people who are no longer expected to purchase insurance through an exchange are expected to purchase insurance directly from an insurer instead,\u201d said the report, issued by Keith Hall, the director of the Congressional Budget Office.The budget office estimated that 9.5 million people, on average, were enrolled in coverage through the exchanges in any given month last year, and it said that eight million of them received subsidies.Two years into the health care law, clear regional patterns are emerging about who has health insurance in America and who still doesn\u2019t.The Obama administration said that enrollment fell below projections, in part, because more employers maintained coverage for their employees and fewer dropped coverage, so fewer employees sought insurance in the exchanges.The budget office predicts a deficit of $544 billion this year, down from $1.4 trillion in 2009, when President Obama took office, in a recession. If the projection is accurate, the deficit this year would be equivalent to 2.9 percent of the gross domestic product, down from 9.8 percent in 2009.The projected 2016 deficit is higher than what the budget office predicted just five months ago, in part because Congress passed legislation that reduced corporate and individual income taxes.If current laws remain generally unchanged, the budget office said, annual deficits will total $9.4 trillion from 2017 to 2026, and federal debt held by the public \u2014 the cumulative total of government borrowing \u2014 will climb to $23.8 trillion, up from $14 trillion this year.In the coming decade, the budget office said, the number of people who are at least 65 years old will increase by 37 percent, and the aging of the population, combined with rising health care costs per person, will fuel an increase in federal spending on guaranteed benefits, or entitlements.The budget office predicts that the economy will grow more quickly in 2016 and 2017 than it did last year, when the G.D.P., after adjusting for inflation, increased by 2 percent. If current laws on taxes and spending remained in place, the budget office said, the economy would grow by 2.7 percent this year and 2.5 percent next year.It sees the unemployment rate \u2014 an important measure in this election year \u2014 dropping to 4.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016, from 5 percent in the last quarter of 2015.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mayor de Blasio to Raise Base Pay for City Workers", "Date": "2016-01-05", "News": "Supported byMayor Bill de Blasio is set to announce on Wednesday a $15-an-hour minimum wage for New York City\u2019s public work force that city officials said would be among the highest of its kind in the country.Under the mayor\u2019s plan, which matches a similar increase for state employees enacted by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo last year, about 50,000 city workers \u2014 including crossing guards, prekindergarten teachers, custodial workers and others \u2014 would see their pay reach the $15-an-hour level by the end of 2018.Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat who is starting his third year as mayor, has pledged to refocus his administration on a core liberal mission, and the wage announcement, described by city officials on Tuesday evening, is sure to win praise from his left-leaning base.The majority of the city\u2019s 300,000 employees already earn $15 an hour or more, officials said. Mr. de Blasio\u2019s plan would affect about 20,000 unionized workers, mostly represented by District Council 37, and 30,000 employees of outside organizations \u2014 like day-care providers \u2014 whose services are paid for by the city.The increase in wages is expected to cost an additional $238 million over the next five years, concerning some fiscal experts. \u201cThe mayor has been lucky so far with the economy,\u201d said Nicole Gelinas of the Manhattan Institute. \u201cIf a recession comes, higher wages will have to mean more layoffs.\u201dThe mayor\u2019s move comes in the same week that Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, said he would provide a $15-an-hour minimum wage to about 28,000 state university workers. In November, the governor made New York the first state to set a $15 minimum wage for public employees; he also took steps to secure $15 an hour for workers at fast-food chain restaurants in the state.Unlike the governor, Mr. de Blasio does not have unilateral power to raise city employees\u2019 wages. To enact his plan, Mr. de Blasio has directed his team to amend existing contracts with the relevant municipal unions, and to rewrite contracts with the affected nonprofit groups. The new policy was reported on Tuesday evening by The Daily News.The $15 minimum wage has become a rallying cry for liberal activists across the country who have urged state and city governments to raise workers\u2019 pay after years of wage stagnation.The mayor has sought other ways to provide more generous benefits. Late last month, Mr. de Blasio said the city would begin offering six weeks of paid parental leave to 20,000 city employees.\u201cWe know that nothing does more to lift up working families and move our economy forward than raising wages, and the city is leading by example by doing just that,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said in a statement.The mayor is expected to announce his plan at an event on Wednesday afternoon at the headquarters of District Council 37, the city\u2019s largest municipal union, in Lower Manhattan.Advertisement"}

It was the biggest single-day increase in Japanese shares since September.Analysts said that, in addition to a push from bargain-hunting traders, Friday\u2019s rally could also have been driven by hopes that major central banks, including those in Japan and Europe, would soon roll out economic stimulus efforts.\u201cThe general background is the expectation for monetary easing,\u201d said Takuya Takahashi, a senior strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo. \u201cWe saw a rise today because the market is just speculatively expecting the Bank of Japan, along with the central government, will take some action.\u201dChina\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.European stocks continued their rebound on Friday, with the FTSE 100 share index in Britain rising 3 percent through early afternoon. The regional Euro Stoxx 50 index was up 2.4 percent. Futures activity pointed to a strong opening on Wall Street when trading begins in New York.Earlier, the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong closed 2.9 percent higher, while Shanghai stocks rose 1.3 percent.Global markets have been under pressure this year. Increased uncertainty over the health of China\u2019s economy and the plummeting price of oil have fed concerns that the world economy could be on shakier ground than it appeared.In response, professional money managers have been converting more of their investment portfolios to cash, regarded as a safer but lower-return investment than stocks or bonds, according to a survey published this week by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.But the rebound on Friday in Asia suggested that buyers have not been lurking too far from the action. Many assets that have been pummeled in recent sessions got an end-of-the-week reprieve from investors.Oil continued its minirally, with futures contracts for Brent crude, the international benchmark, trading 7 percent higher at $31.27 a barrel. Futures for West Texas Intermediate, the American benchmark, also rose for the second day in a row, climbing about 6 percent to $31.26, putting it above $30 for the first time in a week. But analysts cautioned that the global glut, which has punished oil prices in the last year, is likely to continue for months to come.The yield on United States Treasury securities, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rose moderately \u2014 signaling a slightly improved appetite for risk among investors.Hisako Ueno contributed reporting from Tokyo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "North Korea\u2019s Hydrogen Bomb Claim Strains Ties With China", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byBy proceeding with its nuclear test about 50 miles from the Chinese border, North Korea took a gamble that China, its largest trading partner and economic lifeline, would not react with austere sanctions, as many countries have urged.In doing so, it dealt a rare setback to President Xi Jinping, who had hoped a charm offensive over the past six months would ensure stability in the North.\u201cNorth Korea is just thumbing its nose at China,\u201d said Douglas H. Paal, the director of the Asia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. \u201cThat\u2019s got to produce a reaction.\u201dOn Wednesday, officials in Beijing were furious.\u201cChina strongly opposes this act,\u201d Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in unusually harsh remarks at a news conference. \u201cChina will firmly push for denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\u201dMr. Xi is in a difficult position. He is under intense pressure to inflict harsh economic punishment on North Korea, but many Chinese worry that any resulting instability could seep back into their territory. He also faces new questions about China\u2019s efforts to curry favor with Mr. Kim, whom many Chinese regard as a bizarre, bumbling figure.Mr. Xi must also reckon with the prospect that actions by the North could galvanize countries like the United States, Japan and South Korea into strengthening military forces in the Pacific, just as China is seeking to assert its dominance in the region.\u201cThis is precisely what China does not need,\u201d said Rory Medcalf, head of the National Security College at Australian National University. \u201cIf there is one issue guaranteed to refocus U.S. strategic attention on Asia, it is a North Korean nuclear provocation, especially one purported to bring Pyongyang\u2019s destructive capabilities to a whole new level.\u201dOn Wednesday, Chinese officials sidestepped questions about whether they would level economic sanctions against North Korea, by paring shipments of oil, for instance, or food. China is North Korea\u2019s largest economic ally, with trade between the two countries having totaled $6.4 billion in 2014.Cheng Xiaohe, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing, said China had several ways of increasing economic pressure, including by limiting the number of tourists allowed to visit North Korea or by reducing Chinese imports of commodities like coal.But he said the leadership in Beijing should be cautious before resorting to more drastic measures.\u201cIf China unilaterally imposes sanctions, it will have no more tricks,\u201d Professor Cheng said. \u201cPutting more economic pressure on North Korea might also lead to the fall of Kim, the collapse of the regime and all kinds of unpredictable situations China does not wish to see.\u201dNorth Korea claimed on Wednesday that it had tested a hydrogen bomb, the most powerful kind of nuclear weapon.China and North Korea have been allies since the Korean War, when Chinese Communist troops fought to defend the North. Since then, China has helped sustain the rule of the Kim family (Mr. Kim\u2019s father and grandfather governed before him), providing economic aid and political support, even in the face of heavy criticism.The relationship has become more strained in recent years, as North Korea has pushed forward with its nuclear program in defiance of warnings from the United Nations. After the North said it had carried out a nuclear test in 2013, Mr. Xi warned that world peace should not be threatened by the actions of a single country.In recent months, Mr. Xi appeared to recalibrate his strategy, seemingly persuaded that Mr. Kim, despite his rash manner, would stay in power much longer than the Chinese had anticipated.Mr. Xi, 62, has indicated in private meetings that he does not have a warm relationship with Mr. Kim, 32, according to Mr. Paal, who served as an American diplomat in Asia. \u201cHere\u2019s this kid who\u2019s in a very weak position vis-\u00e0-vis China that has managed to really stick it to him,\u201d he said.But Mr. Xi made an effort in recent months to change that dynamic, sending a senior Chinese official, Liu Yunshan, to Pyongyang in October to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of Mr. Kim\u2019s governing party. The Chinese government sent Mr. Liu on the condition that the North halt its nuclear tests, refrain from launching missiles and tone down its inflammatory language, Mr. Paal said.Mr. Xi also sent a personal message, extolling Mr. Kim for \u201cpositive progress in developing the economy, improving livelihoods and so on.\u201dBonnie S. Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said the troubles with North Korea would add to a long list of challenges for Mr. Xi, including a slowing economy and rising tensions in the South China Sea.\u201cXi doesn\u2019t want instability on the border any more than his predecessors did,\u201d she said. \u201cChina will keep North Korea at arm\u2019s length diplomatically, but economic ties will continue to develop.\u201dStill, some analysts said that Mr. Xi might be forced to take a tougher stance against North Korea, given the threat posed by its nuclear program.\u201cNonproliferation is their No. 1 concern, rather than the worry of losing bargaining power or leverage to deal with the United States,\u201d said Cheng Li, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \u201cThis is a major change under Xi.\u201dL. Gordon Flake, chief executive of the Perth USAsia Center at the University of Western Australia, said the North Koreans \u201cknow that the Chinese fear instability more than they fear anything else.\u201d\u201cThey have been uniquely and remarkably unresponsive to Chinese demands,\u201d he said.On Wednesday, many said they were growing anxious about the North\u2019s erratic behavior.In Yanji, a border city, residents reported feeling tables and chairs shake during the blast from the weapon test, which registered as a magnitude 5.1 seismic event. People flooded online forums, trying to piece together what had happened.\u201cWill the city be contaminated?\u201d one post said. \u201cWill the radiation harm us?

Now, world leaders need to think anew about the global trading system.Countries had hoped that the talks, named after the capital of Qatar, where they began in late 2001, would substantially lower trade barriers, contribute to development in poor nations and tackle difficult issues like agricultural subsidies that were not resolved in earlier pacts, like the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.Failure to achieve this ambitious agenda has undermined the credibility of the multilateral trading system and hurt the least-developed countries, which are desperate to export more of their goods to richer countries.While pacts focusing on specific issues are easier to negotiate, they can\u2019t cover the broader issues that countries, rich and poor, have to wrestle with. Trade increasingly determines how governments set social policies and labor conditions within domestic markets, and, of course, affects the future of the environment locally as well as globally.

{"Headline": "MetLife Weighs Split of Retail Business", "Date": "2016-01-12", "News": "Supported byThe giant insurer MetLife said on Tuesday that it was exploring spinning off its retail life and annuity business in the United States because of financial pressures it is facing under regulations put in place in the wake of the financial crisis.The decision was made two years after the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a group created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank regulatory legislation, named MetLife a systemically important nonbank financial institution, or SiFi. That designation carries requirements to set aside more capital as a cushion against a substantial decline in the nation\u2019s financial markets as occurred in 2008, potentially limiting its earnings.MetLife is considering several options, including an initial public offering to create a company that would, presumably, be better able to compete with smaller life insurance and annuity providers who are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions.MetLife is the largest life insurance company in the United States, with $880 billion in assets, including $240 billion of retail assets that would be part of the new company.American International Group, Prudential Financial and General Electric Capital Corporation, the financing arm of General Electric, have also received the designation, which was largely bestowed on companies deemed so large that their failure would damage the American economy.In a statement on Tuesday, Steven A. Kandarian, MetLife\u2019s chairman, president and chief executive, said the risk of increased capital requirements contributed to the decision to explore breaking up the business, although exact plans have not been completed.\u201cAn independent company would benefit from greater focus, more flexibility in products and operations, and a reduced capital and compliance burden,\u201d he said.The announcement, a result of a strategic review, was made weeks before oral arguments in Federal District Court in Washington in MetLife\u2019s year-old case to eliminate the council\u2019s designation.\u201cEven though we are appealing our SiFi designation in court and do not believe any part of MetLife is systemic, this risk of increased capital requirements contributed to our decision,\u201d Mr. Kandarian said.General Electric made a similar calculation last year, when it announced plans to dismantle G.E. Capital, which had grown into one of the biggest lenders in the United States.Last fall G.E. Capital agreed to sell a large part of its commercial leasing business in the United States to Wells Fargo. G.E. had already been selling pieces of its financing arm, spinning off its private-label credit card operation in a $2.9 billion initial public offering in 2014 to create Synchrony Financial.MetLife shareholders greeted the after-markets news favorably, pushing MetLife shares up 6.6 percent Tuesday evening.The stock had declined 22 percent from January 2015 through Monday.\u201cThis is just the first step in the process,\u201d Mr. Kandarian said.Jay Gelb, an analyst at Barclays, said the relatively large size of the new company being created made an I.P.O. more likely than a sale to another insurer. He added that the plan put pressure on Prudential and A.I.G. \u201cto take steps to minimize the anticipated impact of Fed regulation by potentially separating their businesses.\u201dA.I.G. is already under pressure by the activist shareholder Carl C. Icahn to split apart, and it plans to present its strategic vision this month.MetLife\u2019s remaining business after the separation would be corporate-oriented, such as its work with large corporate benefits plans. \u201cIn the U.S., it would allow us to focus even more intently on our group business, where we have long been the market leader,\u201d Mr. Kandarian said.Remaining with MetLife would be its group, voluntary and work site benefits, corporate benefit funding, and business in Asia, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. MetLife would also keep some of the life and annuity business sold through its agents, although it would not write new life or annuity policies after the split, it said.The proposed new company would be run by the MetLife executive vice president Eric Steigerwalt, and would have about a quarter of the current company\u2019s 28,000 employees and 20 percent of its operating earnings.Businesses that would be under it include MetLife Insurance Company USA, General American Life Insurance Company, Metropolitan Tower Life Insurance Company and other subsidiaries.MetLife would move 75 percent of its book of variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the new company, one of the businesses that would be hardest hit by the higher capital requirements. It would also move 85 percent of its universal life with secondary guarantees business.As a company, the new entity would be smaller than some rival insurance providers, such as Lincoln Financial, that do not have the council\u2019s designation, and presumably would not have the same capital-intensive burdens.Likewise, the remaining MetLife would not have the capital requirements of the variable annuity business it would move off its books. The remaining company would have about $640 billion of assets, making it smaller than Prudential but larger than A.I.G.To proceed with the plan, Metlife would need approval from its board and would have to file documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "John Kerry Urges China to Curb North Korea\u2019s Nuclear Pursuits", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 Secretary of State John Kerry warned China on Wednesday that North Korea was moving ahead with an effort to manufacture a nuclear weapon small enough to fit atop a long-range missile that could reach American shores, and said the United States \u201cwill do what is necessary to protect the people of our country.\u201dMr. Kerry\u2019s statement came during a one-day stop in Beijing to see the country\u2019s leadership, during which he warned that if China failed to do more to curb North Korea\u2019s enhanced nuclear capacity, Washington would take steps that Chinese leaders have strongly opposed, including deploying defense systems to protect American allies in Asia.\u201cThis is a threat the United States must take extremely seriously,\u201d Mr. Kerry said of North Korea\u2019s growing nuclear arsenal and its missile capability at a news conference with the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi. \u201cThe United States will take all necessary steps to protect our people and allies. We don\u2019t want to heighten security tensions. But we won\u2019t walk away from any options.\u201dThe United States has been concerned for half a decade about when North Korea will succeed in the difficult task of mating a nuclear weapon to an accurate missile \u2014 and it has already taken the North more time than American intelligence agencies once estimated. Yet the Chinese have been resisting broad new sanctions against Pyongyang, just as they stripped such sanctions out of a United Nations resolution in 2013, after the North\u2019s last nuclear test. Instead, the officials say, Beijing is pressing for targeted sanctions against individuals in the North Korean nuclear complex, which are unlikely to have serious repercussions.But after the North Korean test on Jan. 6, the South\u2019s president, Park Geun-hye, said she would consider accepting the missile system, as the United States has long insisted. China agreed during the talks on Wednesday to approve some form of new United Nations sanctions against the North, but one American official said \u201cthat\u2019s different from sanctions that hurt.\u201d A draft of new sanctions was sent to China about 10 days ago, but by the time Mr. Kerry arrived in Beijing, China had not responded in substance, American officials said.Negotiations on their content will proceed in the coming days, Mr. Wang said. But these new sanctions \u201cmust not provoke new tensions,\u201d he added.Suggesting that the Obama administration was evincing a little too much concern about the North Korean nuclear test, and that Washington\u2019s attention would soon drift away, Mr. Wang said China \u201cwill not be swayed by specific events or the temporary mood of the moment.\u201dMr. Wang stuck to a basic theme, that China\u2019s preference is the reconvening of talks on North Korea. \u201cSanctions are not an end in themselves,\u201d he said.Mr. Kerry, however, made clear that Washington\u2019s position was that China, North Korea\u2019s biggest trading partner, needed to use its leverage and what he called its \u201cconnections\u201d with the country to pressure it to give up its nuclear arsenal.The Americans would like China to curb exports of oil, including aviation fuel, that help keep the bare-bones North Korean economy afloat. It has also asked China to crack down on its banks and businesses that give the North access to foreign exchange.A bill calling for sanctions against Chinese entities that help North Korea in its military programs, criminal activities and money laundering recently passed with strong support in the House of Representatives.As part of his attempt to persuade Beijing, Mr. Kerry used the example of the recent Iran deal: The restrictions on Iran\u2019s banks and financial institutions to conduct transactions abroad helped bring that country to the negotiating table over its nuclear program, a feat that Mr. Kerry led and that China supported, along with Russia.Mr. Kerry used the news conference to urge China to take similar actions against North Korea and to create another \u201cunited front.\u201d\u201cWith all due respect, more significant and impactful sanctions were put against Iran, which did not have nuclear weapons, than against North Korea, which does,\u201d Mr. Kerry said.The secretary faces a tough sell. President Xi Jinping of China made a decision last year that it was better for China to have a friendly, nuclear-armed North Korea on its border than a hostile, nuclear-armed North Korea, Chinese analysts have said.\u201cFor China, the worst-case scenario is you push North Korea over to become an enemy with nuclear weapons,\u201d said Zhang Baohui, director of the Center for Asian Pacific Studies at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. \u201cI think China has decided to tolerate North Korea as a nuclear state.\u201dNevertheless, Mr. Zhang said, China has urged North Korea to denuclearize. And the North\u2019s detonation of a nuclear device on Jan. 6 was a way of telling Beijing that it could not dictate the country\u2019s foreign policy, he said.Chinese officials have told their American counterparts that they were not informed of the timing of the test and that it came as a surprise. China has accused Washington of using the tests as an excuse to deploy the missile defense system in South Korea.\u201cThe Thaad has nothing to do with North Korea,\u201d said Wang Junsheng, a research fellow on Northeast Asia at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. \u201cIt is simply the U.S. technically trying to deter China and Russia with these missiles and strategically alienating South Korea from China.\u201d Hours after Mr. Kerry and Mr. Wang met, South Korea warned that North Korea might be preparing to launch a long-range rocket. On Thursday, Kim Min-seok, a spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry, declined to comment on a Japanese news agency report about possible preparations, but did note that North Korea had always tested a long-range rocket before each of its first three nuclear tests.There was no launch before the Jan. 6 test, \u201cso we worry that it may do\u201d so now, Mr. Kim said. North Korea has recently completed renovations on its Tongchang-ri launch site, near its northwestern border with China. Jane Perlez reported from Beijing, and David E. Sanger from Washington.

{"Headline": "Currency Devaluations by Asian Tigers Could Hinder Global Growth", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "Supported byChina\u2019s decision to push the value of its currency lower has opened a new front of worry for global investors: a potential wave of currency devaluations among the so-called Asian tigers \u2014 South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan.Such an outcome, a number of foreign exchange specialists say, would put a further damper on global growth expectations, which already are being revised downward as China\u2019s once-booming economy retrenches.The dollar\u2019s strong run recently \u2014 together with the plunge in the price of oil and other commodities \u2014 has damaged fragile emerging-market economies like Brazil, Turkey and South Africa; the dollar has risen 130 percent against the Brazilian real and the South African rand since mid-2011.The currencies of fast-growing Asian countries, including India, have largely been insulated, thanks to their better-performing economies and their ability to stockpile large foreign currency reserve positions.But having a strong currency at a time when manufacturing competitors like Japan and China have weaker currencies leads to a sharp fall in exports, which have been the economic lifeblood of these countries for decades.\u201cThese countries have some of the most overvalued exchange rates on the planet,\u201d said Julian Brigden of Macro Intelligence 2 Partners, an independent research firm based in Vail, Colo., that advises large money management firms on global investment themes.When economies have high exchange rates, their exports tend to lose market share compared with countries with cheaper currencies. And when that happens, countries that depend on foreign trade will frequently take steps to push their currencies lower.Echoing these fears, the finance minister of Mexico, Luis Videgaray, warned on Thursday that the Chinese currency actions could lead to a new round of competitive devaluations.The fear is that a currency war in Southeast Asia \u2014 where the Asian financial crisis erupted in 1997 \u2014 could result in lower growth and add to the already substantial concerns about the global economy this year and next.Earlier this week, the World Bank lowered its estimate for global growth to 2.9 percent from 3.3 percent, with expectations for just about all major economies being revised downward.Already, global money managers have begun to pull money out of some of these Asian markets.The Korean won and the Singapore dollar are down 5 percent, while the Taiwan dollar has lost 7 percent over the last six months. Even in India, perhaps the most popular emerging market among global investors, the currency has given ground, about 7 percent, against the United States dollar.Underpinning the fears about a currency war have been the disappointing export figures from the region.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.In Taiwan, government officials say they expect exports for last year to have fallen 10 percent; and in Singapore, the manufacturing sector at the heart of the country\u2019s export-based model slumped 6 percent in the most recent quarter.These export figures are disturbing because they reflect that something deeper is ailing the global economy than simply a slowing China that is buying less oil from Nigeria, iron ore from Brazil or copper from Chile.Strong currencies in the Asian tiger countries have made their high-end electronic products, like Samsung phones from South Korea and computer parts from Taiwan, more expensive in Europe and the United States, their biggest markets.And with China, their main export competitor, expected to to let the renminbi weaken further, these countries will face further pressure to let their currencies fall.The sudden export drop-off for manufacturing powerhouses like South Korea and Singapore troubles analysts who see it as a sign that the slowdown in the global economy is worse than people expect.\u201cI expect these currencies to fall by another 20 or 30 percent,\u201d said Raoul Pal, an independent financial analyst and the founder of Real Vision TV, a media venture where sophisticated investors discuss their views on the market. \u201cThese export figures are a big deal \u2014 it\u2019s a huge shrinkage in the dollar-based economy, as not enough people are buying goods.\u201dFor quite some time, Mr. Pal has been promoting an investment thesis that the relentless rise of the dollar \u2014 since mid-2011, the dollar is up 35 percent against a broad basket of currencies \u2014 will have a deflationary effect on the global economy as export-driven economies enter into a series of competitive devaluations to protect crucial export sectors.\u201cThis is not just a commodity story,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a global trade story.\u201dExchange-rate volatility in this part of the world will not take the heat off other weak currencies. In addition to usual examples like Turkey, Brazil and South Africa, investors expect commodity exporters like Indonesia, Chile and Colombia to take a big hit, as the prices for their products continue to fall.The final frontier in this respect would be the pegged currencies in the Middle East, especially the Saudi Arabian riyal, which is tightly linked to the dollar.Although Saudi Arabia has been running budget deficits of close to 20 percent of gross domestic product because of the fall in oil prices, it still has a war chest of $635 billion in foreign exchange reserves that it can tap to defend the riyal.The other problem with downward trending currencies in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore is that these countries, like just about all emerging market economies, have taken advantage of a rock-bottom interest rate environment to issue billions of dollars in dollar-denominated corporate debt to finance capital investments.Foreign investors were attracted to the high yields and especially the stable currencies and bought them in huge quantities. Now, with the currencies starting to wobble, dollar-based investors have less incentive to hold on to them, and they will do what they have been doing with their Brazilian, Turkish and South African bonds \u2014 get rid of them as quickly as possible.\u201cThere is a lot of underlying investor exposure in these markets,\u201d said Mr. Brigden, the independent research analyst. \u201cI think if things continue to get worse, we are going to move to liquidation stage.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the change in the exchange rate between the United States dollar and the Brazilian real and the South African rand. The dollar has increased 130 percent compared with the real and the rand since mid-2011; the real and the rand have not weakened 130 percent against the dollar in that time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vietnam Faces Last-Minute Maneuvering for Communist Party Leadership", "Date": "2016-01-18", "News": "Supported by\u201cYou could see his face just freeze,\u201d Mr. Michalak, now the senior vice president of the U.S.-Asean Business Council, recalled with a chuckle. Mr. Michalak quickly told Mr. Dung that he wanted to toast his health and make a friendly suggestion: The caterers should serve American beef at the next such diplomatic event.\u201cHe just cracked up, and we started drinking vodka,\u201d Mr. Michalak said. \u201cAnd ever since then, at every one of these dinners, he always would make sure to have a shot of vodka with me.\u201dOn Wednesday, Vietnam\u2019s ruling Communist Party is to convene its national congress, which meets every five years to select the country\u2019s top leaders. And Mr. Dung, a charismatic prime minister who favors closer ties with the United States, is battling to succeed Nguyen Phu Trong, a conservative apparatchik looking to stay on in the party\u2019s top job of general secretary, according to several analysts, diplomats and business leaders.The outcome of these congresses is usually settled months in advance, but a protracted spat between factions loyal to Mr. Dung and Mr. Trong has resulted in last-minute maneuvering. Whoever comes out on top could determine the future of Vietnam\u2019s carefully calibrated strategic balance between China, its ideological ally and main trading partner, and the United States, which the party elite increasingly considers an important counterweight against growing Chinese influence in the region.\u201cIf the conservative faction emerges the winner at this party congress, the U.S. may find that it would need to do even more trust-building with Hanoi\u201d than it has done lately, said Phuong Nguyen, an associate fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\u201cTrade and investment ties are expected to still forge ahead if the TPP is ratified,\u201d she said, but she predicted that it would be more difficult for Washington to expand military ties with Vietnam if Mr. Trong\u2019s faction prevailed.At 66, Mr. Dung is five years younger than Mr. Trong. But according to a longstanding rule, the age limit for a member of the Politburo to start a new term is 65. The leadership can grant an exception, however, and Mr. Dung has been angling for one so he can succeed Mr. Trong as the party\u2019s general secretary, several Vietnamese political observers have said in recent months.That prospect, once considered almost inevitable, has come to seem less likely in recent days as Mr. Trong and his supporters have sought to force Mr. Dung into retirement, analysts said. The apparent turnaround has caused concern among Vietnam\u2019s urban intellectuals, many of whom view Mr. Dung as the best hope for further integration into the global economy and curbing Chinese influence in the region.\u201cDung doesn\u2019t have many allies in the Politburo, and it\u2019s very hard for him to change the status quo, so we are worrying,\u201d said a Vietnamese academic at a state-affiliated institution, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive political matter.While Mr. Trong\u2019s supporters are said to have the upper hand in the elite, 16-member Politburo, they are worried that Mr. Dung, an unusually dynamic prime minister, has undercut the party leadership by strengthening government institutions and building a vast patronage network among provincial party bosses and in the 175-member Central Committee.One chain of events that has been discussed in recent days is that the party\u2019s top four leaders, including Mr. Dung and Mr. Trong, will retire and cede power to a younger crop of Politburo members, apparently in a victory for Mr. Trong\u2019s camp. Some analysts said Mr. Trong may even remain in his post for another year or two to keep a lid on tensions inside the party elite.It is not entirely clear how the leadership shuffle will affect Vietnam\u2019s warming relationship with the United States, or its efforts to assert its economic independence and sovereignty over parts of the South China Sea without angering China.In May 2014, the Chinese oil rig episode set off street protests in some cities that were initially tolerated \u2014 some said encouraged \u2014 by the government, and then riots at industrial parks in central and southern provinces. Mr. Dung, unlike other party leaders, responded to the Chinese move with denunciations of Beijing\u2019s territorial ambitions that appealed to Vietnamese patriotism.Relations between the Communist neighbors have since recovered somewhat, and Mr. Dung shook hands with President Xi Jinping of China when he visited Hanoi in November. But many Vietnamese object to China\u2019s island-building projects in disputed waters, viewing them as reminders of Chinese imperial conquests of Vietnam. They also resent China\u2019s economic influence here, in the form of growing trade, tourism and infrastructure projects.Mr. Dung\u2019s economic record has been marred by scandals at state-owned enterprises and a bout of debilitating inflation. Yet he is still widely seen as the party\u2019s strongest proponent of opening the Vietnamese economy to more foreign investment and competition, and of Vietnam\u2019s membership in the TPP.\u201cUntil now, none of our leaders did much to internationalize Vietnam, but Dung is different \u2014 he stands out,\u201d said Nguyen Viet Ha, who runs a chemical-trading company in Hanoi. \u201cBefore, we depended on China a bit more, and now we\u2019re a bit more independent and have access to Western technology.\u201dBui Kien Thanh, an American-educated businessman who has advised Mr. Dung and other prime ministers on economic policy, acknowledged that such policies had left Mr. Dung open to criticism. \u201cA lot of people say Nguyen Tan Dung is an American ally and so on, but that is only talk,\u201d he said. \u201cNguyen Tan Dung sees very well that economic opening cannot go without good relations with the U.S.\u201dOther analysts and business leaders said relations with the United States would remain on an upward swing even if Mr. Dung were forced to retire. Mr. Trong\u2019s visit to the White House in July \u2014 the first by a Vietnamese Communist Party boss \u2014 was a clear sign of a growing consensus across party factions that better relations with the United States is in Vietnam\u2019s national interest, they said.Mr. Michalak, the former American ambassador, said Vietnam\u2019s relationship with China had \u201cdropped down a few degrees\u201d since the oil rig dispute. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to change anytime soon no matter what government gets in\u201d at the congress, he added.The United States, meanwhile, eased a longstanding ban on the sale of lethal arms to the country in October 2014, saying there have been incremental improvements in Vietnam\u2019s human rights record.But human rights activists have pushed back against that narrative, and many said they expect no improvement in civil liberties as a result of the leadership transition.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Noon Swoon,\u2019 Then Recovery That May Signal Market Turnaround", "Date": "2016-01-20", "News": "Supported bySoon after midday on Wednesday, panic selling seemed to be seizing the United States stock market.The Dow Jones industrial average was down more than 500 points, and all the fears that have driven this year\u2019s declines \u2014 including concerns that the world economy is slowing \u2014 seemed as potent as ever.Then investors\u2019 mood changed.Buyers rushed in, sending the Dow up over 400 points. What could have been a rout ended up being just the sort of down day that investors have had to get used to this year.The Dow closed off 249 points, or 1.56 percent, to 15,766.74. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, a broader benchmark, fell 22 points, or 1.17 percent, to 1,859.33. The Nasdaq composite index ended barely changed, 5.26 points lower, or 0.12 percent.And after spiking, the Vix index, which measures investors\u2019 expectations of volatility and is known as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, tumbled.To some, the turnaround felt a little like the sort of cathartic turning point that can signal a bottom on the markets \u2014 at least for a time.\u201cThe noon swoon today looked to me to be consistent with sort of important lows that I\u2019ve seen over the years,\u201d said Douglas A. Kass, a founder of Seabreeze Partners Management. \u201cYou had panic, fear and immobility on the part of many investors.\u201dThe main reason that the analysts gave for their tempered optimism is that the global economy does not appear to be in as poor a shape as the stock market is suggesting. In other words, while many countries, including China and its $10 trillion economy, still face stiff challenges, the United States stock market now appears to already reflect such risks, these analysts say.\u201cIt feels like we are discounting too much bad news ahead,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. \u201cOn these sort of days, you want to go and look at how the economy is doing, and it appears that the financial markets are overreacting.\u201dIn recent years, global stocks have at times sold off sharply without a clear, cataclysmic trigger. Instead, the cause has been concern that the global economy is faltering. In 2011 and 2012, Europe was the source of most fears. Then last year, China started to unsettle global markets, especially after its shock currency devaluation in August.Still, investors have in recent years jumped back into the market after they have concluded that the world economy is not sliding into recession and that the global financial system is not about seize up as it did in 2008.The markets, however, will have to rise by quite a lot to recover their recent losses.The S.&P. 500 has slid 9.03 percent so far this year and is now 12.74 percent below the nominal high that it reached last year. After adjusting for inflation, the stock market is lower than it was in 1999.And some markets are still flashing warning signals.On Wednesday, for instance, investors sought the safety of government bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which falls as its price rises, slipped to 1.99 percent, from 2.06 percent, the first time it has closed below the 2 percent threshold since October.The tumbling price of oil has also persuaded investors to be cautious. Cheaper oil reduces costs for companies and consumers. But a falling oil price could also be a signal that companies require less oil, which in turn could be an early signal that the world economy is on the verge of decelerating.The impulse when the stock market falls hard for a few days in a row is to do something but it probably doesn\u2019t make much sense to overhaul an investment strategy based on a blip of market activity.And on Wednesday, oil prices resumed their slide; the price of a barrel of crude oil reached the lowest level since May 2003. Crude oil was down 6.7 percent, to settle at $26.55 a barrel in trading for February futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange.European stocks ended sharply lower on Wednesday. The Euro Stoxx 50 index was down 3.3 percent. The FTSE 100 in London closed the day down 3.46 percent. London stocks are now down more than 20 percent from their April high: a level analysts generally regard as a bear market.Stocks in Japan closed 3.7 percent lower, bringing the Nikkei 225\u2019s total decline since its near-term high in June into bear market territory, too.The trading action in the United States stock market contained some unexpected moves. Shares of Twitter, which have plunged in recent weeks, surged on takeover rumors, leaving the stock up 4.13 percent for the day.Pradnya Joshi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Constitutional Standoff in Venezuela", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe ruling, which disqualified three opposition lawmakers, was a preposterous attempt to prevent Parliament from making sweeping reforms the country desperately needs.On Wednesday, opposition leaders agreed to sideline the three lawmakers for the time being. While that deprives the new Parliament, for the time being, of the sweeping powers it would have had with 112 seats, the minimum number needed for a two-thirds supermajority, the move eased a constitutional clash that many Venezuelans feared could unleash violence.Parliament leaders nonetheless intend to start legislating in an effort to get political prisoners released and to start addressing the country\u2019s economic crisis.To make headway, the new Parliament will need sustained and robust international support. Leaders in the hemisphere should make clear to Mr. Maduro that they stand ready to invoke the Inter-American Democratic Charter, which censures a clear breach of democratic practices, if he and his loyalists continue to render the Parliament powerless through unconstitutional means.He recently suggested that he would send lawmakers draft legislation outlining measures the country can take to start mending the economy, which is reeling from low oil prices, absurd currency policies and soaring inflation. Making good on that promise would be a sign that Mr. Maduro is willing to work with lawmakers who were elected by the people.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Obama Speech Points to Successes, as Would-Be Successors Look On", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported byThere was Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a Republican contender, and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who is seeking the Democratic nomination, walking into the House chamber together. They quickly separated as the procession of senators dissolved into a scrum of hearty handshakes, backslaps and overly dramatized pecks on the cheek.Other aspirants, like Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, chose to skip Mr. Obama\u2019s speech to campaign in New Hampshire instead.Mr. Obama acknowledged their ambitions when he used his opening remarks to joke dryly: \u201cFor this final one, I\u2019m going to try to make it a little shorter. I know some of you are antsy to get back to Iowa.\u201dThe candidates were not the only ones in a rush. Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, wielding the gavel at the State of the Union for the first time, sped through the formalities. Even his requisite declaration of having the \u201chigh honor and distinct privilege\u201d of introducing the president of the United States was said with uncommon speed.For the most part, Congress\u2019s reaction to the president was a reflection of the bitter partisanship that Mr. Obama had pledged to reverse when he was elected. Democrats often stood to cheer. Republicans mostly remained firmly in their chairs. Mr. Ryan\u2019s face was fixed in an emotionless half smile.A line declaring that \u201ca thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy\u201d received bipartisan applause. But when the president went on to chide big banks and big oil, Democrats cheered while Republicans were largely silent. And when Mr. Obama declared that food-stamp recipients did not cause the financial crisis, that immigrants were not responsible for stagnant wages and most families watching his speech do not avoid paying taxes through offshore accounts, Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut, pumped her fists in the air, saying, \u201cYes!\u201dSome aspects of the ritual remained, with a fair amount of glad-handing. And Michelle Obama, wearing a marigold dress, received a roaring ovation as she entered her box in the balcony.Before the formal proceedings, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, could be seen scurrying through the hallways in search of H-128, a ceremonial room tucked away on the House side of the Capitol that was being used as a holding room for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Mr. McCain, who served four years in the House in the mid-1980s, finally got directions from a Capitol police officer.Guests filed into the Capitol as the season\u2019s first snow fell on Washington.Jim Harbaugh, fresh off a 10-3 season in his first year as the University of Michigan\u2019s football coach and attending as a guest of Representative Justin Amash, Republican of Michigan, posed for photos near the entrance as a group of police officers looked on.But the lawmakers were not just the subjects \u2014 some were also the photographers.Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, held her iPhone above the crowd to capture a photo as she approached the House chamber, drawing laughter from Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, who is an avid photographer, carried his digital camera as he entered Statuary Hall, where television crews had set up small encampments amid the stone monuments.\u201cGotcha!\u201d Mr. Leahy cried, examining the shot he had just captured before pausing to take another.Some lawmakers found more subtle ways to make an impression. Senator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa, stepped out in the same camouflage-print pumps she wore when she gave the Republican response to the State of the Union last year.In this year\u2019s response, Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina seemed to be part of a pointed effort by Republican leaders to wrest control of the party\u2019s message back from Donald J. Trump, the billionaire and leading presidential contender in the polls.Ms. Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants who became her state\u2019s first female and minority governor, urged Americans not to marginalize immigrants in the face of current threats, an apparent reference to Mr. Trump\u2019s recent call for barring foreign Muslims from entering the country\u201cDuring anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices,\u201d she said. \u201cWe must resist that temptation. No one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country.\u201dMs. Haley has also been especially critical of Mr. Obama on national security and military cuts, a message that resonated in her response on Tuesday.\u201cWe would make international agreements that were celebrated in Israel and protested in Iran, not the other way around,\u201d she said in a jab at Mr. Obama\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran.Mr. Obama, relaxed in tone and language, expressed frustration over the congressional gridlock that has been an unwanted hallmark of his presidency.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the few regrets of my presidency \u2014 that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThere are a whole lot of folks in this chamber \u2014 good people \u2014 who would like to see more cooperation, a more elevated debate in Washington, but feel trapped by the demands of getting elected, by the noise coming out of your base.\u201dAnd then he told members of Congress something they all know too well: \u201cOur brand of democracy is hard.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Trump, is as skilled as Mr. Christie at belittling his rivals.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t my first rodeo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Christie, a former federal prosecutor. Referring to Mr. Rubio, he added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis guy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been spoon-fed every victory he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ever had in his life.\u00e2\u0080\u009dOn Thursday in Nashua, N.H., Mr. Rubio laughed off Mr. Christie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s barbs and underscored his argument that Mr. Christie was a fake conservative who would extend the Obama administration, not undo its work. But the back-and-forth was opportunity-rich for Mr. Christie.It gave him a chance to grab the spotlight after months of being eclipsed by Mr. Trump as the bluntest-speaking candidate in the race. It gave him a chance to showcase his talents as a political performer. And it gave him a chance to demonstrate that Mr. Rubio, 44, a first-term senator from Florida, might not be as battle-ready as his supporters believe, or as tough as his muscular new campaign ads might suggest.Increasingly, as he did in mocking Mr. Rubio, Mr. Christie has been arguing to voters that he is electable in November \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and that, by implication, his rivals are not.Mr. Bush, who the polls show is also inching up in New Hampshire, is also engaging in increasingly aggressive combat. A piece of mail from the super PAC supporting him, Right to Rise USA, arrived in homes in New Hampshire on Thursday: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs Chris Christie a fiscal conservative? Not exactly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it warns, alongside a litany of red-letter warnings about Mr. Christie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic stewardship of New Jersey.

He also suggested Mr. Rubio was uninterested in campaigning, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never here.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Rubio did not hit back hard at Mr. Christie until Thursday, when he delivered a detailed attack on Mr. Christie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record.\u00e2\u0080\u009cChris has a very liberal record for a Republican,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Rubio told reporters in Nashua. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI mean, he supported Common Core. He ran for office as a supporter of gun control. He personally gave a contribution to Planned Parenthood. So I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really want to have a conversation about the issues, because the truth is our next president has to be someone who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to overturn all the damage Barack Obama has done to America, not continue it.\u00e2\u0080\u009dYet the sniping Mr. Rubio is now engaged in is somewhat at odds with his professed image as an Obama-esque Republican: upbeat, optimistic and above the fray. Mr. Rubio also has noticeably darkened his tone on the campaign trail. Once the candidate who dismissively criticized Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cMake America Great Again\u00e2\u0080\u009d slogan by telling audiences, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerica is great,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Rubio has been lamenting the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trajectory more and more in recent days.\u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerica is a great nation in decline,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said on Thursday at a house party in Bedford, N.H.Voters seemed confused by that message.Debbie Urbanik, 48, of Dunbarton, N.H., said she was surprised by how hard a line Mr. Rubio took on Mr. Obama. She said she voted for the president, but could see herself voting for a Republican this year. She was not sure yet whether that might be Mr. Rubio.\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo listen to somebody stand up there saying, \u00e2\u0080\u0098This is all Barack Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fault,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is not a good message,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I had heard him stand up there and say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Listen, our economy is broken and it started with this, and it evolved through this, and I want to fix it this way,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I would have gotten excited.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was hoping I would walk out of here like, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Yeah,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Urbanik added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel as great as I wanted to.

{"Headline": "Can U.S. Remain an Island of Stability in the Global Economy?", "Date": "2016-01-07", "News": "Supported byMarket TurmoilAnd in the United States, the number of people filing unemployment claims is hovering near the lowest levels in four decades, the jobless rate may well fall below 5 percent for the first time since 2007, and whatever the noise on the presidential campaign trail, Congress recently passed bipartisan legislation to keep the government running comfortably into next year.Seven days in, 2016 is shaping up to be a chaotic year in global economics and geopolitics, with profound challenges nearly everywhere. Except, for now at least, in the world\u2019s largest economy. The American economy is acting as a steadying force in a volatile world.A giant question for 2016 \u2014 not just for Americans but for people across the globe who benefit from having one of the world\u2019s major economic engines revving while others sputter \u2014 is how resilient the United States will prove to be.On the other hand, in the past the United States has shown an uncanny tendency to benefit economically from tumult abroad.\u201cThe United States may not have incredibly robust economic growth and has plenty of problems you can point to,\u201d said Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, a geopolitical consultancy. \u201cBut from a stability perspective, when things are more unstable, the United States in some ways gets stronger\u201d as both people and investment dollars gravitate to the nation\u2019s relative stability.The truth is, not one of the problems that have flared across financial news tickers so far in 2016 is completely new or surprising. Rather, they are continuations of trends that were well established in 2015.Oil prices fell to $37 a barrel from around $53 a barrel over the course of last year, and are now under $34. The Shanghai composite index fell sharply starting in June of last year, and even after steep declines in the opening days of 2016 is above its late-August level (though it is anybody\u2019s guess how much it would have fallen absent a string of government interventions to try to stanch the declines).Economic growth has been slowing not just in China but across many emerging markets, including Brazil and Nigeria, for two years now. Europe and Japan are growing only barely, and even formerly hot advanced economies like Canada are suffering from the commodity glut.Against that gloomy backdrop, the consensus economic forecasts for the United States \u2014 the International Monetary Fund forecasts 2.8 percent growth in 2016 \u2014 look pretty terrific. The American stock market indexes, despite the global sell-off and major hits to oil companies\u2019 earnings, remain above their September levels.But there are two basic questions about the notion that the United States can serve as an island of economic and political stability in a messy world.First, what happens if that changes? Second, what happens if it doesn\u2019t?The \u201cthings change\u201d situation is the risk that these global headwinds become too powerful for the United States to overcome.Already, oil producers and their suppliers are suffering. The American industrial sector is groaning under the weight of a strong dollar, which drives up the price of exported goods. That\u2019s a consequence of the mismatch between growth in the United States and the rest of the world.The strength in the service sector and the broader consumer economy in the United States has offset any damage so far. But the 2008 crisis showed how the global economy is intertwined in ways that are hard to predict \u2014 and that\u2019s before accounting for the geopolitical dangers from the Middle East and the Korean Peninsula that could cause major economic disruptions if they take a dark turn.If something does go wrong, the usual buffers in the global economy look to be weakened or nonexistent right now. Government deficits are high in much of the world, and even where they aren\u2019t, political leaders have shown no desire to open the spending floodgates in an effort to bolster economies. If the American economy were to slump and President Obama were to ask the Republican Congress for fiscal stimulus, it would give new meaning to \u201cDead on Arrival.\u201dThen there\u2019s the less obvious risk from this mismatch between what is happening in the United States and the rest of the world \u2014 the risk of what happens if it doesn\u2019t change.During the years running up to the 2008 crisis, the United States served as the global consumer of last resort. Americans kept shopping when the rest of the world hunkered down. The side effect of that role in the global economy was constantly increasing debt, which in the precrisis era frequently took the form of mortgage-related securities.The longer other global economies remain a mess and the United States remains on a relatively steady course, the more these same forces will reassert themselves. This means that an ever-strengthening dollar will hobble American exporters while fueling an American consumption binge. Broadly, it would mean that crisis-era hopes of a more balanced global economy might not come to fruition.In other words, the best thing that could happen for the global economy would be for the mismatch between the United States and the rest of the world to end \u2014 and not because the United States falters. Rather, it would happen if Europe and Japan achieved more rapid growth, China managed its shift toward a more consumer-driven economy and other emerging markets weathered a tough year while continuing their progress toward stable and sustainable growth.It\u2019s a tall order for a world full of unpredictable risks. Good thing 2016 has another 51 weeks to go.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Emerging Markets Roar, Stand Your Ground", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byFundamentallyWhile most forms of investing require a leap of faith, betting on emerging-markets stock funds this year \u2014 Chinese stocks have already had double-digit declines \u2014 may feel like jumping across the Grand Canyon.Not only have shares of companies based in developing economies like China, Brazil and Russia been mired in a prolonged bear market \u2014 prices were down about 40 percent from April 2011 through Thursday, compared with a 44 percent gain percent for American stocks \u2014 but this once-promising group was also hit with a double whammy of bad news at the end of last year.There was the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision in December to raise short-term interest rates for the first time since 2006. Near-zero rates, intended to encourage risk-taking, induced investors to pump billions of dollars into the developing world in search of higher yields and better returns.Now rates are a bit higher and the mood is very different. \u201cUncertainty associated with the Fed and guidance on future rate hikes is a big overhanging negative\u201d for emerging-market shares, said Brian D. Singer, head of dynamic allocation strategies at the asset manager William Blair.Despite this bad news, money managers and market strategists say there is a compelling case for long-term investors to have a presence in the developing world.A big reason is valuations.Historically, the price-earnings ratio of emerging-market stocks \u2014 based on five years of averaged, or \u201cnormalized,\u201d profits \u2014 has been roughly 20 percent lower than the price-earnings ratio for stocks in the United States, according to figures compiled by the Leuthold Group. During the global financial crisis in 2008, emerging-market shares actually traded at a 20 percent premium.Today, these stocks are 53 percent cheaper than domestic shares.The last time they were this inexpensive was in 2000, shortly after the Asian currency crisis raised questions about the health of those economies. From mid-1997 through 2000, emerging-market shares declined more than 30 percent.In hindsight, said Jason Hsu, vice chairman of Research Affiliates, the aftermath of the Asian currency crisis was probably among the best times to be invested in these shares.From 2000 through 2007, emerging-market stocks tripled in value while the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index of domestic shares was flat. \u201cThe lesson of the Asian currency crisis,\u201d Mr. Hsu said, is that \u201crebounds can come fast and furious and waiting can sometimes hurt you.\u201dResearch Affiliates predicts that over the next decade, emerging-market stock returns will outpace inflation by nearly 8 percentage points a year, owing much to lower valuations. By contrast, the firm predicts that blue-chip domestic stocks will beat inflation by only about 1 percentage point a year.Fed rate increases are likely to hurt companies in the emerging world in a couple of ways: Rising interest rates could slow global growth, which may further reduce demand for commodities, and rising domestic rates could also strengthen the value of the dollar against emerging-market currencies.\u201cIf the dollar continues to strengthen, companies and countries holding dollar-denominated debt could be hit with solvency issues,\u201d said Arjun Jayaraman, a portfolio manager with Causeway Capital Management. That is because their debt burden based on their local currencies would rise.But Mr. Jayaraman also pointed out that if the Fed increases are more gradual than expected, leading to \u201ca slow and steady increase in the dollar, the emerging markets can weather that better,\u201d he said.Also, market watchers think that if the slowdown in China is not as pronounced as the market fears, that, too, could be good news for emerging-market equities.How then can investors play this volatile group of stocks for the long term while still trying to play it safe? There are several strategies.Investors could simply \u201cdollar-cost average\u201d into emerging-market stocks, which means putting money to work in the markets in small increments on a regular schedule, which investors already do effortlessly with their 401(k) retirement accounts.\u201cIf you think in the long run you\u2019d be comfortable putting 15 percent of your stock portfolio in the emerging markets but don\u2019t know if today is the right time, give yourself a window \u2014 say, 15 months \u2014 and commit to putting 1 percentage point to work each month come hell or high water,\u201d Mr. Hsu said. \u201cThat takes away the anxiety over whether the timing is exactly right.\u201dLewis J. Altfest, a financial planner in New York City, suggests being selective about the type of emerging-market stocks you own.For instance, he said, \u201cif you\u2019re worried about commodities, you want to be in those countries that are beneficiaries of low commodity prices, not victims.\u201d He pointed to industrial and consumer economies such as India and South Korea that stand to gain with low energy and raw-materials prices.Jeffrey N. Kleintop, chief global investment strategist for Charles Schwab, agreed, suggesting that investors stay away from commodity-based economies such as Brazil, Russia and South Africa, instead focusing on more diverse economies such as Mexico, South Korea and Taiwan.To be sure, such a strategy does have a drawback. While stock market valuations in commodity-producing emerging markets are dirt cheap \u2014 Russian stocks, for instance, trade at a price-earnings ratio of around 6 \u2014 commodity importers like South Korea and India are more expensive. The average price-earnings for the MSCI South Korea index, for instance, is about 10 while Indian stocks trade at 19 times their projected earnings.\u201cYes, the emerging markets are cheap, but it\u2019s not the cheapest ones you necessarily want to own,\u201d Mr. Kleintop said, citing the danger of plunging commodity prices.This calls for seeding a portfolio partly with companies based in economies like India that might not be hurt by lower commodity prices. Among the fund\u2019s top holdings in India is HDFC Bank, a large retail bank. Then the other part can be devoted to \u201cthings that are outright cheap,\u201d Mr. Wilson said. \u201cI would put China in that camp. The market is too concerned about the growth outlook for China without noticing the low valuations.\u201dAmong the fund\u2019s top holdings in China is China Mobile, the world\u2019s largest wireless phone company.For instance, he pointed out that over the next 10 to 20 years, the sheer demographic shifts taking place in China \u2014 including the growing middle class and the aging population \u2014 may point to favorable conditions for the country\u2019s health care sector.\u201cIn the next 10 years, the pharmaceutical market there could be the second largest in the world, outside the U.S.,\u201d he said. Even better, that market is most likely to grow no matter what happens to commodity prices or interest rates.If you are able to take a really long view, emerging markets may not be as scary as they seem.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Studies Point to Inequalities That Could Strain Chinese Society", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Supported bySinosphereBEIJING \u2014 President Xi Jinping calls it his \u201cChina Dream\u201d \u2014 a vision of a cohesive, equal society, increasingly wealthy and healthy, and happily wedded to Communist Party rule, ardent patriotism and traditional values. That vision, splashed on television and billboards everywhere here, has driven Mr. Xi\u2019s vow that under his administration, Chinese society will become more equal and just.But two new studies from institutes in Beijing suggest that while Chinese people remain wedded, though not always blissfully, to the status quo, Mr. Xi confronts a persistent undercurrent of discontent with inequality in incomes, schooling opportunities and health care. That social strain could become troublesome, especially if the economy continues to falter.\u201cAt the same time that our nation\u2019s total wealth has rapidly grown, there are increasingly pronounced imbalances in Chinese society,\u201d it said. \u201cThis is reflected not only in the polarization of incomes and wealth, but also in plainly observable disparities in education, health and other social protections.\u201dMr. Xi and his prime minister, Li Keqiang, have said that overcoming these social imbalances is a priority. But the report, drawing on the results of an annual survey covering more than 35,000 adults and 13,000 families, warns that more needs to be done.\u201cThese problems demand effective solutions,\u201d the report said. \u201cOtherwise, it is very possible that they will threaten social stability and become a bottleneck in social and economic development.\u201dThe study shows that, as in all societies, family background plays a powerful role in determining people\u2019s level of schooling, especially parents\u2019 educational attainment. But in China, political privilege is also an important factor. Whether your father is a member of the Communist Party \u2014 almost mandatory for government officials \u2014 is a powerful determinant of educational attainment, even, the study found, for Chinese born after 1980 under the market-oriented policies of Deng Xiaoping.\u201cHaving a father who is a party member also has a clear, positive effect on an individual\u2019s years of schooling,\u201d the study said. (A mother\u2019s party membership status has no discernible impact, it also found.)Discrimination against girls has weakened, but it remains a powerful factor in the opportunity for schooling, the study also found. On average, boys receive 1.5 more years of schooling than girls.Unequal access to health care has also been a source of dissatisfaction for many Chinese, especially residents of the countryside and small towns where medical insurance has been less widely available and where there are fewer doctors and hospitals.The survey found that the Chinese government\u2019s efforts to spread health insurance had made a difference. Growing numbers of rural residents have some, though it is usually not as generous as policies held by many city dwellers. And women also do worse than men.\u201cFemales, rural residents and low-income groups all enjoy fewer health care subsidies and pay a higher proportion by themselves,\u201d the study said.The professionals, managers, white-collar workers and business owners who make up China\u2019s middle class are a source of hope and anxiety for the nation\u2019s leaders. If its numbers, incomes and satisfaction grow, this middle class could remain a stabilizing pillar of Communist Party governance. But if this wealthier, educated urban stratum becomes unhappy, then the party\u2019s grip could weaken.For now, most members of the Chinese middle class appear attached, for the most part, to the status quo, the Peking University study suggests. The notion that wealthier urbanites are poised to challenge party rule appears unfounded, even taking into account that many people in China may be reluctant to criticize the government, even in surveys.The study found that about 60 percent of respondents who identified as belonging to the \u201cupper middle stratum\u201d of society had a positive view of their local government\u2019s performance. By contrast, 48 percent of those who put themselves in the lowest stratum held a positive view.\u201cCompared to the working class, and especially workers in the state sector, China\u2019s middle class has a more positive assessment of perceptions of the rich-poor gap, trustworthiness of officials and government performance,\u201d the study said. \u201cThe middle class has the potential to become a social stabilizer.\u201dThat could change. A separate survey of more than 3,000 people published by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences found that middle-class Chinese are more politically engaged than other members of society.The survey, conducted across 12 months from late 2014 and published in the academy\u2019s 2016 \u201cblue book\u201d of social issues, found that 42.6 percent of middle-class respondents in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou said they discussed politics with those around them. Just 27.7 percent of people not in the middle class said they did so.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Human Rights Watch Denounces Europe Over Migrant Crisis", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 European governments have allowed widespread fears about migration and terrorism to erode their commitment to civil rights and liberal ideals, according to a new report by the advocacy group Human Rights Watch.The state of emergency allows security forces to conduct searches and to make arrests without warrants, and a lack of judicial oversight makes religious profiling, particularly of young Muslim men, more likely.\u201cPolice stops based on such profiling have long plagued the very populations that should be cultivated to help counter violence,\u201d the report said.Human Rights Watch urged the European Union to expand refugee resettlement programs and to issue humanitarian visas in \u201cplaces of first refuge,\u201d like Lebanon (for Syrian refugees) and Pakistan (for Afghan refugees).Nearly 3,800 people, a third of them children, drowned in the Mediterranean while trying to reach Europe last year, and a more humane and orderly process would make it easier to keep out terrorists, the group said.It also urged the Persian Gulf states and Russia, along with countries that traditionally take in many migrants, like Australia, Canada and the United States, to accept more.The report noted that Ethiopia, India, Russia and several other former Soviet countries had enacted restrictions on civic groups that receive foreign funding, to choke off potential sources of dissent.It faulted Bolivia, Cambodia, Ecuador, Hungary, Morocco and several other countries for using vaguely worded laws or regulations to suppress political expression, and Brazil, China and Egypt, among other nations, for using terrorism as a pretext for cracking down on civil liberties.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Corporate Raider Enters Picture, With Eye on a Sale of Ally", "Date": "2016-01-12", "News": "Supported byNow, an upstart New York hedge fund is trying to step into that pantheon of corporate bank raiders.Lion Point joins a select group of activist investors to take aim at a national, deposit-taking bank as part of a wave of activism that has touched just about every industry in the last two years. It raises the prospect that activism will soon spread to big institutions, like Bank of America, that suffer from lagging share prices.This week, some of the nation\u2019s largest banks report their fourth-quarter results, which are expected to show modest improvement but no cures for their lackluster returns. There are also renewed calls \u2014 this time on the presidential campaign trail \u2014 to break up the big banks.Lion Point\u2019s campaign, however, shows the long odds activists face in trying to shake up or split up a large, underperforming bank.Early this month, the hedge fund proposed two candidates for the board of Ally and urged the company to explore strategic alternatives. In a statement, Ally said Lion Point had a \u201cclear agenda to force\u201d the lender\u2019s sale. Ally, formerly known as GMAC, said that path would not be in the best interest of its other shareholders.Lion Point released a statement two days later, expressing disappointment with Ally\u2019s decision to publicly disclose their talks. The hedge fund said that the strategic review was only one part of their proposal to Ally, without elaborating on other suggestions.Often the mere disclosure of an activist campaign can cause a stock to soar. Ally\u2019s shares, however, have fallen about 12 percent since Lion Point\u2019s involvement became public last week.Inside Ally, there is also frustration with the share price, which has slumped 31 percent over the last year. Long before the activist effort spilled out into the public, Ally was under pressure from many of its other hedge fund investors, which bought the bank\u2019s shares after it went public in 2014 hoping it could ride the boom in auto sales, according to people briefed on the matter.But given the chance, Ally executives might entertain selling parts or all of the company, the people said. The reality, though, is that there are no obvious buyers for a bank with a market value of about $8 billion and more than $156 billion in assets.\u201cFinding an exit strategy for a bank the size of Ally is going to be difficult in the current regulatory environment,\u201d said Frederick L. Cannon, a banking analyst with the investment bank Keefe Bruyette & Woods. \u201cThe number of potential buyers is going to be pretty small.\u201dOne possible candidate is TD Bank Group, of Toronto, which has been acquiring smaller banks in the United States over the last decade, according to analysts and people briefed on the matter. So far, TD Bank has made no overtures toward Ally, the people said. A spokeswoman for TD Bank declined to comment.Regulators keep a close eye on any investor that acquires a significant stake in a bank. Once a fund manager surpasses an ownership of about 5 percent, the Federal Reserve could come in and request a passivity commitment, preventing the shareholder from trying to influence operations at the company or starting a proxy fight.If an investor tries to buy a stake greater than 10 percent, it must file an application with regulators for approval. These potential regulatory hindrances have dispelled activists from going after banks in the past. Lion Point owns about 1 percent of Ally.Lastly, there are certain conflicts of interest that would arise from aiming at the largest banks. For one, many of the hedge funds use these banks to conduct their trading. Additionally, law firms that would help advise on the shareholder\u2019s campaign also count these firms as clients and would be more hesitant in helping the activist.Despite the popularity of activism over the last few years, the financial sector has been largely untapped. In the nonbank sector of the industry, Carl C. Icahn has recently been pushing the insurer American International Group to break itself up.\u201cThere has been a lag of activists targeting this sector,\u201d said Josh Black, editor of Activist Insight. \u201cBut it\u2019s been building over a while by activists becoming more involved and looking for more targets in this sector.\u201dLion Point was started in 2014 by former portfolio managers from the activist hedge fund firms Elliott Management and Perry Capital, ultimately raising about $950 million from investors.Their fund joins about $350 billion in assets at activist-focused or partly focused funds, according to data compiled by Activist Insight, which tracks data on activism. The number of campaigns and amount of capital has increased the perception that the market is crowded, according to a report from FTI Consulting and Activist Insight; 40 percent of activist firms surveyed said that the opportunities had dwindled as more activists entered the fray.The challenges do not make campaigns against financial institutions impossible, however.In recent years, Nelson Peltz\u2019s Trian Fund Management has gone after both BNY Mellon and State Street, two systemically important institutions. At State Street, Mr. Peltz achieved some of his requests, such as higher margins and share buybacks, but not everything. At BNY Mellon, he achieved a board seat.In a number of ways, Ally appears ripe for a shake-up. Like many other large banks, its shares trade below book value, which is what the company would be worth if liquidated. All of the analysts who follow the company have a buy recommendation on the stock.Ally has been expanding its lending to car buyers with less-than-pristine credit, which has helped bolster revenue. But the move also increases the default risks when the economy slows, analysts say.\u201cA big concern for the banks right now is credit,\u201d said Mr. Cannon, the banking analyst. \u201cCredit has been so good for so long that there is a natural normalization that is occurring.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Trump, the leading Republican candidate who has taunted the Clintons recently over Mr. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history of extramarital affairs, but then he answered another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s query about whether his own past was fair game to discuss in the race.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Republicans have to decide who they want to nominate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton replied. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always  attempts to take the election away from people, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just going to give it to them.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Clinton didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just keep his well-known temper in check: He even stopped shaking hands and signing autographs after 15 minutes on the rope line, a place he has been known to spend an hour. It was one of several signs that, at least for this first trip, that Mr. Clinton was willing to play the role of supporting actor opposite his wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s starring role.If Mr. Clinton had a theme, it was portraying Mrs. Clinton (and himself) as high-minded advocates of \u00e2\u0080\u009cinclusive\u00e2\u0080\u009d policies \u2014 an adjective that he repeated several times \u2014  rather than exclusionary proposals like Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call for temporarily banning Muslims for entering the United States.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fit anymore,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton said about the current political climate. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFirst of all, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a happy grandfather. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not mad at anybody.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDescribing the ideas and work ethic of immigrants as potential \u201cmeal tickets\u00e2\u0080\u009d for the American economy, Mr. Clinton told some wandering anecdotes about Muslims and others who had stood up for Christians and defended their families. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to run away from the place we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been \u2014 the place that welcomes all people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said in his most direct implicit shot at Mr. Trump.Mr. Clinton was discursive as he moved back and forth from talking about his own presidency and the work of his foundation, which he mentioned a few times, to Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s candidacy and ideas. At one point he indicated that he was wrapping up the speech, but then began a lengthy description of Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s years of work in Arkansas and elsewhere to improve education for children and opportunities for low-income people and women.\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been elected to anything,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe was just a change maker.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAnd he had a warning for the audience of several hundred people at Nashua Community College, urging them not to take lightly the controversial policy ideas and harsh political language from some of presidential candidates.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re telling you what they believe \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to take them seriously,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlmost everybody goes into the White House with the best of intentions.  Whether they succeed or not depends upon whether their instincts, their experience, their knowledge, and their psychological make up fits the times,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not believe in my lifetime anybody has run for the job who is better qualified by experience, knowledge and temperament\u00e2\u0080\u009d than Mrs. Clinton.Several voters said after the speech that they were struck by Mr. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relatively muted style, but added that they were impressed that he kept much of the focus on his wife and did not upstage her in any unwelcome ways.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was low-key in a down-to-earth way, which I think is the right thing to do, because the limelight should be on Hillary,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Gail DuFresne, 59, a nurse from Rindge, N.H.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Economists Take Aim at Wealth Inequality", "Date": "2016-01-03", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When pundits and presidential candidates talk about inequality and the tiny sliver of the population whose fortunes have soared, they often drop names like Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Sheldon Adelson and Mark Zuckerberg.But those are just the most visible members of a larger but less-talked-about cadre of the big winners in today\u2019s economy. This group consists of roughly 250,000 Americans who mainly populate the executive offices and managerial suites of major companies and financial institutions, along with a smattering of top law firms, hedge funds and other elite aeries.These people \u2014 the top one-quarter of 1 percent of the country\u2019s employed population \u2014 have enjoyed explosive gains in income and wealth in recent decades, even as salaries and wages stagnated for the typical American worker.\u201cYou hear about C.E.O.s, entertainers, athletes and hedge funders, but that\u2019s the tip of the iceberg,\u201d said Nicholas A. Bloom, a professor of economics at Stanford who is finishing a paper examining the underlying dynamics of income inequality. \u201cIt\u2019s a much, much bigger group and they are outpacing everyone else.\u201dLike those of many of his peers who are presenting new research at the annual meeting of the American Economic Association, which began here on Sunday and ends on Tuesday, Mr. Bloom\u2019s findings are bringing to light fresh perspectives on why income inequality is growing and how it is reshaping the national and global economy.While the much-talked-about 1 percent is doing just fine, the supersize gains are taking place even further up the income ladder, according to what Mr. Bloom and four colleagues found by examining 35 years of data from the Social Security Administration.The phenomenon is not limited to Wall Street or the big banks \u2014 manufacturers rewarded their top executives every bit as generously as did firms in the finance, insurance and real estate sectors. And this pattern is being repeated in countries where the political landscape is quite different from that of the United States, like Sweden, Germany and Britain.\u201cThis is a truly global phenomenon, and I don\u2019t know any serious economist who would deny inequality has gone up,\u201d said Mr. Bloom, a native of Britain whose politics veer toward a laissez-faire approach and the Conservative Party there. \u201cThe debate is over the magnitude, not the direction.\u201dThe economic association\u2019s meeting is something of a barometer of what concerns economists most, drawing more than 13,000 attendees from the ranks of academia, as well as research groups and the private sector. And in panels, research presentations and speeches, what was once mainly a preoccupation of ivory tower Marxists and other players on the margins of the profession is taking center stage.\u201cIn the last few years, there\u2019s been a huge change in the mainstream of the profession,\u201d said Steven Fazzari, an economics professor at Washington University in St. Louis who first came to the conference as a job-hunting graduate student in 1982. \u201cThe issue of income inequality was a backwater in the economics field, and it was largely ignored.\u201dAt the same time, there\u2019s a growing consensus among economists of all ideological stripes that inequality is growing \u2014 in the United States and abroad \u2014 even if the usual political fault lines appear when the discussion turns to the consequences of the trend and whether new public policies are needed to address it.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty much indisputable that the percentage of income being earned by the top 1 percent, or the top quarter of 1 percent, is going up,\u201d said Richard H. Thaler, the association\u2019s president.\u201cIt was true five years ago, but it was not as widely recognized,\u201d said Mr. Thaler, a behavioral economist who teaches at the University of Chicago. \u201cAs with climate change, scientific consensus takes a while to build.\u201dAnd, to borrow language from an economic seminar, there\u2019s also a striking correlation between the emergence of income inequality as an issue here and the near-rock-star status accorded a handful of once-obscure experts on the subject inside and outside academia.The best known of these is Thomas Piketty, whose 700-page tome, \u201cCapital in the Twenty-First Century,\u201d became an improbable best-seller in 2014 and made the French academic a media superstar.Emmanuel Saez, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, who has collaborated with Mr. Piketty, won a MacArthur \u201cgenius\u201d grant in 2010. Raj Chetty of Stanford, who has looked closely at economic mobility, also received a MacArthur grant and has presented findings to Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush and Obama administration officials.\u201cThere are definitely fashions in the field,\u201d said Dean Baker, co-director of the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. \u201cAs much as most economists might hate to acknowledge it, there\u2019s no way you can\u2019t respond to Piketty\u2019s success.\u201dAnticipated presentations at the economic association meeting include new findings from David Autor, an influential M.I.T. economist, on the links between college performance and increased financial aid as well as research by Enrico Moretti of Berkeley into how state tax increases prompt the highest earners to move to lower-tax locations.For all the intense focus on the roots and extent of income inequality today, most academics are leery of any easy solution. At the same time, they acknowledge that their traditional tools are inadequate for the task.\u201cThere\u2019s no reason the free market will solve this,\u201d Mr. Bloom said.He believes inequality is being magnified by technological change and what\u2019s known as skills bias, where workers with a particular expertise reap the biggest reward. Neither is amenable to quick fixes.In Professor Bloom\u2019s new paper, which he wrote with David J. Price, a Stanford graduate student, and three other economists \u2014 Jae Song, Fatih Guvenen and Till von Wachter \u2014 the top quarter of 1 percent of Americans appears to be pulling away from the rest.For workers at this threshold, who earn at least $640,000 annually, their salaries rose 96 percent from 1981 to 2013, after taking account of inflation. The trend was especially pronounced among the most successful enterprises in the American economy, creating a divergence between the highest-paid people at companies that employ more than 10,000 people and the rest of the work force. In this rarefied circle, overall pay jumped 140 percent versus a 5 percent drop for the typical employee at these corporate behemoths.The split in compensation between executives and everyone else was much less pronounced at smaller companies, according to the research by Mr. Bloom and his colleagues. At these firms, between 1981 and 2013, top salaries rose 49 percent, while median pay rose 30 percent.In addition, Mr. Bloom and his team also found a sharp divergence between pay at the most successful companies and also-rans in the same field \u2014 think Apple versus BlackBerry. The highest-paid workers cluster at the winners, heightening income disparities in the overall work force.Mr. Bloom traces the outsize gains to large grants of stock and options to top workers at big companies, with their fortunes rising in line with the performance of the stock market.\u201cThere used to be a premium for working at a big company, even in a lower-level job,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not true anymore. The people who have really suffered are lower-level employees at big companies.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "2015 Was a Great Year for Jobs. 2016 Will Have a Hard Time Matching It.", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "Supported byJobs ReportThe newest numbers on the state of the American job market are good news on almost every front and show that 2015 was a blockbuster year for jobs. That raises some important questions \u2014 and doubts \u2014 about what will happen in 2016.The 292,000 jobs the Labor Department estimates the nation added in December, combined with upward revisions to past months, affirm that 2014 and 2015 had the strongest job gains since the boom of the late 1990s \u2014 5.8 million positions added to the nation\u2019s payrolls in a mere 24 months. It was enough to drive the jobless rate to 5 percent in December 2015 from 6.7 percent at the end of 2013.Given the scars left by the 2008 recession and slow recovery, this is all unabashed cause for celebration. There are opportunities for workers now that just weren\u2019t there in the years immediately after the recession.The bad news in the report, if you can call it that, was that average hourly earnings were unchanged. But given the very low inflation, American workers have still seen meaningful improvement in earnings power over the last year \u2014 a 2.5 percent rise in hourly earnings against a backdrop of barely visible inflation.Which brings us to the questions that remain.A big question for the year ahead is whether the breakneck pace of job growth of the last two years can continue now that the jobless rate is close to what economists consider full employment. And this boils down to how many Americans who currently aren\u2019t working can be coaxed back to work.In the latest numbers, the ratio of the population that was working ticked up to 59.5 percent in December, the highest since May 2009. That\u2019s the good news. The bad news is that number was 63 percent on the eve of the recession that began at the end of 2007.Here\u2019s some quick math. The lowest the unemployment rate has been in modern times was 3.8 percent in the spring of 2000. For the economy to get to that low level (which coincided with the peak of the dot-com boom, but that\u2019s a different story) with only the current labor force \u2014 people who are either working or actively looking for a job \u2014 1.9 million more Americans would need to find work.But if the United States keeps adding jobs in 2016 at the rate it did in 2015, we\u2019ll hit that number in no time: in September, to be precise.The sharp improvements of the last couple of years could imply \u201cmodest slowing in jobs growth going forward, as the available supply of qualified workers has been thinned out,\u201d said Rick Rieder, a chief investment officer at BlackRock, in a note. \u201cParadoxically, if our thesis is correct, this forthcoming slowing in jobs growth would be a sign of labor market tightness, not weakness.\u201dIn other words, something has to give. Either some of those millions of Americans who dropped out of the work force will return, allowing continued rapid job growth, or the rate of job growth will have to slow down to something closer to the rate at which the working-age population is growing (below 100,000 jobs a month, versus the 221,000 jobs a month added in 2015).\u201cWith such strong employment gains, you might have expected December\u2019s unemployment rate to dip below 5 percent,\u201d Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist of the Economic Outlook Group, said in a research note. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t happen and for good reason,\u201d namely that 466,000 more people counted themselves as being in the labor force.Whether the \u201cmissing\u201d workers will return as the labor force keeps improving is a question with short-term implications for the Federal Reserve and for the state of the economy when the 2016 election takes place. But even more important, it has long-lasting implications for America\u2019s productive capacity.If the growth in labor force participation that was evident in December goes away in future months and labor force participation stagnates, it will imply that the United States is actually quite close to full employment. That suggests that inflation is imminent, that the Fed will need to raise interest rates relatively quickly and that job growth will be slowing by the time voters go to the polls to pick the next president. In the longer run, it implies that growth will slow down from its already sluggish levels in the next couple of years.On the other hand, if a combination of improving job opportunities and higher wages pulls some of those people who are neither working nor looking for a job into the work force, it will imply that the Fed can take its time with rate increases, and job growth could remain robust for some time to come.The most likely result is some mix of both: The rate of job creation will slow, but the labor force will also grow as people return to the work force.But how the balance tilts is one of the important questions for American workers and the role of the United States in the global economy in the years to come.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oil Goes Nonlinear", "Date": "2016-01-16", "News": "Well, think about why we used to believe that oil price declines were expansionary. Part of the answer was that they reduced inflation, freeing central banks to loosen monetary policy \u2014 not a relevant issue at a time when inflation is below target almost everywhere. Beyond that, however, the usual view was that falling oil prices tended to redistribute income away from agents with low marginal propensities to spend toward agents with high marginal propensities to spend. Oil-rich Middle Eastern nations and Texas billionaires, so the story went, were sitting on huge piles of wealth, were therefore unlikely to face liquidity constraints, and could and would smooth out fluctuations in their income. Meanwhile, the benefits of lower oil prices would be spread widely, including to many consumers living paycheck to paycheck who would probably spend the windfall.Now, part of the reason this logic doesn\u2019t work the way it used to is that the rise of fracking means that there is a lot of investment spending closely tied to oil prices \u2014 investment spending that has relatively short lead times and will therefore fall quickly.Or to put it differently: small oil price declines may be expansionary through usual channels, but really big declines set in motion a process of forced deleveraging among producers that can be a significant drag on the world economy, especially with the whole advanced world still in or near a liquidity trap.Oh, and a belated Happy New Year.Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Egypt\u2019s President Turns to Religion to Bolster His Authority", "Date": "2016-01-09", "News": "Supported byWhen Egyptian voters elected a new Parliament in December, a preacher on state TV urged its members to \u201cobey those in authority, specifically the highest authority,\u201d and referred indirectly to Mr. Sisi as \u201cGod\u2019s shadow on earth.\u201dIn the latest decree, the Ministry of Religious Endowments on Monday instructed preachers that any call to protest on Jan. 25, the fifth anniversary of the revolution that toppled President Hosni Mubarak, would lead to \u201csabotage, murder and destruction,\u201d and constituted a \u201cfull crime.\u201dSuch tactics are not novel: Arab leaders have tried for decades to use Islam to boost their legitimacy. Mr. Sisi, the former head of the armed forces, has also presented himself as a reformer, calling publicly for a \u201creligious revolution\u201d to help combat extremism. But rather than spurring discussion about Islam, his approach \u2014 shutting unregistered mosques and banning unauthorized preachers while drawing the religious establishment into an uneasy embrace \u2014 has had the effect of constricting the debate here.Those tensions came to the fore recently when a television host who appeared to take up Mr. Sisi\u2019s call for change was assailed by Al Azhar, the 1,000-year-old bastion of Sunni Muslim scholarship in Cairo and Mr. Sisi\u2019s designated vehicle for religious change.Islam Behery, a popular satellite TV host known for challenging Islamic orthodoxy, has urged Muslims to think critically about some of the sayings attributed to the Prophet Muhammad that jihadists have used to justify violence. \u201cWe must confront those books, and break the taboo,\u201d said Mr. Behery, a 37-year-old law graduate, in an interview early last month.\u201cIt is inconceivable that the thinking that we hold most sacred should cause the entire Islamic world to be a source of anxiety, danger, killing and destruction for the rest of the world,\u201d Mr. Sisi warned.But Mr. Behery\u2019s ideas offended the scholars at Al Azhar, who accused him of \u201cviolating the foundations of Islam\u201d and, with others, brought a slew of court cases against him. One of those cases resulted in a criminal prosecution, and on Dec. 28 Mr. Behery began serving a one-year sentence.The prosecution appeared to signal the limits of Mr. Sisi\u2019s approach to modernizing Islam. Al Azhar, which is state-funded, has hewed closely to Egypt\u2019s rulers for the past six decades, yet at the same time jealously defended its position as Egypt\u2019s premier authority on Islam.Some clerics appeared to take Mr. Sisi\u2019s speech last year as an attack on the integrity of Al Azhar itself, said Nathan J. Brown, a professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University who specializes in the Middle East.\u201cFor people within Al Azhar, there was something remarkable and distasteful about a president and a general lecturing them about religion,\u201d he said. \u201cYou saw some pushback, in the form of a proxy struggle. Then there was the episode with Islam Behery.\u201dStill, the relationship between the different arms of the Egyptian state is notoriously hard to read, and some experts see the court prosecution as an example of Al Azhar flexing its institutional muscle. In public, Al Azhar has always been loudly supportive of Mr. Sisi.Shortly after the takeover, the grand imam of Al Azhar, Sheikh Ahmed al-Tayeb, sat by the general\u2019s side at his inaugural news conference.Weeks later, Sheikh Ali Gomaa, a senior Al Azhar cleric, justified violence against Muslim Brotherhood supporters, whom he described as \u201cputrid people\u201d and \u201criffraff.\u201d\u201cThe angels are supporting you from heaven,\u201d Sheikh Gomaa told police and military leaders.Yet at the same time, Al Azhar has quietly sought to preserve its room for maneuver \u2014 much as the courts and the security services have done \u2014 particularly in matters of Islamic theology.\u201cI don\u2019t see him as a dictator,\u201d said Ashraf El-Sherif, a lecturer in political science at the American University in Cairo, referring to Mr. Sisi. \u201cHe\u2019s the representative of an alliance of dictatorial state institutions.\u201dThe public blessings of the religious establishment may give Mr. Sisi, himself an observant Muslim, a certain legitimacy in the eyes of many Egyptians. But there are also signs that his approach may irk younger Egyptians who remember the period after the 2011 uprising when state control of religious discourse ended for a time.Last month Sheikh Tayeb paid a rare visit to Cairo University, where he answered questions from disgruntled students about a contentious move \u2014 the university authorities had just demolished one mosque on campus, and closed several smaller ones, in the name of \u201cfragmenting the foundations of radicalism.\u201d Now, the university students pray in one central mosque.The grand imam\u2019s answers did not satisfy everyone.\u201cIt\u2019s just another way of exerting control,\u201d Amira Abd el Sayed, 20, said recently during her lunchtime break. \u201cAlready there is no democracy, and now they are telling us where to pray. The government is pressuring the youth, and it\u2019s going to blow up in their faces.\u201dThe campus, once a hotbed of dissent, is a microcosm of Egyptian society. Some students were reluctant to speak publicly, citing fear of government informers; others trenchantly supported the crackdown. \u201cIt\u2019s important to control the discussion of religion,\u201d said Adam Mustafa, a law student. \u201cThe media has made this into an issue, not the students.\u201dOthers were not afraid to dismiss Al Azhar\u2019s authority. Sheikh Tayeb was \u201cnot even a proper sheikh,\u201d or religious scholar, said Amira Mohamed, one of a group of students in hijab sipping coffee on a lawn. \u201cIn reality, the fatwa came from the president. Everyone knows that.\u201dThe government says tough measures are required to fend off the threat of violent extremism. In Sinai, the military is battling a local branch of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, that claims to have downed the Russian plane in October. On the ideological front, officials monitor extremist publications in a host of languages, including Chinese and Urdu, and track fatwas issued by radical preachers.For others, the talk of regulating Islam is thinly veiled political repression. \u201cThere are no more outlets for discussion,\u201d said Ali Kandil, a schoolteacher in a wealthy Cairo suburb who was ousted from his position as a prayer leader because he had spoken publicly against \u201ctyrants.\u201d \u201cIf anyone talks, he is killed or arrested,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he\u2019s not arrested, he flees the country. And if he flees, he is branded as a traitor.\u201dAnalysts warn of the perils of the growing polarization in Egypt: While the Muslim Brotherhood maintains its official policy of eschewing violence, some members have defended attacks in Cairo last year as necessary \u201cretribution\u201d against the government.A recent official Friday Prayer sermon offered a clue to Mr. Sisi\u2019s next cause of worry: the potential for unrest on Jan. 25.Pointing to the \u201cruin and chaos\u201d that political upheaval wrought in neighboring Arab countries, the 3,100-word official sermon warned against any \u201cdestructive\u201d public protests in Egypt.\u201cTo avoid evil and please God,\u201d it said, \u201ca person shall obey the rulers.\u201dAmina Ismail contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oklahoma Resists Push for Enrollment in Affordable Care Act Coverage", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Supported byOKLAHOMA CITY \u2014 A resolute band of insurance counselors, undeterred by the politics of health care in this staunchly conservative state, is increasing its efforts to find people who are uninsured and enroll them in coverage before the Affordable Care Act\u2019s third annual open enrollment period ends on Sunday. But the push is facing Dust Bowl-force headwinds in one of the states most hostile to the health law \u2014 from some Oklahoma officials and from residents who mistrust all things federal.The public\u2019s attitude can also be an obstacle: Supporters of the Affordable Care Act often encounter stony skepticism here.\u201c\u00a0\u2018Obamacare\u2019 is a cuss word in this state,\u201d said former Gov. David Walters, a Democrat.Steven Goldman, an insurance counselor at the Oklahoma Primary Care Association, which represents community health centers, said, \u201cConsumers come in because they want and need health insurance, but they have trepidation because they believe this is a government insurance plan with government doctors.\u201dIn fact, he noted, the health plans available here on HealthCare.gov are offered by private companies: Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Oklahoma and UnitedHealth Group.More than 133,000 Oklahomans have selected health plans or had coverage automatically renewed through HealthCare.gov since open enrollment began on Nov. 1. In this state of 3.9 million people, about 800,000 are enrolled in Medicaid. But nearly 600,000 were still uninsured in 2014, according to the latest data from the Census Bureau, and getting them covered will not be easy.\u201cThere are not a lot of positive messages about the Affordable Care Act in Oklahoma,\u201d Mr. Goldman said.Kevin J. Counihan, the chief executive of the federal insurance marketplace, says he hopes to overcome those doubts when he visits Oklahoma this week to highlight the open enrollment deadline. Nationwide, more than 11.5 million people have selected health plans or been automatically re-enrolled, with at least 8.8 million coming through HealthCare.gov and 2.7 million through state-based marketplaces.In many other cities, like Milwaukee and Philadelphia, public officials are enthusiastically promoting enrollment in advance of the deadline. In this state, where President Obama lost all 77 counties in the elections of 2008 and 2012, insurance counselors and community health workers have been left to lead the fight.\u201cObamacare is toxic,\u201d said Craig W. Jones, the president of the Oklahoma Hospital Association, who wishes the state would expand Medicaid. \u201cThere has been absolutely zero sentiment in the Legislature to even think about expansion of the Medicaid program.\u201dConsumers who are eligible for insurance subsidies, in the form of tax credits, worry that they are getting something others cannot. Many Oklahomans have a strong streak of independence and are reluctant to rely on federal assistance. When told of their subsidies, Mr. Goldman said, consumers ask: \u201cAm I getting more than I deserve? Have I earned this? Is it fair?\u201dEven Oklahomans generally satisfied with their coverage report some difficulties. Lucia Perri, 49, of Guthrie, an accountant, said she was pleased with her Blue Cross and Blue Shield policy. The premium is $538 a month. But with a federal subsidy of $440, she pays $98 a month.\u201cI don\u2019t like the way the government is administering this program,\u201d Ms. Perri said. \u201cThere are too many surprises.\u201dTwo years into the health care law, clear regional patterns are emerging about who has health insurance in America and who still doesn\u2019t.Another problem stems from the decisions of state officials, whose refusal to expand Medicaid under the health law has created \u201cthis chasm of a no man\u2019s land,\u201d said Lou Carmichael, the chief executive of Variety Care, a community health center with more than a dozen clinic sites in Oklahoma.Many Oklahomans have too much income to qualify for Medicaid under state rules, but not enough to qualify for subsidies to help them buy private insurance in the federal marketplace.\u201cMany of the people we see are destitute,\u201d Ms. Carmichael said. \u201cBut they fall into the gap, and there is little we can do to help them.\u201dIn Oklahoma, parents with dependent children generally cannot obtain Medicaid if their household income is more than about half of the poverty level \u2014 higher than $9,240 for a three-person family. Adults generally cannot get Medicaid at all if they do not have dependent children and they are not elderly, disabled or pregnant.In states that have expanded eligibility under the health law, Medicaid is available to people with annual incomes up to 138 percent of the poverty level, up to $27,724 for a three-person family and $16,242 for an individual. And states that have expanded Medicaid eligibility have generally had much broader gains in insurance coverage.\u201cConsumers come in, eager to see their coverage options,\u201d said Jesus Frias, an insurance counselor at Variety Care. \u201cWe go through their case, we help them apply, and often we find that they are not eligible for Medicaid or subsidized coverage in the marketplace.\u201dJames E. Cooksey, 54, visited the Health Department here last week and left with nine prescriptions for drugs to treat very high blood pressure and diabetes. Mr. Cooksey said his minimal income came from work as a Salvation Army bell-ringer in the holiday season and from odd jobs like mowing lawns. But he does not qualify for Medicaid because he lives alone and has no dependent children.\u201cI\u2019ve still got my mind,\u201d Mr. Cooksey said, \u201cbut my body is failing me. And I\u2019m not getting any help.\u201dFor some, the state\u2019s attitude is mystifying.\u201cIf we have an ice storm, the governor is on the phone begging for federal money,\u201d said Mr. Walters, the former governor. \u201cIf we have a tornado, everyone is lining up for federal money. And we take federal highway funds. It\u2019s just the Obamacare dollars that are radioactive.\u201dThen there are the rising costs, which have bedeviled many states. Premiums had been lower here than in many states. But, according to the federal Department of Health and Human Services, the cost of a benchmark insurance plan increased by an average of 35.7 percent this year in Oklahoma, more than in any other state using the federal exchange.And while the Obama administration says the Affordable Care Act has increased competition among health plans, in Oklahoma, the number of carriers on the exchange has declined to two, from four in 2015, said State Representative Glen Mulready, a Republican who is the chairman of the House Insurance Committee.Oklahoma\u2019s economy and state finances have been battered by a steep decline in oil prices, which reduced state revenue. The state Medicaid agency reduced payment rates for hospitals and other health care providers by 3 percent this year.Hospitals and others who support the expansion of Medicaid say it would bring an infusion of federal money into Oklahoma.Oklahomans such as Mary C. Reynolds, a 60-year-old musician who recently renewed her coverage through the marketplace, see the benefits of the health law as well as its shortcomings. It enabled her to obtain insurance, which she had been denied for more than a decade because of a heart problem. But \u201cit was a hassle to change to a new doctor\u201d last year, she said, and she did not understand why her old doctor was no longer in her plan.\u201cMy experience with the Affordable Care Act,\u201d she said, \u201chas been a mixed bag.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Global Tensions Threaten to Upstage World Economic Forum in Davos", "Date": "2016-01-18", "News": "Supported byTensions reminiscent of the Cold War keep flaring with Russia and in the Middle East \u2014 not to mention over the Korean Peninsula. Europe is struggling to cope with a refugee crisis that risks fracturing the European Union, even as the bloc tries to counter a rising security threat from the Islamic State. Britain may vote this year on whether to leave the European Union altogether. And China\u2019s growth slowdown could prompt the second global financial crisis within a decade.Given those strains, the official Davos theme this time \u2014 \u201cMastering the Fourth Industrial Revolution\u201d \u2014 may sound oddly out of tune, and the various panels on the topic could prove to be little more than sideshows.Klaus Schwab, the World Economic Forum\u2019s founder and one of the best-connected men on the planet, is nonetheless using the forum\u2019s website to urge the cadre of bankers, politicians, tech executives and trend makers to ponder \u201cthe fusion of technologies across the physical, digital and biological worlds, which is creating entirely new capabilities and dramatic impacts on political, social and economic systems.\u201dThe big-thought themes of Davos often billow above current events. Last year, the topic was \u201cThe New Global Context,\u201d a reference to shifting political, economic and social forces in the world. The year before focused on the \u201cReshaping of the World.\u201d If such banners are somewhat elusive, so, too, is the gathering\u2019s ability to map solutions to more immediate problems.But then, problem-solving is not really the point. More than anything, Davos, at about 5,120 feet, is about high-altitude networking.The forum is where hedge fund managers, central bankers, chief executives, social-media magnates, heads of state, self-help gurus, artists, celebrities, fashion models and even archbishops engage in the equivalent of intellectual or corporate speed dating. If all goes well, they may pry open a possible business deal, pad out a contact list or maybe receive enlightenment about affairs outside their professional expertise.Many deal makers retreat to hotel suites for much of the conference, forsaking the official program in favor of a whirl of meetings, emerging only to attend private parties in exclusive chalets on the Davos slopes or invitation-only power dinners.This year\u2019s tech luminaries are to include Jack Ma, the head of China\u2019s online retail giant Alibaba; John T. Chambers, the chief of Cisco Systems, the Internet hardware maker; Eric E. Schmidt, executive chairman of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company; and Sheryl K. Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook.And then there are the captains of the financial industry, including Jamie Dimon, the head of JPMorgan Chase; Gary D. Cohn, Goldman Sachs\u2019s chief operating officer; and top executives from most of the world\u2019s major banks.Also on hand will be a host of regulators who oversee the big banks, including Jacob J. Lew, the United States Treasury secretary, as well as an influential coterie of central bankers who determine monetary policy, including Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank.Foremost among their concerns this year may be whether problems in China, whose rapidly slowing economy has rattled stock and commodity markets around the world, could cause a relapse into global financial instability just as Europe and the United States are recovering from the last crisis. No clear remedies are likely to emerge from Davos, though, because top leaders from China, as in years past, will not be present.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France are conspicuously avoiding the gathering this year, judging it more effective to grapple with pressing problems back home.And then there is the controversy surrounding North Korea. Last fall, the conference organizers took the unusual step of inviting a delegation from Pyongyang. But shortly after North Korea trumpeted a nuclear bomb test on Jan. 5, the Davos organizers disinvited the delegates \u2014 prompting North Korean officials to declare the snub \u201cseriously unjust.\u201dAnd yet, in the honeycomb of private side rooms inside the old nuclear bunker where the main conference takes place, or on the leather couches of the nearby five-star Belvedere Hotel, a favorite place for private dinners and parties, there are always opportunities for key players to make progress on thorny subjects.This year, for instance, Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, is expected to meet on the sidelines with Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece, who defied the fund and Europe\u2019s political elite for many months last year over the terms of a multibillion-euro bailout, risking his country\u2019s exit from the eurozone. More recently, Mr. Tsipras, having turned from a defender of the poor to a mainstream leader eager to save Greece from further financial turmoil, is expected to try to persuade Ms. Lagarde to send more of the fund\u2019s money to Athens.And even if no big policy breakthroughs are achieved, at least there will be star power. Justin Trudeau, the youthful new Canadian prime minister, will give a keynote address aiming to sell a fresh image of Canada to the world.The stalwarts will continue to show up, including Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, who may be pressing his case that Britain should stay in the European Union if the bloc is willing to cut his country a new deal. From the United States, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is leading a delegation including Secretary of State John Kerry and Ashton Carter, the secretary of defense.As for the movers and shakers who have not had time to brush up on this year\u2019s official theme \u2014 how artificial intelligence and robotics are changing humanity \u2014 Mr. Schwab, the forum\u2019s founder, has conveniently published a new book, \u201cThe Fourth Industrial Revolution.\u201dA link on the World Economic Forum\u2019s website whisks readers to Amazon, where the 4,300-kilobyte e-book can be purchased for about $8 \u2014 a digital value that no billionaire should be able to resist.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Obsolete Economic Strategy", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "Supported byEditorialIt was inevitable that China\u2019s economy would slow from its once turbocharged growth rates. But its leaders have made so many mistakes in recent months that they have turned what should have been a benign, natural slowdown into a chaotic descent.China\u2019s main stock index fell nearly 10 percent for the week, depressing stock and commodity prices elsewhere. These drops are not in themselves a big economic problem. The larger question is whether China\u2019s leaders, their credibility already damaged, will see this moment for what it is: a dramatic warning that it\u2019s time to make fundamental changes in the way they manage the economy.The Chinese economy, the world\u2019s second largest, is growing at nearly 7 percent a year \u2014 down from 10.6 percent in 2010 but still a healthy pace for a country at its stage of development. The problem is that the boom was fueled by lavish investment and spending as well as profligate borrowing, a lot of which will probably not be paid back. China\u2019s central government orchestrated that binge by pumping billions of dollars into the economy in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis and by failing to enact needed reforms that would make it easier for private and foreign companies to compete with inefficient state-owned enterprises.The lesson here is clear: Instead of trying to micromanage stock prices, Chinese officials ought to be strengthening the economy, foremost by shifting its emphasis from investment to consumer spending and services. This is important because China can no longer grow by taking people off the farm and putting them to work in factories. It needs to move people into white-collar jobs. To take one example, officials could help create more such jobs and make the economy more competitive by easing the way for private companies to get into industries like telecommunications and insurance that are currently dominated by a handful of state-owned corporations.China also has to clean up its financial system. Many businesses and local governments have borrowed billions of dollars to build high-speed rail lines, real estate developments and other projects, many of which are not going to produce the returns needed to pay off those debts. The government should encourage lenders and borrowers to quickly restructure loans that paid for those projects so that banks are not crippled by bad debts and can continue making new loans. Officials also need to shut down highly inefficient state-owned businesses.Even industrialized countries like Germany, Japan and the United States are vulnerable, though less so than commodity exporters, because they sell manufactured goods to China and many multinational companies have invested a lot of money in the country. Some analysts are concerned that Beijing will simply fall back on a familiar tool to aid the domestic economy: devaluing the currency, the renminbi. That would raise China\u2019s exports and reduce its imports, but it would do so at the expense of the rest of the global economy, which is itself not very healthy.Since early August, the renminbi has already fallen about 5 percent against the dollar. It has also been under pressure because as the Chinese economy weakens many people and companies in China are clamoring to convert their savings into dollars to buy property and invest in businesses overseas.Ultimately, however, China\u2019s leaders must realize that they need to modernize their policies by encouraging more private initiatives and greater competition. Their nation has changed dramatically over the last three decades, and a command-and-control approach to economic management will not produce the results of the past.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iran, Emerging From Sanctions, Faces Crisis After Saudi Arabia Embassy Attack", "Date": "2016-01-04", "News": "Supported byWithin hours of the execution, nationalist Iranian websites were calling for demonstrations in front of the Saudi Embassy in Tehran and its consulate in the eastern Iranian city of Mashhad. The police, outnumbered, looked the other way as angry protesters set the embassy ablaze with firebombs, climbed the fences and vandalized parts of the building.Now, Iranian leaders are suddenly forced to reckon with whether they played into the Saudis\u2019 hands, finding themselves mired in a new crisis at a time they had been hoping to emerge from international sanctions as an accepted global player. Iran might have capitalized on global outrage at the executions by Saudi Arabia, but instead it finds itself once again characterized by adversaries as a provocateur in the region and abroad.\u201cThey knew we couldn\u2019t look the other way,\u201d said Fazel Meybodi, a cleric from the Iranian holy city of Qum, one of the world\u2019s main centers of Shiite theology. \u201cThat they would actually go ahead with killing him? That caught all of us by surprise.\u201dJust in December, the Saudi and Iranian foreign ministers sat directly across from each other during a high-level meeting in New York to talk about Syria. Talks among the warring parties in Syria, overseen by a United Nations mediator, Staffan de Mistura, are scheduled to start on Jan. 25 in Geneva. There was little clarity before about who would represent either the Syrian government or the various opposition groups fighting it, and now, after the diplomatic schism, there seemed to be even more confusion.The United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, spoke by phone on Monday with the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia and Iran, condemning both the execution of Sheikh Nimr and the attack on the embassy in Tehran. Mr. Ban \u2014 who has repeatedly urged the two countries to cooperate on regional conflicts \u2014 called the break in Saudi-Iranian relations \u201cdeeply worrying.\u201dIran sent a letter to Mr. Ban saying it had taken \u201cnecessary measures, including the increase in the number of security forces,\u201d to protect the Saudi Mission, adding that 40 protesters had been arrested.The Saudi ambassador to the United Nations sought to temper apprehensions about whether the new tensions would bear negatively on the fragile peace talks for Syria and Yemen. \u201cFrom our side it should have no effect because we will continue to work very hard to support the peace efforts,\u201d Ambassador Abdallah Y. Al-Mouallimi said.Some Iranian officials had hoped that January would become a celebration of Iran\u2019s growing importance.Now, some Iranians are wondering whether Saudi Arabia has again gained the upper hand in the new diplomatic crisis.\u201cSaudi Arabia killed Mr. al-Nimr at this sensitive juncture in time to widen the gap between Sunni and Shiite Muslims,\u201d said Mr. Meybodi, the Iranian cleric in Qum. \u201cUnfortunately they had predicted our overreaction, and now they are using it against us to try to isolate Iran once again.\u201dSheikh Nimr was not only a leading opposition figure in the Saudis\u2019 Sunni kingdom but also a symbol of Shiite activism abroad. After he was sentenced to death by the Saudi judiciary in 2014, Iran warned of \u201cdire consequences\u201d if Sheikh Nimr were to be executed.Beyond Mr. Nimr\u2019s case, however, there have been several flash points between Iran and Saudi Arabia in recent months, with the nuclear deal and the wars in Syria and Yemen driving most of the tension.\u201cBoth countries are opposed to the nuclear deal; both want it to fail,\u201d said Hamid Reza Taraghi, a political analyst and conservative politician. \u201cDuring the nuclear talks we witnessed John Kerry shuttling between Israel and Saudi Arabia, hoping to appease both of them. We know of the secret trips of Saudi officials to Israel. Their only goal is to limit Iran, which of course they are unable to do.\u201dSome of the Iranians who rioted at the Saudi Embassy said they had friends fighting Saudi-backed extremist groups in Syria.\u201cWe shouted, \u2018Death to the house of al Saud!\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Abolfazl, a protester who refused to give his family name out of fear of punishment. \u201cWe showed our anger and threw whatever we could find. There were police, but there were too few.\u201dIran\u2019s own internal tensions are playing out in the crisis, as well.There was far from universal support within Iran for the nuclear deal, which some criticized as giving away too much to foreign interests. Now, with parliamentary elections scheduled for February, and with a coming election of the clerical council that in theory will choose the next supreme leader, the hard-liners are sure to use the issue, and the crisis with Saudi Arabia, to pummel allies of President Rouhani and others who favored the nuclear accord.\u201cWhat group here in Iran benefits politically from storming an embassy?\u201d a former member of the Iranian National Security Council, Aziz Shahmohammadi, asked rhetorically. He was suggesting that the answer lay with the hard-liners \u2014 a loose alliance of clerics, ideologues and military commanders. \u201cSuch people are even against foreign soccer coaches to train our teams.\u201dThe embassy attack played into their agenda of opposition to President Rouhani, whom Mr. Shahmohammadi said was clearly blindsided by the riot.\u201cFor them, this might lead to electoral gains, an example that Iran is better off isolated. But they are missing the big picture here: We need and want peace and calm,\u201d he said.The act of cutting ties seems a simple one, but the consequences can be far-reaching. \u201cWe are moving increasingly towards conflict,\u201d Mr. Shahmohammadi said.\u201cThis is bad for the entire region \u2014 in Syria, in Yemen, and to a lesser extent in Lebanon and Iraq as well,\u201d he added. \u201cCutting ties is fanning the flames in a region already on fire.\u201dSomini Sengupta contributed reporting from New York, and Ben Hubbard from Baghdad.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders Clash on Issues and Vie for Votes of Iowa Women", "Date": "2016-01-24", "News": "Supported byNORTH LIBERTY, Iowa \u2014 From universal health care and paid family leave to college costs and the Keystone XL oil pipeline, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders challenged each other\u2019s priorities and courted female voters on Sunday as they began the final week of their increasingly hard-fought campaign to win the Iowa caucuses next Monday.As hundreds of volunteers for Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders fanned out across the state to knock on doors and to hold mini-rallies with supporters, the Democratic candidates campaigned in vote-rich counties in eastern Iowa where Barack Obama performed well in his victorious campaign in the 2008 caucuses. Of the two, Mr. Sanders made the sharper and steadier attacks on his rival, while Mrs. Clinton mixed praise for President Obama with criticism of Mr. Sanders.Mr. Sanders took repeated shots at a core part of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s political message: that she would be the strongest advocate for the needs of women and families. At a rally with 2,270 people in Decorah, Mr. Sanders noted that he, unlike Mrs. Clinton, supports proposed Senate legislation that would ensure three months of paid family leave for Americans, financed by a small increase in payroll taxes.\u201cA dollar and 61 cents a week to make sure when you have a baby, you can stay home with that baby and not be forced back to work,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cI think that makes sense. I think that is a good investment.\u201dMrs. Clinton supports guaranteeing 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave, but, as she said at a rally with about 650 people here, she would pay for such a policy with a tax increase on people earning at least $5 million. (Several supporters of the family leave legislation have endorsed Mrs. Clinton\u2019s presidential bid.)The candidates\u2019 focus on female voters on Sunday reflected the views of both campaigns that the caucus votes of many women are still up for grabs, based on the campaigns\u2019 polling analyses and canvassing efforts.Public opinion polls show that the Iowa race is extremely close, with Mr. Sanders gaining some ground recently as he tries to leverage liberal support to score a surprise victory. Mrs. Clinton, meanwhile, received a coveted endorsement from The Des Moines Register on Saturday night, an achievement that some of her volunteers were mentioning in their door-knocking visits on Sunday.To underscore her long history of championing women\u2019s rights, Mrs. Clinton campaigned on Sunday afternoon with Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood, who introduced Mrs. Clinton at a rally here as a \u201cfighter\u201d for health care and education programs.\u201cNo candidate has done more for women and families,\u201d Ms. Richards said.Mrs. Clinton, at rallies here and in Marion, recalled recently meeting women in Iowa who were working two or three jobs and worried about keeping their health insurance.A look at the latest results for Iowa and New Hampshire, and how this year compares to previous election seasons.\u201cThe fastest two ways to raise incomes are increasing the minimum wage, and finally guaranteeing equal pay for women\u2019s work, which will raise income for families and boost our economy,\u201d she said.Even as they drew policy differences with each other, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders did not launch the sort of harshly negative and personal attacks that several Republican presidential candidates have made.Mrs. Clinton has been increasingly pointing out inconsistencies in Mr. Sanders\u2019s positions, but she has not repeated her toughest language from last week, when she said Mr. Sanders had \u201cflip-flopped\u201d by now opposing legal immunity for gun manufacturers and dealers.The Clinton campaign used a sly tactic on Sunday by bringing to Iowa Ms. Richards and Chad Griffin, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights organization.The two served as a pointed reminder of some political trouble for Mr. Sanders last week when he described their two organizations as part of the political establishment.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.Mr. Sanders has since said he was referring to those groups\u2019 leaders. During a small rally at Grinnell College on Sunday, Ms. Richards called Mr. Sanders\u2019s characterization \u201cunfortunate,\u201d but otherwise focused on highlighting Mrs. Clinton\u2019s record. (Mr. Griffin, at a rally with Mrs. Clinton in West Des Moines on Sunday night, held back from attacking Mr. Sanders.)Mr. Sanders is drawing strong support on campuses like Grinnell with his array of liberal positions over the decades, including his opposition to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which Mrs. Clinton supported \u2014 a vote he brought up again on Sunday.\u201cThat is a difference in judgment in what turns out to be the most important foreign policy moment in the modern history of the United States,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in Decorah.He also accused Mrs. Clinton of being slow to oppose the Keystone XL pipeline while Mr. Sanders opposed it early on, and touted his legislation to break up commercial banks and to avoid a federal bailout of financial institutions again.\u201cThe time is now to break them up,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is not the position of Secretary Clinton.\u201dBut Mrs. Clinton, at her rally here, said current legislation included the power to break up banks. She criticized Mr. Sanders for not supporting other regulations for Wall Street firms.\u201cNo bank is too big to fail, and no executive too powerful to jail,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. (Mr. Sanders has taken to calling these executives \u201cbanksters.\u201d)For her part, Mrs. Clinton highlighted her plans to help college students avoid steep education loan debt or refinance their loans, and then picked apart Mr. Sanders\u2019s plan to make college tuition free, arguing that it wouldn\u2019t do anything to control college spending.\u201cI think that would be a big burden that wouldn\u2019t necessarily produce the results,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said in Marion. \u201cIf you say free college for everybody, that would encompass millionaires and billionaires, and they can afford it.\u201dMrs. Clinton did acknowledge the impatience for liberal reforms among Democrats, including many Sanders supporters who believe that she is insufficiently liberal and committed to fundamental changes in the nation.\u201cWe have been moving in our nation, thankfully, in a positive, progressive direction \u2014 maybe not as fast as some hope, but we keep moving forward,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cSometimes trying to stave off bad things and make good things happen doesn\u2019t occur as fast as you would hope.\u201dPatrick Healy reported from North Liberty and Marion, Iowa, and Yamiche Alcindor from Grinnell, Iowa.

Add one start-up with a clever, convenient approach and a willingness to flout laws. Pour millions of dollars on idea.

Sometimes he cannot help but remember his days in grade school in Mahopac, N.Y., when his teachers prodded him to brave an Outward Bound-type climbing program.\u201cI was terrified of heights,\u201d he confessed, with a grin that betrayed both embarrassment and retroactive amusement. \u201cBut you kind of adapt, and as time went on it kind of grew on me.\u201dWith high winds gusting across the Hudson, rain and snow turning steel beams slick as a frozen pond, dozens of cranes dangling 37-ton concrete road-deck panels from above, and heavy machinery churning all around, it can be exceedingly dangerous work. Three workers were killed putting up the Verrazano.Yet the Tappan Zee workers seem to feel a verve that goes beyond what they might experience on more workaday projects, an esprit de corps that comes from knowing they are erecting a mammoth specimen of infrastructure that they can point to and say they helped bring into the world.\u201cIt\u2019s seeing that you were part of something special,\u201d said Mr. D\u2019Ippolito, who grew up in a family that ran an Italian restaurant but whose profession was inspired by cousins and an uncle who were engineers. \u201dI can tell my kids and grandkids about it.\u201dThe bridge is expected to cost $3.9 billion. Plans for financing it include federal loans, state funds and construction bonds that would be paid off through tolls. But, with an eye to the costs of daily commuting from Rockland, Mr. Cuomo now proposes to freeze tolls on the Tappan Zee at $5 until 2020, paying for the freeze with a $700 million earmark that would also lock in tolls on the entire Thruway.Already more than a mile of the blue-steel horizontal framework that will undergird the concrete deck of the new bridge\u2019s southern span stretches boldly from the Rockland County bank across the Hudson, ending abruptly in midriver, and part of a second northern span is already projecting a half-mile from Rockland as well. With a schedule pitched aggressively so the first span of the bridge can open by the spring of 2017 and the full bridge by the following year, many of the workers put in 60 hours a week.Tappan Zee Constructors, the consortium that is building the new bridge for the Thruway Authority, said it does not discuss salary information. But many of the workers installing steel and concrete are members of various locals of the International Association of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental and Reinforcing Iron Workers. Bob Walsh, business manager of Local 40, said workers are paid by the hour only for the hours they work, and that a typical ironworker earns $48.75 in wages and an additional $70.35 an hour in health insurance and other benefits. In bad weather, they do not work and do not get paid.So far no one has died on the project, which began more than two years ago with the sinking of cylindrical piles into the river bottom. Safety for workers has been emphasized in a way that it was not 60 years ago, when reckless bravado was especially valued by an almost entirely male work force. There were at least five casualties then: A tugboat captain drowned after his vessel caught fire, and four workers were injured when a boom snapped and they fell 40 feet to a concrete structure on the waterline, newspaper articles at the time reported.Men and women who work on heights or narrow beams must wear safety harnesses that wrap around the thighs, shoulder and waist and are attached to lanyards, or cables, that are fitted with shock absorbers to gently break any falls. If Mr. D\u2019Ippolito were to slip \u2014 and fairly soon he will be working at a height of 12 stories \u2014 the lanyard and straps would let him drop six feet, then catch him as if he were a rock climber bouncing casually off the face of a cliff, but fairly gradually, thanks to the springlike action of the shock absorber. Old-fashioned harnesses could result in a broken back, workers say.Despite the safety precautions, spouses back home fret. Mr. D\u2019Ippolito\u2019s wife, Melissa, a lawyer, needs daily reassurance.Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York has been busily announcing big projects, but he hasn\u2019t exactly said where the money will come from to pay for them.\u201cShe says, \u2018Be careful!\u2019 every morning when I leave,\u201d he said.Her specialty is building in, and for, frigid weather; knowing, for example, how much concrete is needed to offset the powerful forces of expanding ice.Victoria Graney, a 30-year-old engineer from Virginia, has been surprised at how many of the engineers on the project are female. She attributes that shift to the increasing number of elementary schools and high schools offering science, technology, engineering and mathematics programs equally, to boys and girls.Unlike Mr. D\u2019Ippolito, Ms. Graney is what the trade calls a boomer, traveling far from home to projects made possible by booming local economies. In her case, that means renting an apartment in nearby Sleepy Hollow and trading weekend commutes to and from the Washington area with her husband of one year.She supervises eight other engineers who work on the Rockland and Westchester landings: the shoreline portions of the bridge, or what Ms. Graney calls \u201cthe bookends of the project,\u201d that connect the bridge to the highway and contain the toll lanes.\u201cI think landings are the coolest part of the project,\u201d she said.What makes them cool? She has to coordinate construction of new landings that overlap with the current ones, meaning that she and other workers do their assignments while automobiles and truck traffic speed by at 45 miles per hour. She also has to coordinate operations with the Metro-North Railroad, which runs below the landing, and with the utilities that own the electrical and gas lines that cross the bridge.Architectural blueprints for the landings might as well be sketches; much of the engineering has to be improvised as the construction proceeds. Ramps, for example, have to be engineered as to the peculiarities of a landscape.She and other landings workers are safeguarded not only by concrete barriers and safety harnesses, but also by luminous clothing.\u201cWe look like big glow sticks, and that\u2019s on purpose,\u201d Ms. Graney said. \u201cWe want our guys to be as visible as possible.\u201dMs. Graney grew up in Yorktown, Va., and credits \u201ca bossy mother\u201d for prodding her to take up engineering, which she studied at Virginia Tech, graduating in 2007, a month after a student there shot and killed 32 fellow students.\u201cMy husband ribs me because I call the bridge \u2018my bridge,\u2019 she said. \u201cI think about all the swag that says \u2018TZ\u2019 on it and people see it and are excited to meet you. They want to take a picture with you.\u201dFor Michael Shields, a 38-year-old member of Iron Workers Local 399, the daily work involves safely rigging and balancing the loads of concrete slabs on a crane, swinging them over to the steel framework and setting the slabs at the required elevation using leveling bolts, so the slabs are properly banked to adjust to the road\u2019s curvature.\u201cSo it all lines up together nice,\u201d he said.He has injured a shoulder on previous jobs and considers safety paramount, so that \u201ceverybody goes home at night.\u201d He said, \u201cThings can happen like this,\u201d snapping his fingers to indicate the swiftness. \u201cSo you never want to be under the piece.\u201dWhile slippery steel worries him, heights, he said, \u201chave never been an issue for me.\u201d\u201cI enjoy working high,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s an adrenaline rush to it. I mean you have to respect it also. You have to follow the rules.\u201dBack home in Mickleton, N.J., his 4-year-old daughter, Addison, is clearly awed. She calls every bridge she sees \u201cDaddy\u2019s bridge.\u201dLike Ms. Graney, Rick Pitner is also a boomer, but not, technically, on this project: He sleeps at home. He and his wife and two daughters live in East Stroudsburg, Pa., near the Delaware Water Gap, 91 miles away. He leaves the house shortly after 3 a.m. to drive the breadth of New Jersey to get to the Tappan Zee by 5.He helms a crew of eight that welds the concrete deck panels that crews like Mr. D\u2019Ippolito\u2019s and Mr. Shields\u2019s have fitted into the steel undergirding of the bridge\u2019s roadway. By Christmas, 576 of 2,000 panels had been installed.Mr. Pitner and his crew use 1,800\u2013amp heating guns that melt 9-inch-long studs, used to bond the concrete decks to the steel girders. They can weld 2,000 studs a day. This work, too, is hazardous. A crane overhead sometimes dangles loads of 12,000 studs. And the gun\u2019s heat produces flash burns, so he armors himself with a flame-resistant coat.Mr. Pitner, 57, grew up in Ohio with a father who \u201cwas good with his hands, and I\u2019m good with my hands.\u201d He said he preferred welding to other crafts, and liked working outdoors.\u201cWhen you work outdoors you see that you\u2019re making something, instead of making something indoors and never seeing it again,\u201d he said.He ticks off bridges, like the James River Bridge in Virginia, the Sunshine Skyway Bridge in Florida, and the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge over the Cooper River in South Carolina, that he has helped weld together since 1979.\u201cI\u2019m strictly a bridge man,\u201d he declares. \u201cI get called to work on projects by someone who knew me on a previous project. \u2018Don\u2019t burn your bridges\u2019 is what I say. There\u2019s always someone who remembers you did a good job.\u201dWhen the Tappan Zee\u2019s workers finish their day, they find various ways to unwind. Mr. D\u2019Ippolito relaxes with his wife, his 9-month-old baby, Isabella, and a glass of wine, and Mr. Shields frolics with Addison and his other daughter, Samantha, 7, or settles in to play Fantasy Football.All four look forward to taking their children one day to see the completed bridge.\u201cYou see a piece of history. Mr. Pitner said. \u201cYou can tell your kids you worked on this.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Electrifying India, With the Sun and Small Loans", "Date": "2016-01-02", "News": "Supported by7 PhotosA few years ago, the hundred or so residents of Paradeshappanamatha, a secluded hamlet in the southern Indian state of Karnataka, gathered along the central pathway between their 22 densely clustered homes, and watched as government workers hoisted a solar-powered streetlamp. As the first display of electricity in the town, it was an object of mild interest, but, being outside, the light didn\u2019t help anyone cook or study, and only attracted moths.Still, when B. Prasad arrived two years later to encourage people here to abandon kerosene lighting for solar-powered home systems, people had some idea what he was talking about. What sounded preposterous to the village residents was the price. Mr. Prasad, an agent for Solar Electric Light Company, or Selco, was selling a panel and battery that would power three lights and an attached socket for phone charging for approximately 12,800 rupees, or $192.\u201cThere was no way we could afford that,\u201d P. C. Kalayya remembers thinking. He and his neighbors rise early in the morning to walk miles along a nearly impassable dirt road to work on coffee, pepper and betel nut plantations. Mr. Kalayya earns $3 a day \u2014 he\u2019d been earning $2.25 until a raise came through this year \u2014 and half his wage is withheld by his employer as repayment for various loans.And yet, despite what seemed on its face an impossibly high cost, Selco agents succeeded in persuading Mr. Kalayya and 10 other village households to make the switch. Now, his wife can better see how much spice she is putting in as she cooks, and Pratima, their 18-year-old daughter, can study long after dark.The idea behind Selco, and other companies like it, is to create a business model that will help some of the 1.2 billion people in the world who don\u2019t have electricity to leapfrog the coal-dependent grid straight to renewable energy sources.Solar power accounts for just 1 percent of India\u2019s current electricity production, mostly through large plants that contribute power to the grid, but a generation of Indian energy entrepreneurs is out to prove that a faster, cleaner and ultimately more economical route to universal electrification is through solar home systems.\u201cWhy is it always about a grid?\u201d asked Harish Hande, a co-founder of Selco India. It was one of the first of more than 40 companies now offering solar home systems in India.Selco systems typically include a small panel connected to a battery that stores enough power to run one or more lights, phone chargers and, with higher wattage options, some small appliances. Since its inception in 1995, Selco India has sold 318,400 solar home systems, and has provided power systems to almost 10,000 schools, hospitals and other institutions, almost all in Karnataka.\u201cSolar home systems have been around for a long time by now, and they are a successful model,\u201d said Robert Stoner, the director of the Tata Center for Technology and Design at M.I.T., which works directly with Selco and others, including the Indian government, on renewable technology development. \u201cTheir challenge is that they cost a lot \u2014 far more than the average person has, even a relatively well-off person.\u201dSo if it is difficult to persuade a middle-class family in an industrialized country to invest in solar, how do you persuade a family that lives on a couple dollars a day?Mr. Prasad is a consummate salesman who talks a mile a minute, wears his hair in a side-part and keeps three pens in his breast pocket. On his home turf in the villages of the Chikkamagaluru district in Karnataka, his salesmanship is put to the test. If he can manage to interest people in what is often an unfamiliar technology, he then pitches his potential customers on the more mysterious, but crucial idea of financing.For two decades, Selco has worked to persuade a network of banks to provide financing options to poor people who were typically seen as too risky. As Mohan Hegde, the company\u2019s operations manager, noted, \u201cThe idea behind Selco is to take a poor man to the bank and see if what he can afford to pay per month is acceptable to the lenders.\u201dThe sales presentation, once it includes assurance of financing from a bank, is much more palatable to potential customers: Pay the bank monthly installments of roughly the same price you\u2019d spend on kerosene, and in a few short years, you\u2019ll own the system and your basic energy needs will be fulfilled by the sun free.\u201cWhen we say free, their ears prick up,\u201d Mr. Prasad said.Without financing, decentralized renewable energy could never compete in India with kerosene, which is cheap because the government subsidizes its sale at a cost of more than $5 billion a year. Use of kerosene contributes to carbon emissions, but also to more personal and immediate hazards like skin irritation, respiratory problems and a significant fire risk. Ultimately, it provides only dim, flickering lighting.For many of Selco\u2019s customers, financing the solar home system is their first interaction with a bank. The experience is often new for the bankers, too.\u201cHonestly, I had never even heard of Paradeshappanamatha, and beyond that I\u2019ve never dealt with financing such small sums,\u201d said Shahanaz Ali, the manager of a branch of the Kaveri Grameena Bank, where Mr. Kalayya and his neighbors eventually opened accounts. \u201cI\u2019m very new to this job, so taking risks with these kinds of people is worrisome. They have no collateral, so I have no security in giving individual loans.\u201dMs. Ali telephoned a superior based in a nearby town who had interacted with Selco customers before, and he reassured her that very few defaulted. He offered her an idea for financing that Selco had used for other remote villages.\u201cI created what\u2019s called a \u2018Joint Liability Group,\u2019 \u201d said Ms. Ali. \u201cIn the J.L.G., we give a loan to a group, and each member acts as another\u2019s guarantor, so therefore if one defaults, the whole group does, too.\u201dThrough the cooperation of hundreds of banks like Ms. Ali\u2019s, Selco effectively shifts financial risk away from the customer, and away from its own investors. By and large, the risk to the banks has been worth it \u2014 7.4 percent of Selco\u2019s hundreds of thousands of customers have defaulted. But each new bank needs to be persuaded to participate, and so salesmen like Mr. Prasad can\u2019t promise customers financing from the get-go.\u201cThe banks are only with us because we are relentless about our business model, and the only reason we can be that way is because we have wonderfully patient investors,\u201d said Mr. Hande.Selco\u2019s three investors are foundations, two European and one American, that function like venture capital firms, but emphasize social impact rather than profitability. Selco\u2019s margins are only around 3 to 4 percent; net profit was just $62,500 in the 2013-14 financial year.Other solar home system providers in India, as well as in Africa, have steered clear of the arduous bank-centric model and opted for pay-as-you-go plans, similar to prepaid cellphones. The user pays a shopkeeper for a certain amount of electricity and essentially rents the system.\u201cIn the pay-as-you-go model, the company is forced to own all the capital, so they end up with this incredibly large balance sheet and take on a lot of investor risk,\u201d said Mr. Stoner, the director of the M.I.T. research institute. \u201cOn the other hand, it does allow individuals to get the benefits without having to take on loans.\u201dMr. Kalayya\u2019s family hopes that their solar home system, with its lights and phone charger, is only the beginning. Pratima, who is one of four people in the village to have attended school, said that getting bank accounts and understanding loans had broadened her family\u2019s sense of possibility.\u201cThe faster we pay off this loan, the more likely we are to get another one,\u201d she said.Ms. Ali, the banker, had offered families in Paradeshappanamatha a minimum monthly payment of 350 rupees, or about $5.30, but after a group discussion, the families decided to make spending sacrifices so as to pay 500 rupees per month. They had seen electric appliances in town that could improve their lives.\u201cWe still have to do manual grinding of grains and spices,\u201d Mr. Kalayya said. \u201cIt takes up a lot of time. The next loan can be for a machine that will do this.\u201dThe solar home system, or S.H.S., model has steadily grown as the technology becomes more affordable. A report released in early 2015 by the Climate Group, an international nonprofit working toward a low-carbon economy, together with Goldman Sachs, estimated that the 40 to 50 S.H.S. providers in India were on track to sell at least five million solar home systems in India between 2014 and 2018. The report added that \u201cbetter models for consumer finance alongside large demand and rising incomes,\u201d along with projected growth in per-capita income, could expand that number to around 7.2 million households, or more than 30 million people, by 2018.If true, solar home systems would still account for only a minuscule proportion of India\u2019s electricity supply, and profit margins for providers would remain in the low single digits.The scale of the S.H.S. business model depends on its adaptability to dense, urban areas, where homes are often makeshift and temporary, and where almost all of the net growth in India\u2019s population is projected to occur. Many urban migrants have no legal rights to live where they do, which leaves them vulnerable in countless ways, including the inability to demand electricity from the public grid, or, for that matter, to have access to the kerosene subsidy.In a cluster of around 70 hovels made of scrap metal and plastic about an hour\u2019s drive through bumper-to-bumper traffic from Selco\u2019s headquarters in Bangalore, the company is trying out a model specialized for urban, landless people.The ramshackle settlement doesn\u2019t have an official name, and the Bengali-speaking migrants who live there refer to the place as \u201cnear Hebbal flyover,\u201d referring to a nearby overpass.Mosidul Haque says he came to the settlement three years ago from a town in the state of West Bengal, 1,500 miles away. He now roams Bangalore for recyclable material, which he puts into giant burlap sacks tied to a bicycle that he uses as a cart. He makes an average of 300 rupees a day from a middleman who buys the scrap.Mr. Haque used his savings to open a small stall selling cigarettes and tea, and when Selco scouted the settlement, they identified him as a possible operator who could run a pay-as-you-go-style business for area residents.Based on the number of people living in Mr. Haque\u2019s vicinity, Selco provided him with two large solar panels to put on the roof, 32 power storage batteries and an equal number of single-bulb lamps to rent out. Mr. Haque now sells electricity from the batteries by the hour. He also fully charges phones for 5 rupees, or about 8 cents, saving his customers trips to distant charge shops whose owners they don\u2019t trust, where they would have to stand guard for the duration of the charging.He gets paid 1,000 rupees a month, or about $15, by Selco to serve as an operator, and also earns on the batteries and phone charging. But each month, he must pay 4,000 rupees as an installment toward the 80,000-rupee price, or $1,200, of the entire system, which is owned by Selco until the payments are complete. Very few banks would lend to itinerant workers like Mr. Haque, whose assets and livelihoods are so vulnerable, so this model shifts risk back onto Selco and its investors.The risk is not just that Mr. Haque will come up short. This November, he returned from visiting his home in West Bengal to find that one of the solar panels had been stolen. He\u2019d rather not inform the police; he says they already see the migrants as thieves, and look for excuses to evict them. Selco\u2019s investors will cover the cost of the panel, and the replacement is going to be installed on a higher pole.Running a solar business in an informal settlement like \u201cnear Hebbal flyover\u201d involves a thicket of problems. Mr. Haque worries about whether his home will be razed or if he\u2019ll be able to generate electricity during the long weeks of monsoon rains, or dense winter fog, when lighting is more important than ever. And when your customers are living hand-to-mouth, just collecting payment is a daily frustration.\u201cPeople take mobile charges and light payments from me on credit, and then they never pay,\u201d Mr. Haque said. \u201cWhen you go and ask them for the money, it always turns into a fight. People here get a chance to loot and before you know it, your money is gone.\u201dWhile Mr. Hande, Mr. Stoner and others try to iron out problems like these, they acknowledge that solar home systems don\u2019t represent a complete solution to energy poverty, if only because it is so intertwined with the precariousness of the lives of his customers.\u201cWith S.H.S.\u2019s, at the end of the day, you are just replacing an existing cost with a better technology,\u201d Mr. Stoner said. \u201cHaving electric lighting at home might allow a child to study for longer hours, so you are introducing an indirect productivity benefit, but it doesn\u2019t help you pay next month\u2019s loan.\u201d\u201cStill,\u201d he said, \u201cthat first kilowatt of electricity someone gets is worth an awful lot because they go from darkness to light, with a very small amount of energy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "House Hunting in ... Croatia", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Supported byInternational Real Estate21 PhotosA VILLA IN DUBROVNIK WITH SEA VIEWS$2.73 MILLION (2.5 MILLION EUROS)This three-bedroom two-bath villa, built in 1910 on Lapad Bay, part of the Adriatic Sea, is about a 30-minute walk from Dubrovnik\u2019s Old Town. It has been owned by the same family for four generations. The 2,325-square-foot two-story stone home is on the Lapad Peninsula, one of the most expensive areas in Dubrovnik. \u201cThe old aristocracy of Dubrovnik built their summer houses here,\u201d said Vedrana Kelleher, the owner of Dream Estates Croatia, an associate of Savills, the international real estate company, which is listing the property. There are several large old villas on the hillside, which is covered with pine, cypress and palm trees. A public beach on Lapad Bay is a short walk from the house, and there is a walking path along the bay.This home is on a private street, next door to a villa that is used as an art gallery. From the house there are views of Kolocep Island and the hills across the bay. The property, which is a little more than a quarter of an acre, has tiered gardens, including olive, orange and lemon trees and oleander and bougainvillea. The house has a small reception area. From the entrance, white stone stairs lead up to the bedrooms, and a separate short flight of stairs leads down to the main living area. Many original elements remain from 1910, including the parquet floors in the living and dining rooms and bedrooms, as well as wooden doors, double windows and door handles. Ceramic ovens once used for heating are in the living room and in two of the bedrooms; there is now central heating. The house was renovated over an extended period starting in the 1990s, including a new roof and upgrades to the main kitchen and bathrooms, the owner said.The living room, dining room and kitchen are in separate rooms on the ground floor. The dining room features a raised platform with windows overlooking the garden. There is a full bathroom with a bathtub adjacent to the dining room; the dining room has often been used as a bedroom, the owner said. The kitchen features custom Italian cabinets and a small dining area. There is a door from the kitchen to the garden patio, which can also be reached from the living room.The three bedrooms are upstairs, where there is also a separate kitchen. Two of the bedrooms have a private shower and sink; there is also a shared toilet. The three bedrooms have access to balconies with expansive views of the area.The house includes a basement, currently used for storage, and a one-car garage. There is also an attic that is big enough to be converted into a bedroom, the owner said.A supermarket, hotels, a post office and several restaurants are within walking distance of the house. Dubrovnik\u2019s international airport is about a 30-minute drive.MARKET OVERVIEWDubrovnik is the most expensive market in Croatia, agents say. Although prices fell as much as 30 percent after the 2008 global financial crisis, the market has stabilized in recent years.\u201cAnything well located and priced correctly is selling,\u201d said Tim Coulson, the owner of First Property Croatia, a real estate company. \u201cSupply is still very poor, with very little new development.\u201dCroatia joined the European Union in 2013, which has made it easier for Europeans to buy property. But the volume of sales is still very low compared with the peak years, agents say.\u201cPrice expectation from vendors has become more realistic, but many are still unrealistic,\u201d Mr. Coulson said. \u201cA motivated seller with a good property will find a buyer.\u201dIt is often difficult for buyers to find renovated, well-priced properties for sale, agents said. Homes with sea views or historic properties in the old part of the city are in demand, but there are few homes available, according to agents. Those that are available are often priced at peak levels.\u201cThe typical Croatian seller prefers to wait 10 to 20 years, but not to sell his property 20 percent cheaper,\u201d said Elena Nevskaya, a lead consultant with Adrionika Consultancy and Coordination, a Croatian real estate company. WHO BUYS IN DUBROVNIKDuring the boom years from 2000 to 2008, Dubrovnik was a popular market for buyers from Britain, Germany, Italy and, especially, Russia.\u201cDuring the 2000s the most active buyers were the Russians, who bought many seafront villas in the Dubrovnik area, pumping the prices,\u201d Ms. Nevskaya said.Today Russian buyers are rare, in the wake of a steep decline in the buying power of the ruble, agents say. And instead of buying homes as an investment, more international buyers are purchasing property as vacation homes, agents said.\u201cA lot of people are buying for lifestyle,\u201d Ms. Kelleher said.In recent years, English, Italian and Scandinavian buyers have started to return to the market, as well as Croatian buyers. \u201cAs the local economy improves, more Croatians are buying in to rent,\u201d Mr. Coulson said.BUYING BASICSThe buying process is easy for European Union residents, but more complicated for citizens of other countries. United States citizens have to apply for permission to register property based on reciprocity agreements, which vary from state to state.The mechanics of buying a home follow basic E.U. guidelines. Buyers typically use an agent, escrow accounts are commonly used to secure deposits, and a publicly accessible database tracks title registrations.One potential problem in Croatia: Families who lost their land during the political struggles of the former Yugoslavia may appear to challenge ownership of property. \u201cSometimes the owners of properties who were listed in registers, or whose grandparents were listed, prior to 1945 claim their ownership back,\u201d Ms. Nevskaya said, noting the process can delay a sale, even if it is not successful. Buyers should hire a lawyer to handle contracts, registration and the appropriate paperwork, agents said.WEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCIESCroatian; Croatian kuna (1 kuna = $0.14)TAXES AND FEESFees and taxes can add about 10 percent to the purchase price of a home, including a 2 percent to 3 percent commission for the buyer\u2019s agent and a 5 percent transfer tax, agents said.

{"Headline": "Stance on Migrants Leaves Merkel Isolated at Home and in Europe", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "Supported by\u201cThe state of leadership in Europe is such that the future of the E.U. currently rests on Merkel\u2019s strength, or weakness,\u201d said Constanze Stelzenm\u00fcller, a fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. \u201cLast year, we thought Europe could unravel over the euro. Now, it could be border security.\u201dAs doubts grow over the refugee policy that Ms. Merkel championed, she is now under increasing pressure to change course, particularly in the weeks since asylum seekers were linked to sexual assaults on New Year\u2019s Eve in Cologne.This week, a lengthening string of allies at home and abroad abandoned her on the issue, including neighboring Austria, which said it would set a cap of accepting 37,500 migrants this year \u2014 less than half the 90,000 it received in 2015.So far, while promising a \u201cpalpable reduction\u201d in asylum seekers this year, Ms. Merkel has refused growing demands \u2014 most prominently by Germany\u2019s president on Wednesday \u2014 to set a limit.That insistence has left the chancellor irrevocably associated with a policy on refugees that has sown enormous disquiet, even anger, both in Germany for the financial costs and cultural clashes it has invited, and across Europe, where the Continent\u2019s cherished system of open borders now verges on collapse.The difference with other crises, the leading liberal daily S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung noted on Thursday, \u201cis that this time it concerns the chancellor. Above all, the chancellor.\u201dWhile Ms. Merkel is likely to survive politically \u2014 unseating a chancellor is immensely complex, and there are no obvious alternative candidates \u2014 the anger and rebellion she faces are rare in Germany\u2019s orderly politics, and a watershed in her political life.Most dangerous for the chancellor: Her weakened position leaves her with narrowing room to maneuver on the refugee issue and reduces her leverage with unhappy European partners.That is so even as European Union leaders increasingly sound the alarm that time is running out to forge a strong policy on borders and migration before the surge of refugees resumes in the spring from wars in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan that show no signs of abating.This week, Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, warned, \u201cWe have no more than two months to get things under control\u201d \u2014 a relative blink in the bloc\u2019s sluggish decision-making. Short of that, Mr. Tusk told the European Parliament in Strasbourg, the union would \u201cfail as a political project.\u201dIn previous crises, in particular over a third debt-relief package for Greece last year, Berlin could count on support from other Europeans. On the euro and Ukraine crises, Ms. Merkel was \u201can indispensable leader,\u201d said Jan Techau of Carnegie Europe, a Brussels think tank.On migration, however, Ms. Merkel\u2019s allies have been chagrined by what they see as her flip-flopping as it suits her, Mr. Techau said. Ms. Merkel first defended the European Union practice of trying to turn back or intercept migrants \u201cwhen it was undefendable, and gave it up when it didn\u2019t suit the Germans any longer,\u201d Mr. Techau noted. As a result, he said, \u201cshe is not as strong as she used to be.\u201dNow Germany stands increasingly alone in the migrant crisis, exemplified by Austria\u2019s decision this week to set a cap, which Ms. Merkel\u2019s government called \u201cnot helpful.\u201dThat was an understatement in a week in which conservative lawmakers signed two open letters balking at Ms. Merkel\u2019s refusal to similarly set a cap, and the transport minister, Alexander Dobrindt, became the first cabinet member to openly criticize her policy as questionable for Europe.Germany\u2019s president, Joachim Gauck, whose office carries moral authority, cast the need to set limits on the number of arriving migrants as a moral as well as a political imperative, a deliberate counterpoint to the arguments Ms. Merkel herself had used to justify her refugee policy.\u201cThere is no magic mathematical formula to determine how many people we take in,\u201d Mr. Gauck told business leaders Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\u201cA limitation strategy may even be both morally and politically necessary in order to preserve the state\u2019s ability to function,\u201d he added. \u201cLimiting numbers is not in itself unethical; it helps to maintain acceptance in society. Without acceptance, a society is not open and willing to take in refugees.\u201dIn addition, Mr. Gauck warned, \u201cif democrats refuse to talk about limits, they leave the field to populists and xenophobes.\u201dThat warning was clearly a nod to the Pegida movement and the right-wing Alternative for Germany party, which has risen in polls well above the 5 percent threshold that secures representation in Parliament, said Josef Joffe, publisher of the weekly Die Zeit, who was at the forum.He viewed Mr. Gauck\u2019s speech as both a caution and an attempt to throw a political lifeline to the chancellor, whose conservative Bavarian allies and center-left Social Democratic coalition partners have distanced themselves from her.\u201cWithout mentioning Angela Merkel, and while maintaining very polite, statesmanlike language, he essentially told her, \u2018This has got to stop,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Joffe said in a telephone interview.Ms. Stelzenm\u00fcller of the Brookings Institution, in a separate interview, concurred with Mr. Joffe\u2019s assessment.\u201cHe is trying to build a bridge,\u201d she said, referring to Mr. Gauck, \u201cover what many in the media see as an increasingly unbridgeable chasm between a high-minded chancellor, who is demanding the impossible, and institutions buckling under the strain.\u201dIt is not only Germany that could buckle, but the European Union itself. While Ms. Merkel, as ever, insists on the need for a European solution to the migrant crisis, time is not on the side of the bloc\u2019s cumbersome policy-making apparatus.This week, Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, warned that he, too, was \u201crather worried that we won\u2019t have enough time to tackle the refugee question in sufficient depth.\u201d He called on European Union leaders to devote more time to the issue at their next summit meeting in mid-February, when the agenda is expected to be dominated by how to keep Britain from abandoning the bloc.Ms. Merkel has acknowledged that the union\u2019s lack of unity on the migrant problem leaves the Continent vulnerable. But for the embattled chancellor, urgency may take second place to the imperative of navigating political troubles at home.Her government will present more proposals to tackle the refugee crisis at the next summit meeting, she said on Wednesday, \u201cthen we can draw another interim conclusion, and then we will see where we stand.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here are the trends reshaping the way we drive.Concerns about greenhouse gases and pollution are driving an industry-wide change in the way cars are powered. Regulations on fuel economy and CO2 emissions are forcing carmakers to make engines more efficient. By 2025, 25% of cars sold will have electric engines, up from 5% today. But most of those will be hybrids, and 95% of cars will still rely on fossil fuels for at least part of their power. That means automakers will need to make internal combustion engines more efficient to comply with new standards.The development of alternative power sources such as fuel cells will add to overall efficiency, but only if people can afford them. The Japanese government has set a target price of \u00a52.2million\u2014around US $18,000\u2014for fuel-cell vehicles by 2025. While they would still be a small niche in global sales, that target price would allow them to become competitive with popular hybrids.A combination of technologies throughout the powertrain can increase the fuel economy of cars with internal combustion engines. These include gasoline direct injection, turbocharging and high-speed automatic transmissions.Hybrid vehicles rely on a combination of gasoline or diesel engines and electric power to increase fuel economy. They use regenerative braking and the vehicle\u2019s engine to recharge their electric batteries.Plug-in hybrids have a wider all-electric range than traditional hybrids because they can recharge their batteries from an external power source. Like hybrids, they retain internal combustion engines.Vehicles that rely solely on electric power for propulsion have simpler powertrains than hybrids or traditional cars. Makers of electric vehicles are focused on reducing the cost of their batteries, which can account for 50% of the purchase price today.Fuel-cell vehicles produce their electric power from fuel cells that use hydrogen. They produce no emissions other than water while driving.That conflict is starting to ease, as companies explore materials that are both light and strong\u2014including aluminum, high-tensile steel and carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP).However, these are more expensive materials. CFRP, in particular, is primarily used only in specialty sports cars today.

While challenging, this situation also provides opportunities for parts manufacturers.Weighted average cost increase per vehicle (US$)Source: IHS, company interviews, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research.For large companies, mitigating risks could mean increasing their R&D budgets and diversifying across a range of technologies. Smaller businesses, on the other hand, can deepen their focus on core technologies while forming alliances with other suppliers for areas outside their expertise.With software and other technologies taking the lead, it\u2019s no surprise that consumer tech companies are entering the automotive world. While a car may not be a mobile phone, these businesses\u2019 focus on design, ease of use, automated assistance and battery life will bring new kinds of innovation to the field.One catalyst for tech innovators to move into the automotive industry now: electric vehicles have just 1/3 the parts of conventional vehicles, lowering the barriers to entry.Source: METI, company interview, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research.The car of 2025 will also be shaped by the world around it. New groups of drivers and new ways of driving will create new opportunities for automakers.Connected cars, communicating with each other and with the larger world, will not only reduce accidents and ease traffic.

{"Headline": "G.E. Is Moving Headquarters to Boston and Itself Into the Digital Era", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported byYet Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chief executive, predicted last September that G.E. would be a \u201ctop 10 software company\u201d by 2020. In recent years, the company has steadily built up its software business, and its industrial products are increasingly loaded with digital sensors, all part of an effort to be a leader in the \u201cindustrial Internet.\u201dNow, in its latest step to remake itself \u2014 and its public image \u2014 as an industrial company for the digital era, G.E. said it was moving its headquarters from its longtime sprawling suburban home in Fairfield, Conn., to the high-tech environs of Boston.The relocation by G.E., long a bellwether of the American economy, illustrates how much old-line companies in nearly every industry have been forced to rethink their businesses for a digital age. It is an opportunity, but also a threat. So Walmart is investing heavily in online commerce to meet the challenge from Amazon, and Ford and General Motors are retooling to keep up with innovators like Tesla and Google.The Boston region, Mr. Immelt said, is \u201can ecosystem that shares our aspirations.\u201dThe area is crowded with 55 colleges and universities, including research centers like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard and Northeastern University. G.E. said it was also attracted by the area\u2019s thriving venture capital and start-up community, and pro-business state and local government.In Fairfield, G.E. has about 800 employees, a tiny percentage of its 360,000 employees worldwide. In Boston, G.E. will also have 800 people, but it will have a different kind of headquarters setting, the company said.Only about 200 will be corporate staff, G.E. said, while the remaining 600 will be mainly \u201cdigital industrial product managers, designers and developers\u201d in a variety of disciplines including data analysis, life sciences and robotics.The new headquarters will be leaner, faster and more open with a constant flow of industry partners, customers and innovators, G.E. executives say. The intent, they say, is that it will be more like walking into a start-up in an urban setting than the remote suburban headquarters of the past.The move fits the recent pattern at G.E., analysts say. \u201cIt affirms G.E.\u2019s digital technology orientation and that strategic commitment for decades ahead,\u201d said Steven Winoker, an analyst at Bernstein Research.For years already, G.E. has been at the forefront of industrial companies seeking to use sensor data and clever software to make its machines smarter, using less fuel and predicting when they need maintenance before breakdowns occur. Executives routinely call it \u201can industrial digital business.\u201dG.E.\u2019s digital push is part of the company\u2019s evolution, as it has focused its investment on the industrial side of its business while sharply cutting its once-huge finance arm in the wake of the financial crisis. In 2011, G.E. opened a separate software unit in San Ramon, Calif., which employs 2,000.The company moved to Fairfield in 1974, when many major companies were leaving New York City for suburbia with its lower taxes and living costs, and good public schools. G.E. first said it was weighing moving its headquarters last June, after Connecticut proposed raising taxes on businesses to close the state budget gap.That prompted G.E. to address the issue with urgency but, in its statement on Wednesday, G.E. said its senior management had been considering the appropriate role and location of its headquarters for more than three years.G.E. has not identified the address of its new headquarters, but the company said it would be in the Seaport District in South Boston, which is becoming a hub for investment by technology, biomedical and pharmaceutical companies.Massachusetts and Boston are offering an ample package of incentives. In news releases welcoming G.E., Gov. Charlie Baker and Mayor Martin J. Walsh said the state offered incentives of as much as $120 million through grants and other programs, and the city offered as much as $25 million in property tax relief.The city and state also agreed to make transportation improvements in the Seaport District and to build an innovation center where G.E. and university researchers can collaborate.Employees will move to a temporary location in Boston starting this summer, G.E. said, with the permanent move completed by 2018.G.E. said that the financial incentives from state and city governments vying for its headquarters were competitive. In the financial negotiations, G.E. wanted incentives and grants to make the move itself essentially cost-free for the company, said a person involved in the talks who was not authorized to speak publicly. But G.E. did not seek tax deals that would continue year after year, he said.In its statement, G.E. said it began its search with an initial list of 40 locations. San Francisco was ruled out partly because of its high living costs, and the longer time difference \u2014 by three hours, compared with the East Coast \u2014 in communicating with G.E.\u2019s units in Europe, where the company has a sizable business. Other cities, including New York, made strong bids, but in the end it was Boston, the person involved in the talks said. G.E. did not estimate the extent of the job losses in Connecticut as a result of the move. The company employs 5,000 people in the state, including the 800 at its headquarters.Jess Bidgood contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What\u2019s Our Duty to the People Globalization Leaves Behind?", "Date": "2016-01-26", "News": "Supported byI was there to take part in a discussion of an old friend\u2019s outstanding book on the subject, Steven R. Weisman\u2019s \u201cThe Great Tradeoff: Confronting Moral Conflicts in the Era of Globalization.\u201dAfter praising Steve\u2019s book, I emphasized that I had paid attention in economics class and understood that globalization incontrovertibly has benefited not only the world but also the United States. That\u2019s in part because trade permits Americans to buy goods at lower prices; the added purchasing power helps our economy expand faster.But I soon pivoted to my experience working in the Obama administration on the auto rescue, an experience that had seared into me the sense that intermingled among the many winners from globalization were a substantial number of losers.So far, so good. Then I went rogue and uttered two blasphemous words: \u201cRoss Perot.\u201d He had a point, I said heretically, when he campaigned in 1992 against the landmark North American Free Trade Agreement, saying that it would result in a \u201cgiant sucking sound\u201d of jobs headed south to Mexico.A cool breeze drifted toward me.As I looked out at my audience, I realized that the room was filled with winners \u2014 folks who, from all appearances, earned their livings from intellectual labor. Neither their jobs nor their wages were in jeopardy as countries ranging from Vietnam to Colombia became more competitive with us.I pressed on.Last year, according to the recent figures, our nation added 2.65 million new jobs. Just 30,000 of them were in manufacturing. So much for the widely trumpeted renaissance of Made in America.At first glance, the automobile industry looks to be in better shape. From the depths of the crisis in 2009 through 2013, employment in the auto manufacturing sector in the United States rose by 23 percent, to 690,000 from 560,000.That sounds pretty good, I said, except that employment in the Mexican auto sector rose to 589,000 from 368,000 during the same period, an increase of 60 percent. I\u2019m happy that 221,000 more Mexicans got jobs, but let\u2019s be honest: Absent open borders, many of those jobs would have been in America.The wage picture looks even worse. Since January 2009, inflation-adjusted private sector wages across the economy have risen by 2.5 percent. In the fields of education, health and information, they are up by more than 3 percent. Meanwhile, in manufacturing, pay has fallen by 0.8 percent, and in the auto sector, by 12.7 percent.\u201cLast point,\u201d I said to the 100 or so guests: Average manufacturing compensation costs (includes wages and benefits) in the United States in 2012 were $35.67 per hour; in Mexico, they were $6.36 per hour. \u201cAnd American auto executives will tell you that the productivity they get in Mexico is at least as good as what they get in the United States.\u201dMy central argument was not that we should close our borders or retreat from the world; it was that we need to be sensitive to the losers and try to help. The point \u2014 well illustrated in Steve\u2019s book \u2014 is that globalization is not only an economic matter but also a moral one.Presently, the institute\u2019s blunt director, Adam Posen, used his final moments to shut me down, declaring that the \u201cfetishization\u201d of any industry was \u201cimmoral.\u201d The problem of manufacturing is technology, he declared flatly.Blaming technology is a common refrain from economists who hate the thought that globalization is not the world\u2019s unambiguous salvation.Sorry, Adam, I thought silently, having been afforded no time to respond. If technology were the source of manufacturing workers\u2019 woes, productivity would be rising sharply, which it surely isn\u2019t (notwithstanding claims by some economists that official statistics have been understating efficiency gains).\u201cDon\u2019t blame the robots for lost manufacturing jobs,\u201d read the headline in a blog post last spring by two scholars at the venerable Brookings Institution.I have never forgotten a powerful article I read in Foreign Affairs in 2007 that called for huge tax redistribution, both as a moral matter and as a mechanism for ensuring political support for free trade. (The authors were hardly left-wing shills \u2014 one had served in the administration of President George W. Bush.)That still sounds like the right idea to me.It\u2019s not only morally wrong to fail to help those on the losing end of globalization, but it will also end badly politically, as the ascendant candidacy of Donald J. Trump illustrates.Steven Rattner is a Wall Street executive and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber\u2019s No-Holds-Barred Expansion Strategy Fizzles in Germany", "Date": "2016-01-03", "News": "Supported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Uber is rapidly expanding its ride-hailing operations across the globe. But here in this city of 690,000 \u2014 less than the population of San Francisco, Uber\u2019s hometown \u2014 the company recently did something unusual: It retreated.In early November, Uber shut its small office in Frankfurt\u2019s centuries-old city center after just 18 months of operation, mothballing the online platform that had let people in the city hail rides through a smartphone app. The pullback was spurred in part by drivers like Hasan Kurt, the owner of a local licensed taxi business, who had refused to work with the American service.Uber then tried to recruit licensed operators like Mr. Kurt to build its service within the letter of the law. But Mr. Kurt would not budge.\u201cIt\u2019s not part of the German culture to do something like\u201d what Uber did, Mr. Kurt, 45, said over a cup of tea last month during a break in his busy holiday schedule. \u201cWe don\u2019t like it, the government doesn\u2019t like it, and our customers don\u2019t like it.\u201dIn November, Uber also pulled out of Hamburg and D\u00fcsseldorf after less than two years of operating in each of those German cities. In Amsterdam, Uber recently stopped offering UberPop.Frankfurt offers a case study of what can cause Uber to draw back in one place even as it expands elsewhere.With a thriving financial center and cosmopolitan population, the city seemed like an ideal place for Uber to operate and grow. Yet the company was forced out by a mix of cultural and legal missteps. Specifically, it miscalculated how best to gain the support of skeptical locals unaccustomed to its win-at-all-costs tactics, and it underestimated the regulatory hurdles of doing business in Europe\u2019s largest economy.\u201cIf you want to be successful in Germany, you have to understand the regulation,\u201d said Martin Fassnacht, a professor at the Otto Beisheim School of Management in Vallendar, Germany. \u201cUber should have taken that more seriously.\u201dUber has not completely withdrawn from Germany. It still operates licensed services in Berlin and Munich, and company executives say there is pent-up demand from passengers frustrated with current taxi services.The company has argued it can add thousands of new jobs in Germany if it is allowed to operate freely, though a spokesman declined to say how many German drivers are active on its platform.Uber has also asked the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, to intervene, and an official European investigation into Germany\u2019s ban on UberPop \u2014 along with similar rulings in France and Spain \u2014 is expected to be completed sometime this year.\u201cHave we made mistakes? Absolutely,\u201d said Mark MacGann, Uber\u2019s head of European policy. \u201cBut the current system in Germany artificially protects incumbents who think they have the right to own the market.\u201dTo understand why Uber expanded to Frankfurt in May 2014, you have only to visit the city\u2019s bustling main train station. Throngs of passengers move through the station on their way to Frankfurt\u2019s many banks and its central shopping district. And as in many German cities, the number of licensed taxis in Frankfurt is capped, at just over 1,700 cars, which means that at peak times, there is often more demand for rides than there are available taxis.After Uber arrived, unlicensed drivers for UberPop soon began showing up near the main entrance of the train station, enticing potential passengers with discounted rates that were roughly one-third cheaper than those of the city\u2019s licensed operators, according to Frankfurt\u2019s taxi unions.Such fares quickly set off opposition. Thomas Gr\u00e4tz, head of the Taxi and Rental Car Association, a German trade body, said Uber\u2019s unlicensed drivers had not passed the same lengthy exams and were not subject to similar costs, like the professional drivers\u2019 insurance required by the city\u2019s traditional operators. Uber said its drivers were properly vetted and had appropriate insurance.Confronted with a growing number of UberPop competitors, Taxi Deutschland, another German trade association, filed a legal challenge against Uber in mid-2014, claiming the company\u2019s drivers did not have licenses to operate nationwide. That led to a long court odyssey of rulings and appeals.As the legal tension mounted, Uber\u2019s small Frankfurt team tried to drum up interest from locals, many of whom had never booked a taxi through a smartphone app or used a credit card to pay for a taxi. Unlike the United States and other European countries, Germany still has a low level of credit card use, according to industry statistics.To change those habits, Uber began offering free rides and other incentives to new customers. That helped draw in people like Dan Miner, 32, an American researcher in Frankfurt who signed up for the service after first hearing about it from friends in New York. For Mr. Miner, hailing a taxi through a smartphone app, particularly late at night, was easier than flagging down a licensed taxi that charged for extras like using the trunk.\u201cMore than anything, Uber was cheaper,\u201d Mr. Miner said.Any momentum was short-lived. In March 2015, a Frankfurt judge ruled that all Uber drivers must hold official permits to operate. Despite the decision, Uber continued to offer its low-cost service \u2014 for a while. Then in May, the company shut down UberPop nationwide in favor of only offering licensed services. (Uber had also been offering a luxury chauffeur service in Frankfurt since early 2014.)That was where the alienation of taxi operators like Mr. Kurt hurt Uber. Since the company had already antagonized local taxi operators by prioritizing its low-cost service, Uber could not persuade enough licensed drivers to sign up, even after it offered to pay for licenses and help with other regulatory costs that totaled as much as $400 for new drivers, according to several local taxi groups and policy makers.Uber\u2019s aggressive tactics also turned off potential customers like Andreas M\u00fcller, a financial analyst who tried the company\u2019s Frankfurt service after first using Uber on a business trip in Chicago.

{"Headline": "New Engineering Firm Called Upon to Fix Squibb Park Bridge", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Supported byThe Brooklyn Bridge Park Corporation has finally acknowledged what everyone else has known for months: The $4.1 million Squibb Park Bridge, closed for 17 months, is not reopening anytime soon.At a meeting of its board on Friday, park corporation officials said they were suing the firm of the bridge\u2019s designer \u2014 a MacArthur \u201cgenius grant\u201d winner \u2014 and removing his company from the repairwork, with plans to replace it with an international engineering firm. The lawsuit, filed in State Supreme Court, alleges breach of contract and professional malpractice.Squibb Park Bridge, a 400-foot wooden pedestrian bridge that is supposed to connect Brooklyn Heights to the 1.3-mile-long Brooklyn Bridge Park, opened in 2013. But a year later, its gentle up-and-down movements \u2014 part of the its allure \u2014 became too pronounced, and the bridge began to sway and tilt. In August 2014, it was abruptly closed by the park corporation, which operates Brooklyn Bridge Park.While the closing of the footbridge certainly did not affect the economy or traffic patterns, it was nonetheless an embarrassment for a park that has garnered much attention for its high-design touches. It has also been the subject of debate over its financing model \u2014 relying on private, luxury housing to pay for the park\u2019s maintenance.State Senator Daniel L. Squadron, a Democrat whose district includes the park, has been critical of the way the corporation has handled the closing. \u201cFrom the beginning, there was a distinct lack of communication and transparency on the bridge\u2019s closure,\u201d he said at the board meeting, noting that he had been told multiple times that the bridge would soon reopen, only to see it remain closed.He said Brooklyn Bridge Park Corporation officials had never offered anything more than \u201cvague assurances\u201d about the bridge, and had not been forthcoming about what was wrong with it. \u201cThis is a public amenity, in which the community and its representatives have an interest,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pattern of scant information sharing and collaboration are unacceptable.\u201dRegina Myer, president of the park corporation, rejected assertions that the organization was being evasive last summer when it said the bridge was fixed and just needed city approval to reopen.\u201cThat was our understanding at the time,\u201d Belinda Cape, a spokeswoman, said in an email.But Ms. Myer, speaking of HNTB, said in a statement, \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s now clear that the firm was either unwilling or unable to provide a workable solution to fix the bridge, and that its design was inherently flawed \u2014 that\u2019s why we\u2019re bringing them to court.\u201dThe lawsuit seeks $3 million in damages. Park corporation officials said Arup, the international engineering firm, would design and oversee a plan to stabilize the bridge. That will involve a retrofit that modifies the original design and is focused on safety, which could mean sacrificing the original bounce. It was unclear why HNTB was unable to design such a retrofit itself. Messages left for Mr. Zoli and an HNTB spokesman were not answered.In a statement, Ms. Cape said Arup would work with the New York City Transportation Department\u2019s Division of Bridges on the design of the retrofit. The park corporation, she said, would also work to \u201crecoup costs related to HNTB\u2019s professional failures.\u201dThe park corporation said it expected to pay Arup about $516,000 for its services. That is on top of $955,000 already spent on the unsuccessful repairs. Arup was asked in 2014 to conduct a \u201cpeer review\u201d of HNTB\u2019s efforts to solve the problem with the bridge.But residents will continue to wait for the bridge to reopen: Park corporation officials say that once Arup completes its proposal, which will take about six months, the corporation will put the repair work out to bid.Arup has its own history with problematic bridges. It was one of three designers chosen for the Millennium Bridge in London, a steel-suspension footbridge that crosses the River Thames. The bridge closed two days after it opened in 2000, because it began to sway underfoot, and Arup worked on the repairs. It was closed for two years.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Setting Up Fund for Its Electronics Industry", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 A Chinese technology regulator said on Friday that it would cooperate with a bank to set up a $30 billion fund to support the country\u2019s huge electronics supply chain.Official accounts of the fund did not make clear precisely how the money would be spent. But given the recent weakness in Chinese manufacturing and lower-end electronics manufacturers, it may be intended as a form of stimulus to the tech industry. The terminology used in media accounts signals China\u2019s bold technology ambitions. Reports about the new fund said it would be used to build a \u201cstrong manufacturing country\u201d and an \u201cInternet power.\u201dLocal shares have been hit hard this week by concerns about a depreciating currency and slowing growth. That volatility is most likely worsening an already difficult situation for lower-end electronics makers and component suppliers in China.While China\u2019s largest hardware brands and booming Internet companies tend to attract media attention, the country also has huge numbers of companies that support the electronics supply chain. With low margins and inconsistent orders, many are highly exposed to slowdowns in the worldwide demand for electronics.The headwinds were highlighted again on Friday, when the Taiwanese electronics manufacturing giant Foxconn said that December revenue was 20 percent lower than it was last December. The company operates a number of city-size production facilities in China.Still, Mr. Zhou said that the financing would be used to develop advanced technologies and support companies that are facing financing difficulties, an indication that it might not ultimately lead to a reduction in China\u2019s huge number of low-cost electronics manufacturers.Over the last year, the semiconductor fund has been used to finance a number of strategic investments and acquisitions in foreign chip companies. Foreign trade groups have said it gives unfair advantage to Chinese companies and is a tool of Beijing\u2019s industrial policies. It is unclear whether the new fund will be used to support acquisitions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stop China\u2019s Market Manipulations", "Date": "2016-01-18", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorWashington \u2014 THE other day while I was crossing the street in Beijing, a car almost flattened me. Both the driver and I were outraged at the other\u2019s ineptitude. In China, if you want to avoid being hit, you keep your head down and avoid eye contact with the oncoming driver, since looking at him would signal that you saw the car and know you should let it pass. In the United States, the opposite rule applies: Making eye contact confirms that the driver has seen you and should yield to the vulnerable pedestrian.Something similar is occurring now between China and global financial markets. Billions in renminbi and dollars could be lost while trying to untangle the lines of communication.Chinese bureaucrats believe that they have the right to intervene in their country\u2019s economy whenever they want, not only to promote certain industries but also to prevent sudden downturns and reduce volatility. Officials believe that they don\u2019t have to defend or explain their decisions in real time to market participants. In fact, being opaque preserves their discretion to make changes on the fly.This approach goes against the operating principles of global financial markets: clarity and timely transparency. Intervention should be the exception, not the norm.The job of regulators should be to ensure a fair market, but China\u2019s stock market is worse than a casino, as Chinese regulators\u2019 goals and the basic rules of the game can shift without warning. With China\u2019s housing market in disarray in 2014, authorities invited investors to shift their capital to the stock market and then took a series of steps to facilitate high returns. When the market started to nose-dive last summer, officials wouldn\u2019t let the bubble that had inevitably formed fully burst. Instead they suspended trading for some companies, mopped up shares, ordered large shareholders not to sell and accused market analysts of spreading false rumors.Regulators were at it again earlier this month, delaying the trading of stocks that had been frozen since last summer and even suddenly declaring that the market would temporarily halt trading if the Shanghai index rose or fell 5 percent. All this did was give investors just enough time to hit the sell button when markets restarted. About four days after it was started, this tool was abandoned without apology. Some investors have lost their shirts, but no regulators have lost their jobs.China\u2019s currency missteps have been equally maddening. The market suggests that the renminbi is overvalued because a strengthening or even stable renminbi is inconsistent with the country\u2019s expanding debt burden and slowing economic growth. China\u2019s central bank has taken some steps to liberalize the exchange rate, measuring the renminbi against a broader basket of currencies instead of the dollar. But because Chinese officials continue to publicly assert the renminbi is not overvalued, they are intervening daily to prop up the currency. And they have imposed a range of capital controls.Based on my interviews, Chinese officials believe these steps are preserving economic stability and facilitating gradual change, while investors who see policies change constantly with little apparent rationale have had their confidence in officials\u2019 ability badly shaken.Frustration with China has prompted calls for a regulatory response. Some in Congress have long clamored for the Treasury Department to label China a currency manipulator and issue sanctions. Even Donald J. Trump has advocated for a 45 percent across-the-board tariff on Chinese imports. But given that China is not trying to depress its currency to make its products more competitive, penalties are not justified. Nor would they work; they might make Washington feel better, but American investors, producers and consumers would all suffer from the resulting tit-for-tat.The Obama administration instead should take a page out of the human rights playbook and privately raise the harmful effects of interventionism and delaying liberalization with the Chinese every chance it gets until the message gets through. And if it does not, American officials should step before the cameras and let markets know how disappointed they are with China\u2019s policies. President Xi Jinping claimed that last summer\u2019s emergency measures were necessary to prevent \u201csystemic risks\u201d to China\u2019s economy, but at a summit meeting in September President Obama essentially did nothing to push Mr. Xi on that issue publicly or privately, implying that the United States accepted this explanation and related policies.China\u2019s economic management should also be a central part of multilateral diplomacy. The Group of 7 and Group of 20 nations have issued general calls for flexible exchange rates, transparent market management and greater coordination of macroeconomic policies. But if Chinese interventionism continues to roil global markets, the conversation ought to become much more pointed. At a minimum, governments and world markets deserve far more detailed information from China provided in a far timelier manner than is now the case.If the world economy does not want to be flattened by a Chinese state apparently unaware of how risky its actions are, then we may need to make the conversation about China\u2019s markets much more public. The two sides may not see eye to eye, but no one should avert their glance.Scott Kennedy is the director of the Project on Chinese Business and Political Economy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Taxi Drivers and Air Traffic Controllers Go on Strike in France", "Date": "2016-01-26", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 Taxi drivers and air traffic controllers in France went on separate but simultaneous strikes on Tuesday, blocking traffic in major cities and disrupting flights at several airports.The strikes were part of a wider day of protests in the public sector, including hospitals and schools, to call attention to staff reductions, low salaries and education overhauls. More than 100 demonstrations were planned around the country, and CGT, one of the unions that organized the strike, said that 130,000 to 150,000 people participated nationwide.The police in Paris said that about 2,000 taxis had blocked or delayed traffic around Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports, as well as Porte Maillot, a major intersection in western Paris, and near the Ministry of Economy and Finance.Some taxi drivers set fire to tires and tried to block the highway that circles the French capital, but the police pushed the demonstrators back with tear gas.Twenty-four people were arrested, including the driver of an airport shuttle who had tried to force his way through a taxi roadblock near Orly, injuring two people, the French news media reported.Hundreds of taxi drivers also blocked traffic around airports and train stations in Lille and Toulouse on Tuesday, and they paralyzed traffic in central Marseille.Prime Minister Manuel Valls held an emergency meeting with taxi union representatives, the interior minister and representatives from the Transportation Ministry on Tuesday.Mr. Valls\u2019s office said in a statement after the meeting that the government would increase enforcement of the 2014 law that regulates the activity of ride-booking companies, to \u201cput an end to unfair behavior and guarantee the conditions of loyal competition.\u201dThe statement said that Mr. Valls was ready to consult industry and government representatives \u201con the economic equilibrium of the individual transportation sector and on the potential regulatory evolutions that might follow.\u201dThe consultations will begin in February and will last about three months, the statement said, adding that a \u201cqualified person\u201d would be appointed in the coming days to lead the process.The statement also said that the government would provide support to individual drivers, but it did not provide any details. Some taxi unions have asked that drivers receive financial compensation from the state for their loss of business and the drop in the value of taxi licenses.Ahmed Senbel, president of the National Federation of Independent Taxis, said after the meeting that he felt Mr. Valls was fully aware of the problem, but he warned that the announcements might not placate the taxi drivers.\u201cWe\u2019ve been containing it for seven years, but today we can\u2019t contain it anymore,\u201d Mr. Senbel said. Mr. Valls said earlier that the right to demonstrate should be respected but that violence was \u201cunacceptable.\u201dOne in five flights was canceled at the two main Paris airports, and other flights were delayed as air traffic controllers protested job cuts and changes to how their salaries are calculated. Public transportation was not disrupted.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the number of taxis blocking traffic around Paris airports. It was 2,000, not 2,000,500.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Venezuela Opposition Takes Reins of Assembly as Tensions Rise", "Date": "2016-01-05", "News": "Supported byCARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 Change came to the National Assembly here on Tuesday in very Venezuelan style \u2014 with a lot of shouting. In a raucous session that at times resembled a professional wrestling smackdown, without the hair-pulling and spandex, opposition legislators were sworn in as a majority for the first time in 16 years.\u201cDo you know what\u2019s surprising \u2014 that this is sensational news in Venezuela,\u201d Henry Ramos, the new head of the National Assembly, said as he was surrounded by reporters and television cameras on the floor of the Assembly chamber. \u201cIn no other part of the world is the opening of Congress big news.\u201d \u201cEveryone is paying attention to this today, like never before,\u201d he added. \u201cWhy? Because the world knows that a new phase starts in Venezuela today.\u201dThe opposition swept to a landslide victory in elections in early December, winning two-thirds of the 167 seats in the Assembly and breaking with a long period of domination by the socialist movement of Mr. Maduro and his predecessor and mentor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. Their victory derived from widespread dissatisfaction with a crumbling economy, but many voters also spoke of disapproval over the governing style of Mr. Maduro, who is seen as both indecisive and overly combative.Mr. Maduro has come out swinging in the weeks since the election, slamming the winning majority as a bourgeois faction intent on slashing social programs and replacing him through a coup. Far from pledging to work with the opposition to solve the country\u2019s deep economic crisis, he and other government officials have taken steps in recent days aimed at constraining the new Assembly\u2019s actions.In late December the exiting Assembly members approved 13 new Supreme Court judges in what critics said was an attempt to stack the court and prevent the new body from filling vacancies that would have come up this year. Then, just days before the swearing-in, the Supreme Court blocked four newly elected legislators from taking office, three from the opposition and one from Mr. Maduro\u2019s United Socialist Party. The court ruled in favor of a socialist candidate who had challenged the election results in Amazonas State. The opposition viewed this as part of a bid to chip away at its two-thirds majority, which allows it to propose constitutional changes and remove Supreme Court judges, among other things. Then on Monday the lame-duck legislators approved a new package of government spending and Mr. Maduro signed a decree that stripped the Assembly of its traditional oversight of the Central Bank, including the ability to remove and appoint directors and receive economic data.And opposition leaders accused the socialists of taking away the audiovisual equipment that would allow the opening session to be televised. But Mr. Maduro also called for a peaceful transition to the opposition-led Assembly, and he dispatched soldiers to block the area around the capitol building and keep supporters of the two sides far apart. The opening session was full of symbolic moments and gestures. Members of the news media were allowed into the Assembly chamber for the first time in years, marking the end of a period in which only government-run television stations and other government-controlled media could cover sessions. This session started with speeches from lawmakers from each side, interrupted by catcalls, whistles and loud chants from opposite sides of the room. The socialist legislators accused the opposition of being traitors and shills for big business and the United States government. The opposition accused the socialists of corruption, and of presiding over an economic collapse. \u201cOur country isn\u2019t for sale!\u201d the socialists chanted, backed by supporters in the balconies. The opposition legislators and their supporters responded with chants of \u201c112! 112!\u201d referring to the commanding number of seats they won, making up exactly two-thirds of the Assembly. In another break from the recent past, there were no portraits of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez in the chamber. Eventually, a vote was held in which the opposition legislators approved Mr. Ramos as the head of the Assembly, ratifying a decision reached over the weekend. Mr. Ramos ascended the chamber\u2019s two-tiered wooden rostrum and, under the Assembly\u2019s rules, swore himself in. At one point legislators from both sides rushed the rostrum and engaged in a heated kerfuffle and a shouting match. As temperatures rose there was a brief spate of pushing and shoving. The dispute was about whether an opposition legislator should be allowed to make a speech after the leadership vote, with the Chavistas insisting that the rules for the opening session did not permit it. The socialist bloc walked out in protest. \u201cWe can\u2019t endorse violations of the rules,\u201d said the first lady, Cilia Flores, who was elected as a socialist legislator. \u201cThis session was only for the swearing-in.\u201dWhile the day gave little hope that the two sides would find a way to work together, there did appear to be at least one point of agreement. When Mr. Maduro later phoned in to a program on the main government-run television channel, he echoed words uttered earlier by Mr. Ramos. \u201cWe\u2019re in a new phase,\u201d the president said.Patricia Torres and Mar\u00eda Eugenia D\u00edaz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Needs Assassins When You\u2019ve Got Hackers?", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorIn the years since Mr. Litvinenko\u2019s dramatic death by radioactive poison, Russia\u2019s government has engaged in an array of brazen acts: cyberattacks on Estonia in 2007, the invasion of Georgia in 2008 and covert operations to annex Crimea and destabilize Ukraine in 2014.So was Mr. Litvinenko\u2019s assassination the start of a new era of dirty tricks?It may have seemed like a good idea at the time and probably in the immediate aftermath; the Russian government viewed it as a success that deterred others in the rich Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 community of \u201cLondongrad\u201d from opposition activities. But the political price Moscow paid was considerable; it solidified the image of Mr. Putin\u2019s Russia as a rogue state.Mr. Putin might like to act as if Russia is a world unto itself. It\u2019s not. Modern Russia is thoroughly integrated into global markets and institutions. It seeks foreign investors and partners abroad. Moscow\u2019s elites vacation in Italy, bank in London and send their children to American universities. They can\u2019t afford the repercussions of transnational assassination plots.Mr. Litvinenko\u2019s killing, after all, was primarily about silencing critics and scaring opponents rather than eliminating one man. Moscow has realized that in the age of the Internet and 24-hour news cycles, there are safer ways of doing the same thing.That\u2019s not necessarily a reason to celebrate. While it\u2019s true that no one dies from a hacked website, this campaign to dismay, divide and distract the West may be more destructive than any one assassination.The problem is that liberal countries with open economies, democratic politics and a legal presumption of innocence are far less able to resist these offensives. Money and misinformation move equally fast in the modern world. Proving that an extremist political group or a glib lobbyist is backed by Moscow is often impossible. Indeed, part of the genius of this new model of subversion is that it often can be done in plain sight, coyly wrapping itself in the mantle of free speech.This is the new world of covert war. There are no bodies and no smoking guns, no polonium trails and no easy answers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Puerto Rico Revises Plan to Reduce Debt as Optimism Dwindles", "Date": "2016-01-18", "News": "Supported byIn a briefing for journalists on Monday, officials said they now expected to need a $16 billion break from creditors.The officials said they had run updated forecasts for 10 years as well, and things did not get much better. Over the full 10 years, they said, they would need $24 billion worth of reductions in the total $63 billion in principal and interest that various branches of government owed creditors.And that is if the structural reforms that Puerto Rico is planning succeed in fostering renewed economic growth. Without such a recovery, the officials said, Puerto Rico would need $34 billion worth of relief from the $63 billion of scheduled payments.\u201cWe expect to sit with our creditors shortly and put forth a comprehensive restructuring proposal,\u201d said Melba Acosta Febo, chairwoman of the Government Development Bank, in a statement issued Monday afternoon. She said the proposal would include responsible steps by Puerto Rico to manage its economy, \u201cBut it also includes a comprehensive adjustment of its debt, that reflects the commonwealth\u2019s actual capacity to pay its creditors over the long term.\u201d She added that solutions that \u201cburden the economy with unsustainable debt levels, or allocate all of the debt restructuring burden to one class of credits over another will not work and instead will merely prolong this crisis.\u201dThe officials who briefed the journalists said they recently realized that they had to revise their economic plan when they saw that tax revenues were running about $500 million lower than forecast. The government has increased certain taxes and stepped up audits and enforcement, but the efforts have yet to yield a payoff. The island\u2019s brutal 10-year recession has prompted some businesses to close and many residents to move to the United States mainland, leaving fewer incomes and transactions for the government here to tax.With inadequate revenue and no ability to borrow, Puerto Rico\u2019s cash has been drying up. The island was able to make a number of large, high-priority debt payments due on Jan. 1 only by taking money away from lower-ranking creditors. The island\u2019s next significant debt payment, of $400 million, is due in May from the Government Development Bank.The development bank is important because it orchestrates most of Puerto Rico\u2019s complex web of debt, and because it has the increasingly difficult job of making sure all branches of government have adequate cash. There are concerns that if it ran into severe problems, they would spread to other parts of the government. And on July 1, so many debt payments are due that the officials said that without relief, there would be defaults from the top to the bottom of the hierarchy of creditors. When questioned further, they said it was still too soon to reveal how much relief they would seek from each creditor group. Under the ground rules for the briefing, the officials could not be identified by name or quoted directly.On Wednesday, the United States Treasury secretary, Jacob J. Lew, is scheduled to visit Puerto Rico. He is expected to discuss the island\u2019s debt crisis with Gov. Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla, senior members of the legislature, and business, labor and community leaders.Mr. Lew and other Obama administration officials have been urging Congress to enact measures they say would help it restructure its $72 billion of debt in an orderly manner. In particular, the administration has argued that Puerto Rico needs access to a legal framework, like bankruptcy, that would automatically stay creditor lawsuits and make it possible to force dissident creditors to accept settlements. As currently written, the bankruptcy code bars Puerto Rico\u2019s cities or other bodies of government from using Chapter 9, the provision that insolvent cities and counties on the mainland have been able to use to shed debt.Republicans in Congress have held back from agreeing to amend the bankruptcy code for Puerto Rico, saying they must first have a better understanding of how the island got into so much trouble.The officials who briefed journalists on Monday said that any restructuring would be easier if they could do it under the protective shield of bankruptcy \u2014 but that even without bankruptcy they had to press forward. They said debt relief was the only hope for bringing the government\u2019s fiscal affairs into balance over the long term.To underscore the point, they offered new details about the various vendors and programs that were being shortchanged, as the government desperately pulled together enough cash to make its highest-priority debt payments. In the second half of 2015, they said, they removed $400 million from social insurance programs; they delayed $330 million worth of income-tax refunds due to residents since 2014; they allowed nearly $1.8 billion of unpaid bills to vendors to pile up.They said that some vendors were being stretched to the breaking point, and that they feared they would stop delivering essential medical supplies to hospitals, or foodstuffs to prisons, if they were not paid quickly.At the end of 2015 the government also announced that it was exercising a \u201cclawback\u201d provision that allowed it to strip money away from some bondholders in order to pay it to others. They said about $163 million had been clawed back and used to satisfy payments due to general-obligation bondholders, who have the highest priority under the Puerto Rican constitution. The clawbacks prompted two insurers of the affected bonds to sue the government.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republican Deficit Hypocrisy", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorAt the Republican debate last night in South Carolina, Republicans were happy to talk about, and denounce, the budget deficit and debt. Senator Marco Rubio said that we must \u201cbring our debt under control.\u201dMr. Rubio, like other G.O.P. candidates, rails against the deficit as a sign of President Obama\u2019s moral failure. He advocates a balanced-budget amendment.As a recovering Republican who retired in 2011 after serving on the House and Senate Budget Committees, I have concluded that this ritual denunciation of deficits and out-of-control spending is a fraud. Not only does the party not care about the deficit, but its practice since 1981 has been to worsen it.We should pay particularly close attention to the Republican budget proposals from the presidential candidates in 2016. If a Republican is elected president, the party will almost surely have maintained control of Congress and, therefore, control the federal budget.Since Mr. Rubio offers a detailed plan on taxes and spending \u2014 and since he is widely considered an \u201cestablishment\u201d candidate \u2014 voters might carefully consider what his budget blueprint offers. Here\u2019s the short version: It draws on fantasy math that would wreck America\u2019s fiscal house.On the tax side, Mr. Rubio slashes rates on personal and corporate income, and gives bigger breaks to wealthier Americans.Mr. Rubio\u2019s policies would cause a tidal wave of red ink. A repeal of the capital gains tax would cost roughly $1 trillion over 10 years While there as yet is no estimate for the cost of dividend tax repeal, my best professional guess is a minimum of $250 billion.Republicans have been largely budgeting by magic asterisk ever since.In 1990, when the deficit hit almost 4 percent of gross domestic product and Reagan\u2019s successor, George H.W. Bush, called for a package of spending reductions and tax increases, Newt Gingrich led most Republicans to oppose the measure. He became de facto minority leader.After that, no Republican would dare suggest tax increases, regardless of his promise to balance the budget.By 1998, when the budget was finally balanced, Republicans claimed credit because they controlled Congress. But the real reasons for the budgetary improvement were Mr. Bush\u2019s and Bill Clinton\u2019s deficit reduction packages, which Republicans opposed, and the improved economy of the mid-1990s, refuting the Republican assertion that even the smallest tax increase would ruin the economy.George W. Bush followed the example of Mr. Reagan rather than his father. I was dismayed that he proposed both tax cuts and military increases after taking office while squandering the opportunity to pay down the national debt, an idea that Republicans rhetorically supported during the 1990s. His policies turned a $236 billion budget surplus he inherited in 2000 into a $459 billion deficit in 2008, while in those same eight years doubling the national debt.Their consistently sorry fiscal record and proposals raise the question: Why hasn\u2019t the public caught on?Republicans have been remarkably successful in delinking taxes from fiscal policy, \u201cframing\u201d taxes as a distasteful personal burden unconnected to widely desired public goods like roads, food-safety inspections or clean water. Instead, they claim that reducing taxes will spur so much investment the cuts will \u201cpay for themselves.\u201d Three decades of evidence have shown this claim to be false, but the candidates display ferocious discipline in pretending that tax cuts don\u2019t harm the budget.Working for Republicans, I learned the hard way that expecting the party to restrain the deficit, let alone balance the budget, is, in Samuel Johnson\u2019s words, \u201cthe triumph of hope over experience.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Wall St. Slides After Chinese Stocks Plunge", "Date": "2016-01-04", "News": "Supported byOn the first trading day of the new year, investors\u2019 old worries flooded back.Global stock markets tumbled on Monday, as further fears about a slowdown in China\u2019s economy reignited concerns about global growth.The selling on Monday started after China released a weak manufacturing report, and continued after the United States did the same. Chinese stocks lost nearly 7 percent of their value, although they appeared to stabilize Tuesday morning. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, the main benchmark for the United States stock market, posted a decline of 1.5 percent, while European stocks also fell.The sharp drops bring back memories of the sell-off last summer. China\u2019s surprising decision in August to devalue its currency prompted concerns about the health of the country\u2019s economy and helped ignite a global rout.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.But there was a new twist to investors\u2019 anxieties. Measures to help steady stocks that were put in place after the market turmoil last year now appear to be exacerbating the selling in China.\u201cThis will be the theme for the year,\u201d said Devendra Joshi, an HSBC Asia equity strategist. \u201cThere will be more volatility.\u201dThe market volatility, if it continues, may create headaches for the Federal Reserve, which in December raised interest rates for the first time in over nine years. The Fed chose not to raise rates in September, in part because it was concerned that the turbulence of the summer would weigh on the United States economy.The manufacturing data released on Monday could strengthen the arguments of some economists who say the Fed was too quick to raise interest rates. The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s measure of manufacturing activity fell to 48.2 in December, its lowest reading since 2009. (A number below 50 signals that the manufacturing sector is contracting.)Chinese manufacturing has been steadily contracting for 10 straight months. The Caixin purchasing managers\u2019 index for December fell to 48.2, well below expectations and lower than the reading in November.\u201cIt was a one-two punch from the manufacturing sector,\u201d said Gina C. Martin Adams, institutional equity strategist at Wells Fargo Securities. Some of the stocks that soared in 2015 were among the hardest hit on Monday. Netflix, the top-performing stock in the S.&P. 500 last year, declined by almost 4 percent, while Amazon, the second-biggest gainer last year, plunged 5.8 percent. Investors also appeared to seek some safety in government bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which falls as its price rises, declined slightly to 2.25 percent, from 2.27 percent.The oil markets shrugged off increased tensions in the Middle East. Early in the day, the conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran, two major oil producers, sent the price of crude soaring. But oil ultimately ended down, as concerns about the Chinese slowdown crimped commodity prices.Analysts cautioned that it would be a mistake to read too much into one day\u2019s trading, and they pointed out that markets around the world rallied strongly after the sell-off in the summer. The outlook for Europe appears to be stronger than it was a year ago. And the United States economy has proved its resilience in recent years, growing even as the dollar increased in value and as the plunge in oil prices damaged the prospects of the energy sector.Still, China\u2019s challenges will most likely unsettle investors for a while. As the world\u2019s second largest economy, China is a critical piece of the growth puzzle. If China decelerates markedly, Chinese companies and consumers buy less in goods and services from other countries.Chinese demand is particularly worrisome for commodity producers around the world, which have been hurt by the country\u2019s slowdown. On Monday, Anglo American\u2019s shares fell about 7 percent, while Glencore\u2019s were off 5.8 percent. The pressures on the Chinese currency add to the global worries.The Chinese government is allowing the value of its currency, the renminbi, to decline as a way of spurring its own economy. On Monday, the central bank set the renminbi at its lowest level since May 2011.But this approach risks fanning market tumult and trade tensions.Companies and individuals have moved their money overseas, prompted by economic weakness and the fear that the renminbi will lose more value. Those outflows further weigh on the value of the currency.\u201cThe People\u2019s Bank of China needs to be careful,\u201d said Li-Gang Liu, the chief economist for greater China at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group. \u201cIt cannot create a one-way bet for renminbi depreciation. If they were to do that, we would run into an out-of-control scenario like we saw in the second half of last year.\u201dFrom a trade perspective, China\u2019s policy can prompt other countries to devalue their currencies to try to regain competitiveness. Some Asian countries have already moved in that direction.It is also a challenge for American companies. As other currencies have weakened, the dollar has remained relatively strong. That makes it harder for United States companies to export and it forces them to cut prices to compete \u2014 all of which potentially drags down earnings.The Chinese government\u2019s stock stabilization plan is also playing into the market sell-off.A new rule, which went into effect on Monday, suspends trading in the major mainland markets when the CSI 300 index of blue-chip shares falls 5 percent during a session. The circuit breaker kicked in Monday, setting off a temporary halt. Analysts indicate that the suspension might have led investors to later dump shares, which then brought on a halt for the day.Another measure, a six-month ban on major shareholders\u2019 offloading stocks in Chinese-listed companies, expires at the end of this week. The policy was imposed to stabilize share prices last summer. But now it could be having the reverse effect, leading those with smaller holdings to sell before larger shareholders do. After opening lower on Tuesday, shares in Shanghai wavered between small gains and losses. Hao Hong, chief strategist at the Bank of Communications International, predicted that the tough start to 2016 could continue. \u201cVolatility tends to beget volatility,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will more likely than not spill over to other asset classes. Given we had such dramatic volatility, it\u2019s really too early to see the bottom, especially now that the fundamentals are looking so ugly.\u201dDavid Jolly contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

It may be the largest town in Wright County, but it is not the seat; that is Clarion, about a 20-minute drive away. Fort Dodge, the closest big town and a favorite of candidates, is about a 30-minute drive away in a different county.\u201cI would rather see them in person if I could,\u201d said Mark Sampson, 46, a tax accountant who was having lunch in Lewright\u2019s with his wife, Anne. \u201cBut I just don\u2019t have time to travel.\u201dThe city administrator, Mike Boyd, a fan of politics who ran for mayor in another life but lost, has tried to get candidates to come to town, but never got a response.\u201cIn the last election, I tried to get a campaign to come here, and they didn\u2019t bother to even respond,\u201d he said with a sigh. \u201cI\u2019m just surprised that not one of any of them have even called or thought about stopping here in Eagle Grove.\u201dAdd Mayor Sandy McGrath to the list of surprised officials. She cited places perfect for candidate rallies \u2014 a high school auditorium and a memorial hall \u2014 as well as a bigger event space that the town is working on building to entice such high-profile visitors.She worries that, in a live-stream culture where her constituents are getting only a glimpse of candidates through flashing screens or newspapers, they are missing their chance to size up the contenders one to one, the way other Iowans can.\u201cPart of voting for someone, in my opinion, is how candidates can present themselves off the cuff,\u201d Ms. McGrath said. \u201cWhether they truly know it or not or whether they are giving me an answer as to what I want to hear.\u201dPolitics can be tricky in Eagle Grove; everyone knows one another, in a place where a construction worker at a downtown bar describes a work site by the name of the owner\u2019s house and three others at the table nod in acknowledgment.In a town whose economy is powered by small businesses that have been in families for generations, taking any kind of public political stance could alienate some of the finite number of customers who trickle in every day to grab a slice of pizza or get some help with taxes.But a lack of lawn signs does not mean a lack of interest. Talk of the election, from Ted Cruz to Bernie Sanders to Donald J. Trump, is heard everywhere.\u201cI just had a Bible study this morning and, of course, we talked about the campaign at the end,\u201d said the Rev. Jason D. Cooper, the pastor of a local Lutheran church.Mr. Cooper has been willing to make the journey to Fort Dodge or Clarion to see candidates. With a young daughter who relies on medication, he has taken his son, Jensen, to meet many of the candidates and ask specific questions on health care. Jensen, 11, is turning his trail experiences into a 4-H project.\u201cI think to some degree we get a little lazy and we watch TV,\u201d Mr. Cooper said. \u201cI still think there\u2019s something about shaking the man\u2019s hand, or woman\u2019s hand, looking them in the eyes, and kind of getting a read on their body language, the body language in the room.\u201dThe closest a candidate has come to Eagle Grove this cycle was when Mr. Cruz held a town-hall-style meeting in Goldfield, about five miles away. His campaign even called down to Lewright\u2019s to send up some pasta salad, hot sandwiches and jerky. Carmen Jones, a manager at the deli, drove it over, and ended up meeting Mr. Cruz.\u201cI was a little star-struck,\u201d she said. \u201cI went and got my sign and started jumping up and down and was like, \u2018Yeah, I shook his hand and everything.\u2019 \u201dFor Ms. Jones, though, a swing through town by a candidate would do wonders to politically engage Eagle Grove.\u201cJust stop somewhere,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if you\u2019re rolling through the town, go in, say hi, and back out.\u201dAnd, she added, it might just help the candidate out, too.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell the whole world you\u2019re going there because this little whole world will tell everyone that you were there,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople have cellphones, they\u2019ll record it.\u201d\u201cIt spreads like wildfire in these little towns.\u201dKitty Bennett and Jeremy B.

He urged lawmakers to support the program\u2019s funding in the budget, saying such education would help the nation\u2019s young people succeed in a changing job market.\u201cIn the new economy, computer science isn\u2019t an optional skill \u2014 it\u2019s a basic skill, right along with the three Rs,\u201d Mr. Obama said in the address. \u201cNine out of 10 parents want it taught at their children\u2019s schools.\u201dOfficials said the president\u2019s budget plan, to be officially rolled out on Feb. 9, also calls for sending $100 million directly to school districts to help start computer science education programs. And it directs the National Science Foundation and the Corporation for National and Community Service to spend more than $135 million in existing funds on teacher training over a five-year period beginning this year.White House officials say the need is critical, in part because other nations are doing a better job educating young people in computer sciences, a fast-growing part of the global economy.Only a quarter of the elementary, middle and high schools in the United States offer computer science classes, with 22 states not allowing such classes to count toward a diploma, officials said. Only 4,310 of 37,000 high schools in the country offer Advanced Placement computer science classes, they said, putting American children at a disadvantage.\u201cThat\u2019s what this is all about \u2014 each of us doing our part to make sure all our young people can compete in a high-tech, global economy,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones who will make sure America keeps growing, keeps innovating and keeps leading the world in the years ahead.\u201dIn addition to federal spending, Mr. Obama is urging private technology companies to do more to support computer science education.Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, praised that effort in a conference call with reporters that the White House organized on Friday. He said the company, which has already invested in efforts to encourage computer science education, was beginning a 50-state campaign to expand it further.He called the effort by Mr. Obama and the other companies a \u201csocial imperative\u201d for schoolchildren.\u201cMore than anything else, what we\u2019ve learned is that computing and computer science have become foundational for the future,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just a tech issue.

Offenheiser, president of Oxfam America, \u201cdepriving governments, rich and poor, of the resources they need to provide vital public services and tackle rising inequality.\u201dThe banking sector plays an essential role in the tax-haven issue, the report notes \u2014 just 50 big banks manage a majority of offshore wealth. At the same time, the financial sector is a prime source of rising inequality; one in five billionaires comes from that industry.The global economy has more than doubled in size in the last 30 years. Its value reached nearly $78 trillion in 2014. But even as countries like China and India have built a vast middle class almost from scratch, those gains have disproportionately flowed to those at the very top of the income ladder.Workers in nearly all of the world\u2019s most developed nations and in most developing countries have been getting a smaller and smaller share of the pie, Oxfam notes.\u201cThere\u2019s a huge divide not between the rich and the rest of the population but between the social- and the self-oriented rich,\u201d said Martijn Lampert, Motivaction\u2019s research director. The self-oriented \u201cdo not like to step outside the rich bubble,\u201d he said, but the social-oriented \u201cget more involved, have more compassion and have more contact with what is happening elsewhere in society.\u201d\u201cThey are in a position to work together with mainstream segments to make change happen,\u201d Mr. Lampert said.Jeffrey A. Winters, a political scientist at Northwestern University who studies economic elites, said the Oxfam report highlighted what has been an acceleration of wealth accumulation among a few individuals. Even within the tiny slice of the top 1 percent, the gap between the ultrawealthy and everyone else in that group has been growing, he noted.\u201cThese are unprecedented levels of stratification in all of human history,\u201d Mr. Winters said, whether compared with ancient Rome or authoritarian dictatorships that exert near-total control of a country\u2019s resources. \u201cNo other system has concentrated wealth as much as this system has.\u201dOxfam pointed to a number of trends including deregulation, privatization and financial secrecy that had \u201csupercharged the age-old ability of the rich and powerful to use their position to further concentrate their wealth.\u201dAccording to the Motivaction report, wealthier people in general have more faith in governments, multinational companies and the legal system than the rest of the population. They tend to be more distrustful of religion and trade unions.The survey also revealed that the rich who were considered more social-minded tended to work for smaller companies and were more optimistic. By contrast, the self-oriented have \u201ca more fatalistic attitude, often believing in the existence of a particular destiny for every individual, which one cannot deny or escape.\u201d\u201cThey are more likely to expect that nothing will change, therefore doubting whether it is worth to try,\u201d the report said of the self-oriented.But even these individuals might be influenced by the philanthropic initiatives of business icons they admire, like Mark Zuckerberg or Richard Branson, the report said.Mr. Winters, of Northwestern, noted that the Motivaction survey did not capture the ultrawealthy, but a much broader segment that, at least in the United States, included people who consider themselves to be upper middle class. And whatever their public spiritedness, he says, the most promising way to reduce inequality is through policy and tax changes rather than the good will of people at the top.\u201cWe can adopt policies that make it harder for the ultrawealthy to shape our government and our society,\u201d Mr. Winters said, \u201cor we can do what we have been doing, which is greatly facilitating the ability of the rich to shape society.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Protesters in\u00a0Oregon Seek to End Policy That Shaped West", "Date": "2016-01-05", "News": "Supported byBURNS, Ore. \u2014 They used to call it Bundyville, a dot of the arid Wild West where in 1916, a Mormon pioneer named Abraham Bundy staked out a homestead in a sea of northern Arizona sagebrush. Settlers caught rainwater in tanks and grazed their livestock across public land that had yet to be brought under government control.That place is mostly a ghost town today, gradually abandoned after the nation set up a system of grazing permits and regulations to curb voracious overgrazing on public lands. But shards of Bundyville have stuck with the branch of the family that made its way to Nevada, where they set up a cattle ranch and became the face of unyielding, armed protest over how Washington manages Western lands.And now in many ways, a little piece of Bundyville has re-emerged here in east-central Oregon, in the temper and tone of a Bundy-family led crew of armed, antigovernment acolytes who are occupying a federal wildlife reserve, calling for Washington to hand control of federal lands to ranchers and local governments, and seeking to unwind a century of policy that has shaped the West. The rural economy has stuttered and stumbled in recent years in places like Burns and surrounding Harney County, and the Bundys say it is because of the government. They want to roll it back.\u201cIt is our goal to get the logger back to logging, to get the rancher back to ranching, to get the miner back to mining, the farmer back to farming \u2014 and to jump-start this economy in Harney County,\u201d Ammon Bundy, the leader of the occupation group here at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, about a five-hour drive from Portland, said at a news conference Tuesday.In 2014, a yearslong dispute between Mr. Bundy\u2019s father, Cliven, and federal officials over his illegal grazing on public lands erupted into a tense, armed confrontation. And Ammon Bundy, his brother Ryan and his followers \u2014 who are now in their fourth day of protest at the federally owned sanctuary \u2014 echo the terms and tenets of that conflict: who controls the land in the West.Ammon Bundy, a bearded, soft-spoken man, is treated with deference by his followers, many of whom have their own causes in addition to his. They include Jon Ritzheimer, who is perhaps better known as an organizer of anti-Islam rallies in Arizona, and who regularly sits behind the wheel of a truck blocking the road to the refuge buildings. Ryan Payne, an Army veteran from Montana, volunteered at the Bundy ranch in Nevada during the confrontation there last year, and was part of the armed crew that seized the refuge on Saturday. He said the occupiers in Burns had been galvanized by the case of two local ranchers who were sentenced to serve additional time in prison after being convicted of burning federal lands near their property.\u201cThe idea is power: Land is power,\u201d Mr. Payne said in a phone interview. \u201cThe federal government unconstitutionally laid claim to land within the United States.\u201dA small group of armed protesters have seized parts of a wildlife sanctuary \u2014 putting a rural Oregon county in the spotlight.Not everyone here is supporting that.\u201cIt\u2019s totally against the law,\u201d said Trent Tiller, the owner of a downtown carpet and flooring store and a lifelong resident of Burns.He said he hoped law enforcement would take action, but feared it, too. \u201cI\u2019d hate to see a situation where things got outrageous and turned into a shooting match,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d line up on the law enforcement side.\u201dThe participants surrounding Mr. Bundy appear to have in common a reverence for the United States Constitution, which many quote from at length or brandish in paper form from a pocket to cite. But after that, their paths diverge into a tangle of other causes, beliefs and motivations, with some more focused on personal liberty, others wanting to talk about economic harm to the agricultural heritage or tradition of the West \u2014 which they say comes from government overreach in control of natural resources like the grass that grows on public lands.Almost all men, they have taken jobs scanning the terrain from a watchtower, serving as guards, preparing food and flanking Mr. Bundy at his appearances before the cameras.There is one woman who has been front and center: Shawna Cox, who has answered reporters\u2019 calls and read statements before the cameras, also supported the Bundy family during last year\u2019s protests in Nevada. She befriended Cliven Bundy and wrote an admiring book about him, \u201cLast Rancher Standing.\u201d When the Oregon dispute boiled up, she left her family in southern Utah and joined up again.\u201cI\u2019m just a mom, a grandma,\u201d she said in a telephone interview. \u201cAmerican. I bleed red.\u201dAnother participant who has emerged as a kind of spokesman is LaVoy Finicum, a 55-year-old rancher from Arizona, who talks in fond terms about the grass at his arid ranch that is greener than it has been in years from lots of recent rain. \u201cI\u2019m just a simple rancher,\u201d he said.But Mr. Finicum \u2014 always in earmuffs and cowboy hat \u2014 then expounded at articulate length on obscure sections of the Constitution that he said the federal government had violated here by taking private land into federal control without the approval of the Oregon State Legislature.A willingness to step out to the edge \u2014 of confrontation or controversy \u2014 is one quality that unites the group.Mr. Ritzheimer, for example, drew attention to himself not long after the murderous attack on the satirical French publication Charlie Hebdo last year, after it published a drawing of the Prophet Muhammad. He organized a \u201cDraw Muhammad\u201d cartoon contest of his own in Phoenix.While Ammon Bundy and his inner circle have vowed to stay put until they are satisfied, other protesters may have their limits. Michael Stettler, 49, an electrician who lives about two hours away, drove over with his rifle and his dog, Wolffie, and joined with the protest group.

{"Headline": "For Republicans, Mounting Fears of Lasting Split", "Date": "2016-01-09", "News": "Supported byAt family dinners and New Year\u2019s parties, in conference calls and at private lunches, longtime Republicans are expressing a growing fear that the coming election could be shattering for the party, or reshape it in ways that leave it unrecognizable.While warring party factions usually reconcile after brutal nomination fights, this race feels different, according to interviews with more than 50 Republican leaders, activists, donors and voters, from both elite circles and the grass roots.Never have so many voters been attracted to Republican candidates like Donald J. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who are challenging core party beliefs on the economy and national security and new goals like winning over Hispanics through immigration reform.Rank-and-file conservatives, after decades of deferring to party elites, are trying to stage what is effectively a people\u2019s coup by selecting a standard-bearer who is not the preferred candidate of wealthy donors and elected officials.And many of those traditional power brokers, in turn, are deeply uncomfortable and even hostile to Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz: Between them, the leading candidates do not have the backing of a single senator or governor.\u201cI haven\u2019t seen this large of a division in my career,\u201d said Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican first elected to Congress in 1982. \u201cYou probably have to go back to Ford versus Reagan in 1976. But that was only two people.\u201dThe issues animating grass-roots voters \u2014 opposition to immigration, worries about wages and discomfort with America\u2019s fast-changing demographics \u2014 are diverging from and at times colliding with the Republican establishment\u2019s interests in free trade, lower taxes, less regulation and openness to immigration.The fractures could help a Democrat win the White House if Republicans do not ultimately find ways to unite, as one candidate, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, warned last week.The divide was evident at a recent Greenville, S.C., gathering of bankers and lawyers, reliable Republicans who shared tea and pastries and their growing anxieties about where their party is going. In a meeting room near the wooded shore of Furman Lake, the group of mostly older white men expressed concern that their party was fracturing over free trade, immigration and Wall Street. And they worried that their candidates \u2014 mainstream conservatives like Jeb Bush \u2014 were losing.\u201cIt\u2019s all really hard to believe that decades of Republican ideas are at risk,\u201d said Barry Wynn, a prominent Bush donor at the meeting.\u201cThe Republican Party has never done anything for the working man like me, even though we\u2019ve voted Republican for years,\u201d said Leo Martin, a 62-year-old machinist from Newport, N.H., who attended Mr. Trump\u2019s Claremont rally. \u201cThis election is the first in my life where we can change what it means to be a Republican.\u201dThis anger has transformed the quadrennial exercise of picking a Republican nominee into a referendum on the future of one of the country\u2019s two enduring political parties. Patrick J. Buchanan, a Nixon and Reagan adviser who ran for the Republican nomination in 1992 and 1996 by stressing the economic and cultural concerns of working-class Americans, said these voters were roiling the party because they had \u201csuffered long enough.\u201dMr. Buchanan cited years of job losses and wage stagnation that he blamed on free-trade deals and cheap labor from illegal immigrants, as well as hardships from foreign wars that have hit families whose children enlisted in hopes of better lives.\u201cThe chickens have come home to roost,\u201d Mr. Buchanan said. \u201cPutting the party back together again will be very hard after this nomination race. I think the party is going to shift against trade and interventionism, and become more nationalist and tribal and more about protecting the border.\u201dAnger and alienation have been simmering in Republican ranks since the end of the George W. Bush administration, at first over policy and then more acutely over how the party should respond to the country\u2019s changing demography.While party leaders like Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina say Republicans are in a \u201cdemographic death spiral\u201d and will not survive unless they start appealing to Hispanics and young people, many voters see such statements as a capitulation. They hunger for an unapologetic brand of conservatism that would confront rather than acquiesce to the political establishment \u2014 sentiments that have been amplified by conservative talk radio hosts like Rush Limbaugh and commentators like Ann Coulter, whose verbal broadsides influence the party\u2019s agenda.If party leaders backed Mr. Trump, they would have to conduct campaigns in parallel universes, supporting a candidate who has said he wants to deport illegal immigrants en masse and temporarily bar Muslims from the country, while simultaneously trying to diversify their predominantly white male base.Republican congressional leaders last week asked Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina, the daughter of Indian immigrants, to deliver the party\u2019s response to the State of the Union speech this week, and invited King Abdullah II of Jordan, perhaps America\u2019s closest ally in the Arab world, to address a joint session of Congress.\u201cI know Republicans who will support Hillary if Trump or Cruz is the nominee, no question,\u201d Dick Thornburgh, an attorney general under President George Bush and a former Pennsylvania governor, said of Hillary Clinton. \u201cTrump, especially, would split the party. But many will fall in line, seeing no choice.\u201dMr. McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, and Mr. Graham, who was a presidential candidate until last month, said they would honor the will of the voters and support any eventual nominee. But Mr. Graham said the severity and impact of the party split would ultimately depend on whether a Republican won the presidency.\u201cIf Trump or Cruz wins the White House, then my side of the party has to re-evaluate who we are, what we stand for, and I\u2019d be willing to do that,\u201d Mr. Graham said. \u201cBut if Trump or Cruz loses the presidency, would their supporters re-evaluate their views on immigration and other issues that would grow the party? If they do that, we can come back together. If they don\u2019t, the party probably splits in a permanent way.\u201dOther Republicans said they believed that Mr. Cruz, if he won the nomination, would be similar to the archconservative Barry Goldwater, who was nominated in 1964, and that the party would survive the experience.The presidential historian Richard Norton Smith, who has written biographies of some of the 20th century\u2019s leading Republicans, said a nomination of Mr. Trump would represent \u201ca hostile takeover\u201d of the party, and make it more difficult for old-guard party leaders to suppress the passions of a more hard-core, anti-immigration, angry base.\u201cThe nativists aren\u2019t going away,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cThey might, if anything, become more feverish.\u201dSome political leaders, eyeing the Republican split, are sensing opportunity.Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire media executive and former New York mayor, was intrigued enough by the prospect of Mr. Trump\u2019s becoming the Republican standard-bearer that he commissioned a poll last month testing how he would fare against Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton, according to two sources close to Mr. Bloomberg. But he has often very publicly flirted with a run, savored the attention, then announced that he would not pursue the candidacy.Whatever Mr. Bloomberg decides, the election so far has been upended by voters who live far from his world and, for the first time in years, feel as if their voices are being heard. Dave Conger, 60, a salesman who showed up at a Cruz campaign stop last week with a Cruz pin on his chest, said he had worked to elect both President George W. Bush and his father, but \u201cwas told a lot of things and nothing ever happened.\u201dHe added, \u201cThis time I\u2019m actually hearing somebody who\u2019s telling me the truth; they\u2019re actually going to go in and do something they say they\u2019re going to do.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tumult in World Markets Damps Conviction at Davos", "Date": "2016-01-25", "News": "Supported byDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 The World Economic Forum has long been a citadel for corporate chieftains and government officials to bask in their collective stature, coming together to chat about what they can do as leaders about the world\u2019s troubles.Yet this year\u2019s gathering in the Swiss Alps, which ended Saturday, was marked by a bit more anxiety than usual.And just 27 percent of those C.E.O.s said they believed the overall global economy would grow this year, compared to 37 percent last year.Why the grim outlook? Any number of reasons hung in the crisp mountain air.Global events beyond the control of the World Economic Forum certainly played a role. The continuing depression in oil prices took the wind out of the sails of attendees from the Middle East and Russia whose swagger during previous forums was underpinned by the strength of their oil-based economies.\u201cIf you look at the figures, our economy will not look like anything good this coming year,\u201d Vladimir A. Dmitriev, the chairman of Russia\u2019s Vnesheconombank, sighed during a panel on the outlook for Russia.For others, the sharp swings in the markets took a toll. One financier who attended said that his optimism fluctuated with the vicissitudes of the market, particularly after the sharp plunge Wednesday as the forum began. The markets then rebounded on Thursday and Friday.Yet others appeared anxious over the very disruption that lay at the heart of the theme of this year\u2019s World Economic Forum, the \u201cFourth Industrial Revolution.\u201d It was a formulation aimed at describing the rise of new digital technologies that have been upsetting incumbents in a variety of industries.Several of those being disrupted seemed to be struggling to find their balance, even at a conference seemingly built to assure them of their importance. On a panel titled \u201cFuture-Proofing Global Finance,\u201d Bank of America\u2019s chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, repeatedly both defended the importance of traditional banks and encouraged tougher regulation of the new financial technologies that have begun to eat into his business.Mr. Moynihan emphasized that Bank of America spent billions of dollars developing its technologies. He also highlighted what he described as the proved stability of the traditional bank payment infrastructure, as traditional players spend millions on digital security. Mobile payment systems in Africa \u2014 which have essentially taken the place of traditional banks and payments systems there \u2014 might be less rock-solid, he suggested.Imagine, he argued, if people couldn\u2019t make payments for an hour, hinting at the chaos that might follow such an outage.\u201cThe payments side is critical,\u201d Mr. Moynihan said.Both he and William T. Winters, the former JPMorgan Chase executive who now leads the British bank Standard Chartered, also argued that new entrants to the finance sector should be subject to more regulation. For both banking chiefs, it was a matter of protecting consumers \u2014 in the service of what they called \u201ca level playing field.\u201d\u201cPayment systems have to be regulated,\u201d Mr. Winters said on the finance panel. \u201cThey need to be observed.\u201dOf course, not all in attendance espoused such glum outlooks.in an interview, Robert F. Smith, the chairman and chief executive of the tech-focused private equity firm Vista Equity Partners, openly embraced new technologies, promoting the possibilities that digital systems could bring to sleepy industries like car insurance.Automation and data analytics, he explained, could greatly lower the costs of car repairs for customers, insurers and auto repair shops by eliminating the waste of paper systems and duplicative data entry.Still others evinced little sign of discomfort with the winds of change. Stephen A. Schwarzman, the Blackstone Group\u2019s chairman and chief executive, happily lauded the relative stability of his own industry during the finance panel.\u201cWe\u2019re not disrupters,\u201d he cracked. \u201cWe\u2019re just lovable, friendly investors.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Argentina and Aramco Are Deals for Difficult Times", "Date": "2016-01-26", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsTwo big deals dominated the agenda in Davos, Switzerland, last week: Argentina\u2019s negotiations with holdout creditors and Saudi Arabia\u2019s potential sale of a piece of its national energy leviathan, Saudi Aramco.One would open up a robust democracy to global markets after years of feckless governance and isolation. The other would help a repressive regime retain its grip. That both would arguably leave the world better off underlines its fragile state.The plutocrats assembled in Davos at the World Economic Forum, which concluded on Saturday, spent most of their time reassuring each other that sliding stock markets represent no threat to their prosperity similar to the 2008 financial crisis. When their discussions ventured further afield \u2013 and beyond the surging poll numbers of Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidential bid \u2014 Argentina and Saudi Arabia were front and center. They represent starkly divergent developments that, while not suggestive of crisis at the doorstep, showcase the tenuous nature of global stability.Argentina\u2019s return to the economic mainstream is the happier of the two. The newly elected president, Mauricio Macri, hopes to reach a settlement with creditors led by Elliott Management who went unpaid when his predecessors defaulted. Though Mr. Macri said he had not met with Elliott\u2019s leader, Paul Singer, his delegation of cabinet members, including his finance minister and a former JPMorgan banker, Alfonso Prat-Gay, and even the leader of the opposition party, charmed the pants off the international bankers and world leaders in attendance.In addition, the Argentines used their Swiss visit to meet with bank chief executives to lay the groundwork for expanding the country\u2019s dollar reserves. By lending money to the central bank in return for as-yet-to-be-determined collateral \u2013 via a so-called repo operation \u2013 financial institutions can help bring Argentina back to the markets. That presumably entails support from the International Monetary Fund, with whom Mr. Macri and his entourage also tangoed in Davos.As Mr. Macri made a point of noting, that will benefit everyone. In an interview with Reuters, he boasted that Argentina\u2019s agricultural industry could feed 600 million people \u2013 but only if it could reach them.\u201cFor that we need infrastructure. We need roads, ports \u2014 for that we need financing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are near,\u201d he continued, to having \u201cthe worst logistics in Latin America. That\u2019s a great opportunity also for companies and investors.\u201dMr. Macri\u2019s performance should increase external pressure on the hedge fund holdouts headed by Elliott to accept any offer that looks objectively reasonable. Mr. Singer has a strong track record of holding fast to his legal convictions, but does he really want to be known as the man who deprived the world\u2019s hunger of prime Argentine beef?Contrast Argentina with the other big deal floating around Davos: a stock offering from the national petroleum company of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Bankers on Wall Street and in the City of London were feverishly preparing underwriting proposals last week for the share sale, which would probably be limited to a downstream division of Aramco to avoid shining the full spotlight of transparency on the parent\u2019s books and vast oil reserves.Top executives from banks working on the pitches professed little alacrity about the deal, for reasons that are both selfish and moral. On the first point, though an initial public offering of Aramco could be the biggest equity deal in history, the fees will be negligible. The last big Saudi Arabian I.P.O., a $6 billion offering for National Commercial Bank in November 2014, paid underwriting commissions of below 0.1 percent. By contrast, the Chinese e-commerce group Alibaba paid 12 times as much to the banks that took it public in a $25 billion deal two years ago.That might be tolerable to the banks if the deal were of a more philosophically palatable character, along the lines of, say, restoring Argentina\u2019s access to credit. Saudi Arabia last year summarily executed more than 150 people, the most in two decades, according to Amnesty International. Notwithstanding Deputy Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman\u2019s talk of transparency, the offering has to be seen as part of the Al Saud dynasty\u2019s coping mechanism for sliding oil prices and the damage this is doing to the finances of the kingdom.In an Aramco I.P.O., there\u2019s no money to be made and no pathway to moral redemption. So why participate? Though the idea of financing a regime that kicked off this year with 47 beheadings is troubling, the alternative would be worse for global stability: a chaotic, Libya-style breakdown.It\u2019s na\u00efve to think that financiers alone have the power to prevent Saudi Arabia from spreading geopolitical anxiety or to turn Argentina into a trustworthy, developed market. But given the delicate state of the global economy, World Economic Forum bankers should give it their best shot.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s Payback Time for Women", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "Supported byStill, it couldn\u2019t happen here. Or could it? Over the past few years, a case for the U.B.I. has emerged that could make it appealing not just to the poor, who don\u2019t vote in great numbers, but to women, who do.The feminist argument for a U.B.I. is that it\u2019s a way to reimburse mothers and other caregivers for the heavy lifting they now do free of charge. Roughly one-fifth of Americans have children 18 or under. Many also attend to ill or elderly relatives. They perform these labors out of love or a sense of duty, but still, at some point during the diaper-changing or bedpan cleaning, they have to wonder why their efforts aren\u2019t seen as \u201cwork.\u201d They may even ask why they have to pay for the privilege of doing it, by cutting back on their hours or quitting jobs to stay home.Disproportionately, of course, these caregivers are women. Notwithstanding the advent of the stay-at-home dad, it\u2019s still mothers who do most of the invisible labor of cleaning, schlepping, scheduling and listening.To the extent that mainstream feminism has paid attention to pocketbook issues over the past few decades, it has focused on the workplace: the wage gap, absence of family leave and weak \u201cinfrastructure of care,\u201d to use Anne-Marie Slaughter\u2019s phrase. These family-unfriendly facts of life on the job do yank success further out of the reach of women who combine career and children. But the problem is not that employers hate women and children. It\u2019s that they make a common assumption about motherhood: It\u2019s a lifestyle choice, not a wage-worthy job, and no one other than parents should pay for it. Wages for child rearing and housework? When one feminist collective took up that cry in the 1970s, it was more or less drummed out of the second-wave feminist movement, which aimed to get women into the work force, not pay them to stay out of it.If mothers are glorified hobbyists who produce less value than nonmothers, it follows that they\u2019re getting a free ride on everyone else\u2019s labor. This can lead to tensions between colleagues, and also colors relations between breadwinning husbands and stay-at-home wives, who notoriously have less bargaining power in their households.I\u2019d argue that this view of motherhood gets it exactly backward. Actually, it\u2019s society that\u2019s getting a free ride on women\u2019s unrewarded contributions to the perpetuation of the human race. As Marx might have said had he deemed women\u2019s work worth including in his labor theory of value (he didn\u2019t), \u201creproductive labor\u201d (as feminists call the creation and upkeep of families and homes) is the basis of the accumulation of human capital. I say it\u2019s time for something like reparations.It\u2019s an odd kind of reparations, you may object, that goes to fathers as well as mothers, the unattached as well as those with family responsibilities. But entertain this radical proposition: The universal basic income is a necessary condition for a just society, for it recognizes the fact that most of us \u2014 men, women, parents and nonparents \u2014 do a great deal of unpaid work to sustain the general well-being. If we\u2019re not raising children, then we may be going to school, or volunteering around the neighborhood.Politically, the U.B.I. looks a lot more plausible than a subsidy aimed only at mothers, because, as Social Security and Medicare make clear, policies have more staying power when perceived as general entitlements rather than free cash for free riders. Critics on the right would dismiss a mothers\u2019 annuity as a handout to welfare queens. Critics on the left might see it as enshrining traditional gender norms. A universal basic income would sidestep both of these objections.I do not want to create the impression that feminists dominate this debate. On the contrary: They\u2019re an overlooked part of a much larger conversation that has been going on for centuries.In 1797, Thomas Paine declared that nations should give every 21-year-old a lump sum because those who inherit land have an unfair advantage over those who don\u2019t. By the middle of the last century, economists and leaders on both sides of the political spectrum were proposing minimum incomes.THIS is all very nice, skeptics say, but the U.B.I. still represents a moral hazard. Give people money for nothing, and the lazy will grow lazier and the rest of us will be bankrupted.But that does not appear to be the case. On the contrary: The U.B.I. gives workers less reason to loll about at home than do perversely disincentivizing policies like the one whereby a dollar earned is a dollar cut from a welfare check. Research suggests that, rather than weaken the will to work, unconditional regular disbursements let people manage their careers more wisely.In five famous studies on the negative income tax conducted in the United States and Canada in the 1970s, a minimum income did bring down work hours a bit, partly because the unemployed took longer to find new jobs. Researchers speculate that they were holding out for positions that better matched their skills. In the United States, male breadwinners scaled back by as much as 9 percent a year. In Canada, they hardly cut back at all. In both countries, teenagers stayed in school longer. And women with children did spend up to 30 percent less time on the job.The U.B.I. has feminist critics as well as supporters, and they don\u2019t like that finding. The U.B.I. would encourage women to drop out of the work force, they say, ceding the ground feminism has fought so hard for. But that concern strikes me as, well, paternalistic. Women should have more choices, not fewer. So should men. Equality between the sexes should not require everyone to conform to traditionally male patterns of employment.Besides, basic income policies have been shown to mitigate specifically female kinds of poverty.When cash-transfer experiments were conducted in poor towns in India, girls gained more weight and increased the time they spent at school at greater rates than boys, probably because when cash is scarce, the girls get less to eat and are kept home more.In the United States, as Kathryn J. Edin and H. Luke Shaefer showed in their book on extreme poverty, \u201c$2.00 a Day,\u201d the process of qualifying for food stamps and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, the welfare-to-work program created in 1996, can be so demanding, bewildering and degrading that many applicants simply give up. And who are the patient souls who wait in those daylong lines, pee into cups for drug tests or go home empty-handed? Women, more often than not, since there are more than four times as many families run by single mothers as by single fathers, and a third more households headed by women are on the dole than those run by men.As for stay-at-home mothers supported by their partners, a basic income would let them put aside money of their own. Most retirement-savings instruments are linked to paychecks, which means that so-called nonworking parents have no way to pay into Social Security, 401(k)\u2019s or I.R.A.s. A basic income would let them save for old age. For nonwage-earning mothers trapped in abusive relationships, cash would make it easier for them to leave.The price tag for these cash transfers would be partly offset by savings. Most anti-poverty programs would become redundant. Bureaucracies tasked with weeding out cheaters would melt away (though, unfortunately, so would the jobs devoted to weeding). The better-off would pay back parts of their grants in taxes in proportion to their earned income. Moreover, a basic income would reduce the ill effects of poverty and therefore the cost to society of bad public health, crime and incarceration. Basic-income experiments have shown that recipients make greater use of medical services and break the law less often than nonrecipients. And then there\u2019s the boost to the economy that would result from poor people with cash in hand buying more goods.Some of the many strategies proposed for raising the rest of the money include a relatively high flat tax; the closing of tax loopholes; a value-added tax; the elimination of middle-class entitlements such as the mortgage-interest deduction and retirement benefits; a careful paring back of Social Security; a tax on speculative financial transactions; and a carbon tax. We could also remit money reaped from the exploitation of public resources. Alaska, which already pays its citizens something very like a basic income, sends every adult and child a varying annual dividend of around $2,000 from a fund that invests royalties paid to the state by oil and natural gas producers.The truth, though, is that the U.B.I. is \u2014 yes \u2014 a form of redistribution. We\u2019ll be able to afford it only when we decide it\u2019s worth affording. But that\u2019s just what we ought to decide. We should cut back on military spending if we have to, or raise taxes on the rich. The political will for such a huge restructuring of our economy would require a fundamental reassessment of the relationship between the state and the people. Maybe, like Thomas Paine, we\u2019d start to think of these wealth transfers as a right of citizenship instead of an insurance policy against financial disaster.Even if we started small to get people used to the idea by offering way-below-poverty-level sums ($6,000, say), these would still buoy American families struggling not to slip underwater.The U.B.I. would also edge us toward a more gender-equal world. The extra cash would make it easier for a dad to become the primary caregiver if he wanted to. A mom with a job could write checks for child care and keep her earnings, too. Stay-at-home parents would have money in the bank, more clout in the family, and the respect that comes from undertaking an enterprise with measurable value. And we\u2019d have established the principle that the work of love is not priceless at all, but worth paying for.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Auto Industry Sales Explode in an Ever-Changing Market", "Date": "2015-12-31", "News": "Supported byWheelsDETROIT \u2014 Automakers have enjoyed an unequaled run of success in the United States because of pent-up consumer demand, cheap gas prices and low interest rates. But despite record sales, manufacturers must continue updating their vehicles and improving technology to keep the good times rolling.As the auto industry tallies its final numbers for 2015, it appears certain that annual sales in the United States will eclipse the previous record of 17.4 million set in 2000. Yet while the industry basks in its accomplishment of returning to sales levels not seen since before the most recent recession, the market looks far different today than it did 15 years ago.That dominance has slipped considerably. While overall sales cannot be calculated until December totals are released next week, the Detroit companies, through November, controlled just 45 percent of the market.And as Detroit\u2019s muscle has weakened, foreign brands have surged. The big three Japanese carmakers \u2014 Toyota, Honda and Nissan \u2014 have all gained significant market share. New competitors like the Korean companies Hyundai and Kia are making solid gains. Even smaller niche brands like Subaru and BMW are steadily growing.Industry analysts said the significant evolution of the market had benefited consumers, who now have a broader array of choices from a bigger variety of manufacturers.\u201cIt\u2019s a vastly different landscape today, almost night and day from 2000, when Detroit\u2019s Big Three was dominant in most segments,\u201d said Jack Nerad, a senior analyst with the car research service Kelley Blue Book.A big part of the change can be attributed to the sharp downsizing of the American companies because of financial pressures that prompted them to cut back on United States production, employment and model lineups.United States automakers have emerged from their worst crisis in a generation, but they have lost much along the way.Since the last record year in 2000, the Detroit companies have shed brands that were losing money and whatever cachet they had in the marketplace. The roster of defunct brands is extensive, and includes once-popular nameplates like Oldsmobile, Pontiac, Saturn, Hummer, Mercury and Plymouth.Ford, for example, had to sell off some its most prestigious foreign brands, including Volvo, Jaguar and Land Rover, to stay afloat financially. But rather than disappear completely, the brands have enjoyed revivals under new ownership.\u201cThe industry is less U.S.-centric than it was 15 years ago,\u201d Mr. Nerad said. \u201cBut the amazing thing is that struggling brands like Jaguar and Land Rover are now thriving under the corporate umbrellas of new players like Tata Motors of India.\u201dMeanwhile, G.M. and Ford have diversified geographically and now count China as a prime growth market. At the same time, their leaner operations in the United States have become solidly profitable because of steadily improving consumer demand.Still, the American auto companies remain reliant on large vehicles, particularly pickup trucks, to deliver big profits. Ford\u2019s earnings, for example, slipped until the company was able to achieve full production of its revamped, aluminum-body F-Series pickups.And although overall industry sales soared when gas prices dipped as low as $2 a gallon, automakers are feverishly developing lower-mileage vehicles \u2014 particularly new hybrid and electric models \u2014 in anticipation of higher fuel costs and more stringent government regulations.The composition of the vehicles in American showrooms has also changed. Where once midsize sedans were the biggest-selling segment, those traditional cars have been replaced by so-called crossover models that marry the fuel economy and size of a passenger car with the interior space and utility of an S.U.V.The research firm Experian Automotive calculates that crossovers account for nearly 24 percent of the entire American market \u2014 more than double what the segment was responsible for a decade ago.\u201cThe crossover utility segment provides consumers with a nice balance between utilitarian need and fuel economy,\u201d said Brad Smith, an Experian analyst.Compact crossovers like the Honda CR-V, the Ford Escape and the Toyota RAV4 have leapfrogged the older, bigger sport-utility vehicles to become top sellers in the entire S.U.V. segment.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how the segment has soared,\u201d said Jeff Conrad, a senior executive at Honda\u2019s American division. \u201cNobody expected it to grow like this, but we sure don\u2019t see any clouds on the horizon.\u201dMr. Nerad said the crossover segment had benefited from becoming homogeneous, so consumers have a wide array of choices that all offer good mileage, carlike ride and handling, and the latest in technology like navigation systems and Internet connectivity.Consumers say they switched out of passenger cars because of the higher stance of crossovers and the convenience of additional storage capacity.\u201cI\u2019ve had sedans, but this fits my comfort level,\u201d said Mary Willis, a South Carolina resident who leases a CR-V. \u201cIt\u2019s comfortable and easy to drive, and for anything bigger than a breadbox, it works better for groceries.\u201dOne small-business owner, Dana Castillo, of Fenton, Mich., traded in her Cadillac sedan for a fuel-sipping Hyundai Santa Fe crossover that better accommodates her family\u2019s needs. \u201cI love luxury cars, but my kids and I just outgrew it,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a growing teenage son who plays football, and he needs space for his equipment.\u201dOlder drivers sing the praises of crossovers that not only fit their lifestyle, but provide more comfort than a car. \u201cI\u2019ve got a little arthritis in my knees and this vehicle is easier to get in and out of,\u201d said Bobby Adams, a 66-year-old resident of Michigan.Automakers are expanding their crossover lineups for 2016. G.M., for example, will import a small Chinese-made Buick S.U.V. into the United States specifically for consumers clamoring for new crossovers.Over all, the car companies are downsizing many of their models as part of a larger effort to meet new fuel-economy regulations that are coming down the road. Federal rules require that all companies have fleetwide vehicle averages of 54.5 miles per gallon by the year 2025.Early in 2015, the rush of new-vehicle sales began early because of pent-up demand, gained momentum from low gas prices, and accelerated in a flurry of holiday discounts and incentives.The roaring vehicle sales may not last long, though. Mr. Nerad notes that United States sales have been growing incrementally for the last seven years and says it is unlikely the trend can continue unabated.He said that an expected series of interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve could chill the trend of cheap leases that carmakers have partly relied on to lift sales. Also, the demand curve could flatten out as consumers pull back from the red-hot pace of replacing older models.Still, auto executives cannot help but revel in the strong finish to sales in 2015. \u201cIf you\u2019re not having fun in the car business now, then it\u2019s time to get out,\u201d said Bob Carter, an executive in Toyota\u2019s United States operations. \u201cIt\u2019s never been better.\u201dMary M.

{"Headline": "Roche Leads a $175 Million Investment in Flatiron Health", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Even with some recent wobbles in the start-up world, big sums are continuing to roll into technology start-ups.Just a few days into 2016, Flatiron Health, a start-up that gathers and analyzes data on cancer treatments and sells software based on those insights, said it had raised $175 million in a funding round led by the pharmaceutical giant Roche. Flatiron declined to disclose its valuation.As part of the deal, Flatiron gets more than money. Roche will buy several of Flatiron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s software products, which are based on subscriptions, in a move that is set to expand the start-up\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stream of recurring revenue and better position it for a future initial public offering. The partnership between the two companies is nonexclusive, and Flatiron can continue to work with other pharmaceutical companies.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe plan to go public in two to three years,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nat Turner, Flatiron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief executive and co-founder, said in an interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo do so, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to meet certain financial metrics, and this investment sets us up to do that.\u00e2\u0080\u009dLike many other big pharmaceutical companies, Roche is dealing with threats to its core business from generic-drug makers on the low end. It is also facing a shift in the health care payment system, in which insurers are paying more for treatments when they have been shown to be effective. Roche, a major player in the oncology market, said it would use Flatiron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data to bring new drugs to market faster, keeping its drug pipeline full of innovative new treatments for which it can charge a premium. Generic versions of those drugs will not be available for several years. It will also use Flatiron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data to better match patients with the treatments that will be most effective.\u00e2\u0080\u009cFlatiron has tremendous data that helps us understand how medicine reacts in patients,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Daniel O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Day, the chief operating officer at Roche. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a long-term strategic investment, and the strategic collaboration benefits us. The value in the investment is not to generate a financial return.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Turner said Flatiron was weeks away from finalizing its funding round in November when Roche said it was interested in investing in the company that he founded with Zach Weinberg in 2012. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was clear that Roche would be a great partner and bring brand value to Flatiron,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Turner said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe wrapped up the deal in about a month.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Turner and Mr. Weinberg founded Flatiron with the aim of organizing the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cancer data and making it easy to analyze. The hope was that cancer centers, pharmaceutical companies and other health care professionals could create treatments faster and pair patients with more effective regimens when armed with information about how drugs performed in the real world. The company has about 250 employees and has its headquarters in New York City.Flatiron\u2019s two founders had previously started an advertising technology company called Invite Media, which they sold to Google in 2010. They became interested in health care and oncology after watching several family members and friends battle cancer.Flatiron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growth has tracked the rising interest among health care players in personalized medicine, a practice that tailors treatments to individuals. The aim is that personalized medicine will improve patient outcomes more quickly and help reduce health care costs in the United States, which now account for a significant percentage of the economy. President Obama said in last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s State of the Union address that the health care industry should invest more in personalized medicine, and venture capital investors and entrepreneurs have flooded the space.According to the National Venture Capital Association, investment in health care services more than doubled in 2015 to $720 million, and rose 60 percent in 2014 to $345 million.Other investors in Flatiron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s latest round include Allen & Company, the Scottish investment firm Baillie Gifford and the health-care-focused investment firm Casdin Capital. Previous investors include GV, formerly known as Google Ventures, and First Round Capital. Mr. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Day will join Flatiron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s board, and the start-up will use the money to improve its products. Flatiron has a raised a total of $313 million.FollowAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oil Prices Slide Again, and the Bottom Is Not Yet in Sight", "Date": "2016-01-11", "News": "Supported byLast year a broad reassessment occurred in commodities, as the global economy slowed and demand from emerging markets like China, India and Brazil waned. The slump in oil prices picked up momentum last week on renewed concerns about the health of China\u2019s economy, which led to a rout in global markets.\u201cEvery signal that the market is getting now suggests that we are going to continue to have an oil glut for some time to come,\u201d said Jason Bordoff, director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. \u201cIran is about to re-enter the market, demand numbers and economic indicators look relatively weak, U.S. supply is holding up in a low-price environment much better than people thought and global inventories are growing.\u201dOver the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.In that situation, he said, even geopolitical tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which generally would have frightened energy markets, have not had an impact on the markets\u2019 perception of risk. In fact, the sharp increase in tensions between the regional powers makes it less likely they will agree to stabilize oil markets in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. \u201cIn that world, there is almost every indication that you want to be bearish,\u201d Mr. Bordoff said.Many analysts expect more declines before prices recover. Goldman Sachs, which had predicted that oil might reach $200 a barrel during a \u201csuper-spike\u201d before the 2008 financial crisis, forecast last year that prices might drop as low as $20 a barrel in the current downward cycle.Morgan Stanley also argued on Monday that $20 oil was possible if the United States dollar made rapid gains. Analysts at Barclays cut their outlook for oil and copper prices. They still predicted oil would rebound in the second half of 2016, but set an average price of $37 a barrel this year, down from previous forecasts of $56 to $60.\u201cRecent price declines for major commodities are now greater than in any crisis of the past 30 years and speculative positioning much more negative than it was even in the depths of the financial crisis,\u201d according to a research note by Barclays. \u201cThat suggests that although the price outlook is weaker than it was previously, the road ahead could be a very bumpy one.\u201dAt the same time, the drop in oil is pushing down prices at the gas pump. The average retail price fell to $1.96 a gallon, according to the AAA motor club, down from $2.14 a gallon a year ago.Oil\u2019s decline in the last year was caused in part by the decision by Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s biggest producer, not to reduce production. This fundamental change in oil market discipline was meant to force out high-cost energy producers, particularly shale producers in the United States, by driving down prices.But the decision backfired on Saudi Arabia and other producers, which are now confronting a much higher burden of financing their oil-dependent economies.Among a raft of new economic measures, the Saudi government is considering selling its energy assets. Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil company, confirmed last week that it was studying selling shares to the public in its upstream business or its refining and petrochemical companies.Separately, coal mining companies have been struggling as demand declines. The drop in energy prices and stricter environmental regulations have made natural gas a much more attractive competitor to coal in the United States.The company said it expected its mining operations and shipments to continue. It said it had an agreement with more than 40 percent of its first-lien lenders for its debt-cutting plan and enough cash to run operations through the process.John W. Eaves, the company\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement that a court-supervised process was the best way to strengthen its balance sheet.\u201cWith oil prices collapsing, renewables on the rise and coal companies going bankrupt, we are at a key inflection point in the energy transition,\u201d said Michael Webber, deputy director of the Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cInflection points produce a lot of uncertainty and volatility for investors.\u201dClifford Krauss and Andrew E. Kramer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Confronts Americans\u2019 Fears in State of the Union Speech", "Date": "2016-01-12", "News": "Supported byMr. Obama delivered his final State of the Union address.WASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama on Tuesday set forth an ambitious vision for America\u2019s future but conceded his own failure to heal the political divisions holding back progress, calling it a lasting disappointment of his tenure.But Mr. Obama, who campaigned for president on promises of hope and change, and vowed when he took office to transform Washington and politics itself, accepted responsibility for falling far short of that goal.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the few regrets of my presidency, that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better,\u201d Mr. Obama said, adding that \u201ca president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide.\u201dHe acknowledged that many Americans feel frightened and shut out of a political and economic system they view as rigged against their interests, even as he offered an implicit rebuke of Republicans who are playing on those insecurities in the race to succeed him.\u201cAs frustration grows, there will be voices urging us to fall back into tribes, to scapegoat fellow citizens who don\u2019t look like us, or pray like us, or vote like we do, or share the same background,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to go down that path.\u201dHe repeatedly sought to contrast Republicans\u2019 bleak appraisals of the state of the nation with his own upbeat assessment. He called his opponents\u2019 version \u201ca fiction\u201d and defended his decisions, many of them flash points for the partisan divide. Mr. Obama implicitly singled out Donald J. Trump, the leading Republican presidential candidate, for pointed criticism, saying that Americans must resist calls to stigmatize all Muslims at a time of threats from the Islamic State.\u201cWill we respond to the changes of our time with fear, turning inward as a nation, and turning against each other as a people?\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cOr will we face the future with confidence in who we are, what we stand for, and the incredible things we can do together?\u201dHe also made an indirect but derisive reference to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, another Republican presidential contender who has criticized Mr. Obama\u2019s foreign policy and urged him to \u201ccarpet bomb\u201d the Islamic State.\u201cThe world will look to us to help solve these problems,\u201d Mr. Obama said of global challenges, \u201cand our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet bomb civilians.\u201dThe speech, a mix of Mr. Obama\u2019s often lofty rhetoric and punchy, colloquial language, drew more scattered applause than in earlier years. The president appeared liberated by his decision not to present the usual menu of legislative proposals, although it lasted an hour and four minutes, longer than some past addresses. Mr. Obama spoke informally at times, and with occasional flashes of humor.\u201cNow I\u2019m guessing we won\u2019t agree on health care anytime soon,\u201d he said at one point, as the sound of a single person clapping on the Republican side could be heard in the chamber. Mr. Obama smiled. \u201cA little applause back there,\u201d he said wryly.Mr. Obama opted for symbolism to make some of his points, leaving a chair empty in the first lady\u2019s guest box to symbolize the victims of gun violence. The other seats were filled by an array of guests including a Syrian refugee. Among the guests invited by Republican lawmakers was Kim Davis, the Kentucky court clerk who became a folk hero to social conservatives for refusing to sign marriage certificates for same-sex couples.In his remarks, Mr. Obama said America should harness innovation and not be intimidated by it. He called for a \u201cmoonshot\u201d effort to cure cancer, to be led by Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., who lost his son to the disease last year.The address before a joint session of Congress departed from Mr. Obama\u2019s past practice of outlining executive actions intended to sidestep gridlock in Washington.Instead, Mr. Obama sought to pose and answer the four central questions his aides said were driving the debate about America\u2019s future, including how to ensure opportunity for everyone, how to harness technological change, how to keep the country safe, and how to fix the nation\u2019s broken politics.He called for an end to gerrymandering \u2014 the gaming of political districts to ensure one party\u2019s advantage \u2014 reducing the influence of secretive campaign contributions and making voting easier. Mr. Obama also called on Americans to get more involved in politics and participate, a theme of his first campaign and of his presidency.The speech was one of Mr. Obama\u2019s few remaining opportunities to shape the public conversation before the nation\u2019s attention shifts to the campaign to replace him that is already underway. Except for a final address at the Democratic convention this summer, Tuesday night might have been Mr. Obama\u2019s last big speech.\u201cI know some of you are antsy to get back to Iowa \u2014 I\u2019ve been there,\u201d he said at the start, acknowledging that the political focus is on the state, which holds the country\u2019s first nominating caucuses.Mr. Obama was determined that the address be forward-looking, aides said, even as his time remaining in the White House is limited. The president called for compromise with Republicans on an overhaul of the criminal justice system, approval of a broad free-trade agreement spanning the Pacific Rim and new initiatives to address poverty and the opioid crisis in the United States. He proposed to provide jobless workers with retraining in addition to the unemployment payments they already received.In an effort to find common ground with Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, Mr. Obama noted that Mr. Ryan, a Republican, supports expanding a federal tax credit for low- and middle-income workers. \u201cWho knows, we might surprise the cynics again,\u201d he said, noting a bipartisan budget agreement they struck late last year.And he repeated past calls for legislative action on his domestic initiatives that have fallen short, including raising the minimum wage, revising the nation\u2019s immigration laws and enacting stricter gun restrictions.He used the speech to trace the arc of his presidency and its major themes: the economic collapse and recovery, the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the push for free trade and climate pacts, and his failed bids for an immigration overhaul and new gun laws.Mr. Obama also argued that the country\u2019s most acute challenges emanate not from the strength of adversaries \u2014 a primary criticism of Republicans who portray the president as feckless in the face of mounting threats \u2014 but from their weakness.He defended his approach to taking on the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, describing it as a dangerous threat to the United States that must be dealt with, but not an existential one, and not a force that warrants a commitment of American ground forces in Iraq and Syria.The president also said the United States is uniquely positioned to rally other countries to solve global problems, highlighting his work in forging a nuclear deal with Iran, opening a new era of relations with Cuba, pressing for a global accord reached in Paris to combat climate change and efforts to stop the spread of Ebola.Republicans, too, used the occasion to contrast their agenda and their values with those of the sitting president, and to offer their own, far more negative assessment of his tenure.\u201cThe president\u2019s record has often fallen far short of his soaring words,\u201d Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina said in her official response, delivered immediately after Mr. Obama\u2019s. \u201cAs he enters his final year in office, many Americans are still feeling the squeeze of an economy too weak to raise income levels.\u201d\u201cEven worse,\u201d she added, \u201cwe are facing the most dangerous terrorist threat our nation has seen since September 11th, and this president appears either unwilling or unable to deal with it.\u201d\u201cIf we held the White House,\u201d Ms. Haley said, taxes would be lower, spending slowed and the military strengthened.\u201cWe would make international agreements that were celebrated in Israel and protested in Iran, not the other way around,\u201d she said, referring to the international agreement Mr. Obama pressed for that lifts sanctions on Iran in exchange for restrictions to its nuclear ability.A picture credit on Wednesday with the continuation of an article about President Obama\u2019s State of the Union address misidentified the photographer in some editions.

{"Headline": "Global Markets Move Lower After Sell-Off", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Global markets continued their jitters on Thursday \u2014 with China a lone bright spot \u2014 as investors continued to show concern about the strength of the world\u2019s largest economies.After Wednesday\u2019s sell-off in the United States, shares in Japan fell again, European stocks were down on Thursday, and Wall Street trading opened slightly higher.Oil, whose plunging price has lately become a stand-in for worries about the state of the global economy, rose more than 1 percent and moved closer to $31 a barrel on Thursday, after briefly dipping below the symbolic $30 threshold the day before.China, whose market turmoil in recent days has helped stoke investor anxiety, had a notably strong bounceback on Thursday.Shanghai\u2019s main share index fell in the morning to near the low it had hit amid the turmoil in late August, but it finished the day 2 percent higher. The Shenzhen composite index ended 3.8 percent higher, and the broad CSI 300 stock index finished 2.1 percent higher.\u201cI would caution against any near-term prediction, because the market has been very volatile,\u201d said Hao Hong, the chief strategist at Bank of Communications International. \u201cBut we should have a weakish rebound from here.\u201d\u201cYou tend to have people try to come in and do some bottom fishing,\u201d he added, referring to bargain-hunting investors.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was up 0.1 percent in the first minutes of trading on Thursday, and the Dow Jones industrial average was flat.In Europe, the Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of eurozone blue chips, was down 1.6 percent in early afternoon trading, while the FTSE 100 in London was off 1 percent.While Chinese stocks had at least a one-day respite, Japanese shares continued their recent slide. The Nikkei 225-share index was down as much as 4.3 percent but pared losses late in the afternoon to finish down 2.7 percent.The Japanese market is under pressure on two fronts, analysts said, with broad concerns about global growth rates compounded by a rise in the value of the yen.Traders have flocked to the Japanese currency as a haven during the recent turmoil, pushing up its exchange rate against the dollar by about 5 percent since December. That has undercut one of the main supports for Japanese share prices: The cheaper the yen, the bigger the benefits for global manufacturing giants like Toyota and Hitachi, which earn most of their revenues abroad in foreign currencies.\u201cThe main reason Japanese shares are falling so hard is the exchange rate,\u201d said Masahiro Ichikawa, a strategist at Mitsui Sumitomo Asset Management. \u201cCurrencies in other Asian countries and emerging markets are falling, but people are buying yen as a hedge against risk.\u201dIn addition, traders said, Middle Eastern investors who have been hit by the fall in oil prices are selling parts of their shareholdings in large foreign markets like Japan.\u201cThe biggest markets by capitalization are the U.S., the U.K. and Japan, so if oil money is selling, that is where it will come from,\u201d said Chihiro Ota, general manager at SMBC NikkoSecurities, a Japanese brokerage house. \u201cSell orders from oil producing countries were front-and-center today.\u201dUnited States stocks are in the zone of a correction, or a decline of 10 percent or more from a recent high. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index in the United States dropped 2.5 percent on Wednesday, despite two days of gains that suggested that confidence might be returning after a tumultuous start to the year.

{"Headline": "Robust 4th Quarter Couldn\u2019t Redeem Market After an Anxious Year", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byThe stock market withstood fierce punishment last year and had almost nothing to show for it. A strong fourth quarter healed some of the damage but as the year closed and 2016 began, the battering in the market began yet again.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index ended 2015 at 2,043.94, down just 0.7 percent for the year, after a late rally helped the benchmark recover most of the ground lost during a sharp summertime swoon. The 6.5 percent fourth-quarter gain followed a 6.9 percent third-quarter decline.One reason for the flat-but-volatile performance is that there was much to worry about, yet not much happened.\u201cThe markets went nowhere all year because there was a lot of noise and we were waiting for the Fed,\u201d said David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.Wall Street and the world waited nearly all year for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. The central bank obliged at last in mid-December, nudging the target for its main short-term rate up by a quarter percentage point and suggesting that more increases were coming in 2016.As for the noise, \u201cwe worried about Greece blowing the euro up, China slowing down and another government shutdown\u201d in the United States, Mr. Kelly said. \u201cWe worried about them, but in the end they didn\u2019t become a real problem. They just kept people on the sidelines. Not that these problems have gone away, but we\u2019ve managed to look through them.\u201dInvestors lately have done more than look. They have endured another pummeling. A plunge in the Chinese currency, the renminbi, apparently on fears of economic weakness, led to a sharp drop in Chinese stocks in two of the year\u2019s first three trading days that spilled over into markets worldwide. The S.&P. 500 lost 6 percent in the first week of trading, the worst start to a year ever.That was a departure from the placid and profitable fourth quarter. The average domestic stock fund was up 4.3 percent, according to Morningstar, led by double-digit gains for portfolios that concentrate on technology and health care. International stock funds rose 3.3 percent, as China and Japan outperformed.The fourth-quarter gains alleviated widespread weakness that had been masked by comparative strength in the large companies that dominate the S.&P. 500. The full-year decline in the index still allowed it to outperform shares of smaller companies and nearly all major foreign markets, especially in the developing world. Nearly every other significant asset class fared worse, too, including investment-grade bonds and less creditworthy high-yield issues, foreign currencies and commodities like gold and oil.For all of 2015, the average domestic stock fund fell 1.3 percent, with specialists in small companies down 5 percent and midsize companies down 4.4 percent. Average losses exceeded 20 percent for portfolios that concentrate on energy and other commodities.International stock funds fell 2.9 percent, as losses in emerging markets, mainland Asia and Latin America more than offset gains in Europe and Japan.For all the turbulence before the fourth quarter and so far in 2016, the markets seemed to take the Fed\u2019s rate increase in stride. The S.&P. 500 closed December almost exactly where it was on Dec. 15, the day before the move, and the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds was 2.27 percent on both days.Bond funds were nevertheless weak to poor. The average one fell 0.7 percent during the fourth quarter, hurt by a 2 percent decline in the high-yield niche. For the full year, bond funds in general were off 1.4 percent, with high-yield bonds losing 4 percent.Although Wall Street accepted the rate increase graciously, some investment advisers wish that it hadn\u2019t happened and wonder how markets will perform this year, especially if the Fed keeps raising rates.\u201cThey did it because they felt they had to,\u201d said Hank Herrmann, chief executive of Waddell & Reed. \u201cI don\u2019t think the data necessarily supported doing it.\u201dGDPNow, a forecasting tool of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, estimated on Jan. 6 that the economy grew at a 0.7 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter. The forecast has eroded steadily from nearly 3 percent two months earlier.The Fed has signaled that it will raise rates four times this year, but the markets don\u2019t believe it, and neither does Mr. Herrmann. Based on prices of interest-rate derivatives, two further increases are expected. He anticipates either one or none.\u201cEconomic data will provide the answer, and I think it\u2019s going to remain something less than robust,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we have an inflation threat. There\u2019s still room for employment to increase and not cause a lift in wages.\u201dCharles de Vaulx, chief investment officer at International Value Advisers, is concerned that inflation will bubble up. He also worries about the opposite problem: deflation. Either could occur, he warned, as the Fed tries to step back from crisis mode and return to normal monetary policy while the world pares excessive debt on the books of governments, businesses and consumers.\u201cIt\u2019s a binary outcome. Will deflationary trends stay in place for another 10 years or will there be inflation?\u201d Mr. de Vaulx said. \u201cThe outcome is unknown, and investors have to acknowledge their ignorance. They should avoid making a one-way bet,\u201d by overemphasizing government bonds, for example, to safeguard against deflation, or commodities to hedge against inflation.Whichever way it plays out, he foresees anemic long-term performance, or worse, for many investments.\u201cStocks and bonds will be able to deliver exceedingly low returns for the next five to seven years,\u201d he predicted. \u201cInvestors have to plan accordingly.\u201dThat means buying a diverse group of assets, stressing ones that appear cheap. For Mr. de Vaulx that includes stocks and bonds in emerging markets; high-yield debt, particularly bonds issued by oil-service companies; and gold and other commodities. He also encourages stockpiling cash, which he called \u201ca critical tool to have in a low-return environment where volatility may be with us for a while.\u201d\u201cThe key is to have realistic expectations, then diversify, hold cash, be nimble, be willing to be contrarian,\u201d he advised.Robert J. Horrocks, chief investment officer of Matthews International Capital Management, questions how realistic the Fed\u2019s economic expectations are and what the consequences will be for Asia if growth remains soft.\u201cThe jury is still out on how strong underlying growth in the U.S. economy is,\u201d Mr. Horrocks said. \u201cInflation is still well contained. The Fed was pretty fast off the mark, and I suspect that worries some Asian markets.\u201dThat\u2019s because growth prospects in the region aren\u2019t so great, either, and its central banks haven\u2019t been much looser with monetary policy than the Fed.\u201cIn the very short term, we have some headwinds,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how strong the case is\u201d for emphasizing Asia \u201cat a time when the Fed is raising rates.\u201dAsian stocks aren\u2019t cheap, Mr. Horrocks pointed out, although he thinks valuations compare favorably with American and European markets. Looking past the near future, \u201cthe underlying elements that support growth and ultimately increase profits are still there in Asia,\u201d he added, including stronger productivity growth than other regions and more rapidly expanding economic output.He recommends high-quality companies that pay healthy dividends and have strong competitive positions within their industries. Of the two big mainland markets, he prefers China to India, but he finds good opportunities at lower prices in Thailand and Malaysia. He would also seek out \u201cmiddle-class growth stories\u201d in industries like retailing, insurance, health care and consumer staples.Ben Inker, co-head of asset allocation at GMO, likewise finds the short-term economic outlook daunting, and not just in Asia. He pointed out that the value and volume of global trade shrank last year, something that has never occurred outside of a recession.Mr. Inker encourages investors to go cheap and go abroad. His preferred destination is emerging markets, which have suffered from high indebtedness and weak prices in commodities like the oil and industrial metals that they export. Emerging markets took a turn for the worse \u2014 funds that focus on them fell 13.4 percent in 2015 \u2014 as the dollar grew stronger, reducing the dollar value of their assets and raising the burden of the dollar-denominated debt that proliferates in the developing world.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to be afraid of there, but generally the best money is to be made where people fear to go,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have given up on emerging; you can buy good companies at really cheap prices.\u201dOil prices are bound to recover at some point, he added, but he conceded that it could take a while.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a situation where the price stays at $30 to $40 a barrel for long if the world is producing as much oil as it consumes,\u201d he said, noting that \u201cproduction activity has come to a screeching halt.\u201dAmong American assets, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities offer better value for safety-conscious investors than conventional Treasury instruments, Mr. Inker said. He also considers it worth taking a chance on high-yield bonds for the long haul, but he cautioned that they \u201ccould get worse before they get better.\u201dMr. Kelly of J.P. Morgan also favors high-yield bonds, even though he expects economic and investment conditions to get better before they get worse now that the Fed has begun to raise interest rates. The first move to raise rates in a tightening cycle can lift the economy by putting more money into the hands of savers, he said, while borrowers on fixed-rates loans often see no change for a while. Home sales can improve, too, as the prospect of higher mortgage rates compel buyers to act.After that initial activity, growth slows and further rate increases can choke off a recovery. That\u2019s what Mr. Kelly envisions.\u201cYou want to avoid a situation where you\u2019re raising rates as the economy is slowing down,\u201d he said. Because the Fed waited so long, \u201cthere\u2019s a risk of that toward the end of the year. We have the potential for a typical central-bank-induced boom and bust.\u201dBefore it happens, Mr. Kelly expects stocks in economically sensitive sectors like financial services and consumer cyclicals to outperform. He also likes emerging markets. The appreciation of the dollar in anticipation of rising interest rates has hurt them, but now that rates are heading up, the dollar may reverse course.\u201cMy instinct is if something is cheap and good for long-term investors, don\u2019t wait for a better buying opportunity,\u201d he said.But many investors in 2016 have focused on selling opportunities, especially in assets that took spectacular drops in 2015, like oil and Chinese stocks. Mr. Herrmann wonders if the Fed will be all that eager to tighten credit further. He would stick with safer investments, including Treasury bonds and stocks in sectors that can generate growth in an anemic economy, such as health care, technology and consumer staples. He also advised being prepared for more excitement, like it or not.\u201cIt\u2019s a confusing time,\u201d Mr. Herrmann said. \u201cYou have to predict the unpredictable now more than ever.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Taiwan, Survivor Mentality Stymies Tech Innovation", "Date": "2016-01-14", "News": "Supported byTAIPEI, Taiwan \u2014 With its offices sporting wood flooring, a roof painted bright orange and conference rooms named after target markets in Southeast Asia, AppWorks, one of Taiwan\u2019s few start-up accelerators, has the look and feel of the American counterparts it\u2019s modeled on.But its founder, Jamie Lin, 37, does not sound much like the optimistic entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley. Instead, he is glum about the future for Taiwan\u2019s tech industry.\u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re riding on the Titanic, and you know it\u2019s going to hit an iceberg, and you\u2019re trying to turn the rudder, but you know it\u2019s not turning fast enough,\u201d he said in a recent interview.Five years ago, Taiwan\u2019s tech industry was riding high. The device maker HTC had surpassed Apple to become the largest smartphone vendor in the United States, while the computer company Acer had leapfrogged Dell to become the world\u2019s second-largest personal computer maker. Such successes helped lift Taiwan\u2019s economy, building on the country\u2019s longtime work on computer chips and moving the island nation into its next phase as a tech power.As voters went to the polls and elected a new president over the weekend, a rare point of agreement between Taiwan\u2019s fractious political parties was that the tech industry needs help. Just days before the election four years ago, major Taiwan tech figures took to television to argue that the policies of the incumbent president, Ma Ying-jeou, to improve relations with China would lift the industry.Taiwan\u2019s tech problem, as Mr. Lin sees it, is the result of a culture and government that have failed to generate the talent and flexibility to move beyond the manufacturing prowess that made the island a tech hub in the 1980s and \u201990s and forward to the software and Internet industries driving Silicon Valley\u2019s current boom. The dilemma became apparent to him in 2009 when he saw a commercial for Apple\u2019s iPhone.\u201cThe commercial said whatever you want to do, there\u2019s an app for that,\u201d Mr. Lin said. \u201cImmediately, I realized that\u2019s the end of Taiwan. We\u2019re so good at making cheap computers and phones, but we\u2019re so bad at making an app for anything.\u201dThat has solidified a \u201csurvival mentality\u201d unsuited to innovation, with tech executives unwilling to spend on the marketing and design that could set their firms apart from competitors, said Willy Shih, a professor at Harvard Business School who studies Taiwan\u2019s tech companies.One example of that philosophy was on display recently at Silicon Power, which produces branded portable hard drives and USB drives. When the company, based in the affluent riverside neighborhood of Neihu in Taipei, received a flood of orders before Christmas last year, it sent employees responsible for marketing, design and sales \u2014 all key to building a brand \u2014 to the factory floor, according to one employee, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak about the policy.Yvonne Chang, a Silicon Power spokeswoman, said the move was meant to improve communication between office workers and the factory, not to cut costs. An internal email announcing the plan, however, called for an \u201cemergency mobilization\u201d of employees to help on the manufacturing \u201cfront lines.\u201dSome of Taiwan\u2019s larger tech companies have suffered from a similar philosophy. HTC did not put enough emphasis on branding, Mr. Shih said, adding that Acer failed to adequately transfer to mobile devices as the personal computer market sagged. Many of the Taiwanese companies are now beholden to bigger branded companies, mostly in the United States, for computers, servers and smartphones.Acer and HTC did not respond to requests for comment. Nick Wu, the chief financial officer of Asustek, said the company anticipated the shifts in the industry and was working to expand into robotics, as well as computing devices for the home and car.\u201cTransition is not something that can be completed overnight,\u201d Mr. Wu said. \u201cIt takes strategic planning and solid execution, especially when our industry is undergoing a massive paradigm shift.\u201dTaiwan\u2019s entrepreneurial scene, meanwhile, is growing but remains small. Many of those trying to start new companies said they had often run into the conservative mind-set that shunts younger people into risk-averse positions at established companies. Entrepreneurs also have to grapple with a maze of regulations that have restricted online payment platforms and limited tech start-ups\u2019 ability to list in Taiwan.Mr. Lin of AppWorks recalled a moment last year when he and four others in the tech industry met with 30 legislators to work on a law to regulate online payments like PayPal. Of the legislators in the room, only a few had ever used any form of online payment platform.\u201cIf none of them has used it, what rights do they have to criticize it or say it\u2019s not useful?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou have to at least do your homework.\u201dThe institute is also spearheading an initiative to link Taiwanese companies and offer their services to hardware start-ups in places like Silicon Valley that are in need of quick prototyping and manufacturing, with the aim of bringing in new business from the United States. And the organization has created a research group to work on regulatory problems.Co-founded in 2011 by Horace Luke, a former HTC executive, Gogoro has raised $180 million and produces scooters powered by replaceable batteries stored at stations around Taipei. The company grew to more than 600 employees in 2015, up from 15 in 2011.Mr. Luke said his goal was to avoid relying on larger companies and to build a platform by offering services and devices based around the replaceable battery stations. Because of his strong local reputation, Mr. Luke said he had been given freedom by investors to run the company as he wanted. He said he encouraged employees, many of whom are under 40, to shun short-term considerations in favor of longer-term innovation.Mr. Luke said Taiwan\u2019s lack of urgency around tech was receding. In the last 18 months, an \u201calarm bell went off\u201d over the tech scene, he said. \u201cBusiness leaders here, everyone is talking about that,\u201d he said. \u201cAwareness is the first step to a correction.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oil Price Falls as Global Growth Anxiety Weighs on Markets", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byThe recent turmoil, across stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies, reflects investors\u2019 growing anxiety about global growth. The swirl of forces are interconnected, so the volatility in one area can quickly spread to other countries and other markets.The tumult in China, where stocks are now in bear-market territory, is helping drag down oil prices. China, an important energy consumer, is facing a slowdown that could hurt its demand for crude.It all makes for trouble in the stock markets, with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell about 2 percent.The sell-off started on Friday in China, where the main Shanghai index dropped 3.6 percent. The index has fallen more than 20 percent from its December high, a threshold that analysts generally regard as a bear market.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.China\u2019s troubles have affected the price of oil, which is off more than 70 percent over the last 18 months.On Friday, the futures for Brent crude for March delivery were trading at $29.06 a barrel on the Intercontinental Exchange. West Texas intermediate crude settled at $29.42 a barrel, or down 5.7 percent. As recently as May, Brent crude was trading at about $65 a barrel.Whether the volatility subsists will depend largely on the direction of the global economy and how it affects demand for oil.In China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy after the United States, underlying growth continues to slow. The government is expected to report next week that economic growth cooled last year to 6.9 percent. That figure would be the envy of many countries but that would signal China\u2019s slowest pace in a quarter of a century.China and other growing Asian economies have become important customers for oil exporters like Saudi Arabia and Iran, particularly as rising production of oil in the United States has reduced American imports. If the economic weakness in China leads to a sharp fall in demand, the big producers will most likely discount their oil even more aggressively to attract buyers.Oil prices are also under pressure because an easing of international sanctions on Iran could come in the next few days. Sanctions have crimped Iran\u2019s production and sales in recent years. If they are removed, Iran could start to ramp up production and rekindle sales to former customers in Europe and elsewhere. In the coming months, that could add 300,000 to 400,000 barrels a day to an already oversupplied market, analysts estimate.Sentiment in the market is now very negative, analysts say. Traders are betting on still-lower prices, perhaps even heading toward the $20-a-barrel range.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.With prices settling below the $30 level, \u201cit could set the scene for further declines next week,\u201d said Richard Mallinson, an analyst at Energy Aspects, a research firm based in London.The low prices of oil are wreaking havoc in the industry, adding to the broad investor anxiety.\u201cThe dramatic fall in prices has led to the disappointing write-down announced today,\u201d Andrew Mackenzie, BHP Billiton\u2019s chief executive, said on Friday in a statement. \u201cOil and gas markets have been significantly weaker than the industry expected.\u201dThe cutbacks seem drastic, but it will take time for them to have a significant impact on the balance of supply and demand. Despite weak prices, oil production was higher in 2015 as extensive investments in previous years began to translate into higher production in the United States, Brazil and elsewhere. Even Britain, whose North Sea region is widely viewed as struggling, showed increased output.Seth Kleinman, an analyst at Citigroup in London, said it was unlikely that crude prices would reach bottom before markets encountered production declines outside the United States and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.Saudi Arabia and other members of OPEC continue to produce at high levels and show no signs of abandoning their unwillingness to adjust outputs to regulate the market.\u201cIn order to maintain an efficient economy, you can\u2019t be pushing your production up and down by half a million barrels a day to prop up prices somewhere else,\u201d said Sadad al-Husseini, a former executive vice president of Saudi Aramco, the national oil company, who now runs a consulting firm.Neil Gough contributed reporting from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Fake Missed Connections,\u2019 by Brett Fletcher Lauer", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "Supported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Lauer rifles through their apartment for evidence, fires off pained emails, writes letters to his estranged mother that he will never send, reads \u201cthe entire Internet\u201d and downloads music to match his post-\u00adtraumatic gloom. The memoir doesn\u2019t proceed as much as it accumulates in a kind of curated pastiche, like a Tumblr page in prose. Much of the correspondence in the book is based, we are told, on actual documents or on chat and I.M. transcripts, and these are interspersed with more traditional passages of personal narrative that revel in the awkward pungencies of life. Lauer battles a ghost in his apartment after he\u2019s settled in Brooklyn again, and he writes impressively about his adolescent fascination with the hard-core punk/Hare Krishna hybrid form of rebellion known as Krishnacore.Once Lauer takes a plunge into the online dating site Nerve \u2014 it\u2019s 2007, so this is before OkCupid and Tinder owned the market \u2014 the memoir starts using confession as a means to plumb the social mores, surface inanities and deeper dissatisfactions of the Internet\u2019s love economy. He writes his first dating profile with an assist from Wallace Stevens and John Ashbery, and recognizes the irony when he\u2019s tagged by the site\u2019s algorithms as the \u201cgentle artist\u201d type. He meets Daphne and lets her down (\u201cI was a little bummed that you said we might not hang out,\u201d she writes him at one point in chat-speak, \u201cbecause I want to hang out\u201d); then there\u2019s Bella and an extended debate about \u201cexclusivity\u201d and when it\u2019s all right to ask for it; and Lindsay, who asks Lauer to send her a nude photo, goes ballistic in an email and then uses their relationship as material for a stand-up routine she posts on her blog.Meanwhile, the undisguised longing he finds in the Missed Connections notices on Craigslist inspires Lauer to obsessively post fake ones, so much so that he starts borrowing friends\u2019 computers for their IP addresses. (Lauer\u2019s collaboration with Gretchen Scott, Ships That Pass, collects fake Missed Connections posts as an \u201conline art project\u201d on Tumblr.) The French artist Sophie Calle\u2019s installation \u201cTake Care of Yourself\u201d for the 2007 Venice Biennale is cited as an influence on the project (and on the memoir as a whole), but the stream of cultural signifiers throughout the book \u2014 Pitchfork, French-pressed coffee, Silver Jews, McCarren Park, \u201cVeronica Mars,\u201d Bridget Jones, the Maggie Gyllenhaal film \u201cSecretary,\u201d Lexapro and Wellbutrin \u2014 puts Lauer in the company of more twee conceptualists like Miranda July.It\u2019s fitting, then, that when Lauer finds true love again, he seals it with an ice-cream cake from Baskin-Robbins. The inscription: \u201cWill you be my girlfriend?\u201d I\u2019d be more impressed if Lauer had avoided the teeth-corroding sweetness and used a line from Clarice Lispector instead: \u201cEverything worthless in me was my treasure.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t make for much of an ice-cream cake, but it has a lot more to say about the vulnerability on display in Lauer\u2019s memoir and how he confuses it for literary art.FAKE MISSED CONNECTIONSDivorce, Online Dating, and Other FailuresBrett Fletcher Lauer228 pp. Soft Skull Press/Counterpoint. $25.Benjamin Anastas is the author of two novels and a memoir, \u201cToo Good to Be True.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Dollar Keeps Rising, for Good or Evil", "Date": "2016-01-26", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneJust the other day I got an email in which Ron Paul, libertarian icon, former member of Congress from Texas and father of the Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul, eagerly proclaimed that his \u201cfinal prediction of a dollar collapse is about to become reality.\u201dThe email was a bit extreme, perhaps, with references to the hyperinflation of Weimar Germany, Robert Mugabe\u2019s Zimbabwe and the Book of Genesis. But Mr. Paul\u2019s dire premonition fits within an overarching Republican proposition that the Obama administration and the Federal Reserve are relentlessly undermining the American economy.They were exactly wrong. The dollar\u2019s rise, which started virtually the day Professor Feldstein made his prediction in 2011, shows little sign of abating. It amounts to only the third instance of such consistent appreciation since Richard Nixon took the United States off the gold standard in 1971.The American economy might just be bumbling along, but it is doing substantially better than the rest of the advanced industrial world. \u201cIt is quite natural,\u201d said Barry Eichengreen of the University of California, Berkeley, \u201cthat the currency of the country whose economy is least bad should have the least worst currency.\u201dBut with many developing economies in a tailspin, commodity prices and stock markets tumbling sharply around the world, could a rising dollar damage a fragile economic order?Many economists argue it is mostly a good thing. A strong dollar should help Europe and Japan overcome their deeper economic weaknesses by making their products cheaper on world markets \u2014 an overall positive for global growth. The strengthening of the dollar, Olivier Blanchard, former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, told me, \u201cis a fundamentally healthy process.\u201dBut there are reasons to be cautious. A strong dollar will squeeze American manufacturers, which have otherwise benefited from falling energy prices and rising wages in China. That will weigh on growth in the United States and further suppress inflation, which is already well below the Fed\u2019s target.And the effects in the United States are not the principal worry.Policy makers in developing countries can remember the last two times the dollar went through periods of sharp appreciation. There was the first half of the 1980s, when Latin America fell into what is remembered today as the \u201clost decade,\u201d and the second half of the 1990s, when much of Asia ended up underwater. The memories aren\u2019t pleasant.The added factor today is the new role of China in the global economy, since it is now a significant presence, with a currency that is no longer as insulated from outside forces as it was in the previous two episodes.The attacks are wrong. Indeed, the International Monetary Fund no longer deems China\u2019s currency, the renminbi, undervalued. Actually, China\u2019s currency has been mostly rising along with the dollar against the currencies of its other trading partners, squeezing an already slowing economy.Beijing is in a pickle. Last summer, the Chinese government tried Washington\u2019s prescription: to let market forces play a bigger role in determining the exchange rate. But then the renminbi fell, producing the expected populist complaints from the United States. What\u2019s more, Chinese savers dashed to send their money out of the country, frightened that the currency could be on the cusp of a long slide.The rising dollar \u201ccomplicates policy management,\u201d in China, said Eswar S. Prasad, a former head of the I.M.F.\u2019s China division who teaches at Cornell University. \u201cIf the renminbi were to drop by a couple of percentage points, the implication would be that the central bank wants a much cheaper currency, which would lead to more capital outflows.\u201dProfessor Prasad, like most economists, says he believes the dollar\u2019s gain is benign. \u201cThe United States is the only country whose currency can appreciate like this without its economy suffering badly,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is something of a blessing for the world.\u201dAnd yet he allows for a kink in the analysis.Remember the financial crisis, visited upon the world by the American housing market and its banks? Despite being at the center of the disaster, the dollar didn\u2019t weaken but instead strengthened. Gripped by abject fear, investors could think of nowhere else to run.The dollar has gone haywire before. In the two years before the Plaza Accord, it continued to soar even after the Fed chairman at the time, Paul Volcker, relaxed his grip on interest rates. The misalignment led to devastation in the Rust Belt, helped lay the groundwork for the Japanese bubble and fostered enormous trade imbalances.Today perhaps it is safe to say the dollar is driven mostly by natural forces that should reverse when growth picks up elsewhere in the world. But in this choppy world economy it would be foolhardy to ignore one of the main forces driving financial flows through history: irrationality.Email: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cancer and Climate Change", "Date": "2016-01-16", "News": "Supported byOpinionI\u2019M a climate scientist who has just been told I have Stage 4 pancreatic cancer.This diagnosis puts me in an interesting position. I\u2019ve spent much of my professional life thinking about the science of climate change, which is best viewed through a multidecadal lens. At some level I was sure that, even at my present age of 60, I would live to see the most critical part of the problem, and its possible solutions, play out in my lifetime. Now that my personal horizon has been steeply foreshortened, I was forced to decide how to spend my remaining time. Was continuing to think about climate change worth the bother?After handling the immediate business associated with the medical news \u2014 informing family, friends, work; tidying up some finances; putting out stacks of unread New York Times Book Reviews to recycle; and throwing a large \u201cLimited Edition\u201d holiday party, complete with butlers, I had some time to sit at my kitchen table and draw up the bucket list.Very quickly, I found out that I had no desire to jostle with wealthy tourists on Mount Everest, or fight for some yardage on a beautiful and exclusive beach, or all those other things one toys with on a boring January afternoon. Instead, I concluded that all I really wanted to do was spend more time with the people I know and love, and get back to my office as quickly as possible.I work for NASA, managing a large group of expert scientists doing research on the whole Earth system (I should mention that the views in this article are my own, not NASA\u2019s). This involves studies of climate and weather using space-based observations and powerful computer models. These models describe how the planet works, and what can happen as we pump carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The work is complex, exacting, highly relevant and fascinating.Last year was the warmest year on record, by far. I think that future generations will look back on 2015 as an important but not decisive year in the struggle to align politics and policy with science. This is an incredibly hard thing to do. On the science side, there has been a steady accumulation of evidence over the last 15 years that climate change is real and that its trajectory could lead us to a very uncomfortable, if not dangerous, place. On the policy side, the just-concluded climate conference in Paris set a goal of holding the increase in the global average temperature to 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, above preindustrial levels.While many have mocked this accord as being toothless and unenforceable, it is noteworthy that the policy makers settled on a number that is based on the best science available and is within the predictive capability of our computer models.It\u2019s doubtful that we\u2019ll hold the line at 2 degrees Celsius, but we need to give it our best shot. With scenarios that exceed that target, we are talking about enormous changes in global precipitation and temperature patterns, huge impacts on water and food security, and significant sea level rise. As the predicted temperature rises, model uncertainty grows, increasing the likelihood of unforeseen, disastrous events.All this as the world\u2019s population is expected to crest at around 9.5 billion by 2050 from the current seven billion. Pope Francis and a think tank of retired military officers have drawn roughly the same conclusion from computer model predictions: The worst impacts will be felt by the world\u2019s poorest, who are already under immense stress and have meager resources to help them adapt to the changes. They will see themselves as innocent victims of the developed world\u2019s excesses. Looking back, the causes of the 1789 French Revolution are not a mystery to historians; looking forward, the pressure cooker for increased radicalism, of all flavors, and conflict could get hotter along with the global temperature.The initial heavy lifting will have to be done by policy makers. I feel for them. It\u2019s hard to take a tough stand on an important but long-term issue in the face of so many near-term problems, amid worries that reducing emissions will weaken our global economic position and fears that other countries may cheat on their emissions targets.Where science can help is to keep track of changes in the Earth system \u2014 this is a research and monitoring job, led by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and their counterparts elsewhere in the world \u2014 and use our increasingly powerful computer models to explore possible futures associated with proposed policies. The models will help us decide which approaches are practicable, trading off near-term impacts to the economy against longer-term impacts to the climate.Ultimately, though, it will be up to the engineers and industrialists of the world to save us. They must come up with the new technologies and the means of implementing them. The technical and organizational challenges of solving the problems of clean energy generation, storage and distribution are enormous, and they must be solved within a few decades with minimum disruption to the global economy. This will likely entail a major switch to nuclear, solar and other renewable power, with an electrification of our transport system to the maximum extent possible. These engineers and industrialists are fully up to the job, given the right incentives and investments. You have only to look at what they achieved during World War II: American technology and production catapulted over what would have taken decades to do under ordinary conditions and presented us with a world in 1945 that was completely different from the late 1930s.What should the rest of us do? Two things come to mind. First, we should brace for change. It is inevitable. It will appear in changes to the climate and to the way we generate and use energy. Second, we should be prepared to absorb these with appropriate sang-froid. Some will be difficult to deal with, like rising seas, but many others could be positive. New technologies have a way of bettering our lives in ways we cannot anticipate. There is no convincing, demonstrated reason to believe that our evolving future will be worse than our present, assuming careful management of the challenges and risks. History is replete with examples of us humans getting out of tight spots. The winners tended to be realistic, pragmatic and flexible; the losers were often in denial of the threat.As for me, I\u2019ve no complaints. I\u2019m very grateful for the experiences I\u2019ve had on this planet. As an astronaut I spacewalked 220 miles above the Earth.

{"Headline": "Freeport-McMoRan Battles the Oil Slump", "Date": "2016-01-21", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseWhen some investors questioned the rationale and ethics of the deal, Mr. Moffett highlighted his own management skills with characteristic bravado. \u201cI don\u2019t want to pat us on the back, but we\u2019ve got extraordinary capabilities,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cWe found the biggest gold and copper mine in the world, and I\u2019ve said it three or four times, but I got the right to say it. Joe Namath said it isn\u2019t bragging if you can do it.\u201dOver the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.The deal now looks like a major blunder. In December 2010, Freeport\u2019s stock peaked at over $60 a share. This week it dropped below $4.\u201cThe stock is trading like they\u2019re going to file for bankruptcy,\u201d said Paul Massoud, a mining analyst with Stifel Nicolaus who downgraded Freeport shares in August 2014.Freeport is hardly alone in getting battered by plummeting commodities prices. Banks\u2019 earnings this month have taken a hit as they have marked down the value of their loans to energy companies. Many of the world\u2019s largest commodities producers, including oil-rich countries like Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, or corporate behemoths like the Swiss company Glencore, are suffering after borrowing large sums of money at ultralow interest rates during the commodities boom.In previous price slumps, commodities producers cut back. But this time, many have continued to flood the market with oil and copper even at depressed prices, confounding many economists. One explanation is that they need to generate the cash to meet debt obligations. In its last quarter, Freeport actually increased its oil production and barely cut back on copper despite falling prices.Now, Freeport, which is based in Phoenix, needs to reduce its heavy debt burden, which at more than $20 billion is more than four times the company\u2019s current market value of $4.8 billion. Once an aggressive bidder for trophy assets, it now finds itself in the position of a desperate seller. It\u2019s also cutting jobs and slashing capital spending, the lifeblood of any mining company.For its most recent quarter, Freeport reported a quarterly loss of $3.8 billion, bringing its loss for the first nine months of its fiscal year to $8.2 billion, mostly because of write-downs in the value of its oil and gas assets.When it last announced earnings in October, Freeport said its 2016 projections were based on an average oil price of $56 a barrel. This week oil dropped below $27 a barrel, though it rallied on Thursday. So expectations for Freeport\u2019s latest quarter and full year results, which will be announced next week, are grim. (A Freeport spokesman said the company couldn\u2019t comment because of the impending earnings release.)Freeport \u201cis getting hit by everything,\u201d said Anthony Young, a mining analyst at the Macquarie Group. \u201cIt\u2019s the fall in copper prices and metals, the plunge in oil and natural gas, and the amount of debt on the balance sheet. It\u2019s going to take some pretty dramatic steps by management to right this ship.\u201dStill, however much Freeport is being battered by market forces beyond its control, it\u2019s hard to feel too bad for the company\u2019s management and shareholders, given how many of its woes seem self-inflicted during a woeful lapse in corporate governance standards.A glut of crude oil on the markets is pushing the price of oil down to levels not seen since the global financial crisis.As a pure mining company that had endured over a century of commodity booms and busts, Freeport had long shunned debt and never acted as if it expected good times to last indefinitely \u2014 time-honored notions that Mr. Moffett and his allies appear to have discarded when they pushed into oil and gas. Investors \u201cloved this company for so long because they never took on much debt and never hedged,\u201d Mr. Massoud said. \u201cThey were a pure proxy for commodities. No matter the price, they\u2019d survive.\u201dMany Freeport investors were furious over the company\u2019s audacious debt-financed move into oil and gas. As Evy Hambro, chief investment officer for BlackRock\u2019s natural resources team, said in the company\u2019s investor call to discuss the deal: \u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything on this call that in any way justifies why these companies should be put together, and I find it incredibly disappointing that as a management team, you\u2019ve chosen to break the trust with investors from what the business was that we chose to invest in.\u201dThe deal was all the more troubling given that it was rife with conflicts of interest. At the time, Mr. Moffett was McMoRan\u2019s chief executive while also serving as Freeport\u2019s chairman. (The \u201cMo\u201d in the company\u2019s name stands for Moffett.)Freeport\u2019s chief executive, Richard Adkerson, was McMoRan\u2019s co-chairman. Nine Freeport directors owned stock in McMoRan totaling about 6 percent of the shares. Freeport agreed to buy McMoRan for $2.1 billion \u2014 a 74 percent premium over its market price before the deal was struck. Mr. Moffett himself was paid $73 million.Moreover, Plains owned 31 percent of McMoRan, enough to block any deal. Freeport eliminated that possibility when it bought Plains. And James Flores, Plains\u2019s chief executive, who now runs Freeport\u2019s oil and gas operations, was also a director of McMoRan. He made $200 million on the deal.\u201cWould it be possible to find out if anybody on the call from your side is not conflicted?\u201d Mr. Hambro asked pointedly during the conference call.Freeport officials denied any wrongdoing and justified the deal by saying that committees of independent directors at all the companies approved the transactions. Last year it agreed to pay $137.5 million to resolve shareholder lawsuits over conflicts of interest related to the deal. (All costs to the individual executives were covered by directors\u2019 liability insurance, the company said.)Even now, Mr. Moffett hasn\u2019t exactly been sent packing. He received a severance package valued at $79.4 million, according to company filings. He keeps the title of chairman emeritus and will be paid $1.5 million a year as a consultant. Mr. Adkerson remains Freeport\u2019s chief executive.There\u2019s no easy way out for Freeport. The company earlier said it would explore selling all or part of its oil and gas assets, but given current market conditions, any sale would be at fire sale prices. With its stock so depressed, it doesn\u2019t make sense to raise more money in the equity markets, and it would be hard pressed to borrow more, either from banks or in the debt market (where some of its bonds are already trading at distressed levels).Freeport still owns what Mr. Moffett called its \u201ctrove of treasures\u201d \u2014 the Grasberg gold and copper operations in Indonesia; the Morenci copper mine in Arizona; and majority stakes in the Cerro Verde copper mine in Peru and Tenke Fungurume, the largest copper mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Freeport recently valued its interest in Grasberg alone at $16.2 billion.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of concern about the company\u2019s long-term solvency,\u201d Mr. Young of Macquarie said. \u201cBut they do have some valuable assets that could alleviate the pressure.\u201d He said investors were anxiously waiting to see what strategy the company unveils next week.Freeport\u2019s salvation may come from a rally in the commodities markets. But just as prices looked as if they would never go down during the commodities boom, they now look as if they won\u2019t go up substantially any time soon. \u201cUnfortunately for them, if you extend these low commodity prices indefinitely,\u201d the Stifel analyst Mr. Massoud said, \u201cthere\u2019s zero equity value there.\u201dThe Common Sense column on Friday, about the mining company Freeport McMoRan\u2019s ill-timed move into the oil and gas industry, misstated, in some editions, when Paul Massoud, a mining analyst, downgraded the company\u2019s shares. It was August 2014, not last August.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Unions Lean Democratic, but Donald Trump Gets Members\u2019 Attention", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Supported byBut the union\u2019s president, Mary Kay Henry, acknowledged that Mr. Trump holds appeal even for some of her members. \u201cThere is deep economic anxiety among our members and the people we\u2019re trying to organize that I believe Donald Trump\u2019s message is tapping into,\u201d Ms. Henry said.In expressing her concern, Ms. Henry reflected a different form of anxiety that is weighing on some union leaders and Democratic operatives: their fear that Mr. Trump, if not effectively countered, may draw an unusually large number of union voters in a possible general election matchup. This could, in turn, bolster Republicans in swing states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, all of which President Obama won twice.The source of the attraction to Mr. Trump, say union members and leaders, is manifold: the candidate\u2019s unapologetically populist positions on certain economic issues, particularly trade; a frustration with the impotence of conventional politicians; and above all, a sense that he rejects the norms of Washington discourse.\u201cThey feel he\u2019s the one guy who\u2019s saying what\u2019s on people\u2019s minds,\u201d Thomas Hanify, the president of the Indiana state firefighters union, said of his rank and file.Mr. Hanify said that Mr. Trump has so far dominated the \u201cfirehouse chatter\u201d in his state. While he allowed that his members tilt Republican, he estimated that most followed the lead of the union\u2019s international leadership and supported Mr. Obama in 2008 and 2012.Ms. Henry and other labor leaders remain confident that they can keep their members in the fold by making a case that the Republicans\u2019 economic agenda, including Mr. Trump\u2019s, runs counter to the interests of working people. But they also see Mr. Trump as posing particular risks.The potential pairing of Mr. Trump and union members could be helped along by a sense that Mr. Trump, unlike more conventional Republicans, has historically enjoyed a cordial relationship with labor on many of his real estate projects.\u201cHe has put his fair share into hiring union people,\u201d said Richard Sabato, the president of a building and construction trades council in northern New Jersey. \u201cHe\u2019s done that in Manhattan, in New Jersey.\u201dMr. Sabato said that his members, who lean Republican but in many cases voted for Mr. Obama, would \u201cmarch behind\u201d Mr. Trump on the issue of illegal immigration.He has also fulminated against plans by the company that owns Nabisco to shift some production to Mexico \u2014 \u201cI love Oreos,\u201d he said, \u201cI will never eat them again\u201d \u2014 and vowed to impose a punishing tariff on imports of Ford cars unless the company canceled a $2.5 billion investment in plants in that country.\u201cWe like that he does not support TPP, that he has taken the position that there should be trade tariffs for a company that moves jobs overseas,\u201d said Ryan Leenders, 30, a member of the International Association of Machinists in Washington State. Mr. Leenders, who estimated that one-quarter to one-third of his factory\u2019s union workers were Trump supporters, said he voted for Mr. Obama in 2008 and wrote in Ron Paul in 2012.Reflecting the anti-establishment mood that has engulfed parts of the labor movement, Mr. Leenders said he believed that more than half of his union\u2019s workers support Senator Bernie Sanders, while very few support Mrs. Clinton, despite the fact that the machinists union endorsed her last summer. (A machinists spokesman said that, \u201cAt this point, any estimates of support for a candidate are more a passing snapshot of popularity.\u201d)John Bulgaro, the president of Teamsters Local 294 in Albany, said that Mr. Trump had generated excitement among his members, but that \u201ca lot of people like Bernie Sanders.\u201d He cautioned that they would need to hear more about Mr. Trump\u2019s position on labor rights.To be sure, polling of union voters shows that Mrs. Clinton remains broadly popular and would carry most Sanders supporters in a matchup against Mr. Trump. But the same polling suggests that Mr. Trump could perform unusually well among these voters for a Republican nominee.Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal, particularly among white working-class men, longtime labor officials and political operatives point out that Mr. Trump\u2019s popularity before a single primary vote has been cast is a vastly different proposition than whether he would be able to retain that support in the fall.\u201cIn every election around this time there are stories suggesting that union members will defect \u2014 \u2018Oh, white union men won\u2019t vote for Obama,\u2019\u201d Steve Rosenthal, a former political director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and progressive political organizer, wrote in an email response to questions.In the end, Mr. Rosenthal said, union voters almost always end up voting overwhelmingly Democratic in presidential elections. White male union members favored Mr. Obama in 2008, and John Kerry in 2004, by roughly 20 percentage points, according to polling commissioned by the A.F.L.-C.I.O., even as white men over all favored the Republican candidate by a large margin.Mr. Rosenthal said that unions have proved adept at building support among their members for Democratic nominees who generally embrace their economic agenda and at undermining support for Republicans.\u201cJust delivering a little bit of new information, we could see that his brand takes a hit,\u201d Mr. Morrison said, referring to reports that Mr. Trump may have used undocumented workers on some of his development projects.Other experts cautioned that even if Mr. Trump were to retain substantial support among white male union members without college degrees, that would not necessarily yield him an electoral advantage in November if he became the Republican nominee.The voters whom labor unions must typically work the hardest to turn out, like younger voters and Latinos, \u201care groups that will be highly motivated\u201d against Mr. Trump, said Guy Molyneux, a pollster who has surveyed union voters extensively over the years. Mr. Molyneux also said that many of the union voters attracted by Mr. Trump were among the 30 percent of union voters who already vote reliably Republican.Still, unlike most other Republicans, whose appeal to union voters rarely extends beyond cultural issues like gun rights, Mr. Trump\u2019s economic pronouncements have a greater potential to scramble the standard political calculus.\u201cI do think that Trump is a threat,\u201d said Mike Lux, a progressive activist who is a former labor official and veteran of President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration. \u201cIf the Democratic nominee is Hillary, and she\u2019s mushy at all on the trade issue, Trump will take that issue and drive it and drive it and drive it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Creating a Cuteness Empire in Japan, One Fuzzy Bear Suit at a Time", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "Supported byThe Saturday ProfileMIYAZAKI, Japan \u2014 FOR some of Japan\u2019s most adored celebrities, the journey to fame starts in a converted Internet cafe above a bowling alley in this sunny southwestern city.This is where Hiromi Kano runs her unlikely star factory, an enterprise whose most successful creations are recognized by millions. Some have huge followings on Twitter and earn billions of yen in revenue. At least one has met the emperor.The idols churned out by Ms. Kano, 55, are mascots \u2014 the smiling, dancing animals, mutated foodstuffs and saucer-eyed humanoids that promote every conceivable thing in Japan, from out-of-the-way tourist spots to careers in the military.Ms. Kano is a costume maker, though no one in her industry would describe the job so bluntly.\u201cWe have a motto, which is that there\u2019s no human inside,\u201d said Ms. Kano, a mother of two with a warm smile who oversees the workshop and its roughly 40 employees, almost all women.Whimsical mascots have become almost as closely associated with Japan as Mount Fuji and sushi. Popular for decades, they have become a virtual obsession in recent years, and seemingly every town, business and arm of government now has one.So ubiquitous are mascots that last year, Japan\u2019s Finance Ministry suggested that public agencies think twice before creating more, fearing that taxpayer money was being wasted. Osaka Prefecture alone was found to be supporting 92 of them, including two different dogs for separate tax departments and a caped, flying hot-water bottle representing pharmaceutical regulation. The governor ordered a cull.Ms. Kano said business was still booming, though.\u201cJapanese people have this desire to take the sharp edges off things, to take hard things and make them soft,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you want to explain, say, industrial waste, adding a character softens the message and helps it get through to people.\u201dMs. Kano\u2019s biggest claim to fame is creating the wearable version of Kumamon, a red-cheeked bear that has become one of the most popular fantasy creatures in Japan.The mascot for rural Kumamoto Prefecture, Kumamon won a nationwide popularity contest in 2011. His image adorns bags, T-shirts, key chains, plastic chopsticks, liquor bottles and countless other items. According to the local branch of the Japanese central bank, which studied Kumamon\u2019s economic impact, the bear earned Kumamoto 124 billion yen, or about $1 billion, in tourism and merchandising revenue in the two years after the contest win.Success stories like Kumamoto\u2019s have kept the mascot addiction going.\u201cThe toughest cases are when clients come in and say, \u2018Just make ours like Kumamon,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms. Kano said. \u201cI try to tell them that it\u2019s not enough to have a cute character. You have to think about how to use it to engage people.\u201dShe added, \u201cIt\u2019s sad when a government agency orders a mascot, and it ends up sitting in a box.\u201dMS. KANO was born in Miyazaki, a rural area on Japan\u2019s southwestern Kyushu island known for golf courses and citrus farming. (Official mascots: three dogs, one of which is in turn dressed as a chicken \u2014 a mascot playing a mascot.)She says she did not set out to create a cuteness empire. After a stint in New York in her early 20s, where she worked for a travel agency, she returned to Miyazaki to marry, but she later divorced. She moved to Tokyo with her children and then to rural Fukushima Prefecture, before going back to Miyazaki after she met her current husband, a designer of theater sets and commercial displays.\u201cWhen we got our first orders for mascots, we made them ourselves, by trial and error,\u201d she recalled. Demand for flashy trade-show displays and other large, expensive items dried up as Japan\u2019s economy stagnated. \u201cEventually, mascots were all that was left.\u201d Today, the company produces 20 to 25 costumes a month. International orders are growing: It has done Malaysian cartoon characters and a cuddly bear for Feiler, a German linen maker. An Italian fashion brand recently ordered a pair of mascots \u2014 design \u201ctop secret, but very edgy,\u201d Ms. Kano said \u2014 for a promotional event in the upscale Ginza shopping district in Tokyo.\u201cForeign companies are starting to understand that you need a cute mascot to sell anything to Japanese people,\u201d she said.RECENTLY, some of Ms. Kano\u2019s creations gathered in Hanyu, a semirural Tokyo suburb that hosts an annual two-day mascot fair, now in its sixth year, which draws about 40,000 visitors.Naomi Meguro, 37, and Tomoko Miyakawa, 40, wore ramen-bowl hats as they waited in a long line for photographs with Sanomaru. They described themselves as \u201ckyara-tomo,\u201d or \u201ccharacter friends,\u201d who met online through a shared love of mascots. Their favorites are in constant virtual contact.\u201cThey post photographs and messages like \u2018Good morning\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m coming down with a cold,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms. Meguro said. \u201cThey\u2019re more than just stuffed toys.\u201dChildren and adults alike embraced and stroked their favorite characters and shook hands with them. Ms. Kano said she believed one reason for mascots\u2019 popularity was that they provided an outlet for physical contact and gushing expressions of affection in an otherwise reserved society.\u201cJapanese people don\u2019t really hug, even husbands and wives,\u201d she said. \u201cI would never hug my employees, but as soon as they put on a mascot suit, I want to cuddle them.\u201dStill, Ms. Kano says she often wonders how long Japan\u2019s mascot obsession can go on. \u201cThere are times when even I think, \u2018Really? Is this necessary?\u2019\u00a0\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Automakers Go Electric, Even if Gas Is Cheap", "Date": "2016-01-11", "News": "Supported byDETROIT \u2014 While American consumers were taking advantage of low gas prices to buy trucks and sport utility vehicles in large numbers, some automakers delayed investing in slower-selling electrified vehicles.But with increases in federal fuel-economy standards looming in 2017, car companies are hustling to bring out hybrid and electric models to help them meet the new rules \u2014\u00a0even though electrified vehicles make up only 2 percent of overall sales.The federal government has mandated corporate average fuel economy of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. But companies need to meet an interim standard of about 37 m.p.g. by next year.On Monday, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles introduced a plug-in hybrid-electric version of its new minivan model, the Pacifica, making it the first hybrid vehicle in the Italian-American automaker\u2019s lineup.The Pacifica joined several other new electrified models introduced by other automakers at the auto show, including models from Ford Motor Company and General Motors.Fiat Chrysler has been an industry laggard in the push for electrified cars, relying heavily in recent years on sales of Ram pickups and Jeep sport utility vehicles to drive its growth in the American market.The results, at least financially, have been stellar. Profits have surged and market share has expanded at the expense of Fiat Chrysler\u2019s rivals.But Fiat Chrysler\u2019s chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, acknowledged on Monday that his company needed more high-mileage models, and the hybrid minivan was a good starting point.9 Photos\u201cThe 2025 numbers are very high numbers,\u201d Mr. Marchionne said at a news conference. \u201cYou look around the show at all the hybrids and the electrification as being a solution to the rules in 2025.\u201dThe hybrid minivan is powered by a battery charge that can cover 30 miles of driving, at which point a gasoline engine kicks in to extend its range. The company estimates that the vehicle will achieve an equivalent of 80 m.p.g. in city driving.One hybrid alone will not improve Fiat Chrysler\u2019s corporate average fuel numbers enough to meet the coming standards. Last year, the company\u2019s fleetwide average was about 22 miles per gallon \u2014 making it one of the least fuel-efficient companies in the industry.Mr. Marchionne said the company would improve its average by continuing to improve the mileage of its conventional gasoline-powered vehicles, as well as by adding hybrids.Fiat Chrysler is also preparing for stricter federal rules on pollutants by purchasing emissions credits from competitors like Tesla, which can easily meet the standards by virtue of its all-electric product lineup.Mr. Marchionne said that Fiat Chrysler had to balance how much to spend on new technologies that improve fuel efficiency and cut pollution with the opportunity to buy credits that help it meet emissions standards.\u201cWe will get technology, but at a price,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cost associated with the plug-in minivan is not inconsequential.\u201dBuying emissions credits from other carmakers is part of the overall effort to comply with government standards. \u201cIt would be nonsensical for us not to utilize that market,\u201d he said.Other automakers are also adding vehicles to their lineups that can help improve fleetwide fuel-economy numbers.Mark Reuss, head of global product development at General Motors, said his company was improving fuel economy across its lineup with smaller, more efficient gasoline engines, aerodynamic designs and reductions in vehicle weight.But G.M. still needs new vehicles like the all-electric Chevrolet Bolt to make substantial gains in corporatewide fuel economy.\u201cIt is a zero-emission vehicle, so there are a lot of credits for vehicles like the Bolt,\u201d Mr. Reuss said. \u201cOur plan is to improve fuel economy on all fronts, from taking weight out of new models to introducing game-changers like the Bolt.\u201dThe average fuel economy of vehicles sold in the United States had been improving steadily until gas prices plunged to $2 a gallon last year.Consumers have opted to buy more trucks and S.U.V.s than passenger cars in 2015, resulting in greater overall fuel consumption.In December, the average fuel economy of a new vehicle sold in the United States was 24.9 miles per gallon, according to the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. That was the first time in two years that the average fell below 25 miles per gallon, according to figures compiled by the institute.One analyst said that automakers could hardly be blamed for meeting high demand for pickups and S.U.V.s, even if it set back their fuel-efficiency goals.\u201cThe government is regulating what automakers have to produce to meet new standards, but it isn\u2019t what consumers want to buy,\u201d said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with the firm Autotrader.On Monday, Ford Motor displayed its Fusion midsize passenger car, which also is offered in a hybrid version and a plug-in variation.Ford executives said the company was trying to offer electrification options on as many of its vehicles as possible. That way it could respond more quickly to shifts in consumer tastes if gas prices rose.\u201cEvery company has to work hard to achieve these new standards,\u201d Ms. Krebs said. \u201cSome, like Fiat Chrysler, need to do more than others because they have been relying on trucks and Jeeps to keep their sales growing.\u201dNew fuel-economy rules are not the only area where automakers and federal regulators are grappling with vehicle improvements.Companies have been meeting with officials of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recently to come up with voluntary guidelines to improve vehicle safety. The talks follow record numbers of recalls in the industry, and aggressive enforcement actions by regulators \u2014 including the imposition of big fines for safety violations.Fiat Chrysler, for example, has been hit with $175 million in fines for delaying recalls and failing to follow reporting rules.\u201cAs unpleasant as I find these fines, I understand what prompted them,\u201d said Mr. Marchionne, adding that he expected more cooperation between auto companies and the safety agency in the future.Reuters, citing company officials, reported on Monday that an agreement with regulators on voluntary safety guidelines was imminent.

{"Headline": "Ayatollah Khamenei Warns Iran\u2019s Government Against U.S. \u2018Deceptions\u2019", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported byThe comments came amid indications that an influential panel had disqualified hundreds or perhaps thousands of reformists from running in February elections for Parliament or the Assembly of Experts, whose responsibilities include choosing the next supreme leader.While there has not yet been any official confirmation of the disqualifications, the possibility added to the growing recognition that the supreme leader will not allow Mr. Rouhani to extend his foreign policy achievements into more domestic freedoms, as he once promised to do.That would smack of American influence in hard-liners\u2019 eyes, and Ayatollah Khamenei was adamant that Iran\u2019s ideological enemy was still not to be trusted.\u201cThe deceptions and breaches of promises by arrogant governments, in particular America, on this issue and other issues, should not be neglected,\u201d Ayatollah Khamenei said in the letter.Ayatollah Khamenei urged Mr. Rouhani to be on his guard. \u201cThe comments made by some American politicians in the last two, three days are cause for deep suspicion,\u201d he wrote.But the warnings also reflect a pattern that goes to the heart of Iran\u2019s opaque and factionalized political system and was visible throughout the nuclear negotiations, as Ayatollah Khamenei played both sides of Iran\u2019s divide between reformers and hard-liners. While praising the work of the negotiators, he frequently laid down \u201cred lines\u201d that seemed to reassure the hard-liners that Iran would not be bullied.That dynamic seems to be playing out in the aftermath of the nuclear deal, with the supreme leader coming down hard on anything or anyone seeming to promote greater freedoms, as the latest dispute underlines.On Sunday, an ally of the president, Hossein Marashi, a reformist leader, said that out of 3,000 reformist candidates who had registered nationwide, only 33 had been allowed to participate. While there is a 20-day appeal period, few analysts think the Guardian Council, which vets candidates for all elections and is dominated by hard-liners, would radically alter its decisions.In the Tehran metropolitan area, Iran\u2019s most populous, only four reformists out of 760 candidates were pronounced qualified to run, one newspaper affiliated with that faction, Arman-e Emrouz, wrote on Monday.Hard-liners said the reformists were trying to make the council look bad by registering thousands of candidates they knew lacked the credentials to qualify. \u201cTheir plan is now to undermine the legality of the Guardian Council,\u201d said Hamidreza Taraghi, a political analyst close to the hard-line camp. \u201cBut even so-called hard-liners have been disqualified. These people just want to create tension.\u201dBut reformists argued that the council, like other hard-line factions, was overly sensitive to hints of liberalizing and eager to crack down on anybody who was at all critical of how the country was run. \u201cWith or without the nuclear deal, all of them would be disqualified,\u201d said Farshad Ghorbanpour, an analyst with close ties to Mr. Rouhani. \u201cThey simply can\u2019t stand criticism.\u201dAyatollah Khamenei, in his letter to Mr. Rouhani, also sought to remind the Iranian government that the country had paid a heavy price for the lifting of sanctions, and that no one should be cheerful about the outcome. \u201cWritings and statements that try to ignore this truth and pretend that we are indebted to the Western side are not behaving in a sincere manner toward the public opinion of the people,\u201d he wrote.The lifting of sanctions alone is not enough to revive Iran\u2019s economy, Ayatollah Khamenei wrote, adding that the government must focus on economic policies that promote self-sufficiency and create an \u201ceconomy of resistance.\u201dThe ayatollah said nothing in his letter about the prisoner agreement between Iran and the United States reached over the weekend, in which Iran released five Americans, including four dual citizens, and the United States released seven Iranians, including six dual citizens.Three of the prisoners freed by Iran, Amir Hekmati, Jason Rezaian and Saeed Abedini, who were reunited with relatives from the United States while undergoing medical checks at American military facilities in Germany, are expected to return home soon.Mr. Hekmati, 32, spoke publicly for the first time about his ordeal in a brief appearance Tuesday outside Landstuhl Regional Medical Center. A Marine veteran, he was the American held the longest in Iran, serving a 10-year term since August 2011. He was accused of aiding a hostile power.\u201cI was at a point where I had just sort of accepted the fact that I was going to be spending 10 years in prison, so this was a surprise, and I just feel truly blessed to see my government do so much for me and the other Americans,\u201d he said.Rick Gladstone contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Larger, but Quieter Than Bundy, Push to Take Over Federal Land", "Date": "2016-01-10", "News": "Supported byDENVER \u2014 Ken Ivory, a Republican state representative from Utah, has been roaming the West with an alluring pitch to cattle ranchers, farmers and conservatives upset with how Washington controls the wide-open public spaces out here: This land is your land, he says, and not the federal government\u2019s.Mr. Ivory, a business lawyer from suburban Salt Lake City, does not fit the profile of a sun-scoured sagebrush rebel. But he is part of a growing Republican-led movement pushing the federal government to hand over to the states millions of acres of Western public lands \u2014 as well as their rich stores of coal, timber and grazing grass.\u201cIt\u2019s like having your hands on the lever of a modern-day Louisiana Purchase,\u201d said Mr. Ivory, who founded the American Lands Council and until recently was its president. The Utah-based group is funded mostly by donations from county governments, but has received support from Americans for Prosperity, the group backed by the billionaire Koch brothers.Many conservatives \u2014 Mr. Ivory among them \u2014 criticized Mr. Bundy\u2019s gun-toting tactics, but their grievances and goals are nearly identical. And the outcry has grown amid a dust storm of rural anger at President Obama\u2019s efforts to tighten regulations on fracking, air quality, small streams and other environmental issues that put struggling Western counties at odds with conservation advocates.In the past few years, lawmakers across the West have offered up dozens of bills and resolutions seeking to take over the federal lands inside their borders or to study how to do so. Some of the legislation has been aimed at Congress, to urge it to radically revise the laws that have shaped 550,000 square miles of national forests and terrain run by the federal Bureau of Land Management, stretching from the Great Plains to the Pacific.The effort \u2014 derided by critics as a pipe dream that would put priceless landscapes on the auction block \u2014 has achieved little so far. Utah is the only state to pass a law demanding that Washington hand over federal land to the state. That transfer never happened, so now, Republicans on a state land commission are pressing for a $14 million lawsuit to claim 31.2 million federal acres of canyons, scrub desert and rolling mesas. The state\u2019s attorney general, a Republican, has said he is studying the case and will make a decision about whether to move forward.An armed protest at a remote federal wildlife refuge was the latest flare-up in a decades-long struggle over control of federal land.Colorado\u2019s experience illustrates how the land-transfer discussion far exceeds any concrete results. Last year, a Republican state senator from the agricultural eastern plains sponsored a bill to create a Colorado Federal Land Management Commission, to study turning over federal lands to the state. The measure never made it out of the Republican-controlled State Senate.In Congress, Republicans have supported moves to set up a land-transfer fund and create a \u201cframework\u201d to hand federal acres to the states. Last week, Representative Greg Walden, the Republican who represents the Oregon district where the Bundy takeover is playing out, stood up in Congress to deplore the tactics of the armed protesters, but sympathized with their frustration. \u201cMore than half of my district is under federal management, or lack thereof,\u201d Mr. Walden said, expressing anger at the Bureau of Land Management. \u201cThey have come out with these proposals to close roads into the forests. They have ignored public input.\u201dA small group of armed protesters have seized parts of a wildlife sanctuary \u2014 putting a rural Oregon county in the spotlight.In July 2014, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas proposed preventing the federal government from owning more than half of any state\u2019s land. (Five states are more than half federal land, according to a Congressional Research Service report.) And Representative Cresent Hardy, Republican of Nevada, whose district includes a ranch run by Mr. Bundy\u2019s father, introduced a measure that would block the government from buying any new land unless it could pass a balanced budget.But land experts say the movement offers few details about what would happen the day after the federal government handed over all its land. How would states afford hundreds of rangers, officers and administrators to keep the land safe and comply with complicated federal laws on environmental policy and protecting endangered species? Would the land stay public, or be sold off to the highest bidder?\u201cAll I did was drive down a canyon road,\u201d Mr. Lyman said. \u201cIt seems to be getting worse, and the federal agencies, they are expanding. Their restraints are being overstepped. It\u2019s not the way this country was set up. It\u2019s not the founders\u2019 design.\u201dNot surprisingly, environmental activists have opposed dismantling federal lands, but so have hunters and anglers who worry their elk-hunting grounds and trout streams would be sold to private hands and developed. Unlike the federal government, many states require that their land be used as profitably as possible.About an hour\u2019s drive from the wildlife refuge where Mr. Bundy\u2019s group is facing off with the government, Erin Maupin and her husband, Jeff, pay the government each summer to feed their cattle on 19,000 acres of federally owned land. She said that like many ranchers, they wanted to work with the government, but that layers of grazing restrictions and environmental rules were getting out of hand.\u201cWe want somebody to make sure we\u2019re doing it right,\u201d Ms. Maupin said. \u201cBut it\u2019s got to the point where there\u2019s no common sense in it.\u201dThe resentments toward federal land managers feel sharpest in economically strapped rural counties from Arizona to Montana, where up to 90 percent of the lands are federally managed. People love the beauty that surrounds them, but seethe at policies that they say have whittled away logging and mining jobs, left national forests vulnerable to wildfires and blocked access to public land.\u201cThe land policies now are, basically, lock it up and throw away the key,\u201d said Leland Pollock, a commissioner in Garfield County, Utah, a county roughly the size of Connecticut with pine forests and stunning red-rock spires. \u201cIt\u2019s land with no use. The local economy\u2019s really suffered as a result. Grazing has been reduced. We used to have a thriving timber industry \u2014 that\u2019s all but gone.\u201dJack Healy reported from Denver, and Kirk Johnson from Burns, Ore.

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had been expecting earnings of 26 cents a share.Revenue in the quarter rose about 4 percent, to $19.8 billion, on par with what analysts expected.\u201cWe saw solid customer activity in loan growth, deposits and wealth management asset flows, and we returned more capital to our shareholders,\u201d the bank\u2019s chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, said in a statement.It was the fourth consecutive quarter that Bank of America reported higher profit from the year earlier period.The results were also helped by relatively strong investment banking results. Sales and trading revenue increased 11 percent in the quarter, bolstered by strong activity in the bank\u2019s fixed income, currencies and commodities unit.Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks\u2019 bottom lines.The bank\u2019s fourth-quarter results were muted somewhat by the impact of dropping oil prices.The bank said provisions for credit losses increased $264 million in the fourth quarter, related to higher charge-offs and increased reserves.Last week, Citigroup reported a large increase in reserves, while Wells Fargo said its losses had increased from the third quarter because of low oil prices.Until now, investors have figured that many customers of the large United States banks will actually benefit from the turmoil in the energy markets because low oil price will give them more spending money.But the oil-price drop to below $30 a barrel is destabilizing the vast oil and gas industry, which has borrowed billions from banks like Bank of America to drill wells and explore new reserves. Already, some companies are on the verge of bankruptcy and the collateral backing their loans is shedding value, raising the prospect of large losses in the banking system.For now, executives at the largest banks have said the losses are manageable and oil and gas exposure is not a big percentage of overall loans.Still, bank stocks have been getting hammered since the start of the year, when the stock market turned volatile amid the collapse in oil prices and concern about China\u2019s slowing economy.

{"Headline": "Iran Opens for Business", "Date": "2016-01-18", "News": "Supported bySome people cannot stand good news. It troubles their fixed view of the world. These would include Senator Marco Rubio, the Republican presidential candidate, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who were cast into a huff by the confirmed reversal of Iran\u2019s nuclear program and its release of several Americans, including Jason Rezaian of The Washington Post.Try a smile, guys. Toughness is no more than empty aggression when it will not admit to misjudgment. Diplomacy delivers.Rezaian is coming home after a year and a half of groundless imprisonment. An American pastor and a former Marine will be reunited with their families. Iran had more than 19,000 first-generation centrifuges installed; that number is now 6,104. Its advanced centrifuges have been slashed from over 1,000 to zero. Its low-enriched uranium stockpile has been cut to 660 pounds from over 19,000.The plutonium route to a bomb has been cut off. Iran is subject to what President Obama called \u201cthe most comprehensive, intrusive inspection regime ever negotiated to monitor a nuclear program.\u201d The country\u2019s \u201cbreak-out\u201d time \u2014 the period needed to rush for a bomb \u2014 has been extended to a year from two to three months.The trauma-induced Iranian-American psychosis, ongoing since the birth of the Islamic Republic in 1979, has been overcome. Two tireless diplomats, Secretary of State John Kerry and the University of Denver-educated Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, speak when needed. American sailors who strayed into Iranian waters are released within 24 hours. A financial dispute outstanding since 1981 is resolved. The world\u2019s 18th-largest economy is about to rejoin the world at a time when the sinking global economy sure could use a jolt. The nuclear deal, even in these early days, is not hermetic. It opens doors.To all of which Rubio responds that Obama has put \u201ca price on the head of every American abroad\u201d when he should have used \u201ccrippling sanctions\u201d (oh, please, not that crippled phrase again). Netanyahu actually claims that if it were not for Israel \u201cleading the way\u201d on sanctions, \u201cIran would have had a nuclear weapon long ago.\u201d Iran, he baritones, \u201chas not relinquished its ambition to obtain nuclear weapons.\u201dThat may be \u2014 or not. We can all go guessing in the Iranian bazaar. Nothing comes cheaper than an Iran pontificator.What is clear is that Iran is much further from a nuclear weapon because of the courageous diplomacy of Obama and Kerry and Zarif and the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, who all confronted hostile constituencies at home to get the deal done.For Iran, the arrival of \u201cimplementation day\u201d means the lifting of all nuclear-related sanctions and access to about $100 billion in frozen assets. A big nation is open for business again, back in the global financial system and world oil market.Netanyahu, Rubio and their ilk believe Iran will use the windfall to do its worst. That cannot be discounted. The United States and Iran remain hostile on most fronts, from Syria to Israel. Revolutionary Guard hard-liners have not drunk the Kool-Aid at the Rouhani-Zarif school of diplomacy. Obama\u2019s imposition of mild new sanctions for banned missile tests was a reminder of differences.But if the developments of recent days demonstrate one thing, it is that Iran, 37 years from its revolution, is delicately poised between hard-liners and reformers, neither of whom can dictate the country\u2019s course, each of whom need the other for now. Imminent parliamentary elections may indicate which camp is ascendant. Whatever happens, it is hard to argue that greater contact with the world will be bad for the large, modernizing, highly educated younger generation. Iran is a pro-American country with a tired anti-American refrain. It has a successful diaspora community ready to help revive the country \u2014 if allowed to do so.The breakthrough with Iran is Obama\u2019s greatest foreign policy achievement, one that may have a transformative effect on the region. The next decade will show to what degree. That potential is what has American allies from Saudi Arabia to Israel so perturbed. They preferred the status quo.Of course it could all unravel. Predicting Doomsday is easy. But with hard work, I believe the chances are greater that American-Iranian diplomatic relations will be restored within five years.The Economist had a good summary of why Iran\u2019s reintegration is so important and consequential. It noted that \u201cthe prospects in a post-deal Iran are vast.\u201d The country is not \u201can oil-soaked rentier state,\u201d like some of its neighbors, but a \u201cregional power with an industrial economy\u201d \u2014 if a grossly mismanaged one. Its population of 80 million is well-educated, its oil and gas reserves enormous. The country\u2019s pent-up need for foreign investment may amount to $1 trillion. Iran, it concluded, is \u201cpreparing for takeoff.\u201dTry saying the word Iran without saying the word \u201cnuclear.\u201d It\u2019s time.

Thank God for radio and print, I thought.I\u2019m not sure how many presidential candidates I\u2019ve interviewed over the years. Too many to count. Some of the candidates resonated with Iowans, others didn\u2019t. In 2008, Barack Obama and Mike Huckabee got some love; Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, John McCain and Rudy Giuliani didn\u2019t. Some play the media like a violin, others are clueless. Some understand how crucial local coverage is, others don\u2019t.I remember back in 2012 when Sarah Palin was still considering running. She was in town making an appearance and her security waved me through. Later that evening during a pause in activities, I asked the security director why he let me approach. \u201cThe suspenders,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd wrong side of 50.\u201dIn 2008, Joe Biden was great. He made all of us small media guys and gals feel as if we\u2019d known him forever. Joe was never in a hurry. Never \u201ctoo busy.\u201d Hillary? \u201cToo busy.\u201d She occasionally dipped her toe into the waters of rural Iowa, but preferred our larger cities. (Yoo-hoo, Hillary! I\u2019m right here!)Mitt Romney gave me a couple of interviews, but his staff wouldn\u2019t let him out of arm\u2019s reach, and I felt as if I was a quarterback with a mike in the middle of a football huddle.In 2012 Rick Santorum was around so much, it was like he was a neighbor. He fit in just fine \u2014 sweater vest and all. In 2007, Chris Dodd, a Democratic senator from Connecticut, moved into the state, but it didn\u2019t help him. He looked too much like lots of city folk do: afraid he was going to step in a pile of cow poop.At a summit on agriculture in Des Moines in 2015, when all the original candidates were in the race, Republicans seemed to know very little about agriculture. Mr. Bush, George Pataki and Rick Perry were somewhat conversant with agricultural issues. The rest appeared to think food magically appeared on grocery-store shelves. The national media, from what I could tell, were equally clueless. Every corner of this country is different. People in Montana might be concerned about the loss of glaciers in Montana. In California, the drought. In Louisiana, the oil industry. In Texas, border issues. In coastal New England, the fishing industry.Martin O\u2019Malley had to Google the price of corn and beans \u2014 not a good thing to have to do in Iowa. Lindsey Graham knew the price of corn and beans, but not much else about Iowa\u2019s economy.Years ago, I remember Mr. Obama made a lot of time for locals, and answered our questions. All of them. Why had Mr. Obama singled us out rather than someone with big names? \u201cYou are the media who live here,\u201d a staffer told me, \u201cwho the community knows and trusts.\u201dIn local media, most of us have worked hard to be respected in our communities. People know our personalities, our biases, and are interested in how the candidates interact with us. Sure, the big media asks great questions about the economy, foreign affairs, health care, you name it. But my questions might be a little different, like, what do you think about the low prices of corn and beans? What can be done about the deteriorating lock-and-dam system on the Mississippi River that stops us from getting the soybeans to China they so desperately want? I know what Iowans want asked because I\u2019m one of them.Back at the Jeb Bush scene, he was being ushered to another event. I left my perch near the tree and followed. It felt as if Mr. Bush and his entourage had the whole production choreographed, and I was the only one who didn\u2019t know the dance steps.I cut back between two parked cars and popped up in the path of Mr. Bush on the sidewalk. \u201cWho are you?\u201d he asked.\u201cBob, local radio,\u201d I said. He nodded, and I went on. \u201cOne failed corn or wheat crop and the American economy collapses. Is agriculture a national security issue?\u201dAround us the media paused. Everyone searched for the camera angles they wanted. I sucked in my tummy and tried to stand up straight.\u201cWhy, yes, it is,\u201d he replied slowly. But he had no specifics. It was a question, apparently, he\u2019d never been asked before. A staffer tapped his watch, pulling Mr. Bush away, and the rest of the media followed. I knew that I had gotten all I was going to get.Robert Leonard is the news director for KNIA/KRLS News.Advertisement"}

Perhaps you\u2019ve noticed. While America\u2019s share of industry has constricted, with fewer people needed to perform the same amount of work as in the past, it\u2019s not quite time to start eulogizing.But the way the presidential candidates have been talking about reviving manufacturing jobs has not been very enlightening, and in some cases they have been willfully obtuse. Their statements are meant to appeal to disaffected workers, but they both oversimplify the problems and ignore the real source of trouble.The problem with this sort of rhetoric is that a lot of the manufacturing jobs the United States lost over the past 50 years didn\u2019t go overseas; they simply disappeared with the advent of new technology.\u201cIt\u2019s those basically rote, repetitive tasks where you\u2019re fixing the same thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to imagine any of those positions coming back. Basically, a robot is a lot more affordable than a human employee.\u201dThe skills needed to work on a factory floor today are quite different than they were 20, 10 or even five years ago. Don\u2019t blame stingy companies or over-regulation by the government; blame the rapid progress of technology.\u201cMy fear is that the Republicans to date may not fully understand what modern advanced manufacturing is,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily thousands of people pouring into the plant as in the old days.\u201dInstead of talking down to blue-collar workers, candidates should admit that trying to restore manufacturing to what it once was in this country is not an attainable, or even a desirable, goal. This is not to say the government should not work to bring jobs back to the United States, or that manufacturing as an industry is not valuable to the American economy. But many of the jobs politicians want to restore aren\u2019t on the table anymore.It sounded as if Mr. Rubio believed employers should suddenly realize that machine labor is cheaper than human labor \u2014 though that\u2019s been the case for a long time. Machines are cheaper than people, marginal wage increase or not. Yet Mr. Rubio has a point: Automation has fundamentally changed the manufacturing industry. We don\u2019t, however, need to respond to the shrinking manufacturing job market by becoming all-out technophobes.There\u2019s no easy answer on how best to foster innovation, though. Even the most enticing tax incentives are unlikely to make companies fire their robots and hire back assembly-line workers. Some of the burden lies with American companies to bring production back home \u2014 which actually could be less of a burden than they might think, according to some economists.Mr. Huckabee is right; the United States doesn\u2019t \u201chave\u201d to move away from manufacturing. It\u2019s just that advancing economies like this one inevitably sacrifice some labor for innovation, just as the United States and other developed countries did over the past century when it came to agriculture.If we\u2019re going to move away from anything, let\u2019s leave behind stock stump speeches on factories. They\u2019re not going to get anyone a job \u2014 especially not in the White House.Emma Roller, a former reporter for National Journal, is a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nigeria Goes to the Mall", "Date": "2016-01-05", "News": "Supported byWarri JournalWARRI, Nigeria \u2014 Groups of children wandered inside, wide-eyed at the plenty. Teenagers and adults took selfies and group photos, raving about the convenience, the security, the leisure and, not least, the air-conditioning, so silent, omnipresent and soothing.Others were \u201cJohnny-Just-Come\u201d first-time visitors, standing confused before sensor-activated doors. They drew smiles from veterans who had already been once or twice to the newest and biggest attraction in this Nigerian city in recent memory: a gleaming shopping mall.\u201cI\u2019m very, very, very excited,\u201d said John Monday, who had traveled nearly 200 miles to visit the mall here on a recent Saturday afternoon, as a friend took a photo of him posing in front of a supermarket. \u201cA middle-class person can come into this mall and feel a sense of belonging.\u201dThe emergence of malls \u2014 and mall culture \u2014 in Nigeria reflects broad trends on the continent, including a growing middle class with spending power and the rapid expansion of cities like Warri that are little known outside the region.As in America, malls in Nigeria have quickly become hangouts for the young and destinations for families. Their rarity also imbue a sense of exclusivity.Pushing a shopping cart full of food and the latest Chinese smartphone, Wealth Mark, 22, strolled through Delta Mall with his younger sister, Confidence, and her friend, Franca, all with wide smiles. Mr. Mark stopped to take photos of the two young women with the smartphone, then a selfie of all three.\u201cWhen I am meeting my friends here or in Lagos, we always go to the mall,\u201d said Mr. Mark, who does marketing for a bar-code company owned by an older sister. \u201cWe can just spend a few hours at the mall and relax.\u201dEven older Nigerians who were skeptical about paying premium prices over traditional markets saw the mall\u2019s value as a family outing.\u201cMy kids enjoyed it,\u201d said Victor Omunu, 53, adding that he would never shop for himself at the mall. \u201cI bought them ice cream. It\u2019s not bad at all, the mall. I was happy because I was with my family. I even met some old friends.\u201dThe malls, like the new cars that have replaced the beat-up tokunbos (roughly, used cars) on Nigerian roads, provide visible confirmation that, despite the country\u2019s many problems, life has become materially better for many in recent years. Besides shops, the malls have brought leisure activities, like going to the movies and dining at food courts.\u201cThese are things we are used to seeing outside Nigeria,\u201d said Mr. Monday, 28, a gas turbine operator, who first experienced mall culture when he visited an aunt living in Scotland in his early 20s. Now, a mall is scheduled to open in his hometown, Uyo, late this year. \u201cI will be going there frequently,\u201d he said.One of the main cities in Nigeria\u2019s oil-producing region, Warri has grown rapidly in recent years, like many other medium-size cities in the country. New housing developments are clustered on the outskirts.The size of Nigeria\u2019s middle class, as well as Africa\u2019s, varies according to the definitions used. But many experts agree that Nigeria\u2019s size and population growth will drive the expansion of Africa\u2019s middle class.Standard Bank, a South African bank with branches across the continent, estimated that Nigeria\u2019s middle class grew by 600 percent from 2000 to 2014. While 4.1 million Nigerian households are now considered middle class, or 11 percent of the total population, an additional 7.6 million households would make it into that category by 2030, according to the bank\u2019s projections.Resilient Africa, a South African joint venture that includes Shoprite, the continent\u2019s biggest food retailer, built the mall here. It is working on five other malls in other cities and looking to secure four more sites, said Eddie McDonald, who heads Resilient\u2019s Nigerian operations.\u201cThe retail trade in Nigeria is still in its infancy stage, but growing,\u201d he said.Informal shops, individually run, are still thriving. Street hawkers sell food, clothes and home appliances on sidewalks, or wherever they can find a captive audience, like Nigeria\u2019s epic traffic jams, known as go-slows. The hawkers often compete directly with the malls, selling their wares to people driving into parking lots next to retailers like Game, a discount superstore owned by Walmart.Here in Warri, people have traditionally bought clothes at the hundreds of tiny shops in Igbo Market, named after the ethnic group that dominates the business. Once a year, shop owners travel to southern China where, with the help of locally based Nigerian middlemen, they buy goods and ship them here.Ebere Chukwu, 38, a shop owner since 1999, said he had been to Delta Mall with his family, but only \u201cto feed my eyes.\u201d\u201cThat place looked like abroad, it looked like America,\u201d he said.But Mr. Chukwu was confident that longtime customers would not desert Igbo Market for the mall. The market\u2019s prices are cheaper.Esther Ogbolu, who was shopping for shoes at Igbo Market, said she had found the mall unaffordable, though she spoke approvingly of its air-conditioning, smiling at the memory.But to other businessmen, like Matthew Asegiemhe, the future lies in the mall. Since opening a clothing store, Button Up, in the city five years ago, he has seen sales rise 15 percent to 20 percent each year, and decided to open a branch in the mall.\u201cMiddle-class customers are increasing \u2014 that\u2019s why,\u201d Mr. Asegiemhe said.Anderson Williams, 25, an employee at a road construction company, was on his fourth trip to the mall \u2014 shopping for pants and arranging to buy a leather sofa set on installment. He did not mind paying more.\u201cI love the mall, the whole environment entirely,\u201d he said. \u201cI love the AC especially.\u201dThere were future consumers, too, like the seven young brothers and sisters wandering through the supermarket aisles, often releasing squeals of surprise and delight.\u201cThere\u2019s anything you want,\u201d said Fatima Mohammed, 10. \u201cThere are shoes, medicine, there is cake, everything you want.\u201dAt a ribbon-cutting ceremony at Aroma Foodland, the first restaurant to open in the food court, the mall\u2019s manager, Olushola Oni, led the group in prayer, standing before a counter with meat pies, sandwiches, egusi soup and pounded yam.\u201cThis eatery will go to places in the name of Jesus,\u201d he said to a resounding \u201camen.\u201dGodwin Isemede and his son, Emmanuel, 7, were among the restaurant\u2019s first customers. An engineer at a cellphone company, Mr. Isemede said he would now buy his clothes here, not in the United States during his yearly visits. He would no longer have to drive to Enugu, about 200 miles east of here, to visit the mall there to please his son.\u201cPeople now have somewhere to go to in Warri,\u201d Mr. Isemede said. \u201cThere was no life here before.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gulf States Guarding Their Interests in Saudi-Iran Rift", "Date": "2016-01-05", "News": "Supported byCAIRO \u2014 For all the diplomatic dominoes that have fallen across the Middle East in recent days, with ambassadors from different countries flying home as a result of the explosive rift between Saudi Arabia and Iran, the map of allegiances has not significantly altered.Certainly, several countries offered muscular shows of solidarity to Saudi Arabia after an Iranian mob attacked its embassy in Tehran over the weekend, prompting a crisis that has put the United States in a bind and has threatened to set back the prospects for a resolution to the conflict in Syria.By Tuesday, Kuwait had recalled its ambassador to Iran, the United Arab Emirates had downgraded its diplomatic relationship, and Bahrain and Sudan had joined Saudi Arabia in severing its relationship with Tehran entirely.Yet many other Sunni Muslim countries signaled that they intended to take a more measured approach to the argument \u2014 sympathizing with Saudi Arabia, a rich and powerful ally, but also determined to avoid getting sucked into a harmful conflict with Iran, a country governed by Shiite clerics, with potentially grave costs.\u201cThe smaller Gulf states are worried they will get caught in the middle,\u201d said Michael Stephens, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London. \u201cIt worries them greatly that things could go badly.\u201dSome countries, like Turkey, Egypt and Pakistan, are already battling their own domestic insurgencies. Others are keen to guard their strategic interests or to keep the door open to trade with Iran while there is a prospect of American sanctions being lifted.Qatar, which shares with Iran access to the world\u2019s largest natural gas field in the Persian Gulf, has yet to declare its hand. Oman has also been quiet, sticking to its longstanding position of neutrality on Saudi Arabia and Iran.In Turkey, where senior officials have warned about the impact of the crisis on a \u201cpowder keg\u201d region, Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu offered his country\u2019s services to help resolve the conflict peacefully.\u201cDiplomatic channels must be given a chance immediately,\u201d Mr. Davutoglu said Tuesday at a meeting of his Justice and Development Party in the capital, Ankara. Frosty relations between Turkey and Saudi Arabia have warmed in recent months. But even in Pakistan, which for decades has had a close alliance with Saudi Arabia, there is a marked reluctance to plunge into the crisis.On Tuesday, the Pakistani prime minister\u2019s foreign affairs adviser, Sartaj Aziz, warned Parliament that the crisis posed a \u201cgrave danger\u201d to the Muslim world. He did not hint at any possible diplomatic moves against Iran, emphasizing instead that Pakistan would work toward \u201ceasing tensions.\u201d Although Pakistan has received substantial Saudi financing to bolster its flagging economy, the government in Islamabad also faces pressure from its sizable Shiite minority, and it plans to develop a major gas pipeline with Iran to solve its energy crisis.Another Saudi ally, Egypt, has received billions of dollars in assistance from Saudi Arabia in recent years. In a visit to Riyadh on Tuesday, Egypt\u2019s foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry, reaffirmed their nations\u2019 alliance, saying, \u201cThe security of the kingdom is an integral part of Egypt\u2019s security.\u201d But Egypt\u2019s room for maneuver against Iran is limited. Cairo severed official ties with Tehran in 1989, although there have been sporadic efforts in recent years to revive them.Mr. Stephens, the analyst, said countries with their own insurgencies were unlikely to do much for Saudi Arabia beyond offering words of support.\u201cThe Turks have a problem with the Kurds, the Egyptians have difficulties in Sinai, and the Pakistanis have their own issues,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will publicly support the Saudis, but they don\u2019t have the energy or military strength for anything more.\u201dThere is little doubt that many Gulf countries share Saudi Arabia\u2019s concerns about Iran, whose support for armed groups in Syria and Iraq has contributed to a burst of sectarian warfare across the Middle East. Many were also offended by the attacks on Saudi diplomatic buildings over the weekend, which followed the execution of a Shiite cleric, Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, in Saudi Arabia on Saturday.Western countries fear that a deepening divide in the region could scuttle efforts to negotiate an end to the Syrian crisis and defeat the Islamic State. The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, told reporters on Tuesday that it was not in the interest of the leaders of Saudi Arabia or Iran \u201cto continue to foment the kind of violence that often leads to radicalization and terrorism.\u201dYet the showdown is another reminder of Saudi Arabia\u2019s limited ability, despite all its great wealth, to bend its allies to its will. The two most powerful countries to move against Iran, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, have taken diplomatic half-steps that could easily be reversed if this storm were to blow over. And Yemen, where the Saudis are backing the government as it tries to repel a rebellion by Shiite rebels known as Houthis, has demonstrated the limits of Saudi military power.Although Saudi Arabia triggered the current dispute by executing Sheikh Nimr, a firebrand who had led popular protests in eastern Saudi Arabia, several analysts said Riyadh appeared to be acting from a position of weakness, or at least frustration. The Saudi economy is straining, the country is embroiled in conflicts in Syria and Yemen, and its leaders worry about the prospect of an American rapprochement with Iran.\u201cThey are under pressure on so many fronts,\u201d said Toby Matthiesen, a research fellow at St. Antony\u2019s College, Oxford, and author of a book on Saudi Shiites.There are signs that Iran is feeling the strain of international condemnation.On Tuesday, a commander of Iran\u2019s hard-line military group condemned the storming of the Saudi Embassy in Tehran as an \u201cugly, unjustifiable act.\u201d It was a sign, according to some analysts, that hard-liners in the Iranian regime might regret not having done more to keep the protests under control, and that they might have been taken aback by the vehemence of the international response.The statement could have been a sign of factionalism inside the Iranian regime, said Mr. Matthiesen.\u201cThis is one way of getting at the reformists inside Iran,\u201d he said. \u201cThe two key issues under debate are the negotiations with the United States, and reaching out to the Saudis. Now that relations with the Saudis have been severed, the non-reformists will be empowered.\u201dThomas Erdbrink contributed reporting from Tehran.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rockefeller Foundation to Take Food-Waste Fight to Davos", "Date": "2016-01-21", "News": "Supported byThe Rockefeller Foundation plans to announce here on Thursday that it is kicking off a $130 million initiative to reduce food waste around the world. The wide-ranging plan will stretch from thrown-out crops to excess food at the dinner table.\u201cThe idea is that if you could really reduce food waste across the value chain, you could feed people across the planet,\u201d Judith Rodin, the foundation\u2019s president, said in an interview here. \u201cThis is a people play, a profits play and a planet play.\u201dThe idea for the initiative arose from conversations with the president of Iceland about six to seven years ago, Ms. Rodin said. Fishermen from that country complained that they were needlessly trashing countless fish heads, bones and tails when such grist could instead be sold to African countries where the pieces are prized for soup.That led to discussions about how to clamp down on waste across the spectrum of food production and consumption, which were further spurred by the World Economic Forum\u2019s focus on issues like food security.To carry out the initiative, the Rockefeller Foundation plans to enlist companies and governments to roll out a series of waste-reduction programs. Much of the focus will be on the developing world, where making fuller use of food could have a big impact.Ms. Rodin estimated that up to 40 percent of crops in developing countries are lost before they make it to market. Small farmers could band together to improve their negotiating power with customers, she said, and they could benefit from sharing technologies that improve the longevity of their harvests.The Rockefeller Foundation has already begun working with private sector partners in Africa, including Coca-Cola and mango farmers in Kenya, and the West African conglomerate Dangote Group for its tomato orders in Nigeria.The players most easy to persuade to participate could be big companies that are already clamping down on waste that creates millions of dollars in unnecessary costs.\u201cHere, we have been pushing against an open door,\u201d Ms. Rodin said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Cameron Rowland\u2019s \u201891020000,\u2019 Disquieting Sculptures", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byArt ReviewMr. Rowland, who was born in Philadelphia in 1988 and earned a B.A. in studio art from Wesleyan University, has been exhibiting for less than five years but has become known for his carefully chosen, sometimes arcane use of existing objects. \u201cBait, Inc.,\u201d his 2014 solo show at Essex Street Gallery on the Lower East Side, included scavenged materials like copper and car parts that can generate underground economies. An underlying theme was the way investors and government profit from the new workfare programs begun in 1996.In his Artists Space show, \u201c91020000,\u201d Mr. Rowland deals with a not-too-visible economy that is especially dependent on cheap inmate labor. He presents ready-made objects as sculpture but also as charged, disturbing evidence. Much of what we see here has been made by inmates in state prisons \u2014 three in New York and one in California \u2014 one-third of whose occupants are African-Americans, who enter prison at rates that far exceed their representation in society as a whole.When you enter Artists Space, you\u2019ll see several sizable, pristine objects positioned at the edges of the generous space \u2014 marginalized, you could say. But their placement establishes instantly that Mr. Rowland is an artist who thinks spatially and sculpturally as well as politically.Before us stands a generic desk of metal and wood-grain laminate. Seven large cast aluminum rings are arranged around a wood pallet, and two firefighting suits \u2014 one orange, one yellow \u2014 hanging on a nearby wall. In addition, lying side by side on the floor are two lashing bars, or turnbuckles, used to secure containers on ships; four wood benches grouped tightly together; and two more lashing bars are fastened to the wall, forming a large X. All but the lashing bars have been made in prisons.The objects are enlarged upon by their captions, which the artist considers a part of each piece and which are printed in an accompanying brochure. The combination draws us in, making us ponder in strictly material terms society\u2019s disparities and the price of ignoring history. The show is a calm, often devastating argument that the legacy of slavery, and forced labor dating to Reconstruction, persists in the country\u2019s prison system.In the brochure, Mr. Rowland traces the roots of racial imbalance in prisons to what has been called the re-enslavement of newly freed blacks in the South after the Civil War, a term that gained usage after Douglas A. Blackmon\u2019s searing 2009 book on the subject. Because of vague vagrancy laws and corrupt judges, black individuals, mostly men, were frequently arrested and quickly convicted, sentenced and leased to private industry, including large corporations, often to work under conditions so inhumane they died.Within a few years, states realized that inmates could build the paved roads so sorely needed for the South\u2019s commercial infrastructure and the system of leasing prisoners was superseded by chain gangs. The vagrancy laws continued, part of a network of restrictions known as Black Codes that Southern states began enacting after the 13th Amendment abolished slavery but allowed involuntary servitude as punishment for crime. As Mr. Rowland writes, these laws \u201caligned the status of ex-slave and the preconvict.\u201dThe objects here represent the continuing tradition of prison time used for discounted or so-called stolen labor that contributes to all kinds of economic development. With few exceptions, all inmates work, and for wages well below the $7.25 federal minimum wage. In New York, inmates\u2019 wages for industry jobs can be as low as 10 cents an hour and can go as high as $1.14 an hour.The products inmates make are sold by state agencies organized under the National Correctional Industries Association \u2014 New York\u2019s is called Corcraft. They can be purchased by schools, universities, courts and police departments and certain nonprofit groups. (Artists Space qualified; the show\u2019s title is its customer number with Corcraft.)The play among the a work\u2019s title, caption and material presence provokes connections that are mostly grim and occasionally benign. The wood benches are primarily used in courtrooms, although they can also make you think of churches. The office desk is titled \u201cAttica Series Desk,\u201d for the New York prison where it was made. The label also notes that when prisoners seized command of Attica\u2019s D Yard in September 1971, one of their top demands was to be paid the minimum wage.The cast-aluminum rings are used to make manhole covers level with roads, conjuring the original chain gangs. And the captions for the firefighting suits inform us that they were made in a California prison; orange suits are for that state\u2019s \u201c4,300 inmate wildland firefighters,\u201d while the yellow are for \u201cnon-inmate wildland firefighters,\u201d who are there more or less by choice.The container lashing bars are titled \u201cInsurance.\u201d Their nautical use is self-evident: They bring to mind the Middle Passage, an image intensified by the word \u201clashing.\u201d According to the labels, Lloyd\u2019s monopolized the marine insurance of slave-trading ships and around 1750 devised a classification society, Lloyd\u2019s Register, to assess a ship\u2019s level of risk for underwriters that is still used today. Thus we learn that when slave ships crowded with people stolen from their homelands sank, it was not a total loss for shipowners. The two lashing bars arranged in an X evoke burning crosses but also Leonardo\u2019s Vitruvian Man drawing.Mr. Rowland seems to have chosen his objects partly for their adamant sculptural presence and the ways they intersect with the history of recent art, conjuring the boxes of Donald Judd, the soft sculpture of Hannah Wilke, the art-furniture of Scott Burton. But their solidity, and to some extent their mobility, speaks to the absence and immobility of their makers.This work belongs equally to a long tradition of art dealing with racial issues. Adrian Piper, David Hammons, Glenn Ligon and Kara Walker are among Mr. Rowland\u2019s predecessors. Like them and various Conceptualists, he makes language and form inextricable.And like Hans Haacke, Mr. Rowland is deeply interested in economics and history. So interested, in fact, that he has devised a marketing method for his work that cuts investment and profiteering out of the picture. Mr. Rowland rents his works to collectors, at cost, for five years, at which point the lease can be renewed or the works revert to the artist.Mr. Rowland\u2019s scrutiny has a particular grinding force. Here it accrues inexorably into an argument in the form of art for reparations.

The company\u2019s chief financial officer, John Gerspach, said its borrowers were of high credit quality.Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks\u2019 bottom lines.Another trouble spot for Citigroup and other banks is the energy sector, where companies are struggling to survive as oil prices plunge.Citigroup said that it had set aside $588 million to deal with loan losses in the fourth quarter. Bank executives said about half of those reserves were related to weakness in the energy sector. Citigroup said its total exposure to the energy sector was about $58 billion, which included both funded and unfunded loan commitments.A year ago, Citigroup released $441 million in reserves, as the credit outlook remained strong and problems in the energy industry had just begun to stir. Bank officials have previously warned that collapsing oil prices would lead to higher reserves.Oil producers typically use oil as collateral for their bank loans. As the price of oil has dropped below $30 a barrel, the banks are expecting more of their loans to go unpaid.The bank\u2019s non-accrual corporate loans increased 32 percent, to $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter, largely because of strain in the oil and gas sector.Mr. Gerspach said there were no signs that the slowdown in China and the plunge in oil prices were weighing on consumers.\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any knock-on effects as yet across the portfolio,\u201d he told analysts in a conference call.A big driver of Citigroup\u2019s performance in the fourth quarter was a 23 percent drop in operating expenses. The cost-cutting went beyond the decline in legal expenses. A year ago, Citigroup paid billions of dollars to settle multiple investigations into whether the bank had manipulated the foreign exchange market and certain interest rates.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vietnam\u2019s Communist Party Gives Old-Guard Leader a New 5-Year Term", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Supported byThe reappointment of Nguyen Phu Trong, 71, could slow the pace of Vietnam\u2019s shift to a more open, market-oriented economy, but it is unlikely to alter its strategic balance in relations with China and the United States, analysts said.But his visit to the White House last July underlined a growing view among party elites that developing better relations with the United States is in Vietnam\u2019s national interest, and an essential counterweight to China\u2019s influence in the region. Mr. Trong steered Vietnam into the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an American-led trade agreement among a dozen Pacific Rim nations that excludes China.Vu Xuan Nguyet Hong, a former vice president of Vietnam\u2019s Central Institute for Economic Management, said the party\u2019s 19-member Politburo, which has more power than any single politician, was in broad agreement on the need for both domestic economic changes and better relations with the United States.\u201cThe reforms and renovation toward the market economy will continue,\u201d and Vietnam\u2019s relations with the United States will improve steadily, she said.As prime minister, Mr. Dung has overseen a wave of foreign investment and cultivated warm relations with top American officials, analysts said. He has also spoken out more forcefully than other party leaders against China\u2019s assertive claims to territory in the South China Sea and won support from ordinary Vietnamese who believe the country needs to escape China\u2019s orbit as a way of securing its economic independence.Mr. Dung, 66, is technically barred from serving another term under party rules because he is over 65 and has already served two terms as prime minister. Mr. Trong is also ineligible because he is over the age limit, but the party has apparently granted him a special exemption, for a second time.Several analysts predicted that the pace of Vietnam\u2019s already sluggish economic liberalization may slow further after Mr. Dung retires this year, in part because he has a better understanding than Mr. Trong of how to communicate with foreign investors and has been more eager to shake off the party\u2019s Marxist-Leninist ideological mantle.Tuong Vu, a political scientist at the University of Oregon, said Mr. Trong would probably be more receptive to hard-line party apparatchiks who argue against opening the country\u2019s state-dominated agricultural and service sectors to foreign competitors and against a draft law that would codify rights for nongovernmental associations in Vietnam.Both changes are seen as critical to bringing Vietnam into compliance with the Trans-Pacific Partnership. If approved by its member legislatures, that deal will require Vietnam to further open its economy to foreign competition and make concessions on labor rights, on intellectual property and in other areas.\u201cAll factions agree on a need to have more trade and investment,\u201d Professor Vu said in a telephone interview. \u201cBut the Trong faction would resist any concessions, whereas the Dung faction would try to make the gesture of reform to keep money coming in.\u201dSami Kteily, executive chairman of PEB Steel, a construction company in Ho Chi Minh City, said the country\u2019s membership in several recent trade agreements underlined its commitment to being an active member of the global economy.\u201cI think it will be business as usual,\u201d he said. \u201cVietnam is a country of institutions and policies not determined by one person.\u201dFrederick Burke, managing partner for Vietnam at the American law firm Baker & McKenzie, said the smooth leadership transition at this week\u2019s party congress was encouraging because it highlighted the country\u2019s political stability and respect for the rule of law.\u201cFor people who live here, that\u2019s what you want,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want a virtual civil war going on.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trans-Pacific Trade Pact Would Lift U.S. Incomes, but Not Jobs Overall, Study Says", "Date": "2016-01-25", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A far-reaching trade pact binding a dozen Pacific Rim nations would increase incomes, exports and growth in the United States but is unlikely to add to overall employment, according to an independent analysis released Monday.The pact would liberalize trade from Canada to Chile and Australia to Japan. Other parties to the accord are Mexico, Peru, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam and Brunei.\u201cThe T.P.P. is a landmark accord,\u201d international economists Peter A. Petri of the Brandeis International Business School and Michael G. Plummer of Johns Hopkins University wrote for the institute. They noted that the so-called megaregional pact, binding Pacific-area nations that account for 36 percent of global trade and nearly a quarter of all exports, went further to phase out tariffs among the trading partners than expected, and included unprecedented trade rules governing labor and the environment, goods, services, global investment and digital commerce.The report suggested that the displacement of workers in industries most vulnerable to competition would be relatively small: The resulting movement of workers between jobs and industries, or \u201cchurn\u201d in economists\u2019 terms, would increase less than 0.1 percent.But the authors recommended intensified efforts to help the workers inevitably displaced by free trade, calling that \u201ca compelling ethical and political objective.\u201d\u201cMost workers who lose jobs do find alternative employment, but workers in specific locations, industries, or with skill shortages may experience serious transition costs including lasting wage cuts and unemployment,\u201d they wrote. \u201cSince the costs to the individuals displaced can be quite high, compensating them for these costs, using a fraction of the total U.S. gains, is a compelling ethical and political objective, and policies to achieve equitable adjustment are likely to be affordable.\u201dWhile manufacturing jobs would continue to grow, the trade deal would reduce the sector\u2019s growth rate by about one-fifth, the analysts said. That would be offset, they added, by higher employment in service and \u201cprimary goods\u201d industries such as agriculture and forestry that rely on exports, they added, noting \u2014 much like Mr. Obama does \u2014 that export-intensive jobs pay about 18 percent more than other jobs on average.The United States, as the largest and richest nation of the Pacific group, would benefit most in absolute terms, but \u201cthe agreement will generate substantial gains for Japan, Malaysia, and Vietnam as well, and solid benefits for other members,\u201d it said.The report also warned about \u2014 and quantified \u2014 the economic costs if the accord is not approved. Given the potential benefits, it said, \u201cdelaying the launch of the T.P.P. by even one year would represent a $77 billion permanent loss, or opportunity cost, to the U.S. economy as well as create other risks.\u201dHouse Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin is a trade proponent but he has deferred to his party colleagues. More threatening to congressional action this year, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has suggested delaying debate until after the November elections. Among presidential candidates, Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have opposed the agreement, as have Republicans Donald J. Trump and Ted Cruz.Mr. Obama\u2019s trade representative, Michael B. Froman, who will join other trade ministers in New Zealand on Feb. 4 for a formal signing ceremony, said in a statement that the analysis is evidence that the trade deal \u201cwill raise wages for American workers, grow our economy, and help farmers and businesses export more \u2018Made in America\u2019 products.\u201dHe added, \u201cIt also shows that sitting on the sideline and delaying T.P.P., even for a short time, will cost us dearly.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Andrew Cuomo and Dean Skelos, then the powerful Senate Republican leader from Nassau County, when Mr. Cuomo was seeking to legalize full-fledged casino gambling upstate.In New York, the plan has long been to attach a dubious financial engine (gambling) to a broken-down heap of an industry (horse racing) and fuel it with people\u2019s thinly stretched paychecks and Social Security benefits. Giving up on better ways of reviving the upstate economy, Mr. Cuomo doubled down on gambling: He engineered the 2013 referendum that rewrote the State Constitution to open the door to seven Las Vegas-style casinos, and then cut the deal for the two video gambling parlors on Long Island.Yet many people in Nassau don\u2019t want slot machines anywhere near their homes. Because of local resistance, the Nassau parlor was never considered for the retail and entertainment heart of the county, called the Hub. Why is that, if gambling is such an economic boon? It was blocked from an OTB \u201crace palace\u201d in Plainview and from the site of a shuttered department store in Westbury. In addition, Suffolk\u2019s plan to bring its machines to a shuttered movie multiplex in Brookhaven is mired in a lawsuit.The pro-video-gambling forces in Nassau are counting on the State Legislature and local communities to accept the development at Belmont, and \u201ccounting\u201d is quite literal in the case of the county executive, Edward Mangano. He has already put $20 million of gambling revenue in his 2016 budget. That\u2019s based on estimates that the parlor will net at least $150 million a year.That\u2019s a lot of losing gamblers.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ben Carson Proposes Flat Tax, With Benefits Flowing to the Wealthy", "Date": "2016-01-04", "News": "Ben Carson has proposed tearing up the tax code and replacing it with a flat tax that would represent a substantial cut for the richest Americans and one that could potentially deepen the deficit.The proposal is centered on a 14.9 percent tax for people in all income brackets and for companies, while eliminating deductions for mortgage interest, charitable giving and local taxes. Mr. Carson also would do away with taxing capital gains or interest income. Low-income people and families, defined by having incomes below 150 percent of the federal poverty level, would have to make a smaller, unspecified payment.The changes would mark sharp reductions from the top personal tax rate of 39.6 percent and the corporate tax rate of 35 percent.\u201cOur current system reduces incentives for entrepreneurial ventures and investment, and at the same time inhibits the growth of a vibrant economy,\u201d Mr. Carson said.Although Mr. Carson predicts that his plan would increase the economic growth rate to 4 percent and create 5 million new jobs in the next decade, the proposal left several questions unanswered.Roberton Williams, an analyst at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, said that the prospect of eliminating popular provisions like the earned income tax credit, tax credits for children and deductions for mortgage interest could have unintended consequences for the economy.

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Billions\u2019 Delivers a Dose of Charisma to Hedge Fund Titans", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byMen who make lots of money and growl at one another about profits and margins and winning and losing. Remember them?Americans used to love watching stories about those guys, in the years before the excesses of Wall Street spawned a great recession and before Bernie Madoff brought abject fear back to personal investing. Once their shortsighted shell games toppled the world economy, though, it was a little harder to get into that high-capitalist gambling spirit.The inverse of that charisma is made flesh in Paul Giamatti\u2019s United States attorney, Chuck Rhoades, who serves as Axelrod\u2019s crusading nemesis, fixated on slaying Wall Street corruption \u2014 and propelling himself into political office along the way. The conceit \u2014 power players duel against a backdrop of ambition, greed, corruption and really good bourbon \u2014 feels bulletproof enough, but in practice, the show (Andrew Ross Sorkin, the founding editor of DealBook for The New York Times, is a co-creator and an executive producer) careens into cartoon territory almost immediately, thanks in part to the absurd contrast between Axelrod and Rhoades.Where Mr. Lewis\u2019s Axelrod is all top-dog calm confidence, Giamatti\u2019s Rhoades is pure underdog neurotic rage, alternately barking furiously and rolling over when his dad or his wife asserts dominance. As engrossing as such psychosocial dynamics might be, once you throw in sexual proclivities that feel a little too obvious for even network TV, you\u2019ve got a drama with all the subtlety of a Wall Street-themed ride.Even so, who can look away? \u201cBillions\u201d is exactly the sort of show that, if you don\u2019t reject its over-the-top tactics in the first three episodes, will hook you by the sixth. So even as Axelrod and Rhoades fulfill what are now the familiar requirements of two snarling patriarchs in a personal as much as a professional standoff; even as Axelrod\u2019s wife (played convincingly by Malin Akerman) hisses threats and struts imperiously around her mega-mansion; even as his goons spit out misogynistic remarks with the casual contempt of those who believe that money buys them the right to be repugnant, it\u2019s hard not to be caught up by the spectacle.Part of the show\u2019s draw lies with Maggie Siff, who brought transfixing poise to the first season of \u201cMad Men\u201d as the department store owner Rachel Menken, as well as to the relatively uneven \u201cSons of Anarchy.\u201d Ms. Siff plays Rhoades\u2019s wife, Wendy, who also (unbelievably enough) works as an in-house \u201cperformance coach\u201d for Axelrod. The scenes in which Wendy counsels Axelrod\u2019s gaggle of mini-Gekkos to power down their insecurities and pump up their egos enough to assume their God-given roles as masters of the universe are patently absurd, yet Ms. Siff brings such a placid intensity that they\u2019re still some of the best of the show.But where Mr. Lewis and Ms. Siff deliver magnetism, composure and loads of restraint, Mr. Giamatti\u2019s performance unravels into what feels like a steady stream of sneers, snorts and growls. That\u2019s partly the fault of an otherwise smart, compelling script: It\u2019s not all that easy to deliver lines like, \u201cI want to put him on a rack and stretch him,\u201d and \u201cSing for your supper and you get breakfast in the morning,\u201d without sounding like some high school kid taking a blustery stab at Sky Masterson. Every time Mr. Giamatti gamely leans into the melodrama, it backfires. It doesn\u2019t help that his character is always hunched over in some dark, wood-panel-lined municipal office, whereas Axelrod strides down the sparkling white hallways of his pristine empire like a very busy, confident demigod.Of course, maybe that\u2019s the whole point. After witnessing the rise and fall of many a premium-cable (not to mention Wall Street) antihero before this one, we\u2019ve perhaps grown weary of the precipitous fall of the arrogant, unethical patriarch. Recognizing this, the creators of \u201cBillions\u201d are determined to paint Axelrod as something between a minor deity and a rock star. And why not? When Americans love the player, they tend to turn a blind eye to the game.Heather Havrilesky, a columnist for New York magazine and Bookforum, is the author of the memoir \u201cDisaster Preparedness.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Developer Reaches Settlements Over Luxury Buildings That Were Left Unfinished", "Date": "2016-01-17", "News": "Supported byThe developer promised the building would have the kind of luxurious amenities befitting a 40-story condominium tower overlooking that citadel of capitalism, the New York Stock Exchange.They were supposed to include interiors by the celebrity designer Philippe Starck, what the developer called \u201cthe most elegant indoor swimming pool you\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d a basketball court, a plush movie theater and a billiards area, as well as a terrace and a yoga studio.Instead, the buyers who put down millions for their apartments at 15 Broad Street 10 years ago got an \u201cabject lack of fireproofing,\u201d faulty wiring, numerous leaks and potentially toxic mold, according to residents.In 2008, after selling the 386 apartments in the building for at least $380 million, the developer abandoned all efforts to complete the renovations or build the promised amenities, according to the state attorney general\u2019s office.Last week, after years of litigation, Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, and the residents reached separate settlements with the developer, Africa Israel Investments Ltd., in the process cleaning up some of the wreckage from the last real estate boom in the city.Africa Israel, which is owned by Lev Leviev, an Israeli businessman and diamond merchant, and its one-time partner Shaya Boymelgreen were voracious buyers of New York property during the debt-fueled boom a decade ago. But when the economy faltered in 2008, many of their projects collapsed.Under the terms of the settlements, Africa Israel must resolve the defects at 15 Broad Street and two other buildings with similar issues: 20 Pine Street, a 409-unit condominium also in the financial district, and 85 Adams Street, a 79-unit building in Downtown Brooklyn. It must also surrender control to the condominium boards and pay a $2 million penalty to New York City for improperly taking property tax breaks on the Broad Street building and an adjacent structure.Mr. Schneiderman described the settlement with his office as \u201ca warning to property developers in New York State.\u201dHe added, \u201cThose who collect the enormous profits that flow from offering real estate securities in New York will not be allowed to shirk their obligations to purchasers and the public.\u201dAfrica Israel must also complete work on a historic building adjacent to 15 Broad Street, the landmark century-old former headquarters of J.P. Morgan & Company at 23 Wall Street, which has sat largely vacant for eight years.Mr. Schneiderman said Africa Israel\u2019s failure to finish work at 23 Wall Street had robbed \u201cthe city of the neighborhood revitalization that developers were supposed to deliver in exchange for a tax breaks designed to encourage the conversion of aging office buildings downtown to residential use.\u201d\u201cWe have settled in principle,\u201d said Robb L. Tretter, president of the condominium board at 15 Broad Street and a resident since 2006. \u201cThey have come through in the end and coughed up the funds necessary to make us whole.\u201dAfrica Israel, which also heavily invested in real estate in Florida and Las Vegas at the same time, said in a written statement that it had reached a \u201cvoluntary settlement\u201d with the attorney general. \u201cWe are pleased to be moving forward with a mutually agreed upon resolution,\u201d the statement said.During his shopping spree in 2007, Mr. Leviev bought the former New York Times headquarters on West 43rd Street, sight unseen, paying $525 million, three times the sum paid by the prior owner in November 2004. He spent more than $100 million renovating the building.But it all went awry for his heavily leveraged empire during the recession.Over the years, tenants, condo buyers and elected officials heaped criticism on Mr. Boymelgreen, who oversaw many of the projects. He and Mr. Leviev acrimoniously dissolved their partnership in 2007. The settlement last week does not resolve a continuing investigation of Mr. Boymelgreen by the attorney general. Mr. Boymelgreen could not be reached for comment.Mr. Leviev and Mr. Boymelgreen bought 15 Broad Street and 23 Wall Street from J.P. Morgan Chase & Company in 2003 for more than $100 million.The plans for 15 Broad Street were very attractive, said Mr. Tretter, who signed a contract to buy his three-bedroom condo in 2006, as downtown was becoming a popular residential area.But the work was left unfinished. The owners of the condominiums, Mr. Tretter said, were forced to spend more than $1 million \u201cfixing exterior leaks.\u201dAfrica Israel\u2019s settlement with the residents also includes an undisclosed cash payment.While Africa Israel must complete the work at 23 Wall Street, the settlement does not resolve the future of the landmark building. Africa Israel sold the building in 2008 to a Hong Kong-based company, China Sonangol, along with a stake in the former New York Times headquarters and the clock tower at 5 Madison Avenue.The company\u2019s directors have ties to government agencies in China, as well as to Mr. Leviev in Angola, according a congressional commission.

Uberpop, Uber\u00e2\u0080\u0099s low-cost service, relies on unlicensed drivers and is similar to UberX in the United States.But after talking to local authorities and taxi groups, Mr. Mewes, a 37-year-old German, soon realized that Germany\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tough transport rules \u00e2\u0080\u0094 involving health exams, security checks and state-issued licenses for all taxi operators \u00e2\u0080\u0094 would never allow such a low-cost service to operate freely in the country, Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest economy.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn every country, you have to be prepared to change your setup,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Mewes, whose start-up now operates across several European countries after being acquired by Daimler, the German automaker, in 2014. MyTaxi currently has 45,000 drivers using its online platform, with roughly half of them based in Germany. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why Uber failed here. They aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t willing to change when they enter a new country.\u00e2\u0080\u009dLate last year, for instance, the company pulled out of Frankfurt, Hamburg and D\u00c3\u00bcsseldorf, citing onerous regulation and a lack of drivers operating on its online platform.Mark MacGann, Uber\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head of policy in Europe, says that German taxi unions have lobbied hard to push Uber out of the market, and that the ride-booking service will eventually return to multiple cities across the country.\u00e2\u0080\u009cGermany may end up being the final frontier of Uber\u00e2\u0080\u0099s success story in Europe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u201cI\u2019m confident that Germany will be as big a market for us as the United Kingdom is right now.\u201dYet while Uber has so far remained a bit player in Germany, local rivals \u00e2\u0080\u0094 often in collaboration with licensed taxi operators \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have expanded rapidly, taking advantage of their local regulatory and cultural know-how to succeed just as Uber has been forced to retreat.As local consumers become more accustomed to using smartphone apps, many ride-booking companies now offer the same services as their larger American rival, including on-demand pickup and estimated prices for each ride, though other benefits like in-app payments are only now starting to be added.To re-establish itself in Germany, Uber must take on the likes of Hermann Waldner.As the managing director of a Berlin taxi dispatch center, Mr. Waldner has not stood still when faced with Uber\u00e2\u0080\u0099s somewhat stumbling expansion plans, which have shifted from offering primarily unlicensed taxi services to those based on certified drivers.Mr. Waldner also runs Taxi.eu, a rival smartphone application that relies solely on licensed drivers.

{"Headline": "Davos Takes a Fresh Look at Emerging Markets", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported byEver since emerging markets became a major asset class in the early 1990s, a parade of potentates, policy makers and corporate chieftains have flocked to the stylish village of Davos in the Swiss Alps in the hope of becoming the latest global meme.From 2000 on, the Davos boom and the emerging markets boom have been pretty much one and the same, a living ideal of globalization helped by central banks that have printed trillions of dollars of new money.But now, as interest rates in the United States begin to rise, these dollars have begun to flow out of China, the Middle East and Latin America. Growth rates are stumbling, debt levels rising and geopolitical fears spreading.Over the last year, the exodus has gathered pace, fed by worries that China will lose control of its currency, the price of oil will drop to $20 a barrel, and Brazil\u2019s problems will worsen.And many now say that this rosy, Davos-fueled notion of a world powered by emerging-market growth and innovation needs to be reconsidered.\u201cI have long maintained that the emerging-market hype was oversold when it was clear that what was going on was high commodity prices and cheap money,\u201d said Dani Rodrik, an expert on globalization at the Harvard Kennedy School.As for the World Economic Forum in Davos, he said that over the last 10 years it had become an echo chamber of sorts.\u201cWhat we are seeing now is lower growth and policy conflicts between the emerging and the developed world,\u201d said Mr. Rodrik, who will not be making the trip this time around. \u201cIt is going to be a different type of Davos this year.\u201dPerhaps the biggest sign that global investors have lost faith is that for the first time since 1988 (when only the bravest souls invested in these countries), investors have pulled more money out of emerging markets than they have put in, according to research by the Institute of International Finance.In an unusually blunt speech in Paris this month, Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said that emerging nations needed a new model for growth after years of relying on easy money and high commodity prices.\u201cGrowth rates are down, and cyclical and structural forces have undermined the traditional growth paradigm,\u201d Ms. Lagarde said. Moreover, she warned, the dollar\u2019s continued strength against just about all emerging-market currencies could well result in a new round of financial uncertainty, pushing commodity prices and global growth forecasts even lower.Since mid-2011, the dollar has gained more than 100 percent against emerging-market currencies in Turkey, Brazil and South Africa. And over the last six months, following China\u2019s decision to depreciate the renminbi, previously robust monetary units in Singapore, Korea and Taiwan have also started to lose value against the dollar.\u201cOur own estimates show that a slowdown of 1 percent in the emerging world would lower growth in advanced countries by at least about 0.2 percentage points,\u201d Ms. Lagarde said.Still, even with the gloom and doom surrounding emerging markets these days, there is little sign that standard bearers are forgoing their annual week in the Swiss mountains.This year, more than 320 representatives from Brazil, Russia, India and China \u2014 the so-called BRIC community of emerging nations \u2014 will be in Davos \u2014 compared with 237 from these countries in 2010.None of these representatives will be heads of state, though. In the past, Brazilian presidents and Vladimir Putin of Russia have led their countries\u2019 delegations. This year, Russia is sending a deputy prime minister, Yury Trutnev, while China is sending a vice president, Li Yuanchao.Two large emerging markets that have been under significant stress of late will be sending their leaders. Turkey, recently rocked by terrorist attacks, will be represented by its prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu. And the South African president, Jacob Zuma, who has gone through three finance ministers in the last five weeks, is also planning to show up.The president of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, whose popularity polls have sunk to single digits, will not be making an appearance, but her recently appointed finance minister, Nelson Henrique Barbosa-Filho, is scheduled to attend.Ready to engage in some damage control will be the top executives at BTG Pactual, the Brazilian investment bank whose former chief executive, Andr\u00e9 Esteves, is under investigation for corruption.In terms of panels themed for developing nations, the World Economic Forum will be serving up the usual fare this year. One will explore how companies in emerging markets cope with laws that discriminate against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender workers. Another is more straightforward: What will the impact of higher interest rates in the United States be on emerging market growth?But, as is always the case at the World Economic Forum, the meetings of genuine consequence will be the ones that you do not know are happening.That could mean Laurence D. Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest money management firm, sitting down with Jean-Paul Villain, an executive at the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, or Fahad al-Mubarak, the governor of Saudi Arabia\u2019s central bank and overseer of the country\u2019s $650 billion foreign reserve stash.Or the chief executives of Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase could wind up huddling with Fang Xinghai, the vice chairman of the China securities regulatory commission. The sharp swings in China\u2019s stock market are having an outsize effect on markets in the United States, and the big American investment banks will want to hear what Mr. Fang\u2019s strategy is for 2016.But as central bankers, prime ministers and chief executives wrestle this week to make sense of it all, Ruchir Sharma, head of emerging markets at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, has a fairly simple explanation: The impact on the developed world of a slowdown in China and other emerging markets is going to be greater than most people realize.\u201cIn 1997, the emerging world\u2019s share of the global economy was 20 percent \u2014 now, it\u2019s nearly 40 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a big deal. What happens in China has an effect on the wider world, and I think that the Davos crowd has been slow to recognize this.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Volkswagen May Buy Back Diesel Cars It Can\u2019t Fix", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byThe statement, made during a court hearing by Robert Giuffra, a lawyer defending Volkswagen against class-action suits by owners of tainted diesel vehicles, was the clearest indication yet that the company, which is based in Wolfsburg, Germany, may not have the technology to bring emissions for some of the cars into line with regulations without hurting performance and fuel economy.Mr. Giuffra spoke during a hearing in United States District Court in San Francisco last week, although his remarks did not attract wide attention at the time. Volkswagen officials have indicated that the company might buy back some cars in the United States. Mr. Giuffra\u2019s comments suggested that option has become more likely.Volkswagen could probably find a solution eventually, Mr. Giuffra said. He added, \u201cThe question though is one of timing.\u201cAnd for some of the vehicles it may well be that the timing is too far into the future,\u201d he said, according to a transcript of the hearing. \u201cSo we might have to do a buyback or some sort of a solution like that for some subset of the vehicles, but that hasn\u2019t been determined yet.\u201dVolkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.Volkswagen faces hundreds of lawsuits from diesel owners and independent dealers who say they are stuck with cars that have fallen in value after the company admitted rigging them to cheat on emissions tests. The number of affected vehicles was put at 575,000 during the San Francisco hearing.From September, when the Environmental Protection Agency first accused Volkswagen of emissions cheating, to the end of December, prices for VW diesels have dropped nearly 16 percent, according to data compiled by Kelley Blue Book. Some owners report steeper declines.Volkswagen has not found a way to reduce emissions that satisfies federal and California regulators. In any case, the company would still face legal claims from owners if the cars\u2019 performance suffered and the vehicles lost resale value as a result. It may be simpler just to buy cars back, or offer owners generous trade-ins on new Volkswagen vehicles.\u201cWe have no comment other than to say that Volkswagen continues to work cooperatively with E.P.A. and CARB to resolve these issues as quickly as possible with approved remedies for the affected vehicles,\u201d the company said, referring to California\u2019s Air Resources Board.In Europe, where most of the 11 million vehicles are, Volkswagen is planning to update the engine software and in some cases add a part intended to reduce emissions by improving air flow into the engine.But that solution will not work in the United States because of stricter limits on nitrogen oxide, a pollutant linked to lung ailments and smog. It is particularly difficult for Volkswagen to fix older vehicles equipped with less effective emissions equipment than was installed on newer cars.About 320,000 of the Volkswagen diesel cars sold in the United States are equipped with the first generation of the motor, known as the EA 189, that is at the heart of the scandal. Those motors, which began appearing in the United States in the 2009 model year, have a device known as a nitrogen oxide trap that is considered less effective. Those cars are probably the most likely candidates for buybacks.The nitrogen oxide traps, by contrast, hurt fuel mileage and acceleration when the traps are fully deployed. That may be the reason Volkswagen programmed the cars to reduce emissions controls except when engine software detected that the car was undergoing tests.The Golf, Jetta and Beetle did not get the urea chemical systems until 2015.Volkswagen faces many class-action lawsuits from owners and some used-car dealers. The hearing in San Francisco on Jan. 21 was so crowded that lawyers spilled out of the courtroom into the corridor.After the session, Judge Charles R. Breyer of United States District Court appointed a steering committee of 21 lawyers representing VW owners and dealers to try to negotiate a settlement with the company. The negotiations will be overseen by Robert S. Mueller III, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who was appointed settlement master in the case. Elizabeth J. Cabraser, a veteran San Francisco lawyer who specializes in consumer fraud cases, will be lead lawyer for the plaintiffs.Judge Breyer said during the hearing that the civil cases were not a \u201cwhodunit\u201d focused on who at Volkswagen was responsible for the cheating.\u201cIt is more of a case of how do we fix what was done,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it can\u2019t be fixed, then what is fair and just compensation for the people who have been damaged by this matter?\u201dMr. Giuffra of the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell said that the solution \u201cneeds to be a sustainable fix, and a fix that actually works, because we don\u2019t want to do something that we think is a fix and doesn\u2019t turn out to be a fix.\u201dAn article on Friday about the possibility that Volkswagen may need to buy back some diesel models sold in the United States because they cannot be modified to meet American emission standards misidentified a VW diesel sport utility vehicle sold in the United States. It is the Touareg, not the Tiguan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Comforts of a Hotel That\u2019s Close to Home in Dangerous Weather", "Date": "2016-01-25", "News": "Supported byWhen Robert Kruszka of Virginia saw last weekend\u2019s storm heading for the Washington area, he did not hesitate to find a place where he and his family could stay warm and comfortable \u2014 the nearby Hyatt Regency Tysons Corner Center.As warnings of the storm\u2019s severity grew increasingly dire, the hotel offered a discounted $99 nightly rate \u2014 \u201ca rate we rarely offer,\u201d said Nancy Longstreth, the hotel\u2019s director of sales.Mr. Kruszka said that so many other local residents had the same idea that \u201cthe place was full of families.\u201d He called it \u201ca little vacation, eating at restaurants and window-shopping \u2014 even though the stores were all closed,\u201d he said. Both Friday and Saturday were sold out at the hotel.The increased business is part of the double-edged sword that severe weather presents to hotels in the form of lost revenue from cancellations \u2014 and the opportunity for new business.Canceled reservations can be offset by stranded travelers who need to extend their stays as well as by local residents and emergency workers who are looking for temporary lodging.For the hotels, discounting rates during a storm helps fill otherwise empty rooms and can engender good will.Hotels are looking to replace lost business with any incremental revenue, said Professor Chris Anderson of the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration, \u201cand even capture a guest who otherwise might not stay and introduce them to their product.\u201dThe Hyatt, which opened last spring, is part of a large mall complex and communicated the rate to management there for store employees and facility staff members who would be working on security or snow removal. The rate was also advertised through the hotel website and by representatives answering the phones.Some hotels offer discounts for emergency workers who would have a hard time commuting home between shifts.New Jersey\u2019s South Brunswick police reserved a group of rooms at the Courtyard Cranbury South Brunswick by Marriott when the weather turned dangerous last week.Still, the extreme weather does lead to lost revenue. Mr. Borsuk said that few of his weekend cancellations would be rebooked and only about half of the business reservations would be rescheduled.This only adds pressure to gain back business that hotels lose during a storm.His hotel had set up discounted rates before Hurricane Sandy, Mr. Borsuk said, and found \u201cthe people who came from the local community ended up calling their friends to come on over.\u201dIn the future, Mr. Borsuk plans to advertise the new rates on the web and put up fliers at local retirement homes.While a significant percent of his room reservations were canceled over the weekend, Mr. Borsuk said his dining room was busy Saturday night.Hotels seem to be able to get through the worst weather largely unscathed, said Dennis Nessler, editor of Hotel Interactive, an online hospitality industry newsletter. \u201cMost of the revenue effects are short term,\u201d he said. The exception might be ski resorts depending on a large number of guests for a holiday weekend. \u201cThey might see a bigger effect if there\u2019s a disruption that weekend,\u201d he said.Hotels in the area were affected by last year\u2019s snowstorms, said Michael Oshins, a hospitality professor at Boston University. But, he said, the rebounding economy more than made up for the losses and the hotels ended up having their best year in terms of revenue.For hotel operators like Mr. Borsuk, part of the challenge is to be ready for the bad weather.Hotels generally prepare for snow emergencies with backup generators and snow removal equipment to keep operations going, said Michael McGilligan, general manager of the Hilton Chicago O\u2019Hare and a 22-year veteran of the hotel industry.The bigger challenges stemming from a storm, he said, almost always revolve around people because the same weather that prevents guests from leaving, can prevent staff from making it to work.Employees are sometimes asked to work double shifts during weather emergencies, he said, and hotels may make guest rooms available to them to stay overnight so they don\u2019t have to commute home.Sometimes the need for sleeping spaces outpaces the available guest rooms.Last year, management at O\u2019Hare International Airport in Chicago asked Mr. McGilligan to set up a hotel conference room full of cots so airport workers responsible for plowing runways could have a place to rest.Creativity is paramount at hotels when supply trucks do not arrive or the power goes out.\u201cIf food is running short, we might offer a limited menu and put out free snacks in the lobby so fewer people come to the dining room,\u201d Mr. McGilligan said.\u201cThey want to make this part of their guests\u2019 unplanned stay as enjoyable as possible,\u201d Mr. Anderson of Cornell said. \u201cService providers see this as an opportunity to shine.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Giving Obama His Due", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byI still hold onto a couple of magazine covers and newspaper front pages, despite their preservation in the digital afterlife, marking the moment when a nation that had embraced African-American slavery chose a black man to be its president.Barack Obama\u2019s election in 2008 swept \u201caway the last racial barrier in American politics with ease,\u201d The New York Times reported. The New Yorker, with its cover of a glowing Lincoln Memorial, heralded \u201cthe resurgence of America\u2019s ability to astonish and inspire.\u201d They sensed \u201cthe beginning of a new era.\u201dYou couldn\u2019t help thinking of these trumpets of hope while watching the graying head of the president on Tuesday night. As he walked to the exit, he turned to soak in the scene of his final State of the Union address. \u201cLet me take one more look at this thing,\u201d he said.By any objective measurement, his presidency has been perhaps the most consequential since Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s time. Ronald Reagan certainly competes with Obama for that claim. But on the night of Reagan\u2019s final State of the Union speech in 1988, when he boasted that \u201cone of the best recoveries in decades\u201d should \u201csend away the hand-wringers and doubting Thomases,\u201d the economic numbers were not as good as those on Obama\u2019s watch.At no time in Reagan\u2019s eight years was the unemployment rate lower than it is today, at 5 percent \u2014 and this after Obama was handed the worst economic calamity since the Great Depression. Reagan lauded a federal deficit at 3.4 percent of gross national product. By last fall, Obama had done better than that, posting a deficit of 2.5 percent of G.D.P.Still, Obama can shape only so much of his own legacy. A big part of the 44th president\u2019s place in the national narrative will depend on what happens to the forces of darkness that were unleashed in his time \u2014 things that can\u2019t be quantified by a government agency.Much of the country is now more openly intolerant, quick to hate and nasty. One reaction to Obama has been the rise of an opposition party that is a home for xenophobes, defeatists and alarmists. They are the Eeyore Party with a snarl. As we heard again during the Republican debate on Thursday, Obama\u2019s opponents are drawn to the \u201csiren call of the angriest voices,\u201d as Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina artfully put it. If the majority follows those voices, the Obama presidency will shoulder a sizable amount of the blame.Is that really his fault? Did his presidency give rise to a bigoted billionaire with know-nothing followers? Part of the ugliness seems a reaction to the straitjacket of political correctness, which preceded Obama, and got worse in some corridors, mainly academia. But it may also be that the country was not ready for a transformational president; rather than sweep away the last racial barrier, his years in office showed just how deep-rooted the sentiment behind those barriers remains.These are tricky questions, ones that cannot be answered with certainty. But give Obama, the rare politician who is prone to honest self-reflection, credit for raising the issues himself. One of the \u201cregrets of my presidency,\u201d he said on Tuesday, was that the \u201crancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better.\u201dCould Obama, with that first-class intellect to go with a first-class temperament, with that pitch-perfect sense of humor, have been a better schmoozer and deal maker? Certainly. He was never very good at hiding his condescension for Republican leaders. But that party was united in a single goal \u2014 to defeat him at every turn.Republicans who would not applaud the creation of 14 million jobs, an unemployment rate cut in half, 17 million people given health care, a global climate change pact, the strongest military in the world and a rousing call for a \u201cmoonshot\u201d to cure cancer are incapable of taking a fair measure of Obama\u2019s achievements.This Congress is done with him. That was as clear as the blank prairie stare on the face of House Speaker Paul Ryan. What was a dysfunctional, bickering relationship is now a divorce. Call in the lawyers. Obama could propose Grandmother Appreciation Day and not get a single vote from Republicans because, well, he proposed it.On policy, then, Obama has been a remarkable doer, though you wouldn\u2019t know it from the curiously inept self-promotional apparatus of his White House. The swagger we saw from this president on Tuesday \u2014 saying, \u201canyone claiming that America\u2019s economy is in decline is peddling fiction,\u201d and \u201cif anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change have at it, you\u2019ll be pretty lonely\u201d \u2014 was absent most of the last seven years.But on the mastery of changing hearts and minds, the \u201cability to astonish and inspire,\u201d he falls short. His presidency, as of now, has not been transformational. He has 370 more days, or thereabouts, to make a dent in a hard history.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Hunting in ...Trinidad and Tobago", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byInternational Real Estate23 PhotosA CLIFF-TOP VILLA OF BALINESE-STYLE PAVILIONS IN TOBAGO$4.43 MILLION (3,014,865 BRITISH POUNDS)This clifftop home of Balinese-style pavilions, called Ohana Villa, has the windswept openness of a traditional Caribbean plantation-style home overlooking the Atlantic Ocean on Tobago, one of two major islands in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. On an acre of terrain on Tobago\u2019s southwest coast, the villa has a 20,000-gallon koi pond, two infinity-edge swimming pools and a Jacuzzi, along with a conical-roof gazebo. A flight of stairs lined by firecracker plants and palms descends to a sandy beach.The 7,000-square-foot Indonesian-influenced villa, which has four bedrooms and five bathrooms, with a sixth bathroom down near the beach, was designed by John Otway, an architect who lives on Tobago. Ohana Villa has a concrete foundation drilled into volcanic rock, and its bedrooms, kitchen and perimeter walls are all concrete. However, much of the rest of the villa consists of either fretwork walls of Guyanese pitch pine or demerara shutters, which are louvered, hinge at the top and prop open, said Walter Zephirin, a managing director of Seventh Heaven Properties, a real estate agency specializing in the Caribbean that has the listing.A courtyard with bamboo plants leads to the main doors of the villa, which open to a foyer. To the left is a long hallway with dramatic views of the koi pond at its end. Off the hallway is the kitchen, with pitch pine floors, black tile countertops and a mix of pitch pine and purple heart wood in the cabinets. Appliances are by General Electric and include both a conventional oven and a commercial one. Also off the main corridor is an inner courtyard with tropical plants. At the corridor\u2019s end is a perpendicular hallway. To the right is the open living room, dining room and veranda, all under a peaked ceiling of pitch pine with exposed rafters. The living room abuts an outdoor barbecue area. The villa is furnished with elegant pieces from the Dutch East Indies, and furniture is included in the asking price. The veranda is cantilevered over the beach, with canvas shutters facing the sea.The kitchen has a large countertop that opens to the dining room and can be used as a bar. The entire space has ocean views over the tops of mango, avocado, sapodilla and breadfruit trees, and is open to the decks set among the pools and pond.The bedrooms are at the opposite end of the corridor from the living and dining rooms. All four bedrooms have en-suite bathrooms with Kohler sinks and taps. Two bedrooms have decks overlooking the koi pond; a third has a courtyard. One bedroom has an interior shower and an outdoor shower. At the end of a long hallway, the master bedroom has an enclosed veranda with shutters opening to ocean views and a swimming pool. The master bedroom has an en-suite bathroom that includes a separate shower and bathtub area tiled with greenish stone selected to match the volcanic rock around the beach, Mr. Zephirin said.Ohana Villa has a storage room beneath it of about 1,076 square feet that could be converted to living quarters, he said. Though there are wall-mounted air-conditioning units and ceiling fans in the bedrooms, the trade winds sweeping through the fretwork walls and open shutters keep the villa cool, Mr. Zephirin said.MARKET OVERVIEWHome prices in Trinidad and Tobago fell by about 20 percent, as they did throughout the Caribbean, after the global real estate crisis of 2008, Mr. Zephirin said.The country has not recovered as quickly as some others in the Caribbean, brokers said. One reason is a government mandate issued in 2007 requiring foreign investors to obtain a license for all land purchases in Tobago. Currently the market is stable, with prices having increased about 6 percent in 2015 over 2014, said Patricia Phillips, the broker owner of Island Investments Company Ltd., which is based in Tobago. \u201cThe market is still on the road to recovery, and it\u2019s still a buyer\u2019s market,\u201d she said.Falling oil prices may hold back any full recovery of the housing market, brokers said. The island nation has large oil and gas reserves serving an industrial economy largely based on petroleum and petrochemicals, particularly in Trinidad.A collaborative effort by tourism officials and the government to increase tourism may help boost the housing market, as may a growing number of airline flights, Mr. Zephirin said. While Trinidad tends to attract more foreign home buyers to the island for work reasons, Tobago offers a largely tourism-based market.Currently, a single-story home with three bedrooms, two bathrooms and a two-car garage in Trinidad might start at around $310,000 in United States currency, said Saran Joseph, a broker with Sunrise Properties, based in Trinidad. Modern homes in more desirable neighborhoods in West Trinidad would start at about $550,000. In Tobago, small condominiums start at about $390,000, and single-family homes start at about $550,000, Ms. Joseph said.WHO BUYS IN TRINIDAD AND TOBAGOForeign home buyers came from Britain and Germany, with smaller numbers from Canada and the United States, before 2007, Mr. Zephirin said. \u201cThis demographic is determined by airlift, which has always been strongest from the United Kingdom,\u201d he said.However, the ranks of foreign home buyers thinned considerably after the 2007 land licensing mandate, followed by the 2008 global financial crisis. \u201cFew foreign buyers have yet found their way back to Tobago,\u201d he said.Ms. Phillips said that recently she\u2019s worked with British and Norwegian home buyers seeking summer homes on Tobago. Mostly Europeans arriving for work reasons buy in Trinidad, she said.BUYING BASICSIn Trinidad, a landholding license is rarely required, but in Tobago, all prospective foreign home buyers must obtain a license, brokers said.There are several areas designated for tourism development in Tobago, such as Englishman\u2019s Bay and Bacolet Estate, where obtaining a license should take 40 working days. Ms. Phillips said that she recommends that clients anticipate the granting of a license to take closer to six months. This house is in the Bacolet Estate development area. Foreigners who want to buy land outside of designated development areas in Tobago can apply for a license, but may not receive one. Lawyers typically charge about 1 percent to 1.5 percent of the home\u2019s sales price, brokers said. Ms. Phillips also recommended negotiating an arrangement with the seller to hire a surveyor. Brokers said prospective buyers should budget about 10 percent of the home\u2019s sales price for closing costs, including stamp duty and legal fees. Real estate agent fees are typically paid by the seller.Foreign home buyers are required to use foreign currency when buying property in Trinidad and Tobago, and some local banks will negotiate a mortgage in American dollars, though interest rates are high at roughly 6 percent, Mr. Zephirin said.WEB SITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCYEnglish; Trinidad and Tobago dollar (1 Trinidad and Tobago dollar = $0.156) TAXES AND FEESThere are no property taxes in Trinidad and Tobago at this time. Villa Ohana, which has become a destination for weddings and other events, earns about $275,000 in rental income annually, Mr. Zephirin said.CONTACTAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Inquiry in China Adds to Doubt Over Reliability of Its Economic Data", "Date": "2016-01-26", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 The veracity of China\u2019s economic data has been increasingly questioned as the slowing pace of the country\u2019s growth has startled the world. And a new investigation into the official who oversees the numbers is unlikely to inspire confidence.The Communist Party\u2019s anticorruption commission announced late Tuesday that it was looking into the head of the country\u2019s statistics agency over what it called \u201cserious violations.\u201dChina\u2019s shrinking manufacturing sector and falling stock market have unnerved global investors. Any further doubt about its economic figures could paint an even darker picture of the health of the economy, adding to the pain in the markets. Stocks in Shanghai, which closed before the announcement, were off 6.4 percent on Tuesday.The statistics bureau has a variety of responsibilities that are hard to balance even in the best of times.The bureau is supposed to provide China\u2019s leaders with an unvarnished assessment of the country\u2019s economic strengths and weaknesses, even while reassuring the public about growth and maintaining consumer confidence. It is also supposed to release enough detailed and accurate information for investors and corporate leaders to make sound decisions about economic and financial prospects.Few doubt that China has grown enormously over the past three decades. But economists, bankers and analysts who study the numbers believe that the bureau smooths data, underestimating growth during economic booms and overestimating it during downturns.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.Many economists are worried that China\u2019s economy is not expanding anywhere close to the nearly 7 percent annual pace that bureau data still show. By some estimates, the pace is half of the official figures.Those skeptical about the data point, in part, to the underlying numbers.Still, the bureau has consistently and repeatedly defended its statistics, contending that critics do not adequately understand the data or the Chinese economy. And the market impact of the investigation could be limited by the fact that many were already wondering about China\u2019s data.\u201cThe international credibility of China\u2019s G.D.P. figures is anyway very low, so this probably is not a severe blow,\u201d said Diana Choyleva, the chief economist and head of research at Lombard Street Research, an economic analysis group in London. Lombard estimates that China\u2019s gross domestic product grew 3.2 percent last year, not the 6.9 percent that the National Bureau of Statistics claims.The reliability of China\u2019s economic data goes to the heart of the market\u2019s concerns.At the official rate, China grew last year at the slowest pace in 25 years. The government is trying to manage a slowdown without letting the pain create social unrest.That can make it hard to discern what\u2019s really happening in the economy. Among other problems, it has a glut of old-line factories that make products like steel, glass and cement. That industrial overcapacity stems from years of debt-financed investment in industries that now show little sign that they can repay those loans.Beijing is trying to rebalance its economy to focus more on consumer spending and services. But concerns about the pace of change play into the worries about the data.Take the steel industry.China produced 804 million tons of steel last year, even as demand faltered. Over all, China\u2019s steel-making capacity was set to reach 1.17 billion tons last year, according to estimates from Fitch Ratings.The government is taking steps to work through some of the excess. The country\u2019s State Council, or cabinet, decided on Sunday that it would close 100 million to 150 million tons of steel-making capacity. That would mean cutting capacity by an amount similar to the total annual steel output of Japan, the world\u2019s No. 2 steel maker.The State Council decision, which was released on Monday, also called for large reductions in coal-mining capacity, without providing a target figure.But it is a balancing act for the Chinese authorities.Li Xinchuang, the head of the China Metallurgical Industry Planning and Research Institute, told the official Xinhua news agency that the planned steel mill closings could cost 400,000 jobs. \u201cLarge-scale redundancies in the steel sector could threaten social stability,\u201d he warned.The disjointed attempts of policy makers to manage the stock markets and the currency are adding to skepticism about the economy.The outflows of capital reflect the uncertainty about the direction of the currency \u2014 and about the broader economy. Excluding foreign investment, capital outflows probably rose to as much as $900 billion in 2015, economists at Standard Chartered wrote on Tuesday in a research note.In response to the outflows, China\u2019s central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, has been eating into its reserves at a record pace in recent months. The central bank is trying to prop up the value of the Chinese currency, the renminbi, which is under pressure as the country\u2019s growth prospects weaken.It is all making for messiness in the markets. After the fall on Tuesday, Chinese stocks were at their lowest level in 13 months.Neil Gough contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mayor de Blasio Makes New York City\u2019s Fiscal Case to a Wary Legislature", "Date": "2016-01-26", "News": "Supported byALBANY \u2014 Mayor Bill de Blasio arrived here on Tuesday with a substantial wish list for the State Legislature, urging lawmakers to deliver money for several of New York City\u2019s needs, including public housing, infrastructure and health care.Many of his listeners, however, were less than sympathetic.Mayoral pitch turned to mayoral defense as Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, repeatedly found himself justifying the city\u2019s tax and spending practices. Testimony expected to last no more than a few hours became a five-hour slog, as he explained the need for the city to maintain a surplus, and calmly opposed arguments that the city should contribute hundreds of millions of dollars more to help pay for Medicaid and the City University of New York system.\u201cThe bottom line is that the city is awash in money right now,\u201d said Senator Catharine Young, a Cattaraugus County Republican and chairwoman of the Finance Committee, who opened the question-and-answer period of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s testimony with a skeptical assessment of his message: \u201cBasically, what you\u2019re saying is that you\u2019re demanding more money from the state\u2019s taxpayers.\u201dIt was a familiar dynamic for Mr. de Blasio, who now has two years of experience with the delicate fiscal dance that has left the city disappointed more often than not. As the mayor and legislators made their opening offers in what will become a monthslong negotiation, the city contingent offered a gentle reminder that the city is home to nearly half the state\u2019s population and accounts for 57 percent of its revenue.Yet the city must depend on Albany\u2019s good will not only for money, but also for legislation that affects rent controls, public schools and other parts of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s agenda, and he was careful not to complain of his grilling.\u201cI thought it was a very productive hearing \u2014 long, yes, but very productive,\u201d he said after emerging from the office of John J. Flanagan, the majority leader of the Republican-controlled State Senate, and before going to a meeting with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and another with the State Assembly speaker, Carl E. Heastie.\u201cThe hearing indicated some of the realities we live with in our state; there are partisan differences, there are regional differences. I still think it was respectful, I think it was a pretty informed and fair hearing.\u201dThe city is starting budget negotiations at a disadvantage: The budget that Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, proposed this month would shift hundreds of millions in formerly state-covered costs to the city, while taking back $600 million in city sales-tax revenue.Soon after unveiling these moves, Mr. Cuomo explained that he wanted the city and state to work together so the proposals would not \u201ccost New York City a penny,\u201d a promise Mr. de Blasio quoted several times during the hearing. But Republican lawmakers made it clear they would be content to let the city bear the extra expense, recycling some of the governor\u2019s own arguments in favor of his proposals and further insisting the city enjoys resources far beyond those of struggling upstate communities.Even as Mr. de Blasio resisted these cuts and others, he had to beat back questions that took city officials and onlookers alike by surprise. At least eight different lawmakers pressed him to explain why the city does not abide by a cap on property taxes that applies to other municipalities. Republicans have previously proposed forcing the city to impose the cap, but the issue also gained traction during the hearing with several city Democrats who want tax breaks for homeowners they represent.As the mayor spoke, the Senate was passing a bill to impose the cap on the city, a move the Republican majority said would save city taxpayers $4.5 billion by 2019. The Democratic majority in the Assembly dismissed any possibility that it would follow suit.\u201cI believe that New York City, although larger, although having a unique set of circumstances, if we\u2019re one state, then we\u2019re one state, and we should be under the same guidelines to save our taxpayers dollars,\u201d said Senator Kathleen A. Marchione, a Republican from Saratoga County.Tax-cap question after tax-cap question, Mr. de Blasio responded the same way. He said the city\u2019s financial situation was different from other municipalities\u2019, as it funds services that others do not. He suggested that the city, as the prime driver of the state\u2019s economy, needed resources to continue growing. And he warned of future fiscal tempests, saying the city should save its surplus \u2014 currently under threat from the governor\u2019s proposals \u2014 for an especially rainy day.\u201cWe will continue to build the New York City economy for the good of the whole state, with many benefits for the entire metropolitan area and the entire state,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cThat\u2019s my argument about why I think we should avoid a strategy that could limit that growth and our ability to handle the downturns when they do come.\u201dMr. de Blasio also noted that the city is the only municipality in the state that receives no direct, unrestricted aid from Albany. The mayor\u2019s aides later dismissed the property tax issue as a distraction, pointing out that the effective property tax rate on city homeowners was less than a third of the rate in the counties surrounding the city, and fiscal analysts, as well as other Democrats, chimed in with their own criticisms.Much less time was devoted to the other elements of the mayor\u2019s Albany agenda, including education, housing and homelessness.Mr. de Blasio objected to a proposal by Mr. Cuomo to increase funding for charter schools while shifting the responsibility from the state to the city. If the state wanted to increase funding for charter schools, the mayor said, it should provide the city with additional resources.His remarks drew condemnation from several charter school groups, which have strong supporters in the Senate.He also had to plead for the Legislature to knock down Mr. Cuomo\u2019s proposal to take the city\u2019s sales tax revenue for three years in exchange for savings the city received on refinanced debt that the state pays for.Mr. de Blasio asked the state to send the rest of the $100 million in capital funding for the New York City Housing Authority that it had promised \u2014 but not fully delivered \u2014 this year, as well as to commit another $100 million for each of the next two years. He also requested that the state devote more funding to homelessness prevention programs.The Legislature snubbed Mr. de Blasio last year by granting him only a one-year renewal of his control over the public schools. He said on Tuesday that he would ask for permanent mayoral control, but that he would settle for seven years. The Legislature has until the end of its session to vote on that measure.Jesse McKinley contributed reporting from Albany, and Kate Taylor from New York.Jesse McKinley contributed reporting from Albany, and Kate Taylor from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Precipitous Rents in Ski Country Push Workers to Edges", "Date": "2016-01-24", "News": "Supported byBRECKENRIDGE, Colo. \u2014 On nights when she could not crash on a friend\u2019s couch or unroll a sleeping mat on an attic floor, Chelsea Lilly tucked her silver Subaru into a supermarket parking lot or a dark spot along a mountain pass, wrapped herself in a green Army blanket and watched movies on her phone until she fell asleep.Getting work at a day spa in this bustling ski town had been easy, but finding an affordable apartment this winter proved almost impossible. So Ms. Lilly, 34, bounced along an itinerant path of couches and borrowed bedrooms that has become a fact of life for workers in jewel-box tourist towns across the country. Nights in the Subaru got so cold that she shivered awake every few hours and ran the engine to thaw out.\u201cI didn\u2019t know it was going to be like this,\u201d she said.The miners who once pried gold and silver from the heart of the Rocky Mountains would attest that living in paradise has never been easy. These days, soaring home prices and a shift toward weekend vacation rentals have created a housing crisis in ski country, one that has people piling into apartments, camping in the woods and living out of their trailers and pickup trucks.Local officials and housing experts say it is a symptom of widening economic inequality, one that is especially sharply felt in tiny resort towns hemmed in by beautiful but undevelopable public land. While the wealthiest can afford $5 million ski homes and $120-a-day lift tickets, others work two jobs and sleep in shifts to get by.Ski towns across the West have been building affordable housing for decades \u2014 condominiums and apartments, rowhouses and cabins \u2014 but many officials say the demand is just too much. Breckenridge is building 45 studio and one-bedroom apartments for workers, with hundreds more in various stages of development. And the housing authority of Summit County, of which Breckenridge is the seat, is putting a new employee to work trolling vacation-rental sites to make sure people in employee housing are not illegally renting their homes to vacationing snowbirds.\u201cIt\u2019s so important that Breckenridge retain this identity of having locals live here,\u201d said Elisabeth Lawrence, a Town Council member. \u201cReal town, real people.\u201dIn Jackson Hole, Wyo., carpenters and teachers are commuting from Idaho over steep, snowy mountain passes. Outside Crested Butte, Colo., so many seasonal workers and other visitors camped in the woods last summer that a local biological research station complained its research sites were being overrun by campers and cars veering off the roads.Local officials and employers have been struggling to find space for all the new arrivals and employees. Some are sleeping in their bosses\u2019 spare bedrooms. The 2,300-person town of Telluride in southwest Colorado toyed with building tiny houses as a stopgap. In Steamboat Springs, Colo., where the vacancy rate for multifamily rental units was zero at the end of last year, bus drivers and hotel housekeepers have been living out of two motels converted to de facto dormitories.Vail Resorts, which runs ski areas across the West, kicked up anger in December with a proposal to have its employees share bedrooms in the two-bedroom worker housing units in Summit County. The company said the option was strictly voluntary, and aimed at workers looking for a break in their rent.Vail owns more than 3,200 beds to house flocks of wintertime employees, and said in December that it was dedicating $30 million to building more employee housing to address the crunch.Yun Wang, 22, said she had easily found a winter gig delivering skis and boots to people\u2019s condos and hotel rooms in the town of Vail. But she and her boyfriend, who grooms the slopes at night, could not afford anything near Vail, so they settled for the winter in an unheated basement in Gypsum, about 40 miles away.She brought a space heater and was planning to buy a heated mattress pad with a gift card she got for Christmas. Her boyfriend rigged up a tarp to try to enclose their living space and conserve some heat. One night, out of curiosity, they brought a thermometer downstairs with them. It read 40 degrees, Ms. Wang said.\u201cAt least we have a roof over our head,\u201d she said. \u201cVail\u2019s having all these hiring events. They keep on hiring new people. Where are we supposed to live?\u201dThe economic forces that are pricing middle-class families out of San Francisco and driving young professionals deeper into New York\u2019s boroughs also sent Mitch Bishop farther and farther from his job at a ski-rental service in Breckenridge. After paying $200 a week to sleep on couches in Breckenridge and turning down the chance to share an R.V. for $600 a month, he ended up in a cheap rental trailer in Leadville, 40 miles from work.The commute is beautiful, but the 7 percent grades can be a bit treacherous in his Ford Focus. One day, a snow chain snapped and tore up his car. Another day, he hit a patch of black ice and veered into a snowdrift.Mr. Bishop said he was going to stick it out. He studied natural resources management in college and has worked as a kayaking guide and fly fishing instructor, aiming to make the outdoors his life. Colorado\u2019s mountains are the place to do it, he said.\u201cI\u2019m in the heart of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe economy here is booming. If you can\u2019t find a job around here, you\u2019re unhireable.\u201dMany workers floating from place to place said that, without money, having a sense of adventure was crucial to making it in the mountains.Jacob Buettner fitted out a trailer near Vail with a heater and gear to survive the winter. Drew Hannibal, who moved to Colorado from Michigan to work in retail, said he had camped in the woods until the October chill forced him inside. Rosalyn Gillund put all of her stuff in storage and in her pickup truck and is spending the winter on friends\u2019 couches, making dinner or doing laundry as payment.\u201cI really didn\u2019t know what else to do,\u201d she said. \u201cI can sleep anywhere. I\u2019ve got that going for me.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "When China Stumbles", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "Supported bySo, will China\u2019s problems cause a global crisis? The good news is that the numbers, as I read them, don\u2019t seem big enough. The bad news is that I could be wrong, because global contagion often seems to end up being worse than hard numbers say it should. And the worse news is that if China does deliver a bad shock to the rest of the world, we are remarkably unready to deal with the consequences.For those just starting to pay attention: It has been obvious for a while that China\u2019s economy is in big trouble. How big is hard to say, because nobody believes official Chinese statistics.The basic problem is that China\u2019s economic model, which involves very high saving and very low consumption, was only sustainable as long as the country could grow extremely fast, justifying high investment. This in turn was possible when China had vast reserves of underemployed rural labor. But that\u2019s no longer true, and China now faces the tricky task of transitioning to much lower growth without stumbling into recession.A reasonable strategy would have been to buy time with credit expansion and infrastructure spending while reforming the economy in ways that put more purchasing power into families\u2019 hands. Unfortunately, China pursued only the first half of that strategy, buying time and then squandering it. The result has been rapidly rising debt, much of it owed to poorly regulated \u201cshadow banks,\u201d and a threat of financial meltdown.What about financial linkages? One reason America\u2019s subprime crisis turned global in 2008 was that foreigners in general, and European banks in particular, turned out to be badly exposed to losses on U.S. securities. But China has capital controls \u2014 that is, it isn\u2019t very open to foreign investors \u2014 so there\u2019s very little direct spillover from plunging stocks or even domestic debt defaults.All of this says that while China itself is in big trouble, the consequences for the rest of us should be manageable. But I have to admit that I\u2019m not as relaxed about this as the above analysis says I should be. If you like, I lack the courage of my complacency. Why?Part of the answer is that business cycles across nations often seem to be more synchronized than they \u201cshould\u201d be. For example, Europe and the United States export to each other only a small fraction of what they produce, yet they often have recessions and recoveries at the same time. Financial linkages may be part of the story, but one also suspects that there is psychological contagion: Good or bad news in one major economy affects animal spirits in others.So I worry that China may export its woes in ways back-of-the-envelope calculations miss, that the Middle Kingdom\u2019s troubles will one way or another have the effect of depressing investment spending in America and Europe as well as in other emerging markets. And if my worries come true, we are woefully unready to deal with the shock.After all, who would respond to a China shock, and how? Monetary policy would probably be of little help. With interest rates still close to zero and inflation still below target, the Fed would have limited ability to fight an economic downdraft in any case, and it has probably reduced its effectiveness further by signaling its eagerness to raise rates at the first excuse. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank is already pushing to the limits of its political mandate in its own so far unsuccessful effort to raise inflation.And while fiscal policy \u2014 essentially, spending more to offset the effects of China spending less \u2014 would surely work, how many people believe that Republicans would be receptive to a new Obama stimulus plan, or that German politicians would look kindly on a proposal for bigger deficits in Europe?Now, my best guess is still that things won\u2019t be that bad \u2014 nasty in China, but just a bit of turbulence elsewhere. And I really, really hope that guess is right, because we don\u2019t seem to have a plan B anywhere in sight.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Cost-Cutting Helps Lift Profit 10%", "Date": "2016-01-14", "News": "Supported byThe bank, America\u2019s largest, earned $5.4 billion, or $1.32 a share, in the fourth quarter, up 10 percent from the quarter a year earlier, but down from the third quarter of 2015. The results were better than the expectations of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, who had forecast profit of $1.25 a share.Much of the improvement in profit came from continuing cuts to the bank\u2019s expenses and work force, which the bank has pushed aggressively in an era of higher regulations and relatively slow growth.\u201cWe\u2019re very happy with our expense story for the year,\u201d the bank\u2019s chief financial officer, Marianne Lake, said in a call with analysts on Thursday.Shares of JPMorgan closed up 1.5 percent, at $58.20.One area of weakness was lending to oil and energy companies, as a result of the falling price of oil. JPMorgan put more than $100 million aside in the fourth quarter to cover losses in the area and said it would need to put more aside if oil prices stayed low.The company\u2019s Wall Street operations were helped by lower legal costs. However, revenue shrank at nearly all of the underlying trading and investment banking businesses. Investors have been shying away from taking risks as global growth has stuttered, particularly as a result of the slowdown in China, and interest rates have begun to move up in the United States.Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks\u2019 bottom lines.JPMorgan is the first of the big banks to report fourth-quarter results. Citigroup and Wells Fargo will report on Friday.JPMorgan\u2019s results were largely in line for predictions of a relatively sluggish quarter for the banking industry. For the big banks, results have been driven mostly by cost cuts rather than business growth.Revenue at JPMorgan for the quarter rose 1 percent from the previous year, to $23.75 billion. For the year, however, revenue fell 1 percent.Still, the relatively good final quarter brought the company\u2019s profit for the year to a record $24.4 billion.The bank\u2019s results point to some strength in the American economy. Core lending grew 16 percent from the final quarter of 2014.\u201cWe think that the U.S. economy looks pretty good at this point,\u201d Mr. Dimon said.The results indicate that annual bonuses for 2015 will probably be lower than the previous year. In the Wall Street division, the amount set aside for compensation in 2015 fell 5 percent, while in the much larger consumer bank it fell 7 percent.One of JPMorgan\u2019s more significant announcements on Thursday was that it brought down a regulatory surcharge imposed on the country\u2019s biggest banks: the so-called global systemically important bank surcharge. The bank had initially faced the highest G.S.I.B. surcharge of any American bank, but the bank said it believed it had lowered that by two notches \u2014 to 3.5 percent from 4.5 percent \u2014 by reducing certain types of deposits and assets.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Overflow Crowd for Donald Trump in Bernie Sanders\u2019s Backyard", "Date": "2016-01-07", "News": "Supported byBURLINGTON, Vt. \u2014 Donald J. Trump touched down in one of America\u2019s most progressive cities Thursday night, bringing the bombastic message that has captivated Republican voters into the backyard of a Democratic opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.The visit came as the billionaire real estate mogul has made a point of broadening his focus beyond the early primary states, showcasing his popularity with packed rallies from Mississippi to Massachusetts, and now Vermont \u2014 a onetime Republican bastion that is now one of the most solid liberal states in the nation.The choice of venue seemed curious to some, but Thursday\u2019s rally served multiple purposes for the Trump campaign: needling Mr. Sanders in his own neighborhood; garnering attention in nearby New Hampshire, which holds the nation\u2019s first primary next month; and showing that the candidate can attract big crowds in a Democratic haven.\u201cThey\u2019re afraid to come up here because it has a tendency to be a little bit liberal, a little bit rough,\u201d Mr. Trump said of his Republican rivals. \u201cWhen you look at the candidates, I\u2019m like the only one.\u201dA circuslike atmosphere greeted Mr. Trump as many more people tried to get into the event than the Flynn Center for Performing Arts could hold. A brass band played as demonstrators protested outside, and many waited hours to get into the rally, with organizers turning away activists who said they supported Mr. Sanders.While much of Mr. Trump\u2019s ire during the campaign has been directed at Hillary and Bill Clinton and Senator Ted Cruz as the voting nears, he has not hesitated to show his disdain for the policies of Mr. Sanders, whose socialist views he frequently derides. Thursday night was no different, as he accused Mr. Sanders of wanting to raise taxes sharply and called him a weakling for allowing Black Lives Matter activists to commandeer one of his rallies last year.\u201cOh, I would love to run against Bernie,\u201d Mr. Trump said to cheers. \u201cThat would be a dream come true.\u201dAccording to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.Offering a backhanded welcome ahead of his visit, Mr. Sanders said that he hoped some of Vermont\u2019s progressive values might rub off on Mr. Trump. He also called Mr. Trump \u201ca pathological liar.\u201dHe added, \u201cHe just says things that have no basis in fact.\u201dWhile Mr. Sanders has said that he thinks his economic message could be appealing to Mr. Trump\u2019s backers, Mr. Trump has also been promoting his potential to appeal to Democrats despite his criticism of the party\u2019s leadership and policies.In recent weeks, backers of Mr. Trump have even started a \u201cditch and switch\u201d movement, urging Democrats and independents to join the Republican Party so that they can vote for Mr. Trump in primary elections.On Thursday, many who waited to hear Mr. Trump speak said they thought he and Mr. Sanders have some things in common even though they sit on opposite ends of the political spectrum.\u201cI think he\u2019s smart, and he has the best chance of winning support and maybe flipping the state,\u201d Daniel Nadeau, 22, of St. Albans, Vt., said of Mr. Trump. \u201cBernie is my No. 1 choice, and Trump is No. 2. They\u2019re not that different.\u201dVoters who were on the fence between the seemingly polar opposite candidates said both communicated well with working-class people and made strong cases for how they would improve the economy.\u201cI\u2019m a Trump guy, but I do like Bernie,\u201d said Peter Vincenzo, 59, who works installing hardwood floors and traveled from Ohio for the rally. \u201cThere are a lot of parallels between these two guys. There\u2019s a populist appeal that comes with both of them.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s visit brought a whirlwind of disruption to Burlington. To prevent supporters of Mr. Sanders from stealing the show, he released 20,000 tickets to a rally with a venue that holds just 1,400, leaving many out in the cold. Blocks of Burlington\u2019s main corridor were shut as protesters held silent vigils and flooded the sidewalk and part of a nearby park waving anti-Trump signs.One person who was did not make it into the event was Beth Griffin, 47, a letter carrier from Burlington, who stood with the group of demonstrators on Thursday night. She had reserved a ticket, but scrawled a peace sign and a heart on it instead of trying to get into the venue, hoping to quietly show her displeasure with Mr. Trump.The line to get into the venue, she said, \u201cis like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen in Burlington.\u201d\u201cNot for Phish, not on Free Cone Day, nothing,\u201d she said, referring to the band and to the annual occasion when Ben and Jerry\u2019s give out free ice cream.Earlier in the day, even Ben Cohen, a co-founder of the iconic ice cream chain, got into protesting spirit as he walked down the street with a lit-up Sanders campaign sign.\u201cTrump is here in our backyard, and we want to make it clear that we are dyed-in-the-wool Bernie people,\u201d Mr. Cohen said.Despite the Trump campaign\u2019s best efforts to filter out anyone who was not a fan of the candidate, protesters interrupted his remarks every few minutes during a meandering speech that lasted more than an hour.Among promises to build a wall along the southern border, an explanation of how he plans to negotiate with Iran and a call to end gun-free zones in schools, Mr. Trump scolded protesters and told security to \u201cget them out.\u201d Supporters shook Trump signs as people were whisked away, creating a chaotic scene that belied the setting of a formal theater with gilded walls and a red curtain.Through it all, Mr. Trump seemed amused, expressing pride in the fact that his events were not boring \u2014 as he said those of Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton were \u2014 while showing little sympathy for his critics.\u201cDon\u2019t give him his coat,\u201d Mr. Trump said as one man who spoke out against him was removed from the theater. \u201cTake the coat. Confiscate the coat. It\u2019s about 10 degrees below freezing outside.\u201dYamiche Alcindor contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Although they are not treated as the property of \u00ad\u201cowners,\u201d these victims of debt bondage, kidnapping and childhood indenture as domestic servants are not free to leave their work and are vulnerable to exploitation and high levels of control and abuse.Bales, a co-founder of the advocacy group Free the Slaves and author of seven previous books on the topic, links modern slavery in two ways to ecocide. Often, environmental destruction denies people traditional livelihoods, opening them to exploitation. And some of the most destructive industries on the planet use unfree labor: illegal tropical logging, wildcat mining for gold and other minerals, reckless fishing that destroys precious coastal mangrove forests and brickmaking with kilns that release powerful greenhouse gases. So, Bales argues, \u201cIt is precisely the role slaves play in this ecological catastrophe that opens a new solution\u201d: Free the slaves and save the planet. If it seems too simple, it is. The \u00adGlobal Slavery Index includes construction workers and domestics in the Persian Gulf states, a million Uzbeks drafted to pick cotton in a post-Communist \u00adcorv\u00e9e, child brides, trafficked sex workers, agrarian laborers in age-old \u00adMauritanian servitude to other local families, and Haitian village children sent to live in city households for a mix of schooling and servitude. Bales doesn\u2019t know how many of the modern slaves fit his argument, but the number of miners, loggers and fishers in debt bondage or coerced by warlords looks to be much smaller than his figure of 35 million slaves worldwide.With naked guesswork, Bales ascribes 40 percent of global deforestation to slave labor. He then assumes that if modern slavery disappeared, this deforestation and other environmental destruction now done by unfree workers would also end. But where workers are so vulnerable that they can be pressed into modern slavery, and rule of law is weak enough to tolerate profound environmental destruction, free labor will usually be available to do the same bad work on marginally better terms. Bales knows that modern slavery is a symptom of complex social vulnerability, rooted in poverty, violence and ecological displacement. Turning around to propose that a new abolition movement would reverse these deeper problems may work as a homily, but it is unpersuasive as policy.In tying the global moral conflict of the 19th century to the global crisis of the early 21st, Bales means to deepen our understanding, but instead tells a simplistic morality tale. \u201cWe already know how to end global warming. .\u2008.\u2008. It involves all of us doing things like using eco-\u00adfriendly light bulbs, weaning ourselves off fossil fuels, recycling, eating less meat,\u201d he writes. \u201cBut here\u2019s the thing: Criminal slaveholders don\u2019t care.\u201d If climate change were a matter of personal virtue and defeating some evildoers, it wouldn\u2019t be the slow-moving catastrophe that it is. Old-fashioned slavery ended after wars, massive political campaigns and huge public expenditures, because it was woven into every part of the global economy, as ecological destruction is today. It looks like an easy problem only in hindsight.Bales ends his book with an account of an antislavery pageant in a Brazilian elementary school. The children shout, \u201cSlavery, no way!\u201d and Bales assures us they know the solution: \u201cWe just have to catch up with them.\u201d Really, though, we have to get beyond the just-say-no \u00admorality tales of children\u2019s pageants.

PETER HONERKAMPAmagansett, N.Y.To the Editor:It is perfectly reasonable to hold Wounded Warrior or any other organization \u2014 nonprofit, for-profit or governmental \u2014 accountable for lavish spending or gaming its own metrics. But constraining nonprofits to a special class of organization that isn\u2019t allowed to market itself, pay competitive salaries or grow quickly is a longstanding tradition in America.In recent years, that dated thinking has been torn apart, appropriately replaced by the expectation that this sector should be judged on how effectively organizations solve social and environmental problems.Perpetuating the myth that the worth of a nonprofit organization boils down to what it spends on overhead is simply indefensible. It\u2019s a mind-set that keeps the sector small and dooms efforts from the start.IAN HANNAPort Townsend, Wash.The writer is head of investments and partnerships for the Forest Stewardship Council.To the Editor:The real tragedy of this scandal is the impact it will have on donors\u2019 willingness to give to the many worthwhile and more frugal organizations helping our veterans.

{"Headline": "Japan and 'Inherited Guilt'", "Date": "2016-01-11", "News": "Supported byLettersUnfortunately, a rather antithetical attitude is found in Japan, despite the fact that the Japanese government issued what was characterized as a \u201creal apology\u201d for the country\u2019s war crimes during the World War II era.In August, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe showed a starkly different attitude to the German principle of \u201cinherited guilt\u201d when he stated in a speech, \u201cWe must not let our children, grandchildren, and even further generations to come, who have nothing to do with that war, be predestined to apologize.\u201d Moreover, Mr. Abe\u2019s wife, Akie Abe, uploaded pictures of the Yasukuni shrine onto her Facebook page the day the apology was issued, announcing that she had visited the shrine, which honors Japanese war criminals.

{"Headline": "De Blasio Presents $82.1 Billion Budget", "Date": "2016-01-21", "News": "Supported byThe $82.1 billion proposed budget, up a modest 0.5 percent from last year, is almost willfully boring. In a financial summary released Thursday afternoon, the mayor\u2019s office described its fiscal proposal as a \u201cresponsible budget\u201d that \u201cprotects fiscal health through reserves.\u201d\u201cBoring is good sometimes,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said during a budget briefing at City Hall, warning the economy could go from bad to worse quickly. He added the city does not always need to have \u201csplashy new things.\u201dThe budget proposal was nonetheless a departure from previous years, when causes at the heart of the mayor\u2019s agenda took center stage, notably the city\u2019s prekindergarten program. It also included some cuts in that agenda, including an afternoon summer school program that city officials said cost $24 million. They said additional savings were realized by downsizing office space, or, in the case of the Transportation Department, switching from painting new bus lanes with red paint to using red asphalt.The 47-page summary released on Thursday included seven pages on the prospect of an economic downturn, including two pages that sounded almost apocalyptic. They bore the same heading, \u201cImpact of Recession,\u201d and one page warned of city revenues plummeting and greater demands on city services.The mayor, who is scheduled to travel to Albany next week to discuss the city\u2019s financial needs with lawmakers, said on Thursday that he planned to hold the governor to that. \u201cI am taking the governor at his word and I will hold him to that word,\u201d he said.The mayor is also facing a unanticipated obligation: The city\u2019s actuary has predicted municipal employees will live longer, forcing the city to increase its contribution to its five pension systems by roughly $600 million annually.The budget presentation was just an opening offer from the mayor. It must be negotiated with the City Council, which is expected to vote on it in June. The city\u2019s fiscal year begins July 1.At this point last year, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s proposal did not include one of the biggest elements of the final city budget: an expansion of the Police Department by nearly 1,300 officers. Unlike last year\u2019s proposed budget, this year\u2019s plan includes only modest spending on new Police Department initiatives, including $3 million for an expansion of the ShotSpotter technology to all five boroughs. Already in use in some high-crime precincts, the technology detects gunshots that would otherwise go unreported.The city is increasing the number of traffic agents, adding 327 at a cost of $12.1 million, according to details provided by the mayor\u2019s office, \u201cthat will improve traffic flow.\u201dThe administration did seek to highlight what it sees as the city\u2019s continued economic success under Mr. de Blasio\u2019s leadership \u2014 pointing to job growth, a rise in tourism and a flood of new residents.Mr. de Blasio\u2019s presentation also took up the \u201ctwo cities\u201d theme of his 2013 election campaign, and touched on areas that had not prospered with the rest of the city\u2019s economy. For instance, it highlighted average private wages, outside of the financial industry, that remain below their 2007 peak, and noted income growth among top earners that far outpaces those at the bottom.\u201cToo many hard-working New Yorkers are struggling, even as we have economic growth,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cToo many people are struggling to make ends meet.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oil Market Settles Lower, Taking Iran-Saudi Dispute in Stride", "Date": "2016-01-04", "News": "Supported byIn the past, a flare-up in the Middle East could send oil prices soaring, but investors these days seem mainly focused on a global glut of petroleum. With so much oil on the world market, even the biggest producer \u2014 Saudi Arabia \u2014 has only a limited ability to affect prices. The moderate price reaction to a feud between two of the world\u2019s major oil producers shows how much the dynamics of the oil market have changed in the last two years.The signs of a slowdown in China, the world\u2019s biggest economy after the United States, is weighing on prices of various commodities, including oil.Brent crude oil futures for February, the main international benchmark, settled 6 cents lower at $37.22 a barrel. It had risen as much as 4 percent in Europe on Monday.In the United States, benchmark crude oil briefly traded over $38, but closed at $36.76 a barrel.The friction between the Iranian and Saudi governments did serve as a reminder that, despite the sharp fall in oil prices over the last two years, the Middle East, which produces almost one-third of the world\u2019s crude, remains a volatile region.\u201cWhat is coming back to the surface is how deeply divided and complex the Middle East is at present,\u201d said Richard Mallinson, an analyst at Energy Aspects, a market research firm in London.If anything, the Saudi-Iranian tensions might simply emphasize the considerable disarray in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. It is now a matter of \u201cthe winner gaining market share and the loser being squeezed out,\u201d analysts at Citigroup wrote in a note to clients on Monday.\u201cAn agreement to cut production has already eluded OPEC for more than a year; this latest disagreement seems to put it further out of reach at this time,\u201d said Bhushan Bahree, a Washington-based analyst at IHS, a research firm.A big question that had already been weighing on global markets is how OPEC will deal with the anticipated increase in Iranian output if, as expected, Western sanctions over the country\u2019s nuclear program are lifted later this year.Iranian production has fallen around 800,000 barrels a day to about 2.9 million barrels a day since 2010 as the sanctions have limited Iran\u2019s exports, which now go mainly to China, India, Turkey, South Korea and Japan. A sizable portion of that production could be brought back quickly, although analysts say that major increases will depend on how successful Iran is at attracting foreign investment to update its aging petroleum infrastructure.In recent years, the influence of the Middle East producers on the market has been reduced by many factors, including the increase in production outside the region, especially in the United States, which has become a major oil producer through the development of oil from shale-rock deposits.\u201cThe rise of shale oil production has greatly calmed fears about dependence on the Middle Eastern producers to satisfy global oil demand,\u201d said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research.Another factor is that warm weather in much of the world in recent months has been affecting the price of oil and natural gas, both of which are used for heating.The dispute between Saudi Arabia and Iran may also feed into other regional conflicts, like the fighting in Yemen, which borders Saudi Arabia, or the civil war in Syria.There is also concern that the tensions might affect the shipping lanes out of the Persian Gulf or spill into Iraq, which has become the second-largest OPEC producer after Saudi Arabia.But for now, at least, energy investors seem to be betting that, whatever the geopolitical repercussions of the Saudi-Iranian dispute, oil will stay cheap and plentiful.Advertisement"}

Taiwan held its first direct presidential election only 20 years ago. China\u2019s president, by contrast, is selected by the governing Communist Party, not elected by the public.A victory for Ms. Tsai would be only the second time the Kuomintang, or Nationalist Party, has lost the presidency since Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s forces fled to the island at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949.Holding both the presidency and the legislature would give Ms. Tsai considerable power to pursue her party\u2019s agenda.

{"Headline": "President May Have Exaggerated Role of Stimulus in Clean Energy, Experts Say", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported by\u201cGas under $2 a gallon ain\u2019t bad either,\u201d he concluded.Those facts are accurate. But, experts say, many of the changes had little to do with the stimulus law, occurring instead through government policies, market forces and private sector activities.\u201cThat paragraph as it relates to energy and climate issues \u2014 I thought it was the most troubling paragraph of the whole speech,\u201d said David Victor, an expert on energy policy at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to attribute the bulk of what\u2019s happening now in terms of bending the emissions curve and increasing renewables specifically to the stimulus.\u201dWhatever the cause, Mr. Obama can claim a number of energy successes. During his seven years in office, the United States has cut carbon pollution more than any other country, and it has reduced its dependence on foreign oil. In 2008, the United States imported nearly 60 percent of its oil, but by 2015, that number fell to 24 percent.Energy policy experts praise some of the stimulus spending, such as the $400 million that funded the creation of an Energy Department laboratory, modeled after Pentagon research labs, that is devoted to finding breakthroughs in clean technologies. Lawmakers of both parties have praised the program, known as the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, or ARPA-E. And wind and solar producers say that stimulus funding helped keep them afloat through the financial meltdown.Private oil and gas companies, however, were a driving force behind the most important changes in the United States\u2019 energy landscape over the past seven years: lower fossil fuel emissions and a reduction in dependence on imported oil. Using an extraction method known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, the companies made the United States the world\u2019s leading producer of oil and natural gas.A glut of domestic oil has helped lower prices and imports. The new supply of domestic natural gas has helped lower greenhouse gas emissions. Electric utilities have traditionally relied on coal as the cheapest fuel source, but turned to natural gas as it became cheaper.\u201cThe results that the president trumpeted were driven in part by government action but were at least as much a result of market forces,\u201d said Michael Levi, an expert on energy policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cThe president didn\u2019t get in the way, but that doesn\u2019t mean he made these things happen all by himself.\u201dMr. Levi said that it was a different Obama policy \u2014 a set of Environmental Protection Agency rules \u2014 that required a sharp increase in vehicle fuel efficiency and helped lower oil demand.Wind and solar energy producers say that two policies have long powered their industry. One is a set of state laws, now enacted in more than 30 states, mandating the use of renewable electricity. The other is production and investment tax credits.The most important factor behind the growth of the solar industry is an eight-year extension of a federal investment tax credit, approved by President George W. Bush in 2008, said Rhone Resch, the chief executive of the Solar Energy Industries Association, the main trade group.\u201cWe were such a small industry, it provided that stability so that we could bring forward all sorts of new styles of solar projects \u2014 we really hadn\u2019t done utility-scale solar projects in any kind of meaningful way up until that point,\u201d he said.Mr. Obama\u2019s economic stimulus included provisions to extend those tax credits, and it made the money available for wind and solar projects as cash grants.The federal loan guarantee program \u2014 created under the Bush administration but infused with billions under the stimulus \u2014 had several high-profile failures, but it has had many more successes, including Tesla. The failures cost taxpayers $780 million, the Energy Department said, representing a little more than 2 percent of the $34.2 billion it issued in loans. The agency has recouped the losses through interest payments.Still, experts said that while some programs funded by the stimulus have borne fruit, they have not done so at the scale Mr. Obama signaled in his speech.\u201cThe stimulus program subsidized a lot of things that would have happened anyway, or that shouldn\u2019t have happened,\u201d Mr. Victor said. \u201cBut it also funded a handful of important things that wouldn\u2019t have been funded. Exhibit A is ARPA-E, which is innovating important new energy technology. There were huge amounts of money sloshing around, and some droplets sloshed into important places.\u201dCoral Davenport reported from Washington, and Diane Cardwell from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Taiwan\u2019s Workers Flock to China, Concerns About Economy Grow", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported by\u201cPersonally, I see this as a good thing,\u201d Mr. Lee, 38, said.But what is good for Mr. Lee, and for many of his hundreds of thousands of compatriots working overseas, may not be as good for Taiwan. People here are increasingly worried that growing cross-strait trade and investment and the large number of people from Taiwan working on the mainland are making Taiwan dangerously dependent on China, which claims the island as part of its territory and has tried to use its economic clout to buy influence.As in past elections, the crucial political issue is China, and whether Taiwan\u2019s future lies in a closer relationship with its giant neighbor or an autonomous identity. But after eight years of increasing trade ties, the question has taken on a deeply economic tone, as candidates from the Kuomintang and its main rival, the Democratic Progressive Party, debate the risk and reward of China\u2019s embrace.During the campaign, Ms. Tsai has criticized the Kuomintang over Taiwan\u2019s weakening economy, saying it had not protected domestic enterprises from state-sponsored Chinese competition.\u201cTaiwan\u2019s environment for innovation and entrepreneurship is getting worse and worse,\u201d she said last month. \u201cWorkers are going overseas, and a huge number are being poached by Chinese enterprises. Many of our young people abroad can\u2019t find a way home.\u201dThe Kuomintang\u2019s presidential nominee, Eric Chu, has argued that China remains important to Taiwan\u2019s economic future. But as the island\u2019s economic growth has ground to a standstill, voters appear cautious about continuing that path. Mr. Chu\u2019s electoral prospects have also been hurt by a third-party candidate, James Soong, who split from the Kuomintang in 2000.Brain drain has emerged as a symbol of Taiwan\u2019s economic woes. The issue, analysts and economists here say, is that a lack of good jobs and low pay drive many to seek better opportunities overseas.China is by far the biggest magnet for that talent. A study of immigration records found that in 2013, 600,000 of Taiwan\u2019s 23 million people spent more than half of the year abroad. Three of every four were in China. Other estimates say that one million or more people from Taiwan work overseas.In the past, many people went to China to manage Taiwan-owned factories. But now, the jobs leading them there are increasingly in creative industries like animation, or in high-tech fields like integrated circuit design, where Taiwan has more advanced technology.Taiwan\u2019s economy has experienced some benefits from workers going abroad, such as when people who had been employed in Silicon Valley returned to help develop technology companies. But increasingly, those workers are helping China develop its own domestic industries, rather than bringing new skills to Taiwan.\u201cWe can\u2019t blame others for trying to attract Taiwanese talent,\u201d said Lu Jiun-wei, a research fellow at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, which conducted the study of the Taiwan work force abroad. \u201cWe have to make sure our policies are sufficient to keep them here. If our policies are good and more people will stay here, then Taiwan\u2019s future will be better.\u201dDuring the 2012 election, the Kuomintang portrayed itself as better able to handle the economy and relations with mainland China. Under President Ma Ying-jeou, Taiwan reached more than 20 agreements with China, and trade between the two sides climbed more than 50 percent over his eight years in office.But the benefits were not widely felt in Taiwan, where wage growth stagnated in recent years. And as China\u2019s growth has slowed, Taiwan\u2019s economy has plummeted, contracting over the most recent quarter. Gross domestic product growth for 2015 is expected to be just 1 percent.\u201cThe Kuomintang hasn\u2019t taken care of those of us in the middle class,\u201d said Ling Shih-how, 30, who sells construction materials in Taipei. \u201cThey only take care of corporations, and they want to rely on China. The truth is: For exports, we should look to Europe and the U.S. We should have some balance.\u201dMr. Ling said he planned to vote for Ms. Tsai, the first time that he has supported a D.P.P. candidate for president.Both the D.P.P. and Kuomintang candidates have spoken about the need to revive Taiwan\u2019s capacity for innovation. But Ms. Tsai has put a heavier emphasis on social safety nets, like affordable housing units for people who have suffered in the downturn.The candidates all say that trade will remain critical to the economy. But while Mr. Chu says China, Taiwan\u2019s biggest trading partner, should continue to take priority, Ms. Tsai has stressed a strategy of developing trade with a broader set of partners, including the United States.If it takes power, the D.P.P.\u2019s ability to pursue that goal will be limited by China, which has a de facto veto on Taiwan\u2019s participation in international agreements, said Jonathan Sullivan, an associate professor at the School of Contemporary Chinese Studies at the University of Nottingham.\u201cThrough the campaign, the economic focus has been more on the socioeconomic issues, like increasing provision of affordable social housing and raising graduate salaries,\u201d he said. \u201cThese policies capture the zeitgeist, but I do not see the D.P.P. being able to, or promoting, a radical overhaul of the economy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Without such power, women become easy targets when, for example, business falls off or a company merges; age discrimination makes it all the more likely that such women will lose their jobs and not find new ones.Nor are such women accurately represented in the unemployment statistics, since many accept part-time work or, for lack of a better option, become self-employed. Yet the victims of the perfect storm of gender and age discrimination may have financial obligations equal to those of their male counterparts. A lost job can mean a lost home, a disabled child without adequate support or a spouse who is suddenly burdened with the full support of the family.To remedy such inequities, age discrimination laws must be strengthened and enforced, and gender discrimination acknowledged as a continuing workplace concern. Employers rarely admit, even to themselves, that their choices and actions are discriminatory. It is up to the voters, and the courts, to mandate equal treatment.RITA C.

The careers of millions of women might be over.A Harris Poll in 2015 found that 40 percent of Americans who want to work had given up because jobs are so hard to find. At least six million more have taken part-time jobs when they really want \u2014 and likely need \u2014 full-time employment. Studies by AARP show that many of these workers are over 50.To avoid becoming a statistic, workers 50 and older need to make meaningful changes in how they manage their careers. They need to become comfortable with technology and learn how to work with younger people.

Sadly, they have every right to do so.Under current law in New York, a former public official sitting in prison for a felony conviction for misconduct in office can still receive his or her pension checks. In the cases of Mr. Silver and Mr. Skelos, those payouts could easily total millions of dollars each.And they will join a host of other former public officials, including but not limited to elected lawmakers who have been convicted of crimes related to their jobs but who are nonetheless receiving pensions. This is not only a waste of taxpayer money, but it also conveys the message that Albany tolerates \u2014 and is even willing to bankroll \u2014 those proved beyond any reasonable doubt to be corrupt.Changing this situation for state and local officials requires an amendment to the New York State Constitution, which at present mandates that pension benefits not be diminished once someone enters the state pension system. (In 2011, a statutory change fixed this problem for new public employees, but it has no effect on a vast majority of New York\u2019s public officials, who served in some state or local capacity before the end of that year.)While the constitutional provision protects those who serve honorably, those who dishonor their office by criminal conduct deserve no such protection. More than half of all states have passed some form of pension forfeiture for convicted public officials.A constitutional amendment allowing the forfeiture of a pension following a felony conviction, with a judge allowed to weigh mitigating circumstances, would cause potential lawbreakers to think twice before committing the crime. Furthermore, it would at least begin to repay New Yorkers for the harm that befalls all of us when the public\u2019s trust is eroded by corruption.In his most recent State of the State address, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo reiterated his support for a broad pension-forfeiture constitutional amendment. His remarks follow encouraging statements from Assembly Speaker Carl E. Heastie and the Senate majority leader, John Flanagan, in their legislative session opening remarks. Last year, both the State Assembly and the Senate passed bills to amend the Constitution in this fashion.While the pension-forfeiture bills differ in their scope and detail, both would be a significant improvement over the status quo. In theory, this should mean that this real reform can be achieved for New Yorkers in the very near future.However, numerous obstacles lie ahead before this constitutional amendment can become law. I have served as the principal Assembly sponsor of this proposal for all three of my years in the State Assembly, so I am aware that not every player in Albany shares my belief that it is the right thing to do.Some deny that corruption is a serious problem that can be addressed through legislation. Others refuse to support the amendment based on the mistaken premise that pension forfeiture harms the families of the convicted public officials; of course, it is the corrupt officials who harm their families when they violate the law.Some public sector unions have also resisted this reform on the grounds that any reduction in pension rights will lead to broader pension reductions. I believe that, while perhaps well intentioned, they have things backward \u2014 the real threat to public pensions is the erosion of public support for them that occurs every time there is another headline about a corrupt official heading to prison who will continue to collect a full pension.They have also expressed concerns that the law could be used unfairly against low-level employees. But the reform is specifically designed to target people convicted of felonies in connection with their office.All of these objections can be taken up and resolved during negotiations. Ultimately, however, cynicism about New York State politics is the real barrier that needs to be overcome. Public support in polls for stripping pensions from corrupt officials is clear: For example, a Quinnipiac University poll last March found that voters supported pension forfeiture for elected officials by a margin of 76 percent to 18 percent. However, far too many of my colleagues believe that the public doesn\u2019t care enough about this issue to demand action.If our state is to make real progress on our pressing needs, like improving education and growing our economy, there must be a base of public trust in our government. Pension payouts to convicted officials undermine that confidence.If passed by two successive Legislatures (as required in New York), the pension-forfeiture constitutional amendment could be put before the voters for a referendum as early as November 2017. If not, New Yorkers may instead turn to another question on that November Election Day ballot \u2014 because every 20 years voters are asked whether a New York State constitutional convention should be called.The Legislature\u2019s actions in 2016 will shed significant light on whether a constitutional convention is needed to clean up Albany and to honor our pledge of honest government. I hope we don\u2019t have to wait that long.David Buchwald is a Democratic New York State assemblyman representing District 93 in Westchester County.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Marriage, Poverty and the Political Divide", "Date": "2016-01-24", "News": "Supported byThere remains some argument among lawmakers over which Americans should be able to marry, but nearly everyone agrees that marriage itself offers stability and economic benefits to couples and to society at large.Most of the presidential candidates, on the right and the left, sound the same notes on the importance of families for the state of our union.At an anti-poverty forum in South Carolina this month, Mr. Rubio and other Republicans talked about the crucial role that marriage often plays in improving financial prospects.There\u2019s a catch, though. Even if marriage rates were to skyrocket, there would be no shortage of poor married people.About 28 million married Americans and their children lived below or near the poverty line in 2013, according to the federal Government Accountability Office.And the number of married Americans and their children with incomes below the federal poverty level rose by 30 percent from 2000 to 2014, while the overall population of that group declined 3.6 percent. (There was a similar rise in poverty among Americans over all.)A majority of married families who are considered low income (defined as at or below 150 percent of the Census Bureau\u2019s Supplemental Poverty Measure) includes at least one person who is employed. Millions of these families receive help in the form of food stamps or payments from other government programs.The federal government has long been working to promote marriage. It spent $800 million through 2014 on the Healthy Marriage Initiative, begun during the administration of President George W. Bush, which funds a range of programs to help low-income couples have better relationships.\u201cThe right wants to see more married-couple families,\u201d she wrote. \u201cFor the left, widespread single motherhood is a fact of modern life that has to be met with vigorously expanded government support.\u201dShe added, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make much sense to encourage, much less pressure, a couple with no shared history, interests or deep affection to marry.\u201dBut Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, pointed to an analysis of 100 marriage-promotion programs that \u201coverwhelmingly shows positive results.\u201d\u201cThe bottom line on this is helping couples develop flourishing and enduring relationships is a difficult task,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot to ask for a behavioral intervention. But the overwhelming evidence is that these programs have measurable and quite real effects.\u201dAlthough promoting marriage and counseling may be useful, policy makers should focus on strengthening the economic foundations of families in ways that foster stable and healthy marriages and relationships, said Melissa Boteach, vice president of the Poverty to Prosperity Program at the Center for American Progress. (The program will be releasing a report on marital poverty this winter.)\u201cRising income inequality and economic instability contribute to family instability,\u201d Ms. Boteach said.How to reach that goal is where the divide between parties is most evident.Republicans generally focus more on the need to expand opportunities and jobs to help families prosper, or to alter trade and immigration policies. (Mr. Rubio has called for a tax credit for employers that offer family leave, encouraging but not requiring paid leave for new parents.)\u201cMarriage is far from the magic bullet to end poverty that some conservatives claim,\u201d Ms. Boteach said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to be concerned about poverty among single-parent households, but the reality of poverty among millions of married couples and their children has been ignored for too long.\u201dW. Bradford Wilcox, the director of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia, agreed that marriage is not all that is needed to fight poverty.\u201cBut Americans are more likely to realize the American dream if they get and stay married, and grow up in communities where marriage is stronger,\u201d he said. \u201cMarriage fosters saving, facilitates economies of scale and encourages stability in family life, all things that are good for the average American\u2019s pocketbook.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iran\u2019s Sanctions Lift, and the West Goes to Talk Business", "Date": "2016-01-25", "News": "Supported byIt represents the first wave of a broad rethinking of the Iranian market by Western businesses after they were banned from doing business there for nearly two decades. The nuclear deal led to the lifting of crippling economic sanctions on Iran that have left Tehran with a long shopping list, from planes to cars to oil-field equipment.\u201cThere is a huge demand for commercial vehicles, especially trucks,\u201d said Wolfgang Bernhard, the head of Daimler\u2019s truck division. Last week Daimler said it had signed letters of intent with two Iranian partners, Khodro Diesel and Mammut Group, to return to the Iranian truck market it had left in 2010.Credit also remains a serious obstacle as major Western banks are waiting for clarity from the United States Treasury regarding the \u201cstate sponsor of terrorism\u201d label. The label means that no money intended for Iran can move through American banks, something that is all but impossible to avoid in many modern transactions.For its part, Iran is promoting an investment law that promises tax breaks to foreign investors of up to 100 percent, the right to send revenue out of the country and protection of investments in case laws are changed. Still, some legal experts point out that the law seems to conflict with the constitution at some points.Conflicting views among Iran\u2019s political factions could also endanger investments, particularly involving products perceived as symbols of Western consumption. A newly opened restaurant calling itself Kentucky Fried Chicken (most likely a knockoff of its American counterpart) was closed in December by the morality police.One Moscow investment bank, Renaissance Capital, recently said in a note to investors that it expected foreign investors to follow an arc similar to that of investors in Russia in the 1990s \u2014 from enthusiasm to disillusionment \u2014 as Iran opens to the world.\u201cInvestors will likely learn the pitfalls of investing in a country with entrenched vested interests, from the clergy to the Revolutionary Guard, and surprising linkages between banks and companies that lead to some investments turning sour,\u201d the note said.On Monday Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, was scheduled to depart for Italy with a trade delegation. There he is widely expected to reach a multimillion-dollar pipeline agreement with the Italian company Saipem. Saipem is one of many European service companies that Iran hopes can help resuscitate aging Iranian oil and gas fields whose production has declined in recent years.Iran\u2019s economy has suffered as sanctions prevented the sale of its oil on the international market. It barely took a week after the sanctions\u2019 lifting, though, for local oil producers to move back into the global market. Iranian oil officials say they will increase crude production by 500,000 barrels a day immediately, and reach one million additional barrels by the end of the year, effectively erasing the decline over the past four years.\u201cThe Iranians are going to try and come back with a vengeance because they want to show they were unbroken by the international sanctions,\u201d said Helima Croft, chief commodities strategist at RBC Capital Markets, a division of Royal Bank of Canada.Iran\u2019s oil and gas fields are in dire need of infrastructure upgrades. In total, industry analysts say, Iran could spend up to $100 billion rebuilding its natural gas pipelines.Executives in the energy services business in the United States remain cautious.\u201cIt\u2019s not investable yet, not with these low oil prices,\u201d said Dragan Vuckovic, president of Mediterranean International, a Houston company active in the Middle East. Oil prices have collapsed in recent months to some of their lowest levels in years, falling briefly below $30 a barrel before bouncing back slightly.In addition, Mr. Vuckovic expressed concern about future United States policy toward Iran in light of Republican criticism of President Obama\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran. \u201cIran is O.K. under Obama, but what happens after him, we don\u2019t know,\u201d Mr. Vuckovic said.Before Mr. Rouhani\u2019s departure Monday for Italy, he said that two French automakers were also poised to secure new contracts, PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn and Renault, according to Iranian state news media. Officials at Peugeot and Renault did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The two largest American automakers, General Motors and Ford, said on Monday that the revised sanctions did not yet allow them to do business in Iran.Iran Air operates exclusively Western-built jets, consisting of around 40 planes with an average age of 25 years, including several Boeing 747s as well as models no longer in production, like the Airbus A300 and the Fokker 100.The orders, which are likely to be partly financed with loans from European export-credit agencies, could be announced as early as this week in Paris during a visit by President Rouhani, Mr. Akhoondi said.Airbus would not confirm that discussions with Iran were sufficiently advanced to lead to an order in coming days. \u201cAlthough Iran clearly has a need for new aircraft, we conform strictly to all applicable international laws,\u201d said Stefan Schaffrath, an Airbus spokesman in Toulouse, France.In response to questions about interest in Iran on the part of Boeing, the American aircraft giant, a company spokesman said: \u201cFor now, we continue to assess the situation.\u201dRichard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst with Teal Group in Virginia, noted, \u201cIt\u2019s in Iran\u2019s interests to overstate its commercial potential.\u201d Nevertheless, facing sluggish markets in places like Brazil, Russia and India, \u201cthe world\u2019s aircraft manufacturers are eager for any kind of new growth story,\u201d he said.Fatal air accidents have occurred with alarming frequency in Iran. Since the 1979 revolution, there have been 26 civilian plane crashes in the country, according to the Aviation Safety Network, claiming more than 900 lives.With a full lifting of sanctions on aircraft sales, analysts estimate that Iran\u2019s commercial fleet could expand rapidly to around 400 or 500 jets over the next five years, from around 150 planes today.Russian businesses, themselves hard hit by sanctions, along with slumping oil prices at home, are eyeing Iran as well. Sukhoi, the plane maker better known for making the fighters and bombers now streaking over Syria, is in talks to sell Iranian airlines 100 planes before 2020, Dmitry Rogozin, a Russian deputy prime minister, said late last year. Russian oil services companies say they are ready to sell to Iran\u2019s petroleum industry.Russia also expects military sales to pick up. Mr. Rogozin said that Russia began to supply S-300 antiaircraft missile systems to Iran. \u201cThis contract is now executed and paid for,\u201d he said.Reporting was contributed by Andrew Kramer, Thomas Erdbrink, Christopher Drew, Jack Ewing and Bill Vlasic.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "State of the Union Speech Is One Half of Nation\u2019s Political Split Screen", "Date": "2016-01-12", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 Over the course of 48 hours, Americans will confront two starkly disparate views of Barack Obama\u2019s America that will frame the debate over the future of the country in this election year and beyond.By contrast, the country that Republican presidential candidates will depict on Thursday night in their next nationally televised debate is a darker place, a once-great power that has lost ground in a dangerous world, surrendered its authority and leadership with allies and enemies alike, and diminished freedom and opportunity at home.Whichever view ultimately seems more credible to the public will help determine who succeeds Mr. Obama next January and sets the nation\u2019s course for the following four years. For months, Republicans led by Donald J. Trump have tapped into a deep river of discontent in the electorate, and Mr. Obama decided to use the most prominent platform in American politics to push back.\u201cTonight was President Obama\u2019s morning-in-America response to the malaise speech that the Republican candidates have been delivering for the last year,\u201d said Jon Favreau, the president\u2019s former chief speechwriter. \u201cFrom Reagan to Clinton and Obama, people have never elected a pessimistic president who talks about America like it\u2019s a \u2018Mad Max\u2019 movie.\u201d\u201cAmericans wake up every day to more bad news with a world in constant crisis,\u201d said Mark Dubowitz, executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a policy institute focused on national security. \u201cAmerican leadership is in decline while the world is in full meltdown with Iranian mullahs, Russian dictators and radical Islamists on the ascent. No State of the Union address, no matter how eloquent, can explain away that harsh reality.\u201dRepublicans are not the only ones who see a glass half empty. Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont socialist who has mounted a populist challenge to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, has drawn huge crowds describing a country dominated by well-heeled Wall Street plutocrats profiting off workers who have increasingly lost ground.Such negativity from the right and left has exasperated Mr. Obama, who has gotten less credit than aides say he deserves for the progress of the last seven years. The only regret he acknowledged was failed promise to change the tone of Washington. Beyond that, he used the speech to try to refute gloomy Republican assessments.\u201cAnyone claiming that America\u2019s economy is in decline is peddling fiction,\u201d Mr. Obama told the lawmakers in the House chamber and millions watching at home who could easily guess the \u201canyone\u201d he had in mind.A few minutes later, he added: \u201cI told you earlier all the talk of America\u2019s economic decline is political hot air. Well, so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker.\u201dBy some measures, Mr. Obama has a compelling case. Unemployment has fallen to 5 percent, less than half its peak during the economic crisis he inherited, and nearly 14 million more jobs have been created since the recovery began. More than 17 million Americans have health care coverage under Mr. Obama\u2019s program. Median household income finally reached $56,746 in November, the level that had been reached when the recession began, according to one research firm. After a near-death experience, the auto industry has surged. Violent crime is down; so are gas prices.\u201cTo Republicans who won\u2019t give the president any credit for any success in 2016, I would just suggest they read the statistics about where we were at his first State of the Union address in 2009,\u201d said Representative Steve Israel, a Democrat from New York. \u201cBut they can\u2019t afford to do that and that is part of their political calculation. They are so petrified by the fear of a primary on the right.\u201dBut two out of three Americans still feel the country is on the wrong path, in part because the gains of the last few years have not been distributed evenly. Income disparities have grown worse. The poverty rate is 14.8 percent, higher than when Mr. Obama took office. The economy is growing again, but not as fast as under Ronald Reagan or Bill Clinton. And although the deficit has been slashed from its recession spike, the overall national debt has ballooned to $18 trillion from $11 trillion.More challenging to the president\u2019s argument may be foreign policy, where his successes have been overshadowed by turmoil from Paris to Ukraine to Libya to Syria.Mr. Obama has in the last year secured a landmark nuclear deal with Iran, reopened an embassy in Cuba, sealed a free-trade pact in the Asia-Pacific region and corralled the world into a climate change accord. But each of those agreements has its critics who worry about the economic or national security impact.The resurgence of Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s Russia, the devastating civil war in Syria and the rise of the Islamic State, accompanied by terrorist attacks and beheadings, have unsettled many Americans. A president who authorized the raid that killed Osama bin Laden and who hoped to leave office having ended wars in Iraq and Afghanistan will instead hand his successor an unresolved war spreading across multiple countries. Where he used to boast that he had decimated \u201ccore Al Qaeda,\u201d on Tuesday night he said it still posed \u201ca direct threat\u201d to Americans.\u201cIt\u2019s increasingly clear the anxiety voters feel is not just economic,\u201d said Sara Fagen, a Republican strategist. \u201cThey are concerned with what they perceive as a weakened America on the world stage. They believe that even if America was leading, the rest of the world would not follow us. Obama\u2019s actions on Iran, Syria and Russia have done nothing to assuage that fear.\u201dOne of the hardest things for a president to do is to assuage fear, and as the aftermath of the attack in San Bernardino, Calif., showed, Mr. Obama\u2019s style tends toward the intellectual, and at times didactic, even as he is trying to be reassuring.He took over in exceedingly hard times and has struggled ever since to inspire in office the way he did on the campaign trail. But as he begins his final stretch, he has a bully pulpit and he made clear Tuesday night that he intends to use it.He has 373 days left to define what people think of Barack Obama\u2019s America.Kitty Bennett and Julie Hirschfeld Davis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.N.-Appointed Panel Calls for a Tax to Pay for Crises", "Date": "2016-01-17", "News": "Supported byUNITED NATIONS \u2014 What if the next time you buy World Cup tickets or summon an Uber ride, you found yourself paying a few cents extra to pay for winter blankets for Syrian refugees or clean water for those displaced in Darfur, Sudan?The nine-member panel\u2019s report comes as new conflicts erupt in places like Yemen, old ones persist in places like Darfur and climate change intensifies floods and droughts in already fragile countries. Aid for the millions of people affected has sharply risen, but it has not kept pace with demands.The panel \u2014 which includes representatives of donor governments, corporations and civil society \u2014 takes pains to point out that despite the growing needs, what the world needs to pony up for emergency relief is a fraction of the $78 trillion global economy. It also argues that in the end, while \u201chelping people in distress is morally right,\u201d providing aid is also in the interest of donor countries.\u201cToday\u2019s massive scale of instability and its capacity to cross borders, vividly demonstrated by the refugee crisis in Europe, makes humanitarian aid a global public good that requires an appropriate fund-raising model,\u201d the report says.The conventional wisdom for the humanitarian aid sector had been that most conflicts would be short-lived \u2014 and that aid agencies could rely on voluntary contributions from a handful of rich nations to meet those needs. That wisdom no longer always applies. For instance, some conflicts drag on for so long that those who are displaced from their homes remain displaced for an average of 17 years. Countries that host refugees feel the impact acutely, but do not always have direct access to donor money. And refugees are often prohibited from working in the countries where they are living.The report also suggests tapping into what it calls \u201cIslamic social finance\u201d to help meet humanitarian needs in the Muslim world in particular. That could include earmarking a portion of \u201czakat,\u201d the ritual annual donation that Muslims are urged to make as an element of their faith.In addition, the panel suggests that middle-income countries like Jordan, which is hosting hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees, should be able to tap into grants and loans that are currently available only to the poorest countries.The report urges money transfer agencies to drop their fees, which is a nod to the importance of remittances from migrants to their home countries, especially in times of crisis. The authors of the report also encourage more cash assistance, rather than food, tents and blankets. They cite one 2014 study in which 70 percent of a sample group of Syrian refugees traded \u201cin-kind assistance they received for cash.\u201dThe authors nudge newly wealthy countries to be more generous, suggest that aid officials should tap the private sector more creatively, and fault some United Nations agencies for failing to systematically track and report on how its donor money is spent.The panel members could not agree on exactly what to tax, nor the rates at which to tax. That absence of consensus was a measure of how difficult it could be to come up with such a humanitarian tax. But it has an important backer: one of the leaders of the panel, Kristalina Georgieva of Bulgaria, the European Commission\u2019s vice president for budget and human resources. \u201cI\u2019m in support of a voluntary levy,\u201d she told reporters in a briefing before the report was released. She added that the taxes could be small ones on concerts, sports events, even taxi rides.Ms. Georgieva is among those whose names have been floated as Mr. Ban\u2019s potential successor as secretary general.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Price of Republican Orthodoxy", "Date": "2016-01-20", "News": "Supported byIn the report, David C. Maurer, the director of homeland security and justice issues at the G.A.O., wrote:Under federal law, there is no basis to automatically prohibit a person from possessing firearms or explosives because they appear on the terrorist watch list. Rather, there must be a disqualifying factor (i.e., prohibiting information) pursuant to federal or state law, such as a felony conviction or illegal immigration status.On another level, these votes illuminate a conservative orthodoxy that dominates Republican politics. In some way, this orthodoxy is analogous to the liberal orthodoxy known as political correctness.There are adverse consequences for the nation in adherence to doctrinal conservatism.It is more interesting to see how climate change opposition plays out in Republican-controlled states facing the brunt of rising seawaters.In the memo, he flatly rejected all compromise strategies in negotiations with the Clinton administration:Any Republican urge to negotiate a \u201cleast bad\u201d compromise with the Democrats, and thereby gain momentary public credit for helping the president \u2018do something\u2019 about health care, should also be resisted.Instead, the first step in a bid to revive \u201ca newly bold and principled Republican politics,\u201d Kristol wrote,must be the unqualified political defeat of the Clinton health care proposal. Its rejection by Congress and the public would be a monumental setback for the president; and an incontestable piece of evidence that Democratic welfare-state liberalism remains firmly in retreat.During the Obama years, the Kristol strategy has become fully operational for Republicans dealing with administration proposals.In many ways, the Republican strategy of huge resistance has backfired on the party itself.The Trump campaign \u2014 with its angry, \u201ctruth telling,\u201d transgressive style \u2014 might open the door to a less hidebound, more honest politics in the future. The American political system could use a candidate who possesses a good faith desire to address aggrieved voters who believe they have been shortchanged. But for this to be legitimate, such a candidate would have to have greater integrity, range and moral capacity than Donald Trump.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Top Digital-Privacy Watchdog Zeros In on U.S. Tech Giants", "Date": "2016-01-24", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 The latest standoff between Europe and American tech companies runs through a quiet street just north of the Louvre Museum, past chic cafes and part of the French national library, to the ornate office of Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin.One thing is clear, she says: The practices of American businesses, and tech companies in particular, are squarely in her sights.\u201cAmerican companies do not have an immediate right to collect data on our citizens,\u201d Ms. Falque-Pierrotin, 56, a blunt-speaking career civil servant, said recently in an interview, her voice increasingly animated. \u201cIf they are on our soil, then they need to live with the consequences.\u201dShortly after, the national regulators, led by Ms. Falque-Pierrotin, demanded that the European Commission and the Commerce Department reach a new deal by Feb. 1. Negotiators have been talking almost daily since October \u2014 including discussions in Brussels and Davos, Switzerland, in recent days. Still, they remain at loggerheads over how American intelligence agencies monitor Europeans\u2019 digital profiles, according to several officials, who would speak only on the condition of anonymity.Failure to find a compromise, company executives and officials warn, could disrupt billions of dollars of trade between two of the world\u2019s largest economies. Nearly all major multinational companies, including manufacturers like General Electric and drug makers like Pfizer, routinely move customer and employee data between regions.The biggest impact, though, will be felt by United States technology giants like Facebook and Google, which depend on reams of personal data from people\u2019s social media posts, search queries and online purchases to fuel digital advertising businesses. Those efforts often lead to tensions in Europe, where privacy is considered as sacrosanct as freedom of speech.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Deal or no deal, Ms. Falque-Pierrotin is in a position to play a major role. If negotiators agree to a new pact, she and Europe\u2019s other privacy watchdogs will help decide whether the new agreement meets the region\u2019s tough standards. If no deal is reached, she could impose further restrictions on how data is transferred across the Atlantic when European regulators gather on Feb. 2.After receiving degrees from some of France\u2019s top business and civil service schools, Ms. Falque-Pierrotin has spent three decades leapfrogging among government agencies and state-sponsored nonprofits. In the late 1990s, though, she began focusing more on privacy and the digital economy. She joined France\u2019s data-protection authority in 2004 and quickly rose within its ranks.In person, Ms. Falque-Pierrotin comes across as soft-spoken and formal. But her advocates and targets alike say she can be tenacious, though fair-minded. In recent years, she has gained a reputation for taking on some of the world\u2019s largest tech companies, including Google.Even with the confrontation with Google, French privacy experts say Ms. Falque-Pierrotin has regularly contacted local and international companies. She has often taken a less combative approach than other national watchdogs, they say, particularly those in Germany, where officials have often been quick to blame American companies for flouting local rules.Ahmed Baladi, a lawyer at Allen & Overy who represented Google in a previous French data-protection case, said Ms. Falque-Pierrotin aggressively led her agency, known as the Commission Nationale de l\u2019Informatique et des Libert\u00e9s, or CNIL. \u201cBut her strategy also has focused on communication, not just enforcement,\u201d he added.That nuanced approach may prove handy as last-minute discussions about a new trans-Atlantic data-transfer agreement flounder.National authorities may start legal proceedings \u2014 and potentially issue fines \u2014 against companies they think run afoul of Europe\u2019s tough data-protection rules if a new deal is not reached.Ms. Falque-Pierrotin, for instance, has already received complaints against several unnamed companies, though she is waiting until February before deciding whether to begin investigations into how certain companies move data from France to the United States.Vera Jourova, Europe\u2019s justice commissioner in charge of the European negotiating team, still thinks a new data-sharing agreement can be reached, but warns that \u201ca deal will only be made if there\u2019s an equitable approach in the United States\u201d to safeguard Europeans\u2019 privacy rights.Bruce Andrews, the deputy secretary of the Commerce Department, dismissed Europe\u2019s concerns, saying that the United States had already offered the European Commission a number of guarantees on how its citizens\u2019 data would be treated.\u201cWe\u2019ve agreed to make major changes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe U.S. takes individuals\u2019 privacy very seriously.\u201dIn December, Ms. Falque-Pierrotin sent letters to several American agencies, including the Commerce Department and the Federal Trade Commission, asking for meetings to discuss the current impasse. She received only a short response. Not responding fully to Ms. Falque-Pierrotin\u2019s entreaties may prove costly. Already, the French regulator and other European agencies have sent letters to international companies reminding them that the current mechanisms for transferring data are on shaky legal ground.A number of digital-rights advocates, including Mr. Schrems, are also preparing new privacy cases if a data-transfer deal is not reached by Feb. 1.That will most likely cause more problems for American tech giants, pushing Ms. Falque-Pierrotin and her European counterparts to consider new investigations \u2014 and, eventually, fines. But her position on protecting personal data continues to appear unwavering.\u201cDoes the U.S. provide sufficient privacy guarantees?\u201d she said. \u201cUntil now, the answer is no.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018How Stupid Is Iowa?\u2019", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Supported byIn the 44 years since the two major parties have allowed a small cohort of Midwesterners to decide the nation\u2019s first presidential contest, the good people of Iowa have debated issues ranging from nuclear Armageddon to universal health care.And then there\u2019s 2016, when the top two Republican candidates in the dwindling hours before caucusgoers pick a nominee are throwing around this question: \u201cHow stupid are the people of Iowa?\u201dIt was Donald Trump who first raised the issue of Hawkeye State imbecility, in a mocking reference to a crush that Iowans had on Ben Carson last fall. And it\u2019s the odious Ted Cruz who has been using Trump\u2019s very words to goad Iowans into proving that they are not, in fact, so stupid as to back an ego-inflamed reality television star who makes fun of them.We will know soon enough. But before leaving the fog in the rental car\u2019s rearview mirror, let\u2019s take a whack at the insanity of allowing one state such disproportionate power.The problem is not that the people of Iowa are stupid. They are not, by most measurements. It\u2019s that Iowa looks nothing like the rest of America. As a result, the winners, more often than not, are nationally unelectable extremists. Who can remember President Rick Santorum or President Mike Huckabee, both previous winners? Or President Uncommitted, who beat Jimmy Carter in 1976? And what to make of the finding that 43 percent of likely Democratic caucusgoers this year are self-described socialists, prepared to select a dyspeptic and unelectable senator as their candidate?You\u2019re supposed to be vetting, Iowa. You\u2019re supposed to be culling out the crazies. You\u2019re supposed to recognize the fraud of Ted Cruz and how Donald Trump is playing you. For all your touted small-town verities, you\u2019re not doing your job. Your bull manure detector is broken.As a bellwether, the Iowa caucuses are no more predictive than a gasbag on an ethanol high swaying from a bridge in Madison County. As a representative exercise relevant to the concerns of a nation of 322 million people, the caucuses are laughable.Consider that half of all the babies born last year in the United States were nonwhite. Not in Iowa, of course, one of the whitest states in the nation. On Monday, if the Republican caucus is anything like the 2012 turnout, 99 percent of the attendants will be white. That\u2019s not even the United States of 1816, let alone this year.We\u2019re a young nation, though you won\u2019t see much of that fresh blood when Republicans gather on Monday night. Iowa is the fourth oldest state in the nation: In 2012, nearly seven out of 10 Republican caucusgoers was older than age 45.And Iowa women are not leaning in, at least in one party, where a majority of Republican caucusgoers are men. As for religion, 57 percent of 2012 Republican caucusgoers were evangelical \u2014 more than twice the percentage of the electorate nationwide.What do these demographics do? They produce candidates who deny that climate change even exists, who favor total bans on legal abortion, who are opposed to the most common-sensical reforms in gun laws, and who would require a religious test for entry into the country. All of those positions are out of step with the views of a country that\u2019s supposed to reflect majority will.Trump can call for a police state pogrom against 11 million people and be rewarded, because a majority of Republican caucusgoers are white, native-born and believe that electing a demagogue will make American white again.The evangelicals, in particular, deserve Trump\u2019s taunt at their intelligence. Devout Christians profess a belief in piety, humility and sacrifice. The thrice-married Trump says he\u2019s never asked God for forgiveness. His entire campaign is about pride, ego, solipsistic excess. He can\u2019t even fake evangelical speak. For this, he\u2019s their favorite. As he said, he could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and not lose supporters.None of this is discussed in the gloomy chill of Iowa. Instead, we have the stupidity question. Trump raised it. And if he wins on Monday, the people of Iowa will have answered him.Advertisement"}

I hope Senator McConnell will bring the bill to the floor. The American people need to have this debate. The Congress needs to step up, and here\u2019s the question: Are you all in? They are all in against us. They are moving all over the globe.\u201dMr. McConnell took a procedural step on Thursday that will allow him to put Mr. Graham\u2019s bill directly on the Senate calendar, bypassing the normal committee process.Senate Democrats have not indicated how they will respond to the measure, and it is not clear that a new authorization of force by Congress would change anything.Previously, Republicans and Democrats have taken the position that Mr. Obama can rely on the war authorization to combat terrorism that Congress granted after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.Separately on Thursday, Senate Republicans sharply criticized the Obama administration for moving forward with carrying out the president\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran, saying that the easing of economic sanctions would provide tens of billions of dollars that Iran could use to sponsor terrorist groups.Several senators seized on comments by Secretary of State John Kerry at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in which he said it was possible some money made available to Iran through sanctions relief could ultimately flow to terrorist groups, though he said he did not see the money being directed to such groups yet.\u201cTalk about stating the obvious,\u201d said Senator Kelly Ayotte, Republican of New Hampshire. \u201cThey were supporting terrorism when their economy was crippled. They were choosing to put their money into guns, not butter for their citizens, before they had this economic relief. So could it be any more obvious?

{"Headline": "MetLife\u2019s Spinoff Plan Hedges Its Fight With Regulators", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsSteven A. Kandarian is hedging his bets.MetLife, the $50 billion American insurer Mr. Kandarian runs, may unload much of its domestic retail business. The carve-out would reduce the potential impact of higher capital requirements if the chief executive loses his fight with regulators over labeling MetLife a systemically important financial institution. Carl C. Icahn\u2019s activism at American International Group suggests reshaping MetLife may pay off with shareholders.The company plans to put most of its variable annuity accounts in the new American retail unit. Included are three-quarters of those with bells and whistles that, in effect, expose MetLife to market risk in what it might have to pay out. Along with other nontraditional products, the variable annuities have been singled out by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors and Daniel K. Tarullo, a Federal Reserve governor and regulation specialist, as particularly deserving of higher capital cushions. Such firms, known by the acronym SIFI, are those whose failure would have a damaging effect on the American economy.The scale of any potential competitive disadvantage is not yet clear because the rules have not been written. But MetLife\u2019s spinoff numbers work out conveniently. The new variable annuity-heavy business would have $240 billion of assets \u2014 just over a quarter of the $882 billion the insurer had on Sept. 30. That\u2019s handily less than the $250 billion reported by not-so-dissimilar Lincoln National, which has not been tagged with a SIFI label.The remainder of MetLife, with roughly $640 billion of assets, would fit between Prudential Financial and A.I.G., the two other insurance SIFIs. On that simple yardstick, the spinoff would not render Mr. Kandarian\u2019s battle with watchdogs moot \u2013 his company would still be big enough to merit the systemic designation and have to hold extra capital. But most of the products likely to attract big surcharges would be gone.Mr. Icahn\u2019s proposal, made public in October, that A.I.G. should split into three to reduce complexity and escape the SIFI label gives MetLife additional motivation to act. Mr. Kandarian says he will continue his legal battle. But dividing in two makes the outcome less important. And judging by the 5 percent stock-price pop in Wednesday morning trade, it may help keep shareholders happier, too.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Taxing Google and Other U.S. Giants Is Dividing Europe", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byBRUSSELS \u2014 For some European nations, big American corporations like Google are seen primarily as employers and technological innovators whose presence can help with their global competitiveness.But for others, the multinational giants are seen as having used complex accounting to sidestep corporate taxes. That, some argue, makes them prime targets at a time when governments are grasping for revenue to fill budget deficits and trying to address populist concerns about inequality.The divide, long present in Europe, is playing out with new intensity.European Union officials in Brussels are intent on imposing a blocwide standard for taxation and clawing back what they consider to be improper tax breaks granted by national governments to multinational companies.While some countries like France and Germany are happy to see back taxes collected from big corporations as a result of the effort, others are essentially saying they would rather the companies keep all or some of their tax breaks as long as they bring prosperity.The difference in approach may not rank with more existential problems for the European Union, like how to control the migrant influx without sacrificing open borders across much of the Continent. But it shows how tax policy cuts to the core of economic competitiveness for most countries in Europe, where sustained growth and balanced budgets have been hard to achieve lately.Ms. Vestager made her comments about Britain\u2019s deal with Google on the same day that the European commissioner for financial affairs and taxes, Pierre Moscovici, proposed measures meant to close a number of corporate tax loopholes across the European Union.The European Union wants no member state to use tax policy to achieve an unfair business advantage over its neighbors. But the ability of European countries to tailor tax practices to their own purposes is a matter of national sovereignty that many leaders are unwilling to cede to Brussels. That is true for the countries that are trying to compete for jobs and foreign investment brought by multinational titans like Google, Apple or Facebook as well as for those trying to wring more tax revenue from rich companies to help support a struggling economy.\u201cNational governments have competing objectives here,\u201d Neal Todd, an international tax expert and partner at the law firm Berwin Leighton Paisner, wrote in an email message to reporters on Thursday. \u201cWhilst nearly all governments want multinationals in general (and U.S. tech groups in particular) to pay more tax,\" he wrote, \"none of them want to change their own rules only to find that businesses simply relocate to warmer fiscal climes.\"Although the British prime minister, Mr. Cameron, defended his Google deal, his political opponents have criticized it as too generous to the company and not reflective of the full magnitude of its British revenue for the 10 years it covers.In studying the Cameron-Google agreement, Ms. Vestager may follow up on a request of the Scottish National Party, a British opposition party, which has sent a letter to the European Commission criticizing the tax deal with the search giant. A spokesman for Ms. Vestager\u2019s office said on Thursday that the complaint would need to be studied to see if it warranted a formal investigation.The issue could be particularly delicate, coming as Mr. Cameron has been trying to negotiate better terms for Britain within the European Union. As soon as June, Britain may hold a referendum in which voters would be asked whether they want to remain in the bloc or leave it.But Christian Cubitt, a Cameron spokesman, declined on Thursday to elevate the tax dispute to the level of the debate on Britain\u2019s place in the European Union. He said simply that it was \u201ca decision for the commission\" to decide whether to investigate, although he stressed that Google had agreed to pay all the tax that is due.Britain is by no means alone in seeking to handle corporate tax matters on its own terms.Italian financial police officials were to issue an investigative report to Google on Thursday, indicating whether the company has paid sufficient taxes in Italy since 2008. Although Google has not been accused of wrongdoing, tax officials say the delinquent amount could be about 300 million euros, or about $325.3 million.Google is also in discussions with France over back taxes. Last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the company\u2019s executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, met with the French economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, to discuss the matter.There has been no public discussion of how much in back taxes is being sought by France\u2019s Socialist government, but local news reports have placed the figure as high as \u20ac500 million.Google\u2019s official response to reports of those negotiations has been the same, which it repeated yesterday: \u201cGoogle complies with the tax laws in every country where we operate. We continue to work with the relevant authorities.\u201dThe biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Ms. Vestager is also investigating tax arrangements between Ireland and Apple, and Luxembourg and Amazon over whether the companies received preferential tax deals that broke the European Union\u2019s state-aid rules. A decision in the Apple case is expected in March, at the earliest; the Amazon case could also be decided in the coming months. The companies and governments say they have done nothing wrong.In previous cases where Ms. Vestager has ruled that corporate tax arrangements violated European Union law by favoring certain companies, governments have been ordered to recoup back taxes that they would rather not collect lest they signal to other multinationals that their countries are not business-friendly.While Ms. Vestager is investigating cases where countries might have let companies pay too little tax, the proposals by Mr. Moscovici on Thursday are meant to prevent tax avoidance before it happens by closing gaps in cross-border rules to channel profit to subsidiaries in lower-tax countries.In a news conference, Mr. Moscovici said losses from the loopholes amounted to nearly \u20ac70 billion a year, discriminated against small business and angered ordinary citizens.His proposals mean to deter European governments from, for example, letting companies shift profit to low-tax jurisdictions. Mr. Moscovici said his proposals also showed Europe\u2019s eagerness to put into effect international standards endorsed by the leaders of Group of 20 major economies last year.Mr. Moscovici\u2019s measures would also require corporations to fully disclose all of their taxes, profit, revenue and other financial data to the administrations of all countries where they operate.The proposals, though, might be hard to turn into law. They would require the unanimous approval of European Union governments, and some could balk. And the measures would not affect the low across-the-board corporate tax rates that countries like Ireland use as an inducement to attract foreign companies.Oxfam, an antipoverty group, criticized Mr. Moscovici as taking an ineffective \u201clowest common denominator approach\u201d to the tax overhaul.British lawmakers aligned with Mr. Cameron\u2019s government were wary of Mr. Moscovici\u2019s proposals.\u201cGlobally, there is a battle raging for jobs and growth,\u201d said Ashley Fox, the leader of the delegation of British Conservatives at the European Parliament. \u201cThe E.U. must ensure that its proposals do not act as a deterrent to international investment and employment.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Friday about divisions in Europe over the taxing of multinational corporations misidentified the recipients of written comments about European tax policies from Neal Todd, an international tax expert. They were sent to the news media, not to Mr. Todd\u2019s clients.James Kanter reported from Brussels, and Mark Scott from Rome. Stephen Castle contributed reporting from London, Elisabetta Povoledo from Rome, and Aurelien Breeden from Paris.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton for the Democratic Nomination", "Date": "2016-01-30", "News": "Supported byEditorialFor the past painful year, the Republican presidential contenders have been bombarding Americans with empty propaganda slogans and competing, bizarrely, to present themselves as the least experienced person for the most important elected job in the world. Democratic primary voters, on the other hand, after a substantive debate over real issues, have the chance to nominate one of the most broadly and deeply qualified presidential candidates in modern history.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s main opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described Democratic Socialist, has proved to be more formidable than most people, including Mrs. Clinton, anticipated. He has brought income inequality and the lingering pain of the middle class to center stage and pushed Mrs. Clinton a bit more to the left than she might have gone on economic issues. Mr. Sanders has also surfaced important foreign policy questions, including the need for greater restraint in the use of military force.In the end, though, Mr. Sanders does not have the breadth of experience or policy ideas that Mrs. Clinton offers. His boldest proposals \u2014 to break up the banks and to start all over on health care reform with a Medicare-for-all system \u2014 have earned him support among alienated middle-class voters and young people. But his plans for achieving them aren\u2019t realistic, while Mrs. Clinton has very good, and achievable, proposals in both areas.The third Democratic contender, Martin O\u2019Malley, is a personable and reasonable liberal who seems more suited for the jobs he has already had \u2014 governor of Maryland and mayor of Baltimore \u2014 than for president.Mrs. Clinton is a strong advocate of sensible and effective measures to combat the plague of firearms; Mr. Sanders\u2019s record on guns is relatively weak. Her economic proposals for financial reform reflect a deep understanding of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform act, including the ways in which it has fallen short. She supports changes that the country badly needs, like controls on high-frequency trading and stronger curbs on bank speculation in derivatives.Mr. Sanders has scored some rhetorical points against Mrs. Clinton for her longstanding ties to Wall Street, but she has responded well, and it would be comical to watch any of the Republican candidates try to make that case, given that they are all virtually tied to, or actually part of, the business establishment.One of the most attractive parts of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s economic platform is her pledge to support the well-being and rights of working Americans. Her lifelong fight for women bolsters her credibility in this area, since so many of the problems with labor law hit women the hardest, including those involving child care, paid sick leave, unstable schedules and low wages for tipped workers.Mrs. Clinton is keenly aware of the wage gap for women, especially for women of color. It\u2019s not just that she\u2019s done her homework \u2014 Mrs. Clinton has done her homework on pretty much any subject you\u2019d care to name. Her knowledge comes from a commitment to issues like reproductive rights that is decades old. She was well ahead of Mr. Sanders in calling for repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which severely limits federal money to pay for abortions for poor women.As secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton worked tirelessly, and with important successes, for the nation\u2019s benefit. She was the secretary President Obama needed and wanted: someone who knew leaders around the world, who brought star power as well as expertise to the table. The combination of a new president who talked about inclusiveness and a chief diplomat who had been his rival but shared his vision allowed the United States to repair relations around the world that had been completely trashed by the previous administration.In January 2011, before the Arab Spring, Mrs. Clinton delivered a speech that criticized Arab leaders, saying their countries risked \u201csinking into the sand\u201d unless they liberalized their political systems and cleaned up their economies. Certainly, the Israeli-Palestinian crisis deepened during her tenure, but she did not cause that.Mrs. Clinton, who has been accused of flip-flopping on trade, has shown a refreshing willingness to learn and to explain, as she has in detail, why she changed her mind on trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. She is likely to do more to help workers displaced by the forces of trade than previous presidents have done, and certainly more than any of the Republicans.Mrs. Clinton has honed a steeliness that will serve her well in negotiating with a difficult Congress on critically important issues like climate change. It will also help her weather what are certain to be more attacks from Republicans and, should she win the White House, the possibility of the same ideological opposition and personal animus that President Obama has endured. Some of the campaign attacks are outrageous, like Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to bring up Bill Clinton\u2019s marital infidelity. Some, like those about Mrs. Clinton's use of a private email server, are legitimate and deserve forthright answers.Hillary Clinton is the right choice for the Democrats to present a vision for America that is radically different from the one that leading Republican candidates offer \u2014 a vision in which middle-class Americans have a real shot at prosperity, women\u2019s rights are enhanced, undocumented immigrants are given a chance at legitimacy, international alliances are nurtured and the country is kept safe.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Supreme Court to Hear Challenge to Obama Immigration Actions", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court said Tuesday that it would consider a legal challenge to President Obama\u2019s overhaul of the nation\u2019s immigration rules, agreeing to examine the reach of presidential power as it decides the fate of one of his most far-reaching executive actions.The court, which has twice rejected challenges to Mr. Obama\u2019s signature legislative victory by upholding his health care law, will now rule on the president\u2019s plan to protect millions of illegal immigrants from deportation and allow them to work indefinitely in the country legally.The justices raised the possibility of a broad decision by taking the unusual step of adding their own question to the case, asking the parties to address whether Mr. Obama had violated his constitutional obligations to enforce the nation\u2019s laws. The answer to that question could significantly alter the scope of presidential power in realms far beyond immigration.\u201cThe court\u2019s decision could redefine the balance of power between Congress and the president,\u201d said Stephen Yale-Loehr, a law professor at Cornell.But Mr. Obama\u2019s aggressive use of executive power has intensified the criticism by his adversaries that the president is abusing his authority. Attorney General Ken Paxton of Texas, who is leading the challenge to his immigration actions, urged the court to make it clear that no president can \u201cunilaterally rewrite congressional laws and circumvent the people\u2019s representatives.\u201dFourteen months ago, Mr. Obama ordered the creation of a program intended to allow as many as five million illegal immigrants who are the parents of citizens or of lawful permanent residents to apply for a program sparing them from deportation and providing them work permits. The program was called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA.The president has said he took the step after years of frustration with Republicans in Congress who had repeatedly refused to support bipartisan Senate legislation to update immigration laws. In an Oval Office address just before Thanksgiving in 2014, Mr. Obama excoriated Republicans for refusing to cooperate and told millions of illegal immigrants, \u201cYou can come out of the shadows.\u201dBut the president\u2019s promise has gone unfulfilled. A coalition of 26 states, led by Mr. Paxton, a Republican, quickly filed a lawsuit accusing the president of ignoring federal procedures for changing rules and of abusing the power of his office by sidestepping Congress.White House officials said they were pleased by the court\u2019s decision to hear their case, and they expressed optimism that the justices would eventually clear the way for the president\u2019s actions to be carried out.\u201cThe policies will make our communities safer. They will make our economy stronger,\u201d said Brandi Hoffine, an assistant White House press secretary. \u201cThey are consistent with the actions taken by presidents of both parties, the laws passed by Congress, and the decisions of the Supreme Court. We are confident that the policies will be upheld as lawful.\u201dIf the Supreme Court upholds Mr. Obama\u2019s actions, the White House has vowed to move quickly to set up the DAPA program and begin enrolling immigrants before his successor takes over early next year. Democratic presidential candidates have said they would continue the program, but most of the Republicans in the race have vowed to dismantle it and redouble immigration enforcement.The administration, fearing that the program could remain frozen through the balance of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency, had asked the court to move quickly. On that point, at least, the court agreed, and it now appears that the case will be argued in April and decided by the end of June.As is their custom, the justices gave no reasons for agreeing to hear the case, United States v. Texas, No. 15-674.The new case joins a crowded docket, including cases on abortion, affirmative action, public unions, voting rights and religious liberty. The decisions in all of them will probably land in the late spring and early summer, as the presidential election enters its final stages.He added that the consequences of allowing immigrants to be lawfully present were positive. \u201cWithout work authorization,\u201d Mr. Verrilli wrote of the people eligible for the program, \u201cthey are more likely to work for employers who will hire them illegally, often at below-market wages, thereby hurting American workers and giving unscrupulous employers an unfair advantage.\u201dMany of the briefs so far have focused on the threshold question of whether the states have suffered the sort of direct and concrete injury that gives them standing to sue. The question will play a major role as the Supreme Court considers the case.Judge Jerry E. Smith, writing for the majority in the appeals court, said the states had standing to challenge the program under a 2007 Supreme Court decision that said Massachusetts and other states were entitled to sue the Environmental Protection Agency over its refusal to regulate motor vehicle emissions contributing to climate change.In that case, the Supreme Court said Massachusetts had standing to challenge the Bush administration\u2019s decision not to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions based on the harm the state would suffer from a rise in sea levels and the loss of the state\u2019s coastal land.Judge Smith said Texas would suffer a similarly direct and concrete injury in having to spend millions of dollars to provide driver\u2019s licenses to immigrants as a consequence of the federal program.Mr. Verrilli told the justices that Texas\u2019 injury, such as it was, was self-inflicted, a product of its own decision to offer driver\u2019s licenses to people lawfully in the United States at reduced cost.Texas responded that being required to change its laws is itself the sort of harm that confers standing. \u201cTexas could avoid the driver\u2019s-license-cost injury only by changing its policy and making driver\u2019s licenses less affordable,\u201d the states told the justices. \u201cThat is itself an injury, because Texas has a sovereign interest in enforcing its legal code.\u201dJudge Hanen grounded his injunction on the Obama administration\u2019s failure to give notice and seek public comments on its new program. He found that notice and comment were required because the program gave blanket relief to entire categories of people notwithstanding the administration\u2019s assertion that it required case-by-case determinations about who was eligible for the program.The appeals court affirmed that ruling and added a broader one. The program, it said, also exceeded Mr. Obama\u2019s statutory authority.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "PAID FOR AND POSTED BYWith thousands of migrant workers subjected to abuse and exploitation, development in the Middle East comes at a high human cost.FOR UNSKILLED LABORERS from Bangladesh, India, Nepal and other populous developing economies, jobs are scarce and wages are very low, some less than $100 per month. It is little surprise, then, that a job in the Middle East advertised as paying upward of $500 per month can seem irresistible.Yet for the hundreds of thousands of laborers who jump at this opportunity and migrate to the oil-rich Gulf region, this vision often proves to be a mirage.\u00a0First, securing a position often means paying a local recruiter a $2,000 fee, usually obtained through a loan with an extortionate interest rate. Upon arrival, workers may have to sign a contract \u2014 often in Arabic, a language most of them cannot read \u2014 the terms of which may state that the job pays only $200 a month, far less than promised, with housing costs deducted from that. This leaves approximately $100 a month \u2014 barely enough to cover the loan interest on their recruiting fee.The exploitation, however, often extends beyond mere money. In many cases, the company they signed up to work for confiscates their passports, making it impossible for them to leave without the permission of their employer. Unable to access labor protections, many are\u00a0forced to live in cramped, unsanitary conditions with no time off.\u00a0The result is a form of modern-day slavery that exists together with human trafficking, debt bondage, child labor and forced marriage.And some pay the ultimate price. Between 2010 and 2013, for example, the International Trade Union Confederation estimates that about 1,200 migrant workers died in the state of Qatar; some\u00a0of these casualties were related to the massive drive to build stadiums for the 2022 World Cup. Additionally, in 2015 seven workers were killed, six were injured and 15 were trapped under the concrete of a building site at a university in Qassim, northwest of Saudi Arabia\u2019s capital, Riyadh.Flawed as these labor practices are, they have become the lifeblood of many industries in\u00a0the Gulf\u2019s wealthiest nations. Today, migrant workers make up more than 70 percent of the work force in the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) \u2014 Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman. A large proportion of the workers, meanwhile, are almost entirely from South Asia: Nearly all migrant laborers from India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, for example, take jobs in a GCC country.\u00a0Those who do are all too often left stranded, broke and trapped as forced laborers in the deserts of the Gulf, building the gleaming skyscrapers, huge stadiums and world-class airport facilities that are redefining the architecture and economy of these oil-rich nations.\u00a0With local labor shortages and high-profile construction projects underway\u00a0\u2014\u00a0such as Qatar\u2019s\u00a0World Cup stadiums; new airports in Doha, Dubai and Abu Dhabi; and branches of art museums such as the Louvre and the Guggenheim\u00a0\u2014\u00a0migrant workers are needed more\u00a0than ever across the region.\u00a0\u201cYou have significant demand for workers from Bangladesh, Nepal and India,\u201d says Nick Grono, CEO of the Freedom Fund, a philanthropic initiative focused on the fight against modern slavery. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a whole bunch of structural factors that facilitate exploitation.\u201d\u00a0For example, in a 2015 investigative report, it emerged that roughly one-third (about 10,000 people) of the migrant workers employed in the construction of New York University\u2019s Abu Dhabi campus were unable to access the protections of the university\u2019s labor guidelines on fair wages, working hours and living conditions.\u00a0According to the U.S. Department of State\u2019s 2014 Trafficking in Persons Report, in Kuwait, despite 2010 legislation setting maximum working hours, the law excludes migrant domestic workers. Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch found that in Qatar these laborers are not allowed to form unions or engage in strikes.Back in their home countries, migrants are driven into the hands of unscrupulous recruiters by everything from joblessness and poverty to corruption and political conflict.\u00a0\u201cAt its core, it\u2019s about global inequality,\u201d says David Segall, a policy associate at the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. \u201cBecause of that supply and demand, workers have a strong incentive not to ruffle any feathers by asserting their rights,\u201d adds Segall, who focuses on the recruitment and migration of construction workers from South Asia to the Persian Gulf. \u00a0Male laborers are not alone in their suffering. Human Rights Watch estimates that there are 236,500 domestic workers in the United Arab Emirates, of whom 146,100 are female, accounting for 12.8 percent of the total employment in the country. \u00a0In a 2014 study conducted by the organization, a few of them talked about enduring physical and sexual abuse, being confined to their employers\u2019 homes and working long hours without time off, with insufficient food and no medical treatment.\u00a0As in other parts of the world, the chain of responsibility for migrant workers in the Middle East is long and complex. \u201cEach stakeholder tends to pass the buck on to others,\u201d says Segall.Faced with unsafe conditions as well as physical and sexual abuse, migrant workers in Kuwait show an alarmingly high suicide rate. Domestic workers accounted for 56% of all suicides in 2013, with 81% of all suicides involving South Asian migrants and 19% involving African migrants. Migrant-Rights.org estimated that in 2010 migrant workers in Kuwait were attempting or committing suicide every two days.In Saudi Arabia, domestic employees work an average of 63.7 hours a week, the second-highest rate in the world. Long hours are not the only abuses. In 2014, 3,740 migrants filed complaints about employers, with issues ranging from nonpayment of wages to refusal to renew residency permits.Between 2010, when the World Cup was awarded to Qatar, and 2013, 1,200 workers died, according to data from India and Nepal obtained by the International Trade Union Confederation (as some have pointed out, it is not possible to link World Cup construction projects directly to all these deaths). According to human rights activists, worker abuses in Qatar include passport confiscation, lack of trade union representation, cramped accommodation and delayed wage payments.Research by Human Rights Watch found that migrant workers in Bahrain routinely faced discrimination and abuse, including a series of violent attacks in 2011 during anti-government protests. Human Rights Watch cited Bahrain\u2019s Ministry of Interior, which said that four migrant workers were killed in the incidents during the unrest and 88 were injured, including 11 Indians, 18 Bangladeshi, 58 Pakistanis and one Filipino.In 2013, hundreds of striking migrant workers in Dubai were threatened with deportation after Arabtec, the contractor working on projects that include the city\u2019s airport and the Abu Dhabi branch of the Louvre museum, refused to accept their demands for higher wages. In addition to poor wages, many of the workers in UAE also endure extremely cramped conditions in labor camps such as Sonapur, where dozens of workers have to share single rooms and water shortages are common.After the earthquake that hit Nepal in 2015, killing more than 8,000 people, Nepalese workers being employed on the World Cup construction sites in Qatar were denied permission to leave the country to visit relatives and attend funerals, according to news reports quoting the Nepalese government.The global attention of labor activists focused on sex trafficking among female domestic workers when in 2010 authorities discovered two underage Bangladeshi girls with forged passports at an airport in Bahrain. Thai and Bahraini nationals had told the women they would be working as domestic servants but then forced them into prostitution in entertainment venues.Filipina domestic workers are routinely subject to physical abuse in the United Arab Emirates. One worker told Human Rights Watch that her employers slapped, kicked and beat her. Another said her female employer had punched her on the arm, pulled at her clothes and spat in her face.About 57% of total remittances sent by workers overseas to their families back home come from Gulf Cooperation Council countries. While these remittances help pull families out of poverty, workers\u2019 safety and welfare are threatened by corruption and the presence of middlemen and fraudsters.On construction projects in the Gulf, worker safety is often compromised. In April 2015, two construction workers were killed and at least 14 injured after a collapse at a convention center being built at a university in Qassim, northwest of the capital, Riyadh. The workers were mainly from Pakistan.With huge demand for construction laborers and domestic workers means millions of migrants from poor communities have traveled to the Middle East enticed with promises of high wages, only to find themselves forced into labor. The International Labor Organization (ILO) estimates that there are 600,000 forced labor victims in the region. These workers are often subjected to abuse and exploitation with no legal or social networks to support them.Click on the dots to learn more about the labor conditions in key migrant worker source and destination countries in the Middle EastFaced with unsafe conditions as well as physical and sexual abuse, migrant workers in Kuwait show an alarmingly high suicide rate.

But this region is not the exception. Worldwide, there are 232 million international migrants and the International Labour Organization estimates that about 21 million of them are trapped in jobs into which they were coerced or deceived.\u00a0Indeed, with the globalization of trade and commerce has come the globalization of labor. In manufacturing industries, companies have outsourced production of everything from textiles to toys and electronics to developing countries, where wages are lower, even if human rights may not be respected and working conditions can be harsh. In the Middle East, due to the construction boom, the dynamic is similar but transposed \u2014 it is the workers who are imported rather than the goods they make.\u00a0\u201cIn a globalized economy, we\u2019re going to continue to see risks and cost reductions pushed down to the most vulnerable in society, and that often means migrants, refugees, people affected by conflict, women and children, and those in lower social castes,\u201d says James Cockayne of the United Nations University, who has studied modern slavery. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely part of what we see in the Middle East.\u201dIf the drivers of labor-rights abuses in the Middle East are complex, so too will be the solutions. And many argue that this means not only addressing the complex networks of unregulated subcontractors and unscrupulous recruiters but also helping change the practices of large global corporations.Some see consumer pressure playing a role, particularly in the case of high-profile projects. \u201cCompanies\u00a0\u2014\u00a0especially Western-based construction firms\u00a0\u2014\u00a0are beginning to realize\u00a0that\u00a0reputation risk is increasing, especially with regard to the World Cup,\u201d says Segall.Others see incentives for companies to combat forced labor because of the risk of legal consequences they face if found contravening legislation such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. \u201cIf you are a U.K. or U.S. corporation and you\u2019re employing a work force, there\u2019s potential court liability,\u201d says Grono.Financing provides another leverage point. Duncan Jepson, founder of Liberty Asia, believes persuading banks to treat these risks like any other investment risk could bring about change. \u201cIn this area of the Middle East, these projects are vulnerable to corruption, exploitation and fraud and they should think about this before they invest,\u201d he says.Others argue that highlighting the business case for promoting a better labor environment\u00a0could help companies address safety and poor working\u00a0conditions. \u201cThe turnover rate is extraordinary and it costs money to bring in new workers,\u201d says Segall. \u201cAnd a happy work force is a more productive work force.\u201dThere is a powerful message here for governments, too, since a stable, skilled work force with legal protections is necessary to advance their development goals. The fight against forced and bonded labor is therefore important not only to end injustice and abuse, but also because workers who are released from modern-day slavery and forced labor could become a happy and healthy work force with the potential to advance development in nations and local communities around the world.Tricked and Indebted on Land, abused or Abandoned At SeaIllegal \u201cmanning agencies\u201d trick villagers in the Philippines with false promises of high wages and send them to ships notorious for poor safety and labor records.The Price of Nice NailsManicurists are routinely underpaid and exploited, and endure ethnic bias and other abuse, The New York Times has found.\u2018Sea Slaves\u2019: The Human Misery That Feeds Pets And LivestockMen who have fled servitude on fishing boats recount beatings and worse as nets are cast for the catch that will become pet food and livestock feed.SELECTED BYThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}

Interfax, a nongovernment news agency, reported that the central bank held an emergency meeting Thursday evening with Russian bankers.A main stock market index, the dollar-denominated RTS, recovered from an early decline to close up by 0.6 percent for the day. But it is still just above its post-2008-crisis low, and not much higher than in the late 1990s, indicating the severity of the retreat of Russia\u2019s market.Another benchmark index, the Micex \u2014 which is denominated in rubles \u2014 was up 2.9 percent for the day.Aleksei L. Kudrin, a former finance minister, said at the World Economic Forum on Thursday that Russia should brace for oil\u2019s bottoming out at $16 to $18 a barrel for a short period this year.\u201cThe price will, of course, correct and rise,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly, there is a shock. But in a year or two the economy will pull through to positive growth.\u201dOil prices are nearing a level that could be catastrophic for Russia\u2019s budget, analysts say, given that the government cannot tax oil companies more than the cost of producing oil in Siberia.The production cost in Russia is estimated to average about $15 a barrel. With roughly half of Russia\u2019s budget derived from taxes on oil and natural gas, a sustained drop in oil prices to the levels Mr. Kudrin predicted would compel tax increases or a budget reduction known as a sequester, forcing salary cuts for teachers, soldiers and police officers, and lower pensions.Futures contracts for Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, traded below $28 on Wednesday, but were back in the $30 range on Thursday.In another reflection of the severity of the oil-price shock for Russia, the government is considering canceling a five-year-old social security program. It had deducted contributions from wages to build up funds for future retirees. The government plan would shift to financing pensions from current taxes, the daily newspaper Kommersant reported, even though demographic changes mean more workers will retire in future years.Also on Thursday, the Russian central bank revoked the banking licenses of three lenders \u2014 Vneshprombank, Miraf-Bank and Turbobank \u2014 that had become insolvent.Advertisement"}

Moreover, nearly as many Americans said that Mr. Obama exceeded his authority with his executive actions on gun control as said he acted properly.Over all, 46 percent of Americans approve of his handling of the job, while 47 percent disapprove, placing him below Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton at this stage of their presidencies, but significantly above George W. Bush. Democrats remain broadly supportive of the president and about three in five potential Democratic primary voters said they wanted their nominee to continue his policies if elected.The numbers suggested the challenge for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Gov. Martin O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Malley of Maryland as they jockey for the party mantle. To win the favor of Democrats, they may not be able to veer too far from Mr. Obama, yet he remains weak enough that being seen as the embodiment of a third term might not help with the general public in the fall.Of the issues tested, Mr. Obama is at his weakest on foreign policy, with just 34 percent approving of his performance. Only 37 percent approve his immigration policies and 40 percent of his handling of terrorism. His strongest area is the economy, and even there his ratings are mediocre, with 45 percent favoring his handling of the issue, compared with 49 percent disapproving.On the heels of strong job-creation numbers, Mr. Obama plans to spend much of his speech on Tuesday night highlighting the recovery of the economy on his watch. His Republican opponents, zeroing in on his weak areas, have focused in recent days on what they see as his foreign policy failures in places like Iran, North Korea, Syria and Ukraine.Mr. Obama, who has not enjoyed the support of a majority of Americans in the Times/CBS News survey since shortly after his second inauguration, in 2013, retains one saving grace, namely that Congress remains even less popular than he is. That has not changed drastically with the arrival of new management. Public opinion of Congress is still stubbornly low, with just 15 percent approving and 75 percent disapproving.The new House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, is unknown to many Americans but has a challenge first consolidating support among Republicans, who split with 34 percent approving of his performance, compared with 23 percent disapproving.

Boehner after a conservative revolt, but some on the right remain suspicious of their new leader despite his conservative record.The latest poll was conducted after Mr. Obama announced his plans to expand the range of gun sellers who must conduct criminal background checks on customers and tighten enforcement of existing laws. More than six in 10 Americans support that, but they are divided on party and other lines. While 54 percent of Americans in households with a gun owner supported the action, 61 percent of those with a member of the National Rifle Association at home opposed it.Over all, 49 percent of the public said Mr. Obama had acted within his authority, while 43 percent said he went beyond his power to regulate guns. As with other issues, that one broke down along party lines, with three-quarters of Democrats concluding that he acted within bounds and a roughly equal proportion of Republicans disagreeing.While nearly three in five Americans would like to see stricter gun laws enacted, and 54 percent think such laws would help prevent gun violence, there is ground for consensus on the issue. Americans of all stripes with near unanimity support background checks for all potential gun buyers and strong majorities regardless of party affiliation think better mental health screening and treatment would reduce gun violence.The nationwide poll was conducted from Jan. 7 to 10 with 1,276 adults on mobile telephones and landlines. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points for all adults and six points for Democratic primary voters.Further results from the poll will be released at 6:30 p.m. \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Russians Learn the Ways of the Cowboy From American Ranch Hands", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byValuets JournalThe cowboys on this new Russian ranch here still have a few things to learn. And unlearn. In a throwback to the old Soviet way of doing things, while the two were trying to move the recalcitrant cow, four others were standing idly by shouting advice.Watching the greenhorns from afar was Ashley Chester Corlett, one of 10 American trainers brought in by the ranch\u2019s owner, the Miratorg company. It chose them over Brazilians and Australians in large part because of the similarity between the climate in Wyoming and central Russia, where temperatures can drop to 20 degrees below zero Fahrenheit (minus 29 Celsius).\u201cAt first people always want to use pressure to handle the cattle and don\u2019t realize how much like a predator they seem to the cow,\u201d said Mr. Corlett, a thickset fourth-generation cowboy from Riverton, Wyo. \u201cIf you want to get the best out of that cow, you have to understand how it thinks. It opens so much understanding.\u201dThe aspiring cowboys also have to get used to working long days in harsh conditions, a concept that often seems novel to many of them.\u201cWorking here is hard. Many people cannot stand it, especially the need to stay sober,\u201d said Viktor P. Buivolov, who installed elevators in Moscow before becoming the manager of the ranch. \u201cWe even have a Breathalyzer here,\u201d he said, navigating a Russian UAZ Patriot sport utility vehicle through a herd of cattle.Agriculture all but disappeared from this and many other parts of Russia years ago, after the final screw was turned into scrap metal at the last surviving Soviet collective farms. But as oil prices have collapsed and Russia has imposed retaliatory sanctions against Western food products, reviving the economy with import substitution has become a priority for the Kremlin. President Vladimir V. Putin has said Russia has the potential to become a world leader in food production, and has set a goal of self-sufficiency by 2020.The ranch is part of the Miratorg company of Viktor and Aleksander Linnik, brothers who since 2010, have amassed an empire of more than 1.5 million acres of Russian rangeland and are on track to gather up one million more. At that rate they will become the largest landowners in Russia, owning territory the size of Lebanon.Some in the industry attribute Miratorg\u2019s remarkable success to connections to high-ranking officials in the Russian government, with the company having enjoyed lavish subsidies and generous loans over the last five years. Viktor Linnik dismisses those allegations as the product of envy.\u201cOur rivals have nothing else to do but tell people fairy tales about our mysterious connections,\u201d Mr. Linnik said, sitting in his sleek office in Moscow, in the prestigious district of Ostozhenka. \u201cAny other company could get the subsidies we got.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like sanctions as such, but they forced the Russian government to change the paradigm and start developing domestic production,\u201d Mr. Linnik said. \u201cThe ruble devaluation made us only more competitive.\u201dThis Wi-Fi-enabled ranch here in the middle of the Bryansk region, 270 miles southwest of Moscow, is just one islet in the Miratorg archipelago. A few thousand head of Angus graze wide fields of the Russian pasturelands celebrated by the country\u2019s poets and novelists. A few generic white buildings with red-tile roofs stand beside a corral where the cattle are eventually collected, examined for good health, and then shipped off to an Austrian-designed beef processing factory, one of the most modern in Europe.Mr. Corlett travels among 51 Miratorg ranches like this one, scattered around central Russia, to train and oversee Russian cowboys. Over all, the Americans are training 1,000 of them to eventually watch over more than 360,000 cattle \u2014 what the company calls the largest herd of this type in the world.Mr. Corlett communicates with his students via arm-waving conversations, telling them how to be patient and how to calm the cow. Russian cowboys yearn to understand more, but a lot of what Mr. Corlett knows can be taught only by experience, which they are just beginning to get.Mr. Corlett says training Russians is not all that different from training anyone else. \u201cVery seldom I am treated as a bad guy because I am an American,\u201d Mr. Corlett, 38, said, sipping tea in the ranch\u2019s office. \u201cPeople at home ask me if I am scared, but the American media blows it out of proportion. In their average needs and desires, Russians are no different from us.\u201dNevertheless, wearing ushankas, the traditional fur caps with earflaps that can be fastened at the chin, instead of Stetsons, these Russian cowboys still seem unfamiliar with the sturdy horses they have recently learned to ride.\u201cThis is a tough, dangerous and stressful job. The cattle are wild,\u201d said one of the men, Nikolai Barbashin, 31, who used to work as a carpenter.When asked about their trainers, the Russians keep on marveling at the American\u2019s capacity for work.\u201cWe come to work and they already drive a herd somewhere. Americans are very hard-working,\u201d said Viktor I. Golanov, 37, who worked as a butcher, in a typical comment.The Russians have a strong incentive to keep the nose to the grindstone. Most were born and brought up in the area but were forced to migrate to Moscow to find work. For them, the chance to come home for a good job was a godsend.Back in the slush puddle, the cowboys finally got the cow moving, and began shuttling her to the corral, where she would be checked for diseases.Last year, Russia\u2019s agricultural exports exceeded its arms exports for the first time in decades. This year, they are expected to reach $20 billion.More than 12,000 pounds of Miratorg\u2019s beef is consumed every month at Farsh, a hip burger restaurant on Nikolskaya, one of Moscow\u2019s upscale streets, leading straight to one of the Kremlin towers. This is an equivalent of 17 steers. Muscovites are ready to wait a half-hour for their burgers to materialize, one of them called Bryansk Boy.\u201cWe have a lot to learn from the Americans,\u201d Mr. Linnik said. \u201cI saw how their farmers work 12 to14 hours per day. This is the basis of the nation\u2019s prosperity.\u201cOne day agriculture will replace oil in terms of importance for the Russian economy,\u201d he added, hopefully. \u201cIf we do everything right, I am sure it will.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The Bedouin village in which she lives does not have enough electricity at night to power the laptop she brings home from the office; work must stop once the battery runs out. In a conservative society that frowns on female drivers, she said, she does not have a license.Fortunately for people like Ms. Hawashleh, companies like Sadel and government initiatives aimed at bringing more young Arabs into the technology work force are trying to change that.\u201cIt was a phenomenon in Bedouin society,\u201d said Ibrahim Sana, the chief executive of Sadel, which he set up in 2013 with an Israeli technology investor. \u201cYouths were graduating from college in software engineering and other technological studies, and ended up as gas station attendants or teachers.\u201dMr. Sana, 35, now employs a dozen people. He found one of his employees, who had graduated from college with distinction, stocking shelves in a supermarket. Another was working as an apprentice locksmith.\u201cIt is a real change for those looking from outside, and from within, to feel that we are part of this country,\u201d Mr. Sana said. \u201cIsrael is a leader in high-tech, and we want a piece of that.\u201dMr. Sana\u2019s experience is unusual. Many Bedouins have trouble finding such jobs, he said, because they live far from the commercial center of the country, often in villages that the authorities refuse to recognize, without infrastructure; or because recruitment often works through word of mouth and personal contacts that the Bedouins do not have. Then there is basic prejudice, he said, as well as the fact that English is a third language after Arabic and Hebrew for many Arab citizens. Sadel, in an industrial park about five miles from a growing technology center in Beersheba, mixes technology with tradition. At lunchtime, for example, the employees take out their prayer mats and perform Muslim midday prayers.On a recent afternoon, Bassam Abu Zaed, 27, a web and Android developer and a quality assurance team leader, finished his prayers and was soon back at his desk developing a diagnostics application for mobile devices that he intends to sell to cellphone companies.Sadel is also unusual in that it hires Bedouin women, whose employment opportunities are usually limited to fields such as education. Rifaa Azbarga, 26, one of three women working at Sadel, received a degree in software engineering and then taught math in the Bedouin town of Keseife \u201cbecause everyone told me they never take Arabs into high-tech.\u201d She now builds websites for businesses and is developing an Android application that combines radio news, advertising and chat functions.Ms. Hawashleh, one of 11 siblings, went to school in the village of Abu Qreinat, which has a population of about 5,000. A star pupil, she said she had only herself to compete with and constantly strove to raise her grades.After a year of studying math and computer science at Ben-Gurion University, Ms. Hawashleh dropped out because she needed to help support her family, and taught in the village school until a friend who worked at Sadel introduced her to the company.Ms. Hawashleh said that her parents, who were born in Abu Qreinat, want her to marry within the extended family, but that she would prefer to look farther afield and perhaps move to one of the larger Bedouin towns in the area.\u201cMy parents say that they know what\u2019s good for me,\u201d Ms. Hawashleh said with a giggle, sitting on an embroidered mattress next to her mother. \u201cTo teach, marry and have a family.\u201dDespite this, her mother, Hesen, 50, said she and her husband were proud that they had educated their girls and were happy about her career.Ms. Hawashleh said that when she first began working at Sadel, her parents did not tell relatives, assuming that they would disapprove of her working in a company away from home.\u201cNow,\u201d she said, \u201cthey all know.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Today, the house produces more than 4,000 pieces annually, with prices that start at $5,000 and quickly tip into more eye-watering territory.But in her Paris showroom this night, just a handful of her Chinese team members were crouched at laptops amid cramped clothing racks, storage boxes and styling boards, while a French hairdresser fussed over models being fitted with creations from her latest collection.\u201cThe funny thing is, when I began my own house I had no idea that this type of artistry had a rich and long tradition elsewhere,\u201d she said, her Mandarin translated into English by her husband and business partner Cao Bao Jie. \u201cThis world as it existed in the West didn\u2019t exist to me. I was just doing what I liked and thought was truly beautiful.\u201dFashion in China then was only just beginning in the way we understand it today, she added: \u201cVery few clients could comprehend what I was trying to show. That craftsmanship and design could add enormous value to a garment, transforming it from a piece of tailoring to a true work of art, was very hard to grasp for them.\u201dAs she gradually convinced them, her prices ballooned, as did the ambitions of her lavish designs. The elaborate excess that has become Ms. Guo\u2019s hallmark \u2014 be it vast skirt volumes, lashings of beaded semiprecious stones or rich explosions of embroidered color \u2014 marries European silks with traditional Chinese design heritage.\u201cI don\u2019t consider my work to be within the limits of conventional fashion, nor do I follow trends creatively or commercially,\u201d she said. \u201cMy work displays feelings and emotions that are precious enough to be handed down generation after generation, as well as the experience of developing gowns directly with my clients. They are reflections of myself, and of them, of the scale of my dreams and the pride I have for Chinese culture.\u201dMs. Guo says that looking ahead, her efforts will focus on expanding her business internationally, with a second atelier headquarters in Paris, as well as on her bridal line as the wedding market in China continues to explode. She introduced a cosmetics line in collaboration with MAC last year, and she has branched out into demicouture from a store in Shanghai.The designer, who played down any concerns over China\u2019s recent economic slowdown and its potential impact on the couture market, emphasized how grateful she felt for the opportunity to show her creations to a new audience in the days ahead. She was curious, she said, to hear how others interpreted her work, but was confident that her aesthetic would resonate.\u201cThis year is my 30th year in the fashion industry,\u201d she said. \u201cFor the first 10 years I learned; for the second, I practiced, and now, during the third, I believe I am going to reap the rewards.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The Quinnipiac poll found that Mr. Sanders is seen as more honest and empathetic than Mrs. Clinton, and stronger on climate change and the economy. She is viewed as being more electable in a general election and stronger on foreign policy. Gender is also turning about to be a significant factor in how the candidates are performing, with men preferring Mr. Sanders by a margin of 61 percent to 30 percent. Women back Mrs. Clinton by a margin of 55 percent to 39 percent. Perhaps more worrying for Mrs. Clinton is the finding that a majority of New Hampshire voters said that their choice is set, while only 35 percent were completely decided two months ago.\u201cNew Hampshire Democratic preferences are getting baked in, with Sanders gaining the upper hand,\u201d Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, said in a statement. \u201cThe final question will be who does a better job at turning out their respective voting blocs.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Sanders is now leading Mrs. Clinton among all the major voting blocs in New Hampshire.

{"Headline": "Boom or Gloom?", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Supported byWhether the winner of the 2016 presidential election emphasizes optimism or pessimism, he or she will face some sobering economic developments.important because when big companies swallow up others, it signals that acquiring companies have essentially outsourced their ideas rather than growing internally.According to Litan, the increased number of mergerssuggests that the safer thing to do is to buy someone else rather than develop new products and services yourself. The merger trend is a sign of a collective failure of nerve, the risk-taking that historically contributed to much higher economic growth rates, such as the roughly 4 percent average from 1948 to 1973.Aggregate productivity growth depends not only on innovations and technology investments within firms but also on the economy\u2019s ability to reallocate resources from businesses with lower productivity to businesses with higher productivity.These four authors conclude that the decline in \u201crapid firm-level growth\u201d indicates that there has been a corresponding decline in the \u201cefficient movement of labor toward high-productivity producers,\u201d which, they cautiously note, is \u201ca cause for concern.\u201dIn a dynamic economy, businesses are born, grow, and die; jobs are created and lost; and resources are reshuffled according to their best use. If there are fewer new companies and more aging ones, then labor and capital hang tight in old industries. The economy is not refreshed and growth slows.In the century after the end of the Civil War, life in the United States changed beyond recognition. There was a revolution \u2014 an economic, rather than a political one \u2014 which freed people from an unremitting daily grind of manual labor and household drudgery and a life of darkness, isolation and early death. By the 1970s, many manual, outdoor jobs had been replaced by work in air-conditioned environments, housework was increasingly performed by machines, darkness was replaced by electric light, and isolation was replaced not only by travel, but also by color television, which brought the world into the living room. Most importantly, a newborn infant could expect to live not to the age of 45, but to 72.Since 1970, in contrast, new innovations have occurred primarilyin a narrow sphere of activity having to do with entertainment, communications and the collection and processing of information. For the rest of what humans care about \u2014 food, clothing, shelter, transportation, health and working conditions both inside and outside the home \u2014 progress has slowed since 1970, both qualitatively and quantitatively.The Republican candidates have been talking more about doom and gloom than candidates usually do. If Gordon is right, whoever holds the White House after Jan. 20, 2017, will find the job as frustrating as it is rewarding.In an email, Gordon forecasts a 0.3 percent annual growth rate of \u201cmedian disposable income per person after taxes and transfers\u201d for the period from 2015 to 2040 \u2014 one sixth the 1.69 percent rate from 1920 to 2014. Gordon\u2019s apprehension is based in part on his findings, which show the rise and fall of productivity (you can see this in the accompanying chart).In addition to the slowdown in innovation, Gordon sees four \u201cheadwinds\u201d: the aging of the population, the decline of American education in comparison to foreign nations, rising inequality which, among other things, diminishes consumer purchasing power, and the growing federal debt burden.growth has been consistently weaker than was expected. This has occurred even though interest rates have fallen substantially, suggesting that it reflects a reduction in demand.As unemployment increases, more people adjust to a lower standard of living. As they become accustomed to the lower standard of living, people may not be as determined to achieve the previously desired higher living standard. In addition, as more people become unemployed, it becomes more socially acceptable to be or remain unemployed. After the labor market returns to normal, some unemployed people may be disinterested in returning to the work force.The views of both Summers and Gordon are controversial, and disputed by other scholars.Some of the best economists of our age, including Larry Summers, Paul Krugman, and my own colleague Robert J. Gordon, are joining the chorus of the doomsayers.But not Mokyr. His response to those who say \u201cthat product and process innovation are running out of steam\u201d is \u201cshort and simple: we ain\u2019t seen nothin\u2019 yet, the best is still to come.\u201dBarry Eichengreen, an economist at Berkeley, takes Gordon to task in a chapter he contributed to \u201cSecular Stagnation\u201d:For economic historians, this argument flies in the face of 200 years of experience. Pessimists have now been predicting slowing rates of invention and innovation for centuries, and they have been consistently wrong. Looking ahead, it seems clear that the productive potential of robotics and the human genome, for example, have only begun to be realized. Evidence that we are learning how to use intelligent machines to replace first unskilled and eventually skilled labor suggests that we have a distribution problem, not a growth problem.The transformations brought about by digital technology will be profoundly beneficial ones. We\u2019re heading into an era that won\u2019t just be different; it will be better, because we\u2019ll be able to increase both the variety and the volume of our consumption.In this new world, there will be \u201cbounty instead of scarcity, freedom instead of constraint.\u201dIn a phone interview, Brynjolfsson made the point that \u201cwe are far from tapping out the innovations\u201d growing out of digitization, computers and information technology. Three-dimensional printing, he said, is \u201cthe biggest revolution manufacturing has ever seen.\u201dAccording to Brynjolfsson, as computers learn to identify faces or cancerous lesions, or how to spot fraud in an accountant\u2019s report, the range of new uses for computers will grow geometrically.Despite the conflicting views of optimists and pessimists on the future of technology, there is a surprising level of agreement among those engaged in the debate over the public policy imperatives.Eichengreen of Berkeley puts it this way in his chapter of \u201cSecular Stagnation\u201d:If the U.S. does experience secular stagnation over the next decade or two, it will be self-inflicted. The U.S. must address its infrastructure, education and training needs. Moreover, it must support aggregate demand to repair the damage caused by the Great Recession and bring the long-term unemployed back into the labor market.Summers similarly argues in the same book that reformsshould include increased public investment, reductions in structural barriers to private investment and measures to promote business confidence, a commitment to maintain basic social protections so as to maintain spending power, and measures to reduce inequality and so redistribute income towards those with a higher propensity to spend.Although Brynjolfsson is optimistic about future economic growth, he believes that major improvements in education and training are necessary to ensure that workers have the skills to fill newly created jobs.The current configuration in Washington precludes the adoption of such proposals. Big ticket items \u2014 a major boost in infrastructure spending, enactment of a federally directed program of school reform and alteration of tax and spending programs to redistribute income appear to be out of reach. The ironclad commitment of Republicans to oppose any domestic initiatives that require higher taxes or deficit financing stands in the way of progress. Democrats themselves have misgivings \u2014 ranging from teacher union rejection of school reform to the opposition of upscale Democrats to redistributive tax policies.Perhaps, then, Gordon\u2019s pessimism is justified. \u201cHypothetical legislation,\u201d he writes:however politically improbable, has its limits. The headwinds that are slowing the pace of the U.S.\u2019s future economic growth have been decades in the making, entrenched in many aspects of our society. The reduction of inequality and the eradication of roadblocks in our educational system defy the cure-all of any legislation signed at the stroke of a pen.An earlier version of this column misstated the given name of an economist at the Federal Reserve; he is Ryan Decker, not Roland.Advertisement"}

Once formidable emerging countries are in disarray: Brazil and Russia have fallen into deep recessions, and China is, at best, decelerating; only India emits a soup\u00e7on of positive energy.At such moments, we are reminded that economics is not a science like chemistry or physics in which new discoveries become immutable truths, but an endless debating society whose disorderliness reaches a fresh fever pitch whenever the road ahead seems bleak. This is the point at which we are now. Economists are fiercely divided not only over how to address the world\u2019s challenges but also even over what those challenges are.Among the hopeful, Keynesians \u2014 for whom the New Deal was the apogee of policy-making success \u2014 want more expansionary fiscal policies, particularly spending on investment-type programs like rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure. For conservatives, determined to revive the Reagan playbook, the mantra is to get government out of the way \u2014 through lower taxes, less spending and, certainly, fewer regulations.At the same time, a posse of declinists urges us to accept a reality of subpar performance. One faction of these perma-pessimists argues that the world is doomed to suffocate under an ocean of debt. Another believes, in essence, that we are doomed to slow growth (if any) because transformational inventions that powered the industrial and technological revolutions are unlikely to be repeated.Into this fray wade Satyajit Das and Mohamed A.

The mid-19th-century Opium Wars, which brought a great Chinese economic machine to its knees, resulted from Britain\u2019s trying to contain China\u2019s last export boom by forcing the Asian nation to import opium. And on and on.The heart of Das\u2019s book is a familiar journey through what he calls the Global Financial Crisis and the ensuing recession. In the run-up to the 2008 financial collapse, he says, the world relied too heavily on borrowing and financial engineering to create economic activity. Growth was unbalanced, as some countries saved heavily while others consumed beyond their means. Overly generous pension and health care programs added enormous tonnage to the obligations of both governments and business, setting the stage for cataclysmic moments like the collapse of the American automobile industry.When the financial crisis and ensuing recession struck, Das continues, governments chose not to attack the central \u00adcauses of the near collapse, but instead turned to the more politically palatable path of easy money and increased public spending, which resulted in even more debt. Those ballooning budget deficits helped give rise to efforts in the United States and Europe to slash government spending, an austerity movement of which Das is a paid-up member.But that\u2019s where Das veers off the rails. Slashing debt when the free-fall recession of 2008 hit, as he believes every sector of the economy should have done, could well have meant depression. Similarly, the Federal Reserve\u2019s often maligned program of quantitative easing (the buying of debt securities to keep interest rates low and encourage borrowing) made a difficult situation better, not worse. Obsessed with the debt problem and devoid of policy prescriptions, Das comes down so firmly on the side of the pessimists (the book\u2019s title gives away its conclusion) that by its end readers may want to slit their wrists.Mohamed A. El-Erian \u2014 an economist, former investment manager and peripatetic commentator (with whom I share service on the board of a research organization) \u2014 offers a bit more hope. To him, the world is at a critical juncture. We are destined, he believes, to turn sharply either toward a resumption of historical growth rates or to a slide into full stagnation, or worse.El-Erian frames \u201cThe Only Game in Town\u201d around the world\u2019s central banks, on the sensible grounds that with the rest of government focused on austerity, the one source of help for still-wallowing economies has been easy money, pro\u00advided by low interest rates and quantitative easing.Not since the former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker boosted interest rates to 20 percent in 1979-80 to combat raging inflation have central banks been so much in the public eye, and so controversial. For every supporter who believes they are, indeed, the only game in town, there\u2019s a critic who is unshakably convinced that expansionary monetary policy has put us on the road to another round of asset bubbles and, perhaps, inflation.El-Erian expertly offers a balanced view, commending the central banks for their necessarily aggressive policy views while noting, for example, the failure of the Fed to recognize the pre-crisis housing bubble. But title aside, this is hardly just a book about central banks. Instead, El-Erian offers a grand tour of the challenges we face, along with ideal solutions and more likely outcomes. He even dips into subjects of questionable relevance, like cognitive diversity and cultural bias. All in all, this is an accessible, albeit familiar, cruise through pretty much all things economic.Curiously, just a few years ago, El-Erian declared the world to be in the midst of a \u201cnew normal\u201d of slow \u2014 but positive \u2014 growth, a pronouncement for which he congratulates himself in this book. Maybe he should have stuck with that. To me, a continuation of that path seems more likely than the sharp turn either upward or downward he now \u00adpredicts.The biggest gap in both books is insufficient recognition of the problem of productivity \u2014 the output each worker generates. Without increases in efficiency, workers can\u2019t get paid more and the economy can\u2019t expand. And of late, productivity growth has been woefully light.Das doesn\u2019t acknowledge the productivity problem until well into his book, and then immediately pivots away. El-Erian is somewhat more expansive about the issue, making (unspecified) structural reforms part of his first prong of policy proposals. But he, too, quickly returns his attention to government budgets, monetary policy and the like, all more fun to chew on than the messy business of improving the supply side of our economy.No doubt the challenges of the world economy are great, and no doubt our elected officials have fallen woefully short in implementing potential solutions. But achieving reasonable growth is well within our grasp. Not everything that can be invented has been invented. The countless hours that would be saved by a single, now imaginable idea \u2014 driverless cars and trucks \u2014 could alone reverse disappointing productivity figures.As El-Erian makes clear, dysfunctional government bears a large share of the blame for our inadequate economic performance. The European Union is, of course, a swamp, but more important for us, deepening polarization of political parties in the United States has left Congress gridlocked. With luck, the coming election will unclog our governmental arteries. We desperately need a system in which the central banks are no longer the only game in town.THE ONLY GAME IN TOWNCentral Banks, Instability, and Avoiding the Next CollapseBy Mohamed A.

{"Headline": "What Republicans Should Say", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Supported byFor a few decades, American and British conservatism marched in tandem. Thatcher was philosophically akin to Reagan. John Major was akin to George Bush.But now the two conservatisms have split. The key divide is over what to do about the slow-motion devastation being felt by the less educated, the working class and the poor.Ted Cruz and Donald Trump have appealed to working-class voters mostly by blaming outsiders. If we could kick out all the immigrants there wouldn\u2019t be lawbreakers driving down wages. If we could dismantle the Washington cartel the economy would rise.First, he defined the role of government: basic security. In a world full of risks, government can help furnish a secure base from which people can work, dream and rise.Cameron argued that both sides in the debate over poverty suffered real limitations because they still used 20th-century thinking. The left has traditionally wanted to use the state to redistribute money downward. The right has traditionally relied on the market to generate the growth that lifts all boats.The welfare state and the market are important, but, he argues, \u201ctalk to a single mum on a poverty-stricken estate, someone who suffers from chronic depression, someone who perhaps drinks all day to numb the pain of the sexual abuse she suffered as a child. Tell her that because her benefits have risen by a couple of pounds a week, she and her children have been magically lifted out of poverty. Or on the other hand, if you told her about the great opportunities created by our market economy, I expect she\u2019ll ask you what planet you\u2019re actually on.\u201dCameron called for a more social approach. He believes government can play a role in rebuilding social capital and in healing some of the traumas fueled by scarcity and family breakdown.He laid out a broad agenda: Strengthen family bonds with shared parental leave and a tax code that rewards marriage. Widen opportunities for free marital counseling. Speed up the adoption process. Create a voucher program for parenting classes. Expand the Troubled Families program by 400,000 slots. This program spends 4,000 pounds (about $5,700) per family over three years and uses family coaches to help heal the most disrupted households.Cameron would also create \u201ccharacter modules\u201d for schools, so that there are intentional programs that teach resilience, curiosity, honesty and service. He would expand the National Citizen Service so that by 2021 60 percent of the nation\u2019s 16-year-olds are performing national service, and meeting others from across society. He wants to create a program to recruit 25,000 mentors to work with young teenagers.To address concentrated poverty, he would replace or revamp 100 public housing projects across the country. He would invest big sums in mental health programs and create a social impact fund to unlock millions for new drug and alcohol treatment.It\u2019s an agenda that covers the entire life cycle, aiming to give people the strength and social resources to stand on their own. In the U.S. we could use exactly this sort of agenda. There is an epidemic of isolation, addiction and trauma.There are two natural approaches to help those who are falling behind. The first we\u2019ll call the Bernie Sanders approach. Focus on economics. Provide people with money and jobs and their lifestyles will become more stable. Marriage rates will rise. Depression rates will drop.The second should be the conservative approach. Focus on social norms, community bonds and a nurturing civic fabric. People need relationships and basic security before they can respond to economic incentives.But Republicans have walked away from their traditional Burkean turf. The two leading Republican presidential candidates offer little more than nativism and demagogy.David Cameron has offered an agenda for a nation that is coming apart. There desperately needs to be an American version.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Obama Boom", "Date": "2016-01-11", "News": "Supported byDo you remember the \u201cBush boom\u201d? Probably not. Anyway, the administration of George W. Bush began its tenure with a recession, followed by an extended \u201cjobless recovery.\u201d By the summer of 2003, however, the economy began adding jobs again. The pace of job creation wasn\u2019t anything special by historical standards, but conservatives insisted that the job gains after that trough represented a huge triumph, a vindication of the Bush tax cuts.So what do we learn from this impressive failure to fail? That the conservative economic orthodoxy dominating the Republican Party is very, very wrong.In a way, that should have been obvious. For conservative orthodoxy has a curiously inconsistent view of the abilities and motivations of corporations and wealthy individuals \u2014 I mean, job creators.On one side, this elite is presumed to be a bunch of economic superheroes, able to deliver universal prosperity by summoning the magic of the marketplace. On the other side, they\u2019re depicted as incredibly sensitive flowers who wilt in the face of adversity \u2014 raise their taxes a bit, subject them to a few regulations, or for that matter hurt their feelings in a speech or two, and they\u2019ll stop creating jobs and go sulk in their tents, or more likely their mansions.It\u2019s a doctrine that doesn\u2019t make much sense, but it conveys a clear message that, whaddya know, turns out to be very convenient for the elite: namely, that injustice is a law of nature, that we\u2019d better not do anything to make our society less unequal or protect ordinary families from financial risks. Because if we do, the usual suspects insist, we\u2019ll be severely punished by the invisible hand, which will collapse the economy.Economists could and did argue that history proves this doctrine wrong. After all, America achieved rapid, indeed unprecedented, income growth in the 1950s and 1960s, despite top tax rates beyond the wildest dreams of modern progressives. For that matter, there are countries like Denmark that combine high taxes and generous social programs with very good employment performance.But for those who don\u2019t know much about either history or the world outside America, the Obama economy offers a powerful lesson in the here and now. From a conservative point of view, Mr. Obama did everything wrong, afflicting the comfortable (slightly) and comforting the afflicted (a lot), and nothing bad happened. We can, it turns out, make our society better after all.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Transcript of the Preliminary G.O.P. Presidential Debate", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byBusiness woman, former CEO of Hewlett Packard, Carly Fiorina.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)(APPLAUSE (CHEERING)(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)(BELL RINGING)(LAUGHTER)I talked about that eight years ago, and I\u2019m talking about it now. I talked about the importance of preserving life, of not just saying we\u2019re going to defund Planned Parenthood, but let\u2019s do something bolder. Let\u2019s get rid of abortion once and for all by applying the Fifth, and Fourteenth amendment to every person from conception because that means that we recognize that no person can be deprived of life or liberty unless they have due process. And, that\u2019s not happening in our country.And, I believe, and continue to practice that we need the Fair Tax to revive our economy. To make it so that people are able to be rewarded for their work rather than punished for it.(APPLAUSE)Senator Santorum, four short years ago you won Iowa. You beat Mitt Romney, pretty much shocked the country. But, just the other day you talked about what is in the greater good for your campaign. Is Monday night your last stand?SANTORUM: You know, listening to what your network was talking about prior to this race, this debate, reminded me of the coverage that many on this floor are getting. This race, this debate, was called the, \u201cUndercard Debate\u201d. The undercard debate.It wasn\u2019t advertised significantly. In fact, the entire hour lead up to this there was no conversation about any of the four people on this debate stage, and that is the chronic situation.In fact, they listed \u2014 they put a poll up from Wall Street Journal/NBC News, they listed the candidates, and they failed to mention I wasn\u2019t listed. I got zero, why? Because they \u2014 NBC, Wall Street Journal poll never includes my name on the list.This is what the media has been doing over the past year, and trying to segregate, and take Iowans out of the process. What Iowans deserve...(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)(APPLAUSE)(BELL RINGS)SANTORUM: You know, this, again, more of the politics of trying to get people to throw stuff at each other. I\u2019m not going to throw mud at anybody on this stage tonight. I\u2019m not going to throw mud at anybody on the stage later.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: I\u2019m not going to attack Donald Trump. What I\u2019m \u2014 Mike Huckabee and I were asked to come to an event where money was going to be raise to do help our veterans. You know, I thought about it.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: And I thought about. I said well, wait a minute, now, if there were no political considerations and I had some time because I\u2019m not doing anything at 9:00 tonight.(LAUGHTER)And so if I had some time, would I go...(BELL RINGS)SANTORUM: ... if I could help raise money for veterans? And the answer was yes, I would. And so I\u2019m going.(APPLAUSE)GILMORE: Well, Bill, can I first...HEMMER: Thank you, senator. One moment. We\u2019ll get to you in a moment, Governor. We have a few coming up.MACCALLUM: So it will come as no surprise that there is an idea out there that there is a civil war brewing within the GOP over the meaning of conservative and the question of who is electable.There are some in the GOP who are so outraged by Trump and Cruz that they say they would actually rather have Hillary Clinton in the White House.(BOOING)The people in Iowa showed up and they are still showing up. Hundreds and hundreds of them at every event. I have done over 150 events in the state of Iowa and I have 15 more coming up.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)What they ask me about is Carly, tell us why zero based budgeting is so important. Tell us why you are a leader who is going to produce results. Tell us how you are going to defeat ISIS. Tell us how we are going to replace Obamacare.In other words, I\u2019m going to put my faith every single time not in the pundits, not in the polls. Most definitely not in the national media. I\u2019m going to put my faith in the common sense and the good judgment of the voters of Iowa.And the last time I looked, you hadn\u2019t started voting yet. So, on Monday night, I hope you will stand with me, fight with me, caucus for me. Because...(BELL RINGS)(APPLAUSE)But never mind that, I want to return to something. I\u2019m the only veteran, Bill and Martha in this race. And I\u2019m not going to any Donald Trump event over across town on some sort of faux veteran sort of issue.I\u2019m going to speak to you tonight about the issue that really confronts veterans. I\u2019m going to talk to you about the concerns that they have got with the veterans administration.The lousy appeals process that they have got. The fact that sometimes they get good service at the V.A. and sometimes they don\u2019t and the fact that post traumatic stress syndrome is not properly recognized. That psychology positions are unavailable in the Veterans Administration.(APPLAUSE)One candidate in this race has criticized so-called \u201cNew York values\u201d. So tell me, in your opinion, are New York values different than Iowa values?(LAUGHTER)This much I will tell you. I wish that some of those New Yorkers had funded as much of my campaign as they did the corporately funded candidates, but they didn\u2019t.And to be honest with you, when I say I\u2019m \u2014 wish they had, I\u2019m glad they didn\u2019t. I\u2019m not a New York-funded campaign. I\u2019m not bankrolled by the corporatists, I\u2019m not bankrolled by Goldman Sachs and Citibank and AIG and all the big brokers \u2014 brokerage houses and the billionaires.I\u2019m sponsored by people like Thomas, a part-time Uber driver in Pennsylvania who sent me $25 this week. He\u2019s between jobs. He\u2019s driving an Uber car. But he believed in what I\u2019m talking about enough that, even on a limited, part-time income, he sent me $25 to help in my campaign.I\u2019ll stand with the Thomases of the world any day. I\u2019ll leave all the discussion of the big financiers to other candidates. But there\u2019s only a few of us in the entire Republican process who are not corporately funded by the same group.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.And let me just finish by saying, you want to know why things never change depending on whether Democrats or Republicans are in power, and why Republicans in Iowa and the rest of the country are so frustrated?The reason is, is because if you follow the money, the same folks who finance the Democrats finance the Republicans, and no matter what the speeches and the ads, they get the same results.If you want a different result, I\u2019m available.(APPLAUSE)Senator Santorum, according to Google, the Paris terror attacks were the largest story that was searched in 2015, with nearly 1 billion searches of that story worldwide.There have been at 18 terror attacks so far this year \u2014 in just January alone, in 2016, and it will likely, as we all know, get worse. But what can an American president do to stop these terrifying killings?We have to have an honest discussion with the American people about the nature of the threat that we confront. This president says that ISIS has nothing to do with Islam, and as a result has put together a strategy that doesn\u2019t take care of what the reality is, which is ISIS has established a caliphate.A caliphate is like a kingdom ruled by \u2014 a caliphate is ruled by a caliph, a kingdom is ruled by a king. Only the difference is a caliphate is also a religious title, and it is both a religious call to help this state, as well a \u2014 to \u2014 to make the state stronger.The reality is that ISIS has established a caliphate, and is using that to attract people around the globe to follow them as the leaders of the Sunni world.And you say, \u201cwell, how do we stop them from following them?\u201d Well, to be a legitimate caliphate, you have to control land and operate a state under sharia law.If you don\u2019t do that, you cannot call for that support. And so the answer is we must take their land and make them...(BELL RINGS)... illegitimate in the eyes of the Muslim world. So I would put troops on the ground and take the land back from Iraq and return to its rightful ownership in Iraq. That would delegitimize them.(APPLAUSE)Actually \u2014 actually, it is ISIS, followed closely by Iran. And those two things are linked, so that when our president cozies up to Iran, all of our allies in the Middle East, who are ready to help us defeat ISIS, wonder whose side we\u2019re on. And the truth is, under this president, we are on Iran\u2019s side, not our allies\u2019, who would help us defeat ISIS.You know, one of the things we have to start with is understanding that we must stand up to adversaries. So Hillary Clinton famously asked, what difference does it make how four Americans died in Benghazi? This is the difference it makes, Mrs. Clinton.That, Mrs. Clinton, is what difference it makes.(APPLAUSE)But we have seen Putin\u2019s quote-unquote \u201chelp\u201d in Crimea and in Ukraine. And this week the U.K. implicated him in the poisoning death of one of his rivals. So are you foolish to think that we can ever work with Vladimir Putin?But let\u2019s be very clear about how we take out ISIS. And I think Rick Santorum is exactly right. You take away their land.But one of the things we have to do is a comprehensive strategy to get ISIS. First of all, take away their access to social media platforms. They are using the same social media platforms to recruit, and to train, and to direct people as I use to see pictures of my grandkids. That\u2019s ridiculous.The second thing, go after them financially. Wage war with them. Make it so nobody can do commerce with ISIS. Not a nickel of transfer. Any company, any country, that even gets close to dealing with them, absolutely put sanctions on them. Make them pay.And finally, you have got to go after them militarily. And that means we send the land, the sea, the air forces, the A-10 Warthogs dropping ordnances on every truck and every tank, and we obliterate them. But we have to understand that they are a force that\u2019s getting bigger. And with any kind of cancer, you don\u2019t contain it, you eradicate it. And that\u2019s how we have to fight ISIS, comprehensively. That\u2019s what I would suggest we do.(APPLAUSE)And I\u2019m the candidate who is best qualified to deal with this issue. A degree in foreign policy in Russian area studies. I\u2019m the only United States Army veteran having gone to Europe during the Cold War as United States Army Intelligence agent, the governor during the 9/11 attack, the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security for the United States for five years.And this is what I will do. If I become the president, I\u2019m going to rebuild the United States military. We\u2019re going to take the sequester off the defense budget. Give the Navy the ships it needs. Refit the United States Army. Refit the United States Marine Corps.And on this international guerrilla war, we need to recognize our Special Forces, our intelligence community, and the people that we need in order to really protect us.And finally, this war of ideas, we must win this. We must say to the world that radical Islamism is the threat. It isn\u2019t just confined to ISIS. It is worldwide. And if we win the war of ideas, then we will win the international guerrilla war.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)Is this Presidency, and presidency, simply too small a David to slay the Goliath of government?The other day I was in Newton, Iowa. It used to be a vibrant place where Maytag washers and dryers were built. Went out of business in 2007, all those shops went to Mexico. All those people lost their jobs. There was a guy in my forum that day, he lost his job. He still has never found an employment that got anywhere near the job that he had.Let me ask you, how many people do you think living around the Beltway know a guy like that? Care about a guy like that? Not many. And, that\u2019s because they\u2019re six of the ten richest counties in America that surround Washington D.C. People who live in the bubbles of the high finance world of New York, the government world of Washington, the entertainment world of Hollywood, don\u2019t have a clue about how hard people out here in Iowa are working every single day.And, I believe one of the values of campaigning in Iowa, you can\u2019t win unless you go out and talk to farmers and housewives \u2014 and welders, and unemployed truck drivers, and I hate...(BELL RINGING)(APPLAUSE)And the only way to control the money is to ask the federal government to budget the way you do, to examine every dollar, to cut any dollar to spend \u2014 to move any dollar.The fancy word for that is zero-base budgeting. I call it common sense. That three-page tax code I talk about all the time here in Iowa? It\u2019s been around for 20 years. But politicians don\u2019t want to talk about it, and you bet the lobbyists don\u2019t want to talk about it.In fact, nobody wants to vote on a three-page tax code or zero- base budgeting, although they\u2019ve both been around for a long time. You know why? Because if you get those two things done, you are goring everybody\u2019s ox.You are taking the political establishment apart. You are actually challenging the status quo, which is what we need in the Oval Office. So you know who I\u2019m going to count on? The citizens of this great nation, because you have extraordinary power.But when you do not use it...(BELL RINGS)... you are losing it. So take out your smartphones, folks. The people of Iowa know what I\u2019m talking about. You take out your smartphones. if you agree with me that three-page tax code needs to be passed, lobbyists aren\u2019t going to be in my office.If you agree we gotta finally pass zero-base budgeting, take out your smartphones. Press one for yes, ladies and gentlemen. Press two for no. Citizens, we must take our country back.(APPLAUSE)Your critics would argue that\u2019s exactly what you did at Hewlett Packard when 30,000 people lost their jobs. If it did not work at H.P., why would it work at the federal government?Secondly, at Hewlett Packard, as you know \u2014 the people of Iowa know this \u2014 we went through a tough time. The worst technology recession in 25 years \u2014 a great company called Gateway used to do be right here in Iowa. But they didn\u2019t make the tough calls necessary to save all those jobs, and so they lost every one of those jobs.Yes, I\u2019ve had to make some tough calls. We saved 80,000 jobs. We went on to grow to 160,000 jobs. And, frankly, I think the American people know we need a president who\u2019s going to make some tough calls.So let me tell you where I\u2019m going to start. The American people got a bill passed through Congress that said we could fire the top 400 senior executives at the V.A. for dereliction of duty.When we know that 307,000 veterans have died waiting for health care and the V.A. handed out $142 million worth of bonuses for superb performance, I\u2019m going to start by firing 400...(BELL RINGS)... senior executives at the V.A.(APPLAUSE)She leans on her parents for help. She says she can\u2019t buy presents for her children. We are all sympathetic to this woman\u2019s plight. On the other hand, the G.O.P. is supposed to be the party of smaller government. So what would you look her in the eye and say?History suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.This is an opportunity for America. It\u2019s an opportunity for us to get those jobs back. And by the way, do you want to solve global climate change? Take 2 million jobs from China in manufacturing and moving them back here to the United States, where we produce one-fifth the CO2 when we make things.(APPLAUSE)We can help \u2014 we can do every \u2014 we can do it all. We can take care of the environment. We can create more jobs here. Seventy-four percent of Americans don\u2019t have a college degree.And unfortunately most folks who, in the Republican Party, don\u2019t talk about what we\u2019re going to do to create jobs for people who feel like neither political party cares about them.(BELL RINGS)When you elect me, we\u2019ll create opportunities for working men and women in this country \u2014 all over this country.(LAUGHTER)But that person you asked Rick about a moment ago, that lady that\u2019s making 10,000 bucks a year, do you know what our poverty programs do to people? They keep them in poverty.They keep them in poverty because we have these arbitrary thresholds...(APPLAUSE)My mother grew up in a house, oldest of seven kids. She had lived in a house that didn\u2019t have floors. Just dirt. No electricity. No running water. I resent it when people say, oh, people are poor because they want to be. No, they are not.Nobody wants to be poor. And that\u2019s a stupid, foolish thing, mean thing to say. People are poor because they don\u2019t know how to get out of the hole. And government shouldn\u2019t push them back in the hole which is what our policies do when they punish people who want to go to work and don\u2019t let them out. (APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)You and others say that you would rip up that deal. But, really, by the time the next president is in office, won\u2019t that horse be well out of the barn?And that\u2019s very dangerous because it means people in the Middle East have to begin to react to that right now. The United States, I think, has to continue to exercise its influence in the Middle East, stay active, and not do this pull-back type of program that we are seeing all over the place with President Obama, which is creating this kind of danger.The world is a more dangerous place now than when I was an intelligence agent. We have not only this international guerrilla war but also these challenges from these other countries as well.But, Martha, I want to say one more thing to you and Bill. I disagree with Carly Fiorina when she says that it\u2019s just a political class in Washington. The truth is that the country has changed. And there are powerful forces at this point that are really controlling our lives. And that\u2019s why people are so angry.One of those is government, which is regulating everything through the Environmental Protection Agency, through other places. But the biggest one is the organized establishment media.And I just noticed just now you gave Carly Fiorina two one-minute answers in a row. This media across the country is manipulating and shaping and framing this campaign and has been for at least a year now in order to get the kind of choices that people are going to have an opportunity to see.This is wrong. It has to change. And when I\u2019m president, it\u2019s going to change.(APPLAUSE)(LAUGHTER)When it comes to the tragic mass killings that we have seen in this country, Donald Trump says that what we need to do is build quote \u201cmore institutions for people who are sickos.\u201dCharles Krauthammer also says that in some cases involuntary commitment would help. And you have agreed with that. Given that institutions would be extraordinarily expensive to begin building, how much is too much to ask on this from the American taxpayer?But I do believe this is one of the really principle issues in this campaign. The president and Hillary Clinton are working very hard to change the culture of this country in order to put us in a position where we can\u2019t exercise Second Amendment rights.That\u2019s wrong. I am a board member of the National Rifle Association.If gun control...(BELL RINGING)(APPLAUSE)The Conservative Club for Growth has had an issue with your policy on taxes for years. In fact, it called you, \u201cTax Hike Mike\u201d. And, the record shows state spending in Arkansas increased 54% when you were in charge, 94% if you include federal dollars during that same period. When it comes to helping people at the margins, $30,000, $32,000 dollars a year, what\u2019s better? A tax and spend approach, or shrinking government?I also was able to see per capita income growth in my state go up by 50%. I think that\u2019s a pretty darn good record. Look at the overall record and it was fine.But, it\u2019s not about stats from when I was governor. Look, one of the reasons I support the Fairtax is because it\u2019s the one thing, Bill, that would truly empower people at the bottom of the economy by no longer punishing them for their work.If a guy works an hourly job, and he works eight hours, gets paid for it, terrific. But, if he works 16 hours, he doesn\u2019t get a double paycheck because he\u2019s going to be bumped up into a new tax bracket, and the government will get more of his second shift than he will. So, we\u2019ve actually punished him for being industrious, hardworking, and that is a foolish economic policy...(BELL RINGING)(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: Well, in fact, the plan that I put forward is scored by the Tax Foundation as bringing three and a half million jobs into this country, and we have provisions in the flat tax for the corporate side that actually has a phase in of manufacturing. Manufacturers initially don\u2019t pay any income tax. Ten percent the next year, and 20.We\u2019re going to also have a repatriation provision which says that if you have money overseas, and you\u2019re Apple, and you got a couple hundred billion dollars there, bring it back. The most you\u2019ll be taxed 10%, invest it here in America. Create jobs here in America with all that money that\u2019s sitting overseas.We also \u2014 it\u2019s not just taxes. It\u2019s regulation. I\u2019ve pledged to cut every single Obamacare \u2014 I mean, excuse me, Obama regulation, including Obamacare, and remove those regulations that cost more than a hundred million dollars in the economy. That will liberate \u2014 and that includes waters of the U.S., and the ozone regulations, they \u2014 the mercury regulations. All of these just crush our manufactures and don\u2019t create an opportunity for us to survive.And, remember, China produces five times as much CO2 and other pollutants per dollar of GDP as we do.(BELL RINGING)SANTORUM: You want to help the environment? Bring jobs back to America.(APPLAUSE)HEMMER: Senator, thank you.MACCALLUM: Still more to come from the Republican Presidential debate tonight.We\u2019ll see you, just a moment \u2014 back.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK )MACCALLUM: We are back live at the Iowa events center and this question goes to Carly Fiorina. In the last debate you said as part of your introduction, quote, \u201c And unlike the other woman candidate in this case I actually love spending time with my husband.\u201d(LAUGHTER)FIORINA: He is right there. He is right there.MACCALLUM: But back in September in an interview you said that you would stick only to the record, your record versus Hillary Clinton\u2019s record. And never resort to personal attacks. So what changed?FIORINA: It wasn\u2019t a personal attack. I was pointing out the fact that Hillary Clinton will do anything to gain and hang on to power, anything. Listen, if my husband did what Bill Clinton did, I would have left him long ago.(APPLAUSE)FIORINA: So, here\u2019s the deal. Hillary Clinton has been climbing the ladder to try and get power and here now she is trying for the White House. She is probably more qualified for the big house, honestly.(LAUGHTER)She has escaped prosecution more times than El Chapo, perhaps Sean Penn should interview her.(LAUGHTER)The woman should be prosecuted.(APPLAUSE) FIORINA: And while Mrs. Clinton has flown hundreds of thousands of world around the global, I have too. And I know flying is an activity not an accomplishment. While I know that she has held many positions and many titles she has not accomplished much of anything in her life. She has gotten every single foreign policy challenge wrong.(BELL RINGS)She continues to lie to the American people. It\u2019s called the Clinton way. Both Bill and Hillary practice it, the Clinton way. Say whatever you have to say, do whatever you have to say. Lie as long as you can get away with it. Hillary Clinton cannot be the president of these United States.(APPLAUSE)MACCALLUM: All right. Carly, I want to stay with you on this next question as well.You waded into the Planned Parenthood early on. You took some heat for it. Now the people who shot that undercover video are the ones who got indicted and Planned Parenthood is untouched. Hillary Clinton has been crowing about this. Any regrets about this?FIORINA: Well, you know, Hillary Clinton hasn\u2019t been indicted either. So that tells us a lot about our justice system in this country. But, look, the facts of Planned Parenthood have not changed, folks, and I will not be rendered silent on this issue or any other issue.And it doesn\u2019t matter what stage I\u2019m on. Here are the facts. Planned Parenthood engages in partial birth abortion, in late-term abortion. They alter those abortion techniques to harvest and sell body parts. They have admitted that they are not going to accept compensation for this anymore.The reality is, most Americans find this practice horrific. Most Americans find horrific that Hillary Clinton\u2019s position on this is it\u2019s not a life until it\u2019s born. Most Americans find horrific Hillary Clinton\u2019s position or the Democrat party\u2019s position, that a young woman does not need her mother\u2019s permission to get an abortion.But if you are 13 years old, you can get an abortion, but you can\u2019t go to a tanning salon without your mother\u2019s permission. A president Fiorina \u2014 in a president Fiorina budget, there will not be one dime for Planned Parenthood, although there would be a lot of money for women\u2019s health and we will finally pass the pain capable unborn child protection act.I will always stand for life and religious liberty...(BELL RINGS)... because this is about the character of our nation.(APPLAUSE) MACCALLUM: Thank you Carly Fiorina. Let me just ask a quick question here to Senator Santorum.Carly Fiorina was the only one of the GOP candidates to attend the March for Life in Washington last week. Where were you.SANTORUM: Well, I\u2019ve been to the March for Life for about 25 years and I thought \u2014 I think that\u2019s a pretty good record.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: Spoken at it a few times and I have shepherded every single piece of pro-life piece of legislation that\u2019s passed over the last 20 years. I\u2019ve either authored it or shepherded it through the United States Congress and I\u2019m pretty proud of that record too.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: But we have an election going on and there was some snow coming. So I decided that maybe it would be better for me to get out and do some campaigning and not be stuck as my wife and kids were for a week, piling out of two and a half feet of snow.So, here\u2019s what I would say. If you want someone that is going to talk a good game, there are a lot of folks on this stage that have talked a good game on the issue of life.Not only have I talked a good game on life and I\u2019ve done some things. But I\u2019ve also lived it. You know, one of the things Saint Francis said was, you know, if you preach the gospel, then if you have to, speak.The bottom line is, that twice in my life, we were counseled to have an abortion, one with our son Gabriel and one with our little girl Bella. And neither time did Karen and I for a moment think about it because we know that life begins at conception.We know the dignity of every human life and we know the potential of every child, no matter how long that life lives. And that is a message that can come across to all Americans and without having to say a word and defend the institution of life and the dignity of life in this country.(APPLAUSE)FIORINA: Martha, can I just say we\u2019ve been talking tonight about a lot of issues and we\u2019ve also been talking about the fact that the game is rigged and frankly, the media has a lot to do with that.It is outrageous frankly, that Fox News, and you, would question the pro-life credentials of Rick Santorum.(APPLAUSE)FIORINA: That is outrageous.(APPLAUSE)HEMMER: Thank you Ms. Fiorina.Governor Gilmore. Who are the moderate Muslims do you seek advice and counsel from on how to deal with the threat from radical Islamic terrorism?GILMORE: You know Bill, that raises, I think, the question of the future of the Republican party. The question is \u2014 first of all, I stand second to no one in standing up to radical Islamism. I understand that ISIS is a piece of that but it is a world-wide phenomena that has manifested itself in Paris, in 9/11, in San Bernardino, in Boston.I recognize all that. But I also recognize this. This is a strain of Islamism that cannot be supported and cannot be stood for. And what we need is for people in the Muslim community in the United States to stand up and be counted and to say that this is not right.And yes, I have met with some people. And I\u2019m not going to identify who they are. I met with them last week. And they told me some terrible stories about how they have been harassed and their children have seen them be harassed.And I said to them. You have got to stand up and condemn this radical Islamism because it\u2019s the war of ideas that we are going to have to win to go along with our military conflicts that are coming forward.But the point is Bill...(BELL RINGS)... we cannot have a Republican party that scapegoats anyone, Hispanics, Muslims, any women, African Americans, anyone. If that becomes the future of the Republican party, I don\u2019t want to be a part of that.HEMMER: Thank you governor.(APPLAUSE)HEMMER: Governor Huckabee. Here in Iowa 43 percent of Democratic caucus goers describe themselves as socialist. That\u2019s a higher number than those who say they are capitalist. I guess you could say, they\u2019re feeling the burn.(LAUGHTER)HEMMER: This is a country rooted in capitalism, the United States of America. How did we get here?HUCKABEE: I honestly don\u2019t understand how anybody with IQ above plant life would honestly think...(LAUGHTER)HUCKABEE: ... that we would be better off if we let the government have all of the private property and that the government would dole out what they thought we should have.I\u2019m not \u201cfeeling the Bern,\u201d Bill. I\u2019m not feeling it.(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: And when Bernie Sanders promises these kids free college, I\u2019m telling them, because I get asked, what about free college? I said, look, if we give you free college when you are 20, pal, you are going to be paying for it when you are 30, when you are 40, and when you are 50.(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: There is no such thing as the government giving you anything. They will definitely make a mess of it.And I just think there are a lot of people who have never understood the basic understanding of economics, that you do not make people rich by tearing down those who are you providing jobs, and you don\u2019t help poor people by taking away.You give them jobs. Let them work. Let them earn. And then you let them keep the money that they earned. That\u2019s how we build a great economy.(APPLAUSE)HEMMER: Thank you, Governor.Senator Santorum, the president says politics in America have become meaner over the past several years with him in the White House. Two weeks ago at the State of the Union he said the following. \u201cA president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide.\u201dHEMMER: Lincoln and Roosevelt, that\u2019s pretty good company. If he is right, do Republicans share some of the blame?SANTORUM: The president of the United States has been the most divisive president in \u2014 certainly in my lifetime. This is a man who constantly...(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: He is not trustworthy. You can\u2019t sit down and negotiate with him. He won\u2019t keep a deal. We have heard that over and over again. And here is what he does that really, really creates the friction in Washington.He personally attacks people. He ascribes motives to them that aren\u2019t true and then he tears them down. How are you going to work with someone if you don\u2019t treat them decently, honestly, and respectfully?I was a tough fighter when I was in Washington. I had very sharp elbows. I fought. I went there and joined a game named Jim Nussle here from Iowa with the \u201cgang of seven.\u201d And we, in four years\u2019 time, took a Congress that had been controlled by Democrats for 40 years, and brought in the first Republican majority because we fought and we fought tough.But you know what? I was able to then work with those same people that we fought with and able to pass welfare reform. Unborn Victims of Violence Act. Pro-life bills. Health savings accounts.A whole laundry list of things not because I was mean, but because I was able to be respectful in the disagreements. And that\u2019s what we need in Washington, someone who can be respectful and still unite this country.(APPLAUSE)HEMMER: Thank you, Senator.MACCALLUM: All right. Coming up, we will have the closing statements from our candidates tonight as we continue live from the Iowa Events Center in Des Moines. We\u2019ll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HEMMER: In the closing few moments, the candidates have an opportunity to make a closing statement, 30 seconds for each. And, we want to start tonight with the former Virginia Governor, Jim Gilmore.GILMORE: Well, thank you very much, Bill. And, thank you, and Fox and Google for including me in this debate tonight. I think it\u2019s been a wonderful opportunity.I\u2019m the son of a meat cutter. My father worked for Safeway stores for 45 years. My mother was a secretary, she ended her career as the Secretary for the Methodist Bishop. I didn\u2019t have a father that could give me a million dollar loan to start my business. But, my father did talk character, and he provided for his family, and he was a wonderful example.And, I\u2019m not about to go across town tonight to carry the coat for some billionaire. Instead, I intend to run for President of the United States, speak to the issue of this international war, and challenge that we\u2019re in. This issue of veterans rights, and the issue of Second Amendment rights, and I ask for your support...HEMMER: ... Thank you, Governor.(APPLAUSE)MACCALLUM: Alright, let\u2019s go now to Senator Rick Santorum.SANTORUM: I just want to thank the people of Iowa. Over the last five years I\u2019ve done 700 speeches and town hall meetings all throughout the state of Iowa, and it has been an incredible right. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)I want to thank all the wonderful folks like Pastor Carey (ph) Gordon (ph) who gave me a smooth stone and said you go slay Goliaths. Someone like Jim and Janet Cook who over this past Christmas gave up Christmas presents for their kids, and they have more than I do, just they can help me and my campaign.That\u2019s the kind of people...(BELL RINGING) SANTORUM: ... in Iowa. And, here\u2019s what I\u2019m asking you to do. You\u2019re good people. You know good leaders. Lead. Pick the right person, not what the polls say. Not who the money give people to. Pick the leader you know is best for this country. Thank you.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)HEMMER: Governor Huckabee.HUCKABEE: Well, this week there was a little dust up about a video we put together with the music of Adele, so I thought it\u2019d be appropriate for me to begin tonight by saying, \u201cHello, Iowa. It\u2019s me.\u201dMACCALLUM: (LAUGHING)HUCKABEE: And, you know me. You gave me the largest number of votes in the history of the Iowa caucus eight years ago, and I think you did it because you trusted me, you believed that I had your best interest at heart.When I was governor I had a little plaque in my office in the Governor\u2019s office, and it simply said this. Come, let us reason together.(BELL RINGING)HUCKABEE: I believe the next President needs to put that plaque in the oval office, and needs to lead this country by saying, \u201cCome, let us reason together.\u201dGod bless you, and thank you for your support.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)HEMMER: Thank you, Governor.MACCALLUM: Carly Fiorina.FIORINA: In over 150 events I have come to know and love the people of Iowa. And the people of Iowa know what the rest of Americans have figured out, this ain\u2019t working anymore. The government no longer works for those who pay for it. The professional political class says and does whatever they need to do to win, and then does whatever they please.We need to return to a citizen government. That is why I am running for President. The media, the establishment, they all want to tell you this elections over, they know who\u2019s going to win it, except that you haven\u2019t...(BELL RINGING)FIORINA: ... cast a single vote yet. So, the people of Iowa, stand with me, fight with me. Caucus for me. It is time to take our country back.MACCALLUM: Thank you, Carly.(APPLAUSE)HEMMER: That concludes our debate tonight, but the night has just begun.MACCALLUM: In one hour, seven more candidates take the stage for a debate hosted by Bret Baier, Megyn Kelly, and Chris Wallace. But, up next, the O\u2019Reilly Factor.Good night, everybody.Advertisement"}

Mr. Trump closes with a version of his tag line: \u201cWe are going to make it greater than ever before.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s signature success has been the ability to tap into anger in the Republican base, and the first ad of his campaign stoked both fear and anger, highlighting the most controversial aspect of his platform: halting Muslim immigration. The new advertisement strikes a more aspirational tone, one centered in the candidate\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d slogan.The ad features the many broad platitudes and the lack of policy specifics common in Mr. Trump\u2019s speeches.Mr. Trump is continuing to spend nearly $2 million a week on advertising in New Hampshire and Iowa, and this ad will be a part of those reservations.The rather conventional ad is noteworthy given the unconventional nature of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. But as he finds himself in a very tight race in Iowa with Senator Ted Cruz, the upbeat message could help him with evangelical voters uneasy with his combative style. And the ad, featuring Mr. Trump on camera for 30 seconds straight, could be addressing criticism of his previous advertisement: that he did not show enough of his biggest asset \u2013 himself \u2013 by using a narrator.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iran Reports Removing Core From Reactor", "Date": "2016-01-11", "News": "Supported byDisabling the reactor is one of the most critical steps required by the nuclear agreement that Iran reached with world powers in July before international sanctions can be lifted. Iran filled in the reactor core, the semiofficial Fars News Agency reported, and the reactor will be revamped to yield only small amounts of plutonium insufficient for bomb making.The reported progress came as Mr. Obama pledged to veto legislation aimed at undermining the nuclear agreement. The legislation, set to advance in the House on Tuesday, would bar the president from lifting sanctions against Iranian banks or other institutions financially linked to Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps or other Iranian organizations tied to terrorism.In a written veto threat, the White House said the bill would go beyond the terms of the agreement and thus unravel it \u201cbased on activity that may have taken place and ended\u201d long ago. Sabotaging the agreement would \u201cdeal a devastating blow to America\u2019s credibility as a leader of international diplomacy,\u201d the message said.The White House repeated its arguments that the agreement was meant \u201cto address one issue only,\u201d meaning Iran\u2019s pursuit of a nuclear weapon, and that adding terrorism as a condition after the fact would amount to bad faith. Separate sanctions remain in place to punish Iranian terrorist activities, the White House noted.Iran is speeding toward what negotiators are calling implementation day, the moment when it will have met its obligations sufficient to earn relief from the sanctions that have constrained its economy. The Obama administration hopes that Iran completes its nuclear commitments to get the sanctions relief in time to help President Hassan Rouhani in coming elections.The disablement of the Arak reactor was among the most intractable issues resolved with the agreement, which will relieve sanctions against Iran in exchange for its verifiable guarantees of peaceful nuclear work.The Iranians have also severely reduced the number of centrifuges used to enrich uranium.Peter Baker reported from Washington, and Rick Gladstone from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pope Francis and Hassan Rouhani of Iran Discuss Mideast Unrest", "Date": "2016-01-26", "News": "Supported byMr. Rouhani\u2019s visit is the first to Europe since taking office. He planned to sign several contracts that he hopes will restart his country\u2019s ailing economy. In Italy, he signed a gas deal, and in France he is expected to commit to buying 127 Airbus planes and sign a deal with the French carmaker Peugeot. The visit was widely reported in the pro-government press in Tehran.The Vatican statement spoke of \u201cthe important role that Iran is called upon to fulfill\u201d in promoting peaceful solutions to Middle East conflicts and countering the spread of terrorism and arms trafficking.The wide availability of illegal weapons in the Middle East, an element of instability, \u201chas always been an important issue for the Vatican,\u201d said Prof. Raffaele Marchetti, who teaches international relations at Luiss Guido Carli University in Rome, so it was not surprising that the pope would raise the issue with Mr. Rouhani. \u201cBut he\u2019d probably say the same to Sunni leaders,\u201d he said.Shiite Iran is seen as a potentially stabilizing element in the region because \u201cChristian minorities in the Middle East are generally in a better situation with Shiite groups than with some Sunni groups,\u201d Professor Marchetti said. He pointed out that Christian minorities supported the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad, which allowed them to live in peace.This also explains why the Vatican has never backed efforts to force Mr. Assad to resign, Professor Marchetti said. \u201cChristians are frightened by the radical Sunni scenario that could emerge afterwards,\u201d he said.Since he became pope nearly three years ago, Francis has repeatedly spoken out against extremism and violence done in the name of religion. He has also called for diplomacy and dialogue in the Middle East and highlighted the impact the conflicts have had, most visibly on the millions of refugees who have been fleeing to Europe to escape the violence.Meeting with the international diplomatic corps accredited to the Holy See earlier this month, Francis cited the nuclear deal as one of several important agreements brokered in 2015 that gave \u201csolid hope for the future.\u201d The pope said he hoped that the Iranian deal would \u201ccontribute to creating a climate of d\u00e9tente in the region.\u201dThe Iranian delegation, which included Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, also met with the Vatican\u2019s secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, and Archbishop Paul Richard Gallagher, secretary for relations with states. The last time an Iranian president met with a pope was in March 1999, when Pope John Paul II met with President Mohammad Khatami. Mr. Khatami also led the Iranian delegation at John Paul II\u2019s funeral in 2005. Pope Paul VI, who traveled to Tehran in 1970, is the only pope to have visited Iran.President Rouhani also met with Italian political and business leaders in Rome. After a visit to the Capitoline Museums with Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, Mr. Rouhani said that Iran had \u201calways been on the front line in combating terrorism,\u201d and that had it not been for Iran\u2019s role, \u201cthe situation would be very difficult.\u201dCareful not to upset the Iranian president\u2019s sensitivities, according to a spokesman for Rome City Hall, Italian officials placed several classical Roman-era nude statues inside tall white wooden cartons when Mr. Rouhani visited the museums.On Twitter, Mr. Rouhani highlighted the two countries\u2019 efforts to improve business relations, noting that Mr. Renzi \u201cwill travel to Iran in the coming months to boost economic ties.\u201d Another Rouhani Twitter post declared a \u201cnew chapter\u201d in economic, scientific and cultural exchange between the countries and included a picture of Mr. Rouhani and Mr. Renzi observing as their representatives signed economic agreements.Mr. Rouhani told the business leaders on Tuesday that the Quran \u201cinvites Muslims to protect churches and synagogues before anything else. This means tolerance.\u201dThe meeting at the Vatican ended with an exchange of gifts. The Iranian president gave the pope a handmade carpet and an illustrated book of miniatures. Pope Francis reciprocated with a medallion of St. Martin and a copy of \u201cLaudato Si\u2019,\u201d his encyclical on the environment.Francis thanked Mr. Rouhani for the visit and told him, \u201cI hope for peace.\u201dPresident Rouhani asked the pope to pray for him.Thomas Erdbrink contributed reporting from Tehran.Advertisement"}

Countries and companies, fueled by cheap debt, aggressively broadened their operations, betting that China\u2019s appetite would grow unabated.Now everything has changed.China\u2019s economy is slumping. American companies, struggling to pay their debts as interest rates rise, must keep producing. All the excess is crushing prices, hurting commodity-dependent economies across emerging markets like Brazil and Venezuela and developed countries like Australia and Canada.The geopolitical and financial consequences of this shift have shaken investor confidence. Concerns over global growth intensified in recent days, when weakness in China prompted a stock sell-off around the world.The commodities hangover, the dark side of a decade-long boom, could last for a while.The flood of raw materials is pressuring prices, prompting a painful shakeout. Oil companies have laid off an estimated 250,000 workers worldwide. Alpha Natural Resources and other American coal mining companies have filed for bankruptcy protection.Michael Levi, an energy expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, likened the reversal to a rainfall that first relieved a drought but then created a flood. \u201cProducers ended up being their own worst enemies,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one ever worried they would produce too much, but that is exactly what has happened and gotten them into this mess.\u201dBut economists worry that the commodity mess reflects a weakening global economy, lowering the value of trade worldwide and perhaps even pushing some countries into the same kind of deflationary spiral that has hampered the Japanese economy for decades. Global turmoil last summer, stemming from China, prompted the United States to delay raising interest rates until the end of last year.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.\u201cLower oil prices have not proven to be as stimulative as economic theory once had it,\u201d said Daniel Yergin, the energy historian and vice chairman of the IHS consultancy. \u201cThe question is what are weak commodity prices telling us: Is it overinvestment in the past, or signaling a weaker global economy forward? My own feeling is the answer is both.\u201dCommodities have always been subject to booms and busts, rising and falling with the global economy. But China and the cheap debt have changed the equation in some ways.China\u2019s rapid growth led to an increase in crude oil consumption to 7.5 million barrels a day in 2007, from 5.5 million barrels a day in 2003. It is now the world\u2019s biggest importer of crude, having surpassed the United States. Other commodities have followed a similar pattern.The increased demand fueled a surge in prices; copper tripled and zinc doubled over the five-year period ending in 2007. Americans and Europeans found themselves in what amounted to a bidding war for products as diversified as gasoline and coffee.Then the financial crisis hit in 2008. While the global economy faltered, China continued to grow, buying ever more commodities from developing countries. Those economies, in turn, flourished from the infusion of money.Peru, with its big bounty of copper and other metals, used its newfound riches to expand its middle class, creating a boom in shopping centers and apartment houses in its capital, Lima. Lagos, Nigeria, experienced the same, benefiting from the high price of oil.The low interest rates, which had been cut to the bone because of the crisis, fueled the boom. The Brazilian energy company Petrobras accumulated $128 billion in debt, doubling its annual borrowing costs over the last three years.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.Then the commodity story started to change when Chinese growth slipped.In 2015, commodity prices had their worst year since the financial crisis and global slowdown. Nickel, iron ore, palladium, platinum and copper all declined by 25 percent or more. Oil prices have declined by more than 60 percent over the last 18 months. Even corn, oat and wheat prices have sunk.And the commodity slide has continued into this year. At just over $30 a barrel, oil has reached levels not seen in over a decade.The bust is made all the more pernicious by rising interest rates, as the Federal Reserve changes gears. Companies that took advantage of the cheap debt to increase production are now stuck with a big bill that will be difficult to cover.Freeport-McMoRan is putting the finishing touches on a $4.6 billion expansion of the Cerro Verde copper mine in Peru, which will triple production. The project is so big that it could consume nearly 10 percent of Peru\u2019s electricity.With copper prices at their lowest level in seven years, Freeport-McMoRan reported a $3.8 billion loss for the third quarter. The company\u2019s shares have dropped by more than 70 percent over the last year. At the behest of the board, the executive chairman James R. Moffett stepped down at the end of 2015, and the company\u2019s next moves are uncertain.Although companies are retrenching, they cannot completely retreat. Many new mines, for example, are designed to function at full capacity to keep them operating efficiently. And the sales are necessary to pay the debts incurred to build them.At particular risk are coal mines in the United States, Australia, Indonesia and elsewhere. Not only is Chinese demand declining, but rising environmental concerns are also hurting their prospects.\u201cRaw material producers invest according to current prices without realizing how those prices might affect future demand,\u201d said Michael C. Lynch, president of Strategic Energy and Economic Research, a consultancy. \u201cNow that the demand is declining because of high prices, they have too much capacity, and once it\u2019s built, you can\u2019t unbuild it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Retro Super Bowl, Putting Defense and Running First", "Date": "2016-01-26", "News": "Supported byT.M.Q. \u2014 Tuesday Morning QuarterbackPerhaps no N.F.L. team has reinvented itself as quickly and successfully as the Denver Broncos \u2014 from No. 1 offense headed into the 2014 Super Bowl to No. 1 defense headed into the 2016 trophy contest, from postmodern quick-snap to traditionalist ground-and-pound.Few N.F.L. teams have gone against the grain as much as the Carolina Panthers \u2014 in a pass-wacky league, they compiled a 15-1 regular season record by running more than throwing. League-wide this season, 58 percent of snaps were pass attempts; the Panthers threw but 49 percent of the time. In the postseason they\u2019ve doubled down, with 78 rushes versus 50 pass attempts, just 39 percent passing.Given how the pass has taken over professional football, it\u2019s intriguing that the four most recent N.F.C. Super Bowl entrants \u2014 San Francisco, Seattle, then Seattle, now Carolina \u2014 are rare in being run-first clubs, while Denver, crushed in the 2014 Super Bowl with a pass-first approach, returns to the trophy contest with a defense-first philosophy.The coming Super Bowl in Santa Clara will recreate the Super Bowl in New Jersey, and not just via cartographic disorientation. In 2014 in the swamps of Jersey, the No. 1 scoring team, the Broncos, confronted the No. 1 defense, the Seahawks. Two weeks hence, the No. 1 scoring team, the Panthers, will confront the No. 1 defense, the Broncos.When offense meets defense in a football title game, defense holds the high card. The Denver offense that got crushed two years ago was the highest-scoring N.F.L. team ever. The second-highest-scoring N.F.L. team, the 2007 Patriots, also lost the Super Bowl, to the Giants. In the ultimate game, these aerial powerhouses produced just 14 points (New England) and 8 points (Denver).Not only did the top two highest-scoring N.F.L. teams fail in the playoffs, but so so did the third (2011 Packers, lost in divisional round), the fourth (2012 Patriots, lost in A.F.C. title game), the fifth (the 1998 Vikings, lost in N.F.C. title game) and the sixth (the 2011 Saints, lost in the divisional round). Of the top 10 scoring clubs in N.F.L. annals, only the 1999 Rams won the Super Bowl the same season.Carolina\u2019s 500-point regular season ranks 16th for most points. It puts the Cats into the category of the unusually high-scoring team that meets a power defense in a championship contest. The big difference between Carolina and other high-scoring teams that have faltered in the end is that the Panthers are run-first. In a football artificial universe of pass-pass-pass, a traditionalist Super Bowl awaits.Adding sweetness to Ginn\u2019s day, late in the second quarter, hosts leading 24-7, Arizona\u2019s Patrick Peterson intercepted a pass and seemed on the way for a touchdown. Ginn ran him down from behind, and on the next Arizona snap, Carson Palmer threw a pick. Preventing a momentum swing, Ginn\u2019s tackle of Peterson was the hidden play of the title round.Denver called a timeout, giving the Patriots a chance to get their ducks in a row. Rob Gronkowski, New England\u2019s best goal-line receiver, was not split wide, rather in-line \u2014 he\u2019d been in-line most of the second half, partly to help with blocking on Von Miller. He\u2019d been in-line the down before, when he caught a fourth-and-goal touchdown pass. A five-man New England pattern left the Patriots only five to block five rushers, and the offensive line barely slowed three of them. Veteran tackle Sebastian Vollmer just gave DeMarcus Ware a quick shove and then stood watching him chase Tom Brady backward to the 12, where Brady threw an interception. Injuries have caused New England to reshuffle its offensive line many times this season, which would be a problem for any team. But on the Patriots\u2019 do-or-die play, the whole offensive line was overpowered: sour.Peyton Manning is 3-1 versus Brady in the A.F.C. title game.Defeating the Patriots twice in two months, the Broncos outrushed them, 278 yards to 83 yards.The Broncos beat the Patriots during the regular season; in postseason rematches, teams that prevailed in the regular season (either 1-0 or 2-0 versus the opponent) are 59-44 in the postseason.Denver is 7-0 with Ed Hochuli as the referee; New England is 4-5.In consecutive home playoff games, the Panthers took a combined 55-7 first-half lead.To halftime of the N.F.C. title contest, Carolina was on a home streak of outscoring opponents 168-31 in the first half.In Arizona\u2019s final three games, the Cardinals were outscored 105-46.Carolina finished the season 10-0 at home.The Panthers are on a 22-2 stretch.Peyton Manning hasn\u2019t thrown a postseason interception, after tossing 17 in just nine regular-season starts. If the Bronco defense remains stout while Manning resists the urge to launch crazy passes, Denver\u2019s Super Bowl chances are good.In the Pittsburgh game, Manning threw super-short. Against New England, Manning went deep five times, once for a 34-yard gain, once for a touchdown, thrice for incompletions. That\u2019s an acceptable outcome for the Broncs \u2014 the occasional deep shot that falls incomplete prevents safeties from choking up versus the run. Before the field goal that made the count 20-12, Manning missed an open receiver in the end zone. But he threw no crazy passes, and by his recent standard, that\u2019s a good day.New England showed many press fronts, which seemed to frustrate Manning, so this tactic may be expected from Carolina. Twice in the fourth quarter, Brady sensed a Denver blitz and audibled to splitting tailback James White wide and sending him on a fly route. Both times he was open: Once he dropped the pass; the other time Brady missed him. Carolina coaches will notice that this tactic almost generated a big play. The Patriots \u201ctook away\u201d Denver\u2019s best receiver, Demaryius Thomas \u2014 seven targets for 12 yards gained. You\u2019d best believe Carolina will look closely at film of how New England did it.Both Denver touchdown passes were to vagabond tight end Owen Daniels, who really should change his first name to Godfrey. (Announcer: \u201cGodfrey Daniels a touchdown!\u201d) On the first, Daniels was in motion; Patriots linebacker Jamie Collins seemed confused and did not cover him. On the second, Daniels split far wide the way Rob Gronkowski sometimes does, and Collins made the mistake of looking into the backfield trying to guess the play, rather than stick with his man.New England often operated five-wide, including when close to its own goal line. But the Patriots did not use a hurry-up, a small surprise since this tactic generally has been good for them. Brady threw one interception directly into the hands of Von Miller when the Denver sack artist surprised by dropping in coverage.Both teams turned the ball over with sideways plays \u2014 New England losing yardage on a shaggy-looking sideways pass on fourth-and-1, Denver losing a fumble on an equally shaggy-looking sideways pass that was initially ruled an incompletion. The call was changed to fumble, a major gift to the Patriots, by Ed Hochuli, whom Flying Elvii faithful didn\u2019t want wearing the white cap. That Hochuli was assigned to the game proves Roger Goodell is trying to destroy New England! Just ask any Patriots fan.\u201cGood morning, I would like to order an espresso please\u201d now is \u201creal quick can I get an espresso?\u201d People who once said \u201cperhaps we should meet in the conference room to review the project\u201d say \u201creal quick what\u2019s up with the project?\u201d Insertion of \u201creal quick\u201d assures the interlocutor that the pain of actually listening to someone soon will be over, and multitasking can resume.

Blow out that candle.\u201d\u201cWhen in the course of human events, real quick, we get pretty steamed, we mutually pledge stuff.\u201d\u201cReal quick, 87 years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation. It won\u2019t perish. Thanks for coming.\u201d\u201cTr\u00e8s rapidement , je ne ai pas besoin de cette hypoth\u00e8se.\u201d\u201cVerum velox, veni, vidi, vici.\u201dAbout that famous Douglas MacArthur line \u201cold soldiers never die, they just fade away\u201d: It\u2019s memorable \u2014 and makes no sense. If you\u2019ve got another famous oft-quoted statement that makes no sense, tweet it to me at @EasterbrookG.Dodd reports Nike will charge high school players \u201cat least $1,000 to participate.\u201d Many disadvantaged families may shell out this fee because they\u2019ll dream it will translate into an athletic scholarship, only to realize too late they\u2019ve been duped. Nike and Marriott should be ashamed of themselves for dreaming up this latest way to exploit young football players.The Cardinals\u2019 Preposterous Punt was a different matter. Trailing 27-7 midway through the third quarter, Coach Bruce Arians sent out the punter on fourth-and-2. Who cares if the spot was the Arizona 28? The Cardinals were down by three scores in the second half of a title contest. The Cardinals had the league\u2019s No. 1 offense during the regular season: If in the postseason they were afraid to try to gain just two yards, they stood no chance. As the punt boomed, T.M.Q. wrote the words \u201cgame over\u201d in his notebook. Then in the fourth quarter Arizona did go for it on fourth-and-2. But by that juncture the Cardinals were down by 27 points, with the situation hopeless.Carson Palmer looked mighty good during the regular season at Arizona, but he was off-key in the postseason versus Green Bay and cover-your-eyes at Carolina. In the title game, his passer rating, 43.2, barely exceeded the 39.6 rating the N.F.L. formula assigns when every pass a quarterback throws clangs to the ground incomplete. At times Palmer\u2019s passes were so bad you couldn\u2019t tell who he was trying to throw to. Receivers including the great Larry Fitzgerald didn\u2019t help, dropping passes on third down. But mainly Palmer seems to get the yips in money time. On his career, he is 1-8 in January.Now the paragraph you knew was coming. All season T.M.Q. had warned that the Cardinals\u2019 predictable big-blitzing on third-and-long would bring the team to woe. Carolina leading 10-0 late in the first quarter, the Cats faced third-and-8 on their 14. Arizona big-blitzed, and the seemingly easy 86-yard touchdown pass to the uncovered Corey Brown made the audience think, \u201cThis will be a walkover.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the substance that an academic paper noted was now routinely shipped long distances because of falling transportation costs. The substance is cement, not concrete.Advertisement"}

Jay Nixon of Missouri, who is term-limited and working to elect a Democratic successor. \u201cHe\u2019s entitled to his positions, and it\u2019s a big-tent party, but as far as having him at the top of the ticket, it would be a meltdown all the way down the ballot.\u201dAnd after months of ignoring Republican cheerleading for Mr. Sanders, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign has started aggressively highlighting how much the opposition is openly providing him aid and comfort \u2014 mostly recently in a new ad by Karl Rove\u2019s group American Crossroads that echoes Mr. Sanders\u2019s attacks on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s ties to Wall Street.Mr. Sanders, for his part, has taken to highlighting polls that show him faring better than Mrs. Clinton against some of the Republican candidates, and his aides insist that voters will look past labels to consider his record, ideas and proposals.Yet Mrs. Clinton herself has begun urging activists in Iowa to consider \u201celectability and how we make sure we have a Democrat going back into that White House on Jan. 20, 2017.\u201d And her supporters, with the campaign\u2019s blessing, are aggressively moving to sow doubts about Mr. Sanders\u2019s viability, a tactic aimed at alarming primary voters concerned about retaining the presidency and regaining the Senate.For all the authorized fear-mongering, though, it is clear that few Democrats seeking re-election this year relish the prospect of running with Mr. Sanders on top of the ticket.\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be helpful outside Vermont, Massachusetts, Berkeley, Palo Alto and Ann Arbor,\u201d said Representative Steve Cohen, Democrat of Tennessee.\u201cThe Republicans won\u2019t touch him because they can\u2019t wait to run an ad with a hammer and sickle,\u201d said Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, a supporter of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.Mr. Sanders and his supporters deny that he would be a drag on other Democratic candidates. And Tad Devine, Mr. Sanders\u2019s consultant, recalled another election when Mrs. Clinton\u2019s supporters said her primary opponent was unelectable. \u201cThis is all so reminiscent about what they said about Obama in 2008,\u201d he said.Instead, he framed the primary as a choice between a candidate who is inspiring younger, new and independent voters or one running a 1990s-era race, focused on suburban swing voters, seizing the middle ground on issues like taxes and pushing \u201cincremental change.\u201dAs for the socialist label, Mr. Devine said: \u201cVoters are going to be bombarded with a phenomenal amount of information about him, his life, his political philosophy and his plans, and they\u2019re not going to let that word stop them from looking at him and considering him.\u201dYet after largely ignoring Mr. Sanders as he raised tens of millions of dollars and built a robust grass-roots following, mainstream Democrats are now following Mrs. Clinton\u2019s lead.\u201cI can tell you, as somebody who ran the Democratic Governors Association, that candidates in purple states would face serious problems with him on top of the ticket,\u201d said Gov. Jack Markell of Delaware, referring to the most politically competitive states.\u201cHaving somebody who is identified more as a socialist in many decades of public service than as a Democrat makes it impossible for Democrats in a state like Missouri,\u201d Ms. McCaskill said of her state, which could have competitive races for governor and senator this fall. \u201cAnd it makes it very difficult for Democrats in states like Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida,\u201d she added, referring to states where some of the hardest-fought Senate races will take place.Some Democrats are even talking openly about a kind of cautionary Democratic attack on Mr. Sanders, to show how much the party could be harmed if he were the nominee and Republicans got to sink their teeth into him.\u201cSome third party will say, \u2018This is what the first ad of the general election is going to look like,\u2019\u201d said James Carville, the longtime Clinton adviser, envisioning a commercial savaging Mr. Sanders for supporting tax increases and single-payer health care. \u201cOnce you get the nomination, they are not going to play nice.\u201dAfter the ranks of Democrats in Congress and state capitols thinned under President Obama, the party\u2019s standard-bearer is no small issue. Democrats need at least four seats to win the Senate, and their hopes are promising largely because the races will be fought in states like Wisconsin, Illinois, Nevada and Pennsylvania, which tend to vote for Democratic presidents or at least be hotly contested. They are unlikely to recapture the House, but they could pick up as many as a dozen seats under good conditions. And the outcome of at least five governor\u2019s races will be determined in part by the national political environment.A Sanders-led ticket generates two sets of fears among Clinton supporters: that other Democratic candidates could be linked to his staunchly liberal views, particularly his call to raise taxes, even on middle-class families, to help finance his universal health care plan; and that more mainstream Democrats would have to answer to voters uneasy about what it means to be a European-style social democrat.\u201cHillary Clinton doesn\u2019t have to explain socialism to suburban voters,\u201d said Representative Steve Israel of New York, the former head of the campaign arm for House Democrats, whose hardest-fought races this year include districts outside Philadelphia, Washington and Chicago.House Democrats got a taste of those challenges last fall. As many of their candidates met in Washington with consultants, donors and reporters, word leaked that Mr. Sanders was to give a speech explaining what it means to be a democratic socialist. \u201cWe had candidates and consultants calling us, emailing us, saying: \u2018What do we say about this? How do we explain this?\u2019\u201d recalled a House Democratic official, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to intervene in the presidential race.The official drafted a mock question-and-answer memo.\u201cSenator Sanders has caught fire in the Democratic primary. He is a democratic socialist. Are you a democratic socialist?\u201d went one of the questions. \u201cNo,\u201d was the recommended response.Another question asked the difference between a Democrat and a socialist. Candidates were urged to express pride in being a Democrat but also belief in capitalism and small businesses, \u201cthe engine of our economy.\u201dTo some Democrats, efforts to portray their party as extremist would be made easier were they to nominate a left-wing crusader.\u201cThe things Republicans lied about when they attacked the president would be more true with Bernie in terms of how far left he is,\u201d Mr. Markell said.And Matthew Miller, a former top aide at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said Mr. Sanders would be burdened with the two most glaring vulnerabilities of the Republicans Donald J. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. \u201cHe is hard to see as president, like Trump, and his politics are so far to the left, like Cruz\u2019s are to the right.\u201dAs for whether Democrats risked turning off Mr. Sanders\u2019s legion of youthful supporters by assailing his electability, Senator McCaskill said the party would have no trouble healing.\u201cSix months ago there was a lot of nervousness about keeping the party united and walking gently because we didn\u2019t want to offend millennials and progressives,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think Ted or Trump are going to take care of our need to be united.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Decoding Airline Fare Classes to Make the Most of Your Miles", "Date": "2016-01-12", "News": "Supported byThe GetawayDo you know what a Q fare is? How about an X or a Z? When you browse for flights on an airline\u2019s website, assorted letters appear in your search results. Travelers often miss them. Or see them but don\u2019t factor them into their decision about which flight to choose. But these letters matter. Because of them, the person to your left may receive more award miles than you, reach elite status faster than you, or change her itinerary at no cost while you pay a $200 fee \u2014 yet you\u2019re both in the same cabin. What gives?As many frequent fliers know, the visible class distinctions on airplanes (Economy, Premium Economy, Business, First) are further divided into invisible groups called fare classes, or booking codes. Different airlines assign different letters to these classes, which can also vary from carrier to carrier. Knowing the ABCs of fare classes may help you attain elite status, avoid penalties for changing and canceling flights, and rack up miles, among other things. If you\u2019re aiming to earn award miles by flying an airline that\u2019s partners with your primary carrier, it\u2019s particularly important to learn how to make fare classes work in your favor.What those charts don\u2019t show are details about the flexibility of each fare class. To see the complete rules, including how much you have to pay for itinerary changes, you often have to go deep in the flight search process, almost to the payment page. That said, airline websites tend to make it clear early on in a search whether a ticket can be refunded and if changes can be made. I\u2019ll touch on this again below. For now, let\u2019s look at how fare classes relate to earning award miles, and miles that count toward elite status.I\u2019ll use Delta as an example because its website displays fare class letters clearly above the price of each flight. Members of Delta\u2019s reward program earn award miles based on ticket price, not distance flown. The higher the price, the more miles you can use toward award travel. Additionally, program members earn Medallion Qualification Miles, which are based on both distance flown and fare class paid. These qualification miles are used to determine your status: Silver, Gold, Platinum or Diamond.While searching for a round-trip flight from Los Angeles to Panama City on Delta.com, I saw a business class ticket with two stops for $2,014 in fare classes Z, A and G. Call it Ticket No. 1. There was also a Business class ticket for $2,756 in fare classes J and F and F. Call it Ticket No. 2.According to Delta\u2019s fare class chart, if I bought Ticket No. 1, I would earn 150 percent of the distance I fly. So the approximately 3,000-mile flight to Panama would earn me 4,500 qualifying miles. If I bought Ticket No. 2 , I would earn 200 percent of the distance I fly. So the flight to Panama would earn me 6,000 qualifying miles.Is there a winner? It depends on what you\u2019re after. Ticket No. 1 is $742 cheaper than Ticket No. 2. But it earns 1,500 fewer qualifying miles. And it\u2019s nonrefundable. Ticket No. 2 costs more. It earns more qualifying miles. And it\u2019s refundable.Sure, one advantage of some higher-priced tickets is the ability to cancel a trip or make changes at no additional cost. (Keep in mind, though, that sometimes the cheaper flight is still cheaper even if you end up paying a change fee.)It\u2019s especially important for members of airline loyalty programs to understand fare classes when deciding whether to credit miles to their primary carrier or a partner airline. Travelers who are not careful can end up with few miles and, in some instances, none at all.For example, Turkish Airlines partners with United. Some Economy tickets (fare classes Y, B, M, H or S) on a Turkish Airlines-operated flight earn you 100 percent of the United award mileage. But an economy ticket in fare class E or Q is a discount code that earns you 75 percent. It gets worse. Fare classes V, T and L are deep-discount economy tickets for which you receive only 50 percent. Alas, that\u2019s better than a W, G or P fare class, where you receive no mileage.When your primary carrier is giving you little or no mileage for travel on a partner airline, you\u2019re often better off crediting your flight to the partner airline.When miles matter, another thing to bear in mind is that while some fare classes put you in the Business cabin, they\u2019re essentially upgraded Economy tickets that don\u2019t earn many miles. Again, check the fare class chart to see the earn rate.Bottom line: I don\u2019t waste time deciphering every last fare code. I read fare-class rules to see if I\u2019m able to change or cancel an itinerary. I decide whether to gamble on a nonrefundable fare. And if I\u2019m traveling with a partner airline, I look at fare-class charts to ensure that I\u2019m not flying without earning. A little homework equals peace of mind and, just maybe, some status.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is America Headed in the Right Direction? Readers Respond", "Date": "2016-01-11", "News": "Supported byThe president may put on an upbeat air in tonight\u2019s address, but I hope he tempers it with realism. Given the mood of the electorate, he is going to need a very convincing case.While I personally feel he has done the best he could \u2014 and there are genuine achievements \u2014 I am still saddened by all that could have been done if not for the most highly obstructive Congress in the past 50 years.Thus my thoughts on what constitutes our largest challenges? They have to include the influence of money in politics, political polarization, the death of compromise and the 24/7 news cycle that has turned American affairs into one big TV reality show.I genuinely feel that this nation is moving away from its democratic ideals and the vision the founders had for this nation. The more wealth and power is concentrated in the hands of a few who can purchase the support of political leaders in Washington and mold the laws to suit their personal financial interests, the more we lose as a society.How can one not think that the country is headed the wrong direction under Obama? We have had one of the weakest recoveries in postwar history, just over 2 percent per year, and the beneficiaries are a small sliver of society. Real median income in 2014 was 4 percent below the level of 10 years ago, and a reasonable level of unemployment has depended on loads of people dropping out of the job market.Are we headed in the right direction? Since Barack Obama came to office, our economy has improved, the jobless rate has fallen, health care has improved, and we have decreased our military involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan. We are headed in the right direction.I hear criticism of ISIS, the recent downturn in the stock market, immigrants and the lack of gun control. I also hear about increasing economic disparities and decreasing political compromise. I miss the idealistic altruism of the past. Things aren\u2019t perfect, but much progress has been made. I approve of the direction the country has taken in the last seven years.I\u2019m going to be 66 this year, and despite our Social Security not being sufficient to pay the rent, let alone full retirement expenses, I am optimistic that there are better days ahead. I\u2019ve lived thru all of the worst in modern history, from the Cold War to the Cuban Missile Crisis to the Kennedy assassination, so I have some broad experience to judge my feelings by. Today, it feels like the Progressive Democratic Socialist values I have held since my youth are finally coming of age. That makes me feel positive, and optimistic about 2016.Those long ago planted seeds in the 1960s have taken root in a few of us, grown to prominence slowly but steadily ever since, and now expanding to the younger generation in force. Perhaps now to finally get the pendulum to swing back to the other direction I we will have finally changed the world, for the better.The extremes of both parties have us all believing that there is no middle ground. Actually, if you take the top 10 issues facing us today, you will find that 80 percent of Americans are generally in agreement on how to proceed. It is the extremists in each party coupled with the press and special interest who are bringing us all down. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Year Junk Bonds Lived Up to Their Name", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byInvestors chasing high yields have been battling high anxiety.Many of the woes of the junk-bond sector are a result of the steep dive in commodity prices.The North American shale rush was financed largely with junk bonds. According to MarketAxess, high-yield bonds issued by gas and oil companies grew to more than $250 billion last year from $95 billion in 2012. Yet with the price of oil 65 percent below its 2012 peak, many energy companies now find themselves in a cash-flow pinch. Energy companies that defaulted on debt in 2015 include SandRidge Energy, Halc\u00f3n Resources, Quicksilver Resources and Walter Energy.Plenty of others are in rough shape. For example, some bonds issued by Chesapeake Energy, a natural gas and oil exploration and production company, fell more than 70 percent in 2015.S&P Dow Jones Indices tracks \u201cdistressed\u201d high-yield corporate bonds. By its definition, a bond that yields at least 1,000 basis points (10 percentage points) more than a Treasury issue with a comparable maturity earns a spot in the distressed heap. About 15 percent of the $1.6 trillion high-yield United States bond market is distressed right now. Thirteen commodity-related industries account for nearly 40 percent of the distressed market, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices; the rest is spread among more than 85 industries.Unless a sharp rally in commodity prices provides relief for energy and mining companies, there is likely to be more bloodletting in the high-yield world. Moody\u2019s Investors Service expects the 3.4 percent default rate for domestic junk bonds at the end of last year to rise to 4.1 percent by late this year. The pain is expected to be highly concentrated: The default rate is expected to rise to near 7 percent for metals and mining issuers and more than 5 percent for bonds issued by oil and gas companies.Gershon Distenfeld, director of high yield at AllianceBernstein, points out that falling commodity prices are a boon for companies that use them \u2014 as well as for consumers, who drive about two-thirds of the domestic economy. Moreover, the broad sell-off in junk bonds over the last 18 months has made the high-yield bond market more compelling.That sell-off was painful, of course. An index of high-yield bonds that yielded 5 percent before commodities collapsed was at 8.75 percent at the end of 2015. If you owned junk during that climb, you felt the pain. That is because bond prices fall when yields rise, and a fund\u2019s total return is the sum of the yield plus the changes in the price of the bond. The negative returns of late reflect the fact that the income payouts were not enough to offset the decline in bond prices.But those past declines may help now. \u201cOdds are that high yield will do better going forward given where yields are now,\u201d Mr. Distenfeld said. He added that a \u201cpretty good guide\u201d for forward annualized returns over a four- or five-year rolling period was the yield at the beginning of the period. That is more than 8 percent now.Just do not expect anything resembling a smooth ride. The Fed has signaled its belief that a still-weak economy is at last strong enough to merit lifting interest rates off the zero level in place since the financial crisis. But with that less-than-robust backdrop, every bit of disappointing economic data could set off an outsize investor reaction. And if recession chatter picks up meaningfully, losses in high-yield bonds could be big. Case in point: The average junk fund lost more than 25 percent in 2008.One indication that the high-yield market is dicey comes from actively managed high-grade core bond funds, which typically have the freedom to invest 10 to 20 percent or so of their assets in high-yield issues. It makes sense to do so when they surmise they are getting a big enough yield payoff to compensate them for the risk. (Core index funds do not own junk bonds.)But these funds are holding back. According to Morningstar, the average actively managed core bond fund holds less than 10 percent of assets in issues rated below investment grade, and that includes investments in low-rated mortgage- and asset-backed securities. The two largest actively managed core bond funds, Pimco Total Return and Metropolitan West Total Return, have little to no exposure to high-yield corporate bonds.The third-largest active bond fund, DoubleLine Total Return, has never trafficked in high-yield corporate bonds (it does own lower-rated mortgage- and asset-backed issues), and the DoubleLine Core Fixed Income Fund has just 5.3 percent of its assets invested in high-yield corporate bonds and bank loans. \u201cJust because it is cheap doesn\u2019t mean it is a deal,\u201d said Bonnie Baha, head of DoubleLine\u2019s Global Developed Credit Group. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on slowing U.S. growth, slow global growth and the fact that the Fed can\u2019t justify raising rates based on fundamentals,\u201d Ms. Baha said.Given the evident risks, now is a time to play it as safe as possible within the junk world.That starts with the quality of the bonds a fund owns. The bond rating scale starts at AAA for the high-quality issues, and then continues to AA, A, BBB, BB, B, all the way to C and unrated. Any bond rated below BBB is considered high yield. Junk bonds rated BB and B are the most solid part of the high-yield market. Once you get into the C range, you\u2019re not trawling just among the riskiest companies, but among bond issues that are the hardest to trade in volatile times.Those trading difficulties are what brought down Third Avenue Focused Credit Fund, a high-yield portfolio that specialized in distressed debt, which it bought with the expectation that it would rebound in value, sooner or later. But nearly 90 percent of the portfolio was in issues rated CCC and lower. When investor redemption requests increased, the fund\u2019s managers decided to shutter it rather than be forced to promptly meet redemptions by selling bonds at fire-sale prices. Dan Gagnier, a spokesman for Third Avenue, said there was no timetable for how long it would take the fund to liquidate and make final payments to shareholders. With a loss of more than 40 percent since the middle of 2014, many shareholders are facing net losses.Sarah Bush, a bond fund analyst at Morningstar, said the emphasis on distressed issues made Third Avenue Focused Credit an extreme outlier, and she did not expect there to be similar implosions among other junk funds. \u201cMost junk funds focus on BB- and B-rated debt,\u201d she said, \u201cbut Third Ave. explicitly invested in much lower-quality issues from firms that were known to already be in trouble.\u201dIn fact, the average high-yield mutual fund has about 17 percent of its assets in bonds rated CCC or lower. That is about what the SPDR Barclays High Yield Bond E.T.F. holds. The iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond E.T.F. has about 10 percent invested below B.Anthony Valeri, fixed-income strategist at LPL Financial, said that index funds, which are required to track the market even when it includes very risky constituents, may be at a disadvantage when it comes to junk bonds now. \u201cWe recommend investors seek out actively managed high-yield mutual funds, where the manager can avoid the land mines,\u201d he said.The actively managed Vanguard High-Yield Corporate Fund recently had less than 6 percent invested in issues rated below B. Last year it lost 1.4 percent. That may not seem like anything to boast about, but passively managed competitors did worse: The SPDR E.T.F. lost more than 7 percent, and the iShares E.T.F. lost more than 5.5 percent.Advertisement"}

He has no plans to visit the city, but White House officials said he had met in Washington on Tuesday with Karen Weaver, the Flint mayor, who was in town for a previously scheduled meeting of the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mayors. He assured her that the federal government would support state and local efforts to address the crisis, officials said.In Detroit, Mr. Obama is scheduled to visit the 2016 North American International Auto Show, in an effort to remind the public of the wisdom of the aggressive steps he took at the start of his presidency to bolster the economy and to prop up General Motors and Chrysler, in particular. Then, he will speak at the United Automobile Workers-General Motors Center for Human Resources on the Detroit Riverfront. He is also planning to have lunch with Mike Duggan, the Detroit mayor, and highlight the support his administration has provided to that city, including after it declared bankruptcy in 2013, through federal funds to eliminate blight and through initiatives to bolster transportation and housing.The success story stands in stark contrast to embattled Flint, the birthplace of General Motors and the U.A.W. \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Fading Factories Weigh on an Already Slowing Economy", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported byDONGGUAN, China \u2014 Walking around an abandoned furniture factory, Fang Minghua pointed out the workshops where several hundred employees once toiled, transforming sheets of raw wood into TV stands or wardrobes for the aspiring middle class in China and other emerging economies.The factory is relocating to a new facility two hours away, priced out by rising costs and falling orders. Mr. Fang estimated that as many as a third of the furniture factories around town had gone out of business, while many others were struggling.\u201cThe economic slowdown is real,\u201d said Mr. Fang, 46, who over the last 22 years had worked his way up from $50-a-month laborer to production supervisor.The downturn in Dongguan, a once-thriving manufacturing hub, is part of the Chinese economic puzzle that global investors are trying to solve.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.While China has been moving away from the type of low-end manufacturing that has been Dongguan\u2019s specialty, the protracted slump in the country\u2019s vast industrial sector is a major threat to the nation\u2019s already slowing economy. As the government tries to manage the situation, the risk is that the Chinese economy is worse off than expected \u2014 a concern that has put markets around the world on edge.For the full year, China expanded at 6.9 percent, just below the government\u2019s target of 7 percent and the weakest performance since 1990 when foreign investment shriveled in the year after the deadly crackdown in Tiananmen Square.When it comes to the economy, Mr. Fang said, politicians and business leaders talk about industrial innovation and upgrading, \u201cbut I think that is just a slogan. It\u2019s really hard to carry out.\u201dDongguan is at the heart of south China\u2019s Pearl River Delta. For decades, the region drove the country\u2019s global ascent in exports, producing furniture, garments, shoes and other goods.But the world\u2019s workshop has been stumbling as cheaper production bases in Asia have gained ground. Last year, Chinese exports fell for the first time since the financial crisis \u2014 and for only the second time since the country\u2019s economy began reopening to the outside world in the late 1970s.That position is likely to be further eroded by the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The United States-led trade agreement deepens American ties with Asian countries like Vietnam and Malaysia, but it excludes China.The slump has created a tricky situation for the government.Officials have encouraged phasing out low-end exports in favor of promoting the service sector and high-tech manufacturing. While newer and more dynamic companies are on the rise in China, the risk is that they won\u2019t develop fast enough to offset the hollowing out of light manufacturing, which remains a shrinking but significant employer across the country.Some traditional manufacturers have responded to the downturn by relocating farther inland or overseas, where costs are generally lower. Others are trying to reduce their reliance on export orders by establishing their own branded products for domestic sale.\u201cThis is an unfortunate pain being felt in traditional, older sectors,\u201d said Louis Kuijs, the head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics. However, he added, the shift away from low-end, labor-intensive manufacturing \u201cis an unavoidable part of the structural change that the economy is undergoing.\u201dZhang Lin, 43, is trying to adapt to the shifting terrain.As a supervisor, Mr. Zhang, who left his home in western Sichuan Province 25 years ago to work in Dongguan shoe factories, once oversaw about 7,000 production-line workers at a Taiwanese-owned factory here. At their peak, before the financial crisis, factories in the city accounted for about one in every four pairs of athletic shoes sold globally, according to estimates from the Dongguan Shoe Industry Commerce Association.But rising costs have weighed heavily on the shoemaking business. The Taiwanese factory where Mr. Zhang worked closed in 2012. He and several partners went out on their own, setting up a plant making shoes and leather boots for brands like K-Swiss and Durango. Today, Mr. Zhang\u2019s factory employs about 700 people.While costs are rising, demand from overseas customers has also been declining. The company\u2019s orders slipped to about 1.2 million pairs of shoes last year, down about 15 percent from 2014.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say whether we can keep going for another five years \u2014 the outlook isn\u2019t very good,\u201d Mr. Zhang said.In response, the company has been reducing hours for its workers. It also considered moving.While the company plans to keep the existing factory here, it is making a future bet by expanding to a less-developed province, Guizhou. Labor costs there are as much as 40 percent less than those in Dongguan. Mr. Zhang also went on a scouting trip in August to Bangladesh, where some other large Dongguan shoe companies have shifted production.The factory has also started making its own line of leather casual shoes. It sells them online in China, for as much as $75 a pair, on Taobao, Alibaba\u2019s main online shopping platform.\u201cIn a situation where overseas orders are falling, you need to have a backup plan,\u201d Mr. Zhang said.Other sectors have similarly been struggling, including some electronics manufacturers. In October, Fu Chang Electronic Technology, a supplier to the telecommunications equipment makers Huawei and ZTE, shut its doors unexpectedly. The closing prompted a protest by thousands of workers in front of a government building in Shenzhen.While there are still many active factories in Dongguan, the main ones succeeding are increasingly high-tech and less reliant on large staffs.After working 15 years at an automotive plant in Alabama, Michael Recha moved to Dongguan in 2012 to set up a specialized factory for car parts, one of the first of its kind in China. Owned by Gestamp, a Spanish automotive component maker, the factory uses a technology called hot stamping to form metal sheets into precision parts like car bumpers and body panels for both local and foreign carmakers.But robots do an increasing share of the work. The factory employs just 400 workers working two shifts a day.\u201cChina is no longer a low-cost country, so we have the same robots and equipment here\u201d as in Europe, Mr. Recha said.Mr. Fang, of the furniture factory, estimates that by moving inland and consolidating three factories, the company saves about $150,000 a month in operating costs \u2014 including lower electricity and water bills, and also taxes. The biggest saving is on rent, because the owner of the company was able to buy low-cost land to build the new compound.The move, though, has extracted a different toll.The new factory is relatively remote, so there isn\u2019t much to do after work. Mr. Fang\u2019s wife, who stayed behind in Dongguan, \u201cdoesn\u2019t feel very happy about being apart,\u201d he said.Their current plan is for her to join him sometime after next month\u2019s Lunar New Year holiday.\u201cShe will get a new job, probably in the same factory with me,\u201d he said.Sarah Li contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "So What Would It Mean to \u2018Beat China\u2019 on Trade?", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byLabor MarketIf you were Donald Trump, you would probably summarize the academic paper\u2019s finding as follows: China is beating us.\u201cThe idea that trade competition with China has hurt various workers and communities is nothing new and extremely well known to people and voters in those communities,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. \u201cJust because Donald Trump says it doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t true.\u201dNow, some minds are changing. The process of labor market adjustment is \u201cgummier than anybody realized,\u201d said Mr. Hanson, a professor at the University of California at San Diego. The persistent negative effects of Chinese trade on much of the American labor market have \u201ctoppled much of the received wisdom about the impact of trade on labor markets,\u201d Mr. Hanson wrote with his co-authors, especially the \u201cconsensus that trade could be strongly redistributive in theory but was relatively benign in practice.\u201dIn fairness to the economics profession, that consensus emerged mostly because workers actually did adjust more easily to trade in the past. Global trade soared in the four decades after World War II without apparent negative effects on labor markets in rich countries. But most of this trade was between rich countries, and exposing Ohio workers to competition with Ontario workers wasn\u2019t that much different from the competition they always had with Michigan workers.As Mr. Gordon and his co-authors describe, the rise of trade with China since 1991 increasingly exposed American workers to competition from those who would work for much less, causing particular problems for lower-skilled workers.There is also a damaging trade imbalance. The rise of Chinese exports would not have had such negative effects on the American labor market if it had been offset by a commensurate rise of Chinese imports. More exports to China would have created American jobs, both in exporting industries and in the sectors that support those industries, making it easier for displaced workers to find new jobs.The big question is what to do about any of this, and it\u2019s a lot easier to find common ground about the problem than the solution.Mr. Bernstein has advocated provisions in international agreements that punish countries for manipulating their currencies, as China did for years, depressing the value of its currency to help its manufacturers undercut other countries on price. But while such rules would help level the playing field in the future, they wouldn\u2019t do much today because China\u2019s currency is no longer overly weak, Mr. Bernstein said.Dean Baker, an economist who I find usually agrees with Mr. Bernstein on trade matters, told me the opposite: that China\u2019s currency is still too weak, held down by huge investments in American bonds held by the Chinese central bank. If they sold those bonds, he said, China\u2019s currency would strengthen, American manufacturers would be in a better position to compete, and the trade deficit would shrink.Mr. Hanson expressed skepticism that any public policy tools would be effective in combating the imbalance of trade because the exact source of the imbalance is a \u201cpuzzle,\u201d much of it far removed from what you would traditionally think of as trade policy. For example, he argued that the one-child policy perpetuated the trade imbalance by driving Chinese workers to save instead of consuming, as they knew they would enter old age without many children to support them.\u201cThe problem is not trade liberalization,\u201d he said. \u201cTrade is going to lead to the reallocation of workers across sectors, generating income growth for the world as a whole, even if you have distributional effects along the way. The problem is that labor market adjustment is too slow.\u201dAs such, Mr. Hanson calls for changes in our own economy: reforms to labor, housing and safety-net policy that would make it easier and less painful for workers to move to new regions and switch to new industries \u2014 whether such moves were necessitated by global trade or any other economic shifts.But Mr. Baker argued there are more opportunities to use the diplomatic channels identified by Mr. Bernanke to make trade with China less harmful to American workers. He noted that currency manipulation and the trade deficit are existing items on the American diplomatic agenda with China; the question is how high they rank, and what issues American officials really care about winning on.\u201cWe have a list of things,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want you to respect Bill Gates\u2019s copyrights, we want you to respect patents, Goldman Sachs wants more access. There\u2019s a list, and currency is on it.\u201d\u201cCharacterizing it as \u2018us versus China\u2019 is inflammatory, jingoistic, if you like, racist,\u201d Mr. Baker said. \u201cA lot of the companies doing the exporting are U.S. companies. So it\u2019s not China, it\u2019s our companies. Walmart has low-cost supply chains throughout China.\u201d So, for that matter, did Mr. Trump\u2019s apparel line.Yet Mr. Baker still endorses the idea that a frank negotiation that puts the weight on the right issues could improve American workers\u2019 trading position with China.\u201cThe question is, what exactly is he telling China?\u201d Mr. Baker said, regarding a hypothetical Trump presidency. \u201cIt would have to be part of a give and take; it\u2019s going to be about priorities. It might mean giving up on certain priorities. So in that sense he could do it, but it\u2019s not a question of beating them up; he\u2019d have to give things up.\u201dAn Upshot article on Thursday about the effects of China trade on the United States labor market misstated Ben Bernanke\u2019s advice for addressing the problem of trade imbalances between nations. Mr. Bernanke, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve, said countries that run persistent and unjustified trade surpluses \u2014 not trade deficits \u2014 must be urged to change their ways.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Year the Studios Get It Right", "Date": "2016-01-01", "News": "Supported byIn February, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will consecrate a best picture, most likely choosing from among a roster of respectable, serious dramas. A few early favorites have already faded \u2014 does anyone remember \u201cThe Walk\u201d or \u201cEverest\u201d? \u201cSicario\u201d or \u201cBlack Mass\u201d? \u2014 but the field of Oscar movies is crowded with aspirants. Meanwhile, movie audiences have had other ideas, driving box-office totals to record heights with their enthusiasm for reanimated dinosaurs, romantic trainwrecks and galactic battles. Popularity is not the same as quality, of course, but 2015 was a year when a lot of the best cinematic art could be found at the multiplex, amid the sequels and blockbusters.Critics like to complain \u2014 with ample justification \u2014 about the soullessness of sequel-driven commercial cinema. We also like to be surprised, and maybe what surprised me most in 2015 was how much risk, heart, imagination and relevance could be found in large-scale, big-studio releases.However cynically bottom-line driven, the big studios seem to be increasingly diversifying their product beyond just varying genre. But I\u2019m not sure that the Academy has caught up to the changes that are happening around it. Movies like \u201cCompton\u201d don\u2019t necessarily win Oscars, as much as I\u2019d like to see its creators holding aloft a statuette on the Dolby stage on Feb. 28. It might just be too violent and profane for most of the Academy membership; it might seem like too much of a genre movie even if it\u2019s as much a biopic as that best picture winner \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech\u201d (but better!). And the voters might be too square to enjoy rap, much less grasp the wider implications of this music and the musicians who were changing the culture 24 miles south of the Hollywood sign.Academy voters tend to elevate Oscar movies that take on the bluntly obvious, whether it\u2019s adversity, a historical catastrophe or the industry\u2019s favorite topic: itself. That\u2019s why a movie that announces its Importance like \u201cThe Revenant\u201d is an obvious contender even if \u201cCompton\u201d is the radical one.This is partly because young rebels have a way of aging into establishment figures, whether they like it or not. But it\u2019s also because the indie sensibility was in many ways more homogeneous and less adventurous than its propagandists liked to believe. At a certain point, as the indie feature mutated into the mid-budget Oscar film, it became synonymous with an earnest drama (or sometimes a wry comedy) about the strivings and sufferings of white people. This was true of smaller-scale independent films as well, which through the mumblecore era of the early and mid-2000s were, if anything, even whiter than Hollywood movies.The blockbusters, all of a sudden, look like models of inclusiveness and ambition. Don\u2019t get me wrong: I like wry comedies and earnest dramas and white people in old-fashioned clothes as much as the next guy. And I\u2019m often more bored than excited by effects-driven serial storytelling. But when I look back at the movies of 2015 in search of popular art that reflects the realities and nourishes the dreams of the world I inhabit, I find myself thinking of \u201cFurious 7,\u201d with its multihued family of noble gearheads; of the \u201cHunger Games\u201d heroine Katniss Everdeen and her epigones, Rey from \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d and Furiosa from \u201cFury Road\u201d; of Finn (also from \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d) and Adonis Johnson, also known as Creed.I do like and love some of the movies we\u2019ve been discussing, even if I don\u2019t see enough messiness, wildness and risk and do see far too much self-importance, all terminal signs of white-elephant auteurism. The Academy tends to reward the bland and banal, despite the occasional outlier, which has remained true even as the industry has absorbed some salable indie-film talents. Fast forward to 2015, when some of the most memorable movies were rowdy, big-studio release that were out to grab truckloads of cash and ended up speaking to the mass audience (critics too) more than many tastefully correct awards hopefuls with their impeccable technique and Important subjects. The movies and times are changing \u2014 will Oscar?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oscars So White? Or Oscars So Dumb? Discuss.", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byThis year\u2019s nominations led Spike Lee and Jada Pinkett Smith to announce on Martin Luther King\u2019s Birthday that they would not be attending the ceremony. On Monday, the Academy\u2019s president, Cheryl Boone Isaacs, promised a review of recruitment efforts, saying, \u201cThis is a difficult but important conversation, and it\u2019s time for big changes.\u201dLike many, The New York Times\u2019 chief film critics, Manohla Dargis and A. O. Scott, and the critic at large Wesley Morris were not surprised by the nominations. Here are excerpts from their conversation:The statistics are unequivocal: Women and minorities are vastly underrepresented in front of and behind the camera. Here, 27 industry players reveal the stories behind the numbers.The shocking \u2014 or maybe not so shocking \u2014 whiteness of this year\u2019s field of nominees exposes not only the myopia of the nominating body but also the deep structural biases of the industry that feeds it. The Oscars have, since the century began, done a reasonably good job of recognizing black talent, belatedly making up for decades of neglect. \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d won best picture. Denzel Washington, Jamie Foxx, Halle Berry, Forest Whitaker and Mo\u2019Nique all collected statuettes for acting, as Geoffrey Fletcher (\u201cPrecious\u201d) and John Ridley (\u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d) did for screenwriting. But somehow (and I hope we can shed some light on exactly how), these victories, in the larger context of Hollywood racial politics, can smack of tokenism rather than real change. Spike Lee\u2019s lifetime achievement award feels like belated and inadequate compensation for a career\u2019s worth of slights. At the movies, we may be in the age of \u201cChi-Raq\u201d and \u201cStraight Outta Compton,\u201d but the Academy is still setting the table for \u201cGuess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner.\u201dIn the case of both \u201cCreed\u201d and \u201cCompton,\u201d I just don\u2019t think the campaigns were there for these movies. Just as I don\u2019t think they were there for \u201cSelma\u201d the previous year. And as nauseating as that sort of thing can be, that\u2019s how these things work: positioning, narratives, spinning, hype, overexposure, wanton whoring. So some of this is a matter of there not being enough movies in the pool. Some of it is the studios\u2019 misunderstanding the worth of the movies they have. It strains credibility that \u201cCreed\u201d wouldn\u2019t be a film the Academy would go for. But I also don\u2019t think any voter wants to be told that he or she has to vote for a predominantly black film or: racism!Manohla, wouldn\u2019t you say that\u2019s what happened in the last year and the year before? The audiences paid to see women, films with mostly black actors and racially diverse casts, and paid often: \u201cThe Force Awakens,\u201d \u201cInside Out,\u201d \u201cFurious 7,\u201d \u201cPitch Perfect 2,\u201d \u201cSpy,\u201d \u201cMad Max: Fury Road,\u201d \u201cTrainwreck,\u201d \u201cStraight Outta Compton,\u201d \u201cCinderella,\u201d \u201cCreed,\u201d \u201cGet Hard,\u201d \u201cSisters,\u201d that second \u201cDivergent\u201d movie and the last \u201cHunger Games.\u201d There\u2019s demonstrable proof that North America wants to see itself \u2014 more of itself \u2014 in its entertainment. And the Academy \u2014 which is working to add more women, young people and color to its ranks \u2014 should want to see more of its ideal self at the Oscars.But I don\u2019t want to let the Academy and its members off the hook. Or rather, I want to broaden the indictment beyond the specific complaints that they ignored Mr. Elba, \u201cCreed,\u201d \u201cStraight Outta Compton\u201d and Will Smith\u2019s excellent Nigerian accent in \u201cConcussion.\u201d It\u2019s not as if the 6,000 Academy members exercised the singular intention to ignore those contenders. The nominations are a numbers game, and in each case you can offer a nonracial explanation for the oversight. Other movies and actors just had a few more votes. \u201cBeasts of No Nation\u201d came from Netflix, which is a scary interloper in the hidebound, turf-protective world of the studios. The violence may have put off some voters. \u201cCreed\u201d did not get much of a campaign from Warner Bros., which may have figured that the seventh movie in a 40-year-old franchise with a mixed track record wasn\u2019t exactly Oscar bait. \u201cConcussion\u201d is terrible. \u201cStraight Outta Compton\u201d \u2026I think it\u2019s when you get to that one that race sneaks back into the picture. The Academy, in its function as the culture industry\u2019s upholder of the ideology of Quality, has for a long time been open to African-American talent and even eager to promote and reward it. But at the same time, it has been consistently blind, indifferent and hostile to African-American culture, or at least to certain popular manifestations of blackness at the moment of their greatest impact elsewhere. A Ray Charles biopic in 2005 is unlikely to cause any Academy member the slightest discomfort. An N.W.A biopic in 2015 is another story. \u201cMillion Dollar Baby\u201d and \u201cRocky\u201d are both excellent boxing pictures and worthy best picture winners that breathed fresh life into perhaps the most clich\u00e9-ridden genre in all of cinema.\u201cCreed\u201d belongs in their company, but I think some of its particular virtues flew under the Academy\u2019s radar, much as the glories of \u201cBeyond the Lights\u201d (2014) did. In addition to being a fight movie, \u201cCreed\u201d is a quiet, sweet love story about two people who happen to be young, gifted and black. It\u2019s also suffused with hip-hop and Philadelphia street culture, but in a way that feels entirely organic. It\u2019s not a film that is pointedly \u201cabout\u201d race or class or any particular social problem. It\u2019s not sending a message or teaching a lesson. It\u2019s about the lives, feelings and aspirations of its characters.Which, if those characters are not white, is apparently not enough. American cinema \u2014 more than television or pop music or literature \u2014 still prefers to treat black people as symbols, problems and members of a \u201cniche\u201d audience.The year 2010 was the first that the field went back to including more than five best-picture nominees, and that was a reaction to the omission of \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d from the best-picture list in 2009. That was perceived at the time to be a cataclysm. And what happened in 2010 was a pretty astounding range of movies (of varying excellence, but still!): \u201cAvatar,\u201d \u201cThe Blind Side,\u201d \u201cDistrict 9,\u201d \u201cAn Education,\u201d \u201cThe Hurt Locker,\u201d \u201cInglourious Basterds,\u201d \u201cPrecious,\u201d \u201cA Serious Man,\u201d \u201cUp,\u201d \u201cUp in the Air,\u201d all up for best picture.What a bounty. And to think it came about because the world was mad that the Oscars dissed a comic-book movie. The question is: Could the range happen again now that the system seems thoroughly rigged for campaigns, and this time be even more diverse?So, I\u2019m not sure that the bounty of 2010 is an honest reflection, as you put it Wesley, of the Academy\u2019s taste and priorities. A lot of variables go into every nomination round, including box-office and auteur branding, which may largely explain why James Cameron\u2019s \u201cAvatar\u201d made the cut, though pleasure shouldn\u2019t be discounted. My guess is that the inclusion of titles like \u201cDistrict 9,\u201d a genre movie about race, was primarily a function of the membership scrambling to answer the criticism over \u201cThe Dark Knight.\u201d Now, though, it\u2019s back to a certain old-fashioned idea of Quality, hence all those pale, pretty faces \u2014 Eddie Redmayne, seriously? \u2014 and a great animated movie like \u201cInside Out\u201d downgraded to the best animated feature rather than being allowed to vie as best picture.As to your question, Wesley, could the range of 2010 be replicated \u2014 could it be improved on? Yes and yes again. But much depends on who gets a meeting and who doesn\u2019t; what gets the greenlight and what doesn\u2019t; what\u2019s in the pipeline, and what is still struggling to be made for no reason other than the fact that the person struggling is black or Latino or Asian or a woman of any color and the person who could have said yes instead said no. A lot of this is about who\u2019s cutting the checks, running the companies, calling the shots. Mostly, as we know, those people are white men, and while I have no complaint against them as a class of people (some of my best friends are white guys), none of this will change until they actively help bring about the necessary change or until the country\u2019s demographics force them out. Because while we\u2019ll probably be writing this same story next year, change is coming.This year, at least, the contradictions will be heightened. Spike Lee will get his lifetime achievement award. Chris Rock will be the host. Many of the presenters will be minorities. Integrally close to none of the winners will be. There will be awkward remarks and uncomfortable smiles. The intensity of the discomfort might be a hopeful sign.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Tehran, Iranians Play Down Milestone", "Date": "2016-01-16", "News": "Supported by\u201cI haven\u2019t seen any excitement,\u201d said Ali Shoja, an office cleaner riding the Tehran subway on his way to work. \u201cThey speak of billions of dollars coming, but as in the past, I don\u2019t expect those dollars to reach my pockets.\u201dState television had its own reason to play down the milestone. The end to the sanctions is a success for the government of President Hassan Rouhani, but comes at a cost for Iran\u2019s ruling system. Since the deal was signed in July, Iran has had to put into storage more than 12,000 centrifuges, ship out almost its entire stockpile of enriched uranium and remove the core of its heavy-water reactor. Many officials, especially hard-liners, find it hard to present the nuclear agreement as a victory, especially when so much was given up in compromise.\u201cNuclear burial,\u201d the hard-line newspaper Vatan-e Emrouz wrote in a headline on its front page on Saturday, showing a picture of freshly poured concrete, similar to what replaced the core of the reactor.The government, at odds with the hard-liners, prefers to focus on the economic gains Iran can expect now that sanctions, some in place since 2007, are lifted. Mr. Rouhani also emphasizes at almost every opportunity how, during his administration, Iran has stepped out of its isolation.Indeed, the German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, is planning his second visit to the country; the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, will visit Tehran on Jan. 22; and Mr. Rouhani will visit Italy and France immediately after Mr. Xi leaves.At the center of the diplomatic activity stand the big rewards of the nuclear agreement \u2014 Iran\u2019s vast natural resources, which go well beyond oil and gas, and access to one of the last untapped markets in the world. Several deals have already been made, awaiting only the lifting of the sanctions.Mr. Rouhani likes to call the deal a \u201cwin-win\u201d for both sides, though conservatives in both Iran and the United States say it is more win-lose, with the other side winning. Whatever the outcome of that debate, Iran indisputably will once again be able to sell its oil and make international financial transactions. But as Europe and Asia gear up for their share of the bonanza, businesses in the United States, the main broker of the nuclear agreement, will mostly be watching from the sidelines.Iran\u2019s appetite for investments and imports goes beyond its oil and gas industry, though officials here have said they need at least $150 billion and possibly much more to keep crude oil flowing in the coming decades. \u201cBasically we need everything: hundreds of planes, new ports, an update of our infrastructure,\u201d said Saeed Laylaz, an economist close to Mr. Rouhani\u2019s government.American companies are showing interest, but sanctions dating to 1984, when Iran was designated a state sponsor of terrorism, will force them to work through subsidiaries. Because of that, one analyst predicted, European and Asian companies will divvy up the Iranian market.American companies \u201cwill wait at least until after the U.S. presidential elections\u201d before making any serious moves, to see who wins, said Amir Cyrus Razzaghi, the president of the Ara Enterprise Group, a Tehran-based business consultancy. The risk of a Republican winning and reimposing harsh sanctions, he said, was too great. \u201cIn reality, any American company will only come a year later.\u201dIt might take even longer, given the hodgepodge of sanctions still in place and removable only by a Republican-dominated Congress that has no interest in lifting them.With some exceptions, there is still an American trade embargo with Iran, largely preventing most Americans from doing business with Iran and vice versa. While Iranian financial institutions will once again have access to the international banking system, they generally cannot use it to conduct transactions that go to \u2014 or even through \u2014 the United States, as many major financial transactions now do.\u201cIran was under sanctions before the nuclear issue came about, and the window of business that the United States will be able to do with Iran will remain quite narrow, almost as narrow as it is now,\u201d said Farhad Alavi, the managing partner of the Akrivis Law Group, a Washington firm that specializes in sanctions law and export controls.Even after implementation day, a complicated maze of exceptions to the remaining American sanctions will \u201cgive much pause\u201d to United States businesses, Mr. Alavi said.Iran complied with the requirements of the nuclear deal at breakneck speed, something that analysts attributed to Mr. Rouhani\u2019s wish to bring that triumph to critical parliamentary elections in February. But there was another reason. Insiders admit that the government is near bankruptcy, after years of burning up savings, and that the economy has all but ground to a halt.Iranians see the signs everywhere. \u201cMy husband owns a shop for ladies\u2019 coats, and he hasn\u2019t sold a thing in the past few weeks,\u201d said Mojgan Faraji, an unemployed former journalist. The implementation of the deal will \u201cmostly have a positive psychological impact,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter that, we\u2019d have to wait to see whether purchasing power will increase.\u201dUnder the weight of the sanctions, declining oil sales and, lately, declining oil prices, Tehran has been forced to scrap direct cash handouts for some of the wealthier strata of society. Middle-class Iranians, hurt by inflation that only recently declined from 42 percent to 12 percent, wonder whether the rate has really dropped as far as the government has been saying.\u201cWhat is getting cheaper, tell me?\u201d one woman could be overheard saying in a Tehran taxi last week. Gasoline and utilities have become more expensive, as have rents. Housing prices have recently gone down, the Tehran real estate organization has said. A slump in sales has also been reported.Few think the lifting of sanctions will mean an overnight improvement in their financial situation. Cynicism has the upper hand, after years of what many say were empty promises of improvement.\u201cI do not follow the nuclear news,\u201d said Ali Baseri, a 45-year-old printing-house worker who was taking his father to the hospital. \u201cHow will this solve my economic problems? I do not care, and I don\u2019t see anybody around me caring.\u201dMany point to the drop in oil prices. Historically, oil sales have provided a third to a half of the government\u2019s annual budget expenditures. But the price collapse endangers that.Iran itself will contribute to the problem after sanctions are lifted, adding 500,000 barrels a day on top of the approximately 1.2 million barrels now being produced daily. The aim, the oil minister, Bijan Zangeneh, has repeatedly said, is to eventually return to the former production capacity of 4 million barrels a day.\u201cIran is determined and will be able to fulfill its wish to increase the export of oil and gas, even if the oil price drops to $5 per barrel,\u201d Farshad Ghorbanpour, an analyst in Tehran, said. He also said that after implementation, Iran\u2019s fleet of oil tankers could once again obtain international insurance and start working. The end of the sanctions will also give a lift to trade and commerce. \u201cNow, we have over 1,000 letters of credit waiting to be accepted by international banks,\u201d said Hamidreza Taraghi, a political commentator with close ties to the government. Mr. Razzaghi, the consultant, said he was entertaining representatives from a Turkish company who were thinking of investing over $100 million in food processing operations. He also said that a European bank had shown interest in the potential purchase of a midsize Iranian bank.\u201cBut that would be a long process, maybe two to three years,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat matters is that after the implementation things will start moving.\u201dDavid E. Sanger contributed reporting from Vienna, and Rick Gladstone from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Macedonian Prime Minister Steps Down, but Tensions Over Vote Linger", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byThe resignation came after the arrival here in the capital of Johannes Hahn, the European Union commissioner for enlargement negotiations who helped mediate an agreement in July among the country\u2019s four largest parties. That deal called for the prime minister to step down by Friday.Some issues are still in dispute despite the accord, most notably the election date of April 24, and Mr. Hahn\u2019s presence is intended to ensure that all sides accept any changes and keep the country on track. Both the opposition and the government have raised the specter of voting fraud; in a country with a population of about two million, there were 1.8 million people on the official list of voters.Still, the developments on Friday represented at least a temporary end to nearly 10 years of government under Mr. Gruevski and to the scandal-inspired gridlock that not only stalled legislation in Parliament but also hurt the economy and investments.\u201cWe signed an agreement last summer designed to end the political crisis we faced, and this resignation honors that obligation,\u201d Mr. Gruevski said in an announcement late Thursday. \u201cI can\u2019t stress enough how important it is for these problems to be surpassed and the \u2018hostage situation\u2019 to finally end.\u201dIlija Dimovski, a member of the executive committee for the governing Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party, said that Emil Dimitriev, the party\u2019s general secretary, would serve as prime minister until elections are held.The agreement called for elections to be held on April 24, but that date has not been confirmed and the opposition is hoping to push back voting.\u201cThis is not the end of Gruevski,\u201d said Zoran Zaev, leader of the Social Democratic Union of Macedonia, the largest opposition party. \u201cThis is just the beginning of the end.\u201dMr. Zaev and other members of the opposition have said the vote should be delayed because there was not enough time to ensure that elections in late April would be fair and democratic, as outlined in the agreement reached with the governing party.Mr. Zaev said he expected Mr. Gruevski and several other top officials to face criminal charges in connection with the illegal wiretaps, which secretly recorded senior officials discussing plans to rig elections, control judges, punish opponents, arrange suspicious business deals and cover up killings.The July agreement called for the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate the wiretaps, which also recorded conversations from journalists, clerics, activists and foreign diplomats, and they revealed various forms of fraud in the country\u2019s electoral system.The agreement sought to end a crisis that began in February, when Mr. Zaev revealed that his party had copies of more than 670,000 secretly recorded conversations involving more than 20,000 phone numbers.The opposition said that the recordings had been ordered by senior government officials, and that they had obtained them from unidentified workers at the Interior Ministry who wanted to expose the project.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Transcript of Cuomo\u2019s 2016 State of the State Address", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported by\u201cThank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very, very much. Welcome to Albany. Good afternoon to all of you. Thank you very much for joining us today. First, for the people who put together that video, let\u2019s give them a sign of appreciation. That was a job very well done. To our great Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul who has been all over the state, she\u2019s doing a magnificent job. She had big shoes to fill after Bob Duffy. I don\u2019t know that she literally filled his shoes, but she\u2019s doing a great job. We miss Bob Duffy, still \u2014 Bob Duffy.\u201cTo the Members of the Court of Appeals who are led by Acting Chief Judge Eugene Pigott. It\u2019s a pleasure to be with you, Judge, and the court.\u201cWe lost a great judge and a great New Yorker who was a pioneer in many, many ways. First female to head the Court of Appeals. It\u2019s Judge Kaye, obviously, and I ask a moment of silence as we remember Judge Kaye. Thank you.\u201cTo our great Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who has had a great year. Attorney General, it\u2019s a pleasure to be with you. Likewise, with Comptroller Tom DiNapoli, who has had a blockbuster year. Thank you very much, Tom, for your public service.\u201cAnd to my colleagues from the Legislature. Last night, President Obama was speaking to the nation about the political divisions and how harmful they are. In New York we have political differences, but we don\u2019t have political divisions. And that\u2019s all the difference in the world. And that why this government has continued to work and that\u2019s why this government has continued to progress, so thank you for that.\u201cLet\u2019s start with Minority Leader Brian Kolb. Independent Democratic Conference Leader Jeff Klein. Democratic Conference Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins. Speaker Carl Heastie. Majority Leader John Flanagan.\u201cWe\u2019re also lucky today to be joined by the New York Mets who had a fantastic season. We have Jeff Wilpon, and the Mets\u2019 manager, Terry Collins, and we\u2019d like to thank them for their good work. You made us all proud. Thank you for being here.\u201cWell it is my pleasure to call the 239th Legislature to order. In our five years we have accomplished much. After many, many bad years for the state we love, the arrows are finally pointed in the right direction.\u201cGovernment, as you know, is ultimately about results and you delivered. You made this state a better state. And what\u2019s what government is all about, and congratulations to each and every one of you.\u201cBut with all that we\u2019ve done, we are not immune to the problems vexing our nation. Crumbling infrastructure, a slow economic recovery, the unambiguous reality that climate change threatens the very way of life, a growing specter of terrorism, homelessness, an ever widening gap between the wealthy and everyone else, political polarization and government gridlock. All challenged issues to be sure.\u201cBut thanks to the people in this room we have a government that is built to lead. These problems may have confounded other states and the federal government, but I know New York must and can address them.\u201cThe state of the state, my friends, is strong. Today I am proud to report to the 239th Legislature that we stand stronger than at any point in recent history. The Empire State is poised to grow and to lead.\u201cWhile our challenges are daunting because of what this body has accomplished in the past, it should give all of us great hope for the future.\u201cAs President Clinton liked to say, \u2018We brought arithmetic to our government.\u2019 We limited the state\u2019s new spending to less than 2 percent a year. We passed a 2 percent property tax cap that has brought welcome relief to the citizens of our state and we have cut income, corporate and estate taxes. In total, we have reduced the tax burden on New Yorkers by $114 billion dollars.\u201cWhy is that important? Because reducing taxes is part of our strategy to create jobs, and when you\u2019re creating jobs, you\u2019re creating opportunity and you\u2019re creating hope and you\u2019re creating progress and it is working here in New York. Unemployment is down from 8 percent to 4.8 percent, and today New York State has more private sector jobs than ever before in the history of the state of New York \u2014 7.9 million. From Montauk to Niagara Falls, the New York economy is on the rebound.\u201cOur economic success was matched with an uncommon partner, namely unprecedented social progress. In the past, our government offered a Sophie\u2019s choice: it embraced either fiscal responsibility or social progress \u2014 one or the other. We said we could do both. We said we could bring fiscal responsibility to the state and we could also be the nation\u2019s progressive leader: a beacon for social justice and fairness.\u201cAnd we did it. And we were right to do it. And we were right when we showed this nation true leadership and passed marriage equality; and we were right when we stood up for the women of this state and we passed the Women\u2019s Equality Act; and we were right when we passed the most aggressive law stopping sexual violence on college campuses in the nation; and we were right when we stopped fingerprinting for food; and we were right when we led the way on climate change; and we were right when we stopped discrimination based on sexual identity; and we were right when we passed common-sense gun safety laws. New York now has the smartest gun laws in the nation. And remember this, since Sandy Hook, when we passed our gun control law, we have had fewer gun deaths in the state of New York thanks to your good work.\u201cThat is leadership.\u201cFiscally responsible Democrats, people said, were impossible. Socially progressive Republicans, people said, were impossible. These legislators acted responsibly and we reached compromise and we showed that that can happen. And we didn\u2019t listen to the zealots and we didn\u2019t listen to the extremists and we didn\u2019t list to the naysayers. We governed, we came together, we refused to be intimidated, we refused to be shouted down. We said we are New Yorkers first and we are coming to come together and we are going to kick the extremists to the side and we are taking this state forward on what\u2019s good for the state of New York, and just because you yell, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re right. And just because you stand, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re correct. That\u2019s what this Legislature is all about.\u201cNow, going forward, we must continue our laser focus on reinvigorating the state\u2019s economy, because that is the engine that pulls the train, and remember, my friends, when you are helping the economy you are helping everyone because the best social program is still a job.\u201cWe charted a new path and it is working. New York is on the move, and we have just begun. Building forward starts with maintaining our fiscal discipline.\u201cI will submit a $145 billion budget that spends an additional 1.7 percent \u2014 less than our 2 percent spending limit.\u201cTo stimulate economic growth I propose a tax cut for small businesses because that is the engine that is driving the economy. Ninety-seven percent of all businesses in New York employ fewer than 100 people \u2014 that\u2019s 3.4 million employees working in small businesses. I propose a $300 million tax cut that will reduce the rate from 6.5 to 4 percent, plus a 15 percent income exemption for partnerships and S-corporations. That\u2019s a tax reduction for one million small companies and another clear signal that New York is open for business.\u201cAt the same time, we will continue to reduce the mandates and their cost to the locality. The largest mandate is the Medicaid program. Three years ago we capped the increase in cost to the locality. Localities are now held harmless. Since then, the state has assumed approximately $3 billion in costs from the counties. I believe the state should continue to cap the growth and assume the cost as long as the local government adheres to our 2 percent cap.\u201cRemember, my friends, the property tax is the killer tax in this state, and it has been for a long time. It\u2019s nothing new. Listen to what F.D.R. said, and I quote, \u2018The public is at last coming to realize that the increase in real estate taxes is due wholly to the increase in the cost of local and not state government. These taxes on real estate are too high.\u2026 Local government has in most communities been guilty of great waste and duplication.\u201cThe cost, the waste, the inefficiency of our 10,500 local governments is still this state\u2019s financial albatross, and that is what is driving up the cost. Consolidation, shared services, local efficiencies must be a top priority and we must encourage those choices by framing the true economic realities for local governments. Local governments must be sustainable from a financial point of view. That is the clear economic truth and that is what we have to work towards.\u201cControlling spending and reducing taxes will continue our growth but we can do even more. Our state\u2019s founding fathers\u2019 and founding mothers\u2019 early vision and daring was really breathtaking. Their boldness in constructing our transportation and infrastructure made this state the success it is today.\u201cThe tallest buildings, the longest bridges, the deepest tunnels \u2014 they never said quit. Now it\u2019s our turn, my friends. We must provide the vision and the daring for the next generation. To continue to grow in size and strength, we must develop a new interconnected, planned system of mass transportation, roads and bridges and airports for the next 100 years. We can and we will.\u201cI propose the New York: Built to Lead program. It is a development initiative that would make Governor Rockefeller jealous. A $100 billion investment in transformative projects statewide.\u201cAll experts are unanimous that investment today in the infrastructure of tomorrow creates jobs and builds economic strength. In Washington, both sides agree. However, like so many issues, Washington just can\u2019t get it done. In New York, we can and we will.\u201cOur new Tappan Zee Bridge is an exciting symbol of what we can accomplish. A bridge that other administrations couldn\u2019t even begin is now moving forward. It\u2019s rising from the Hudson like our aspiration is rising for this state.\u201cLet\u2019s take a moment and recognize some of the daring men and women who are working on the Tappan Zee Bridge in the winter, when it\u2019s cold, under dangerous circumstances and are doing a great job. They\u2019re here today. We\u2019ll ask them to stand and show them our appreciation.\u201cThe New York Built to Lead program will begin by ensuring New York remains an international destination at the cutting edge of air travel.\u201cDownstate New York we will build a new airport to replace the outdated La Guardia. Not rebuilding what was, but building a whole new state-of-the-art airport. It will be the first new airport in the United States in over 20 years and New York will lead the way again.\u201cThis year we will also present a new vision for the current maze of terminals at Kennedy Airport and we will also continue our development of Republic and Stewart Airports.\u201cI also propose $6 million in this budget to build a customs center to make MacArthur Airport on Long Island a real international hub once and for all. This will reduce the air demands on La Guardia and Kennedy and increase economic activity on Long Island.\u201cBut mass transportation is the key if our region is to grow in size and strength. If our regions are going to grow, it must be through mass transit. We must move more commuters faster with less damage to the environment. A record $26 billion investment in the M.T.A., buying 1,400 new subway cars and 3,100 new buses, will reinvent the commuting experience. Likewise, $5.6 billion invested in the L.I.R.R., and $3 billion invested in Metro-North will improve the system\u2019s comfort, safety and reliability.\u201cOur $20 billion Gateway Partnership \u2014 a project long overdue \u2014 is now a reality \u2014 it is a coordinated effort among the federal government, New Jersey and New York. It will build a new rail tunnel \u2014 the first in one hundred years \u2014 and it will speed commuters from the west.\u201cFrom the east, the commute from Long Island to New York City is one of the worst commutes in the nation. We need to add a third track to the Long Island rail system so we can expedite commuters and promote intra-island transit.\u201cThe main mass transportation access point in New York City is Penn Station. Penn Station is grossly over capacity and underperforming.\u201cPenn is, in a word: miserable. Amtrak owns it. It is un-New York, it is unwelcoming and it is unacceptable.\u201cIf Vice President Biden was critical of La Guardia Airport, we\u2019re only lucky he didn\u2019t take a train and end at Penn. I can only imagine what he would have said. But we won\u2019t give him the chance. We will build a new Penn Moynihan complex, finally.\u201cNew York State did a great thing in 1986 when it opened the Jacob Javits Convention Center which attracted thousands and thousands transcripts on New York. But it is no longer competitive for many of the big shows. It\u2019s too small and its configuration is not conducive to the exhibitions of today. We will add one million square feet to the convention center and remove thousands of trucks and their diesel fumes that currently line up along Manhattan\u2019s West Side. It\u2019s going to be a boon to the economy, a benefit to the environment and it\u2019s going to be self-financed by the Javits Center. That\u2019s what I call a win-win-win.\u201cNow, upstate New York must remain an economic priority. The cold truth is that this state government shortchanged upstate New York for many years. And that was short sighted. Not only are we one New York family, but we are one New York balance sheet and upstate growth means a stronger economy for all. I propose a record $20 billion economic development program to grow the momentum in upstate New York.\u201cOne of the heavy costs for upstate businesses and citizens are the tolls that we impose on the New York State Thruway. Now as you know, the New York State Thruway was paid off in 1996, but the tolls have continued. I propose we set aside $1 billion of our settlement funds as a reserve fund to maintain and improve the Thruway system. It will also allow us to freeze tolls for all users until 2020. We can also cut tolls by half for all frequent users, and \u2014 listen to this \u2014 eliminate all tolls for our agriculture sector which has been struggling for many, many years.\u201cThis will show upstate businesses and citizens that we are on their side. We owe it to them. Let\u2019s do it and let\u2019s do it this year.\u201cUpstate\u2019s roads and bridges, broadband and other infrastructure must be upgraded also. I propose the largest roads and bridges investment in history \u2014 a $22 billion, five-year investment \u2013 achieving parity with downstate.\u201cI also propose $250 million necessary to assist local governments in rebuilding their water and sewer infrastructure. It\u2019s not fancy but it\u2019s necessary.\u201cThe Regional Councils are producing dividends. Today there are more than 4,000 economic development projects underway thanks to their work. I propose another round of R.E.D.C.s \u2014 our sixth \u2014 for $750 million, to keep the momentum going. Our R.E.D.C. partnerships have created or retained 165,000 jobs. Let\u2019s give them a round of applause.\u201cThe I Love New York tourism campaigns have been a phenomenal success. We have invested $181 million in tourism over the past five years. That $181 million has seen tourism spending increase $8.5 billion and the total impact is now over $100 billion in tourism. I want to add another 10 percent to that budget for a total of $50.5 million because what we\u2019ve learned is that when people see upstate New York they love upstate New York. So we just have to keep them coming and the I Love New York campaign is a way to do that.\u201cThis year we will continue our part by holding the Adirondack Challenge and we will add the Catskill Challenge to which you are all invited. I hope you all can make it.\u201cLeader Flanagan appears physically fit and is legendary for being fast on his feet \u2014 I mean running. But we don\u2019t yet know how he can handle the rough waters \u2014 I mean rafting. We will soon find out because I\u2019m sure the Leader is going to come to both the Adirondack and the Catskill Challenge.\u201cSpeaker Heastie grew up near a river so he is the odds on favorite to win. I understand the speaker is wagering two to one odds on his victory. That\u2019s Assembly confidence, for you. For those of you who wonder what river did the speaker grow up near, of course, it\u2019s the legendary Bronx River.\u201cOur paradigm of entrepreneurial government is the way of the future. The regions of this nation that excel will be the most functional, creative public private-sector partnerships and New York is already leading the way.\u201cWe began in 2011 with our partnership to stimulate dairy production through our Greek yogurt industry expansion and it has worked. We now produce more Greek yogurt than Greece, believe it or not. And our dairy industry is booming because the yogurt companies are consuming all of the milk we\u2019re producing. It has been a great victory and an important lesson, and besides having some cows suffering from sore udders, it has been a great, great success.\u201cWe can also toast our wine and beer initiatives. The number of wineries has increased four fold, breweries have increased sixfold and distilleries and cideries sevenfold. We have made it easier for these businesses to grow and do business by revising some of our laws. But we have to do even more. We have to overhaul the Prohibition-era S.L.A. laws that are way overdue and are an obstacle to growth and we have to do it this year.\u201cThis year I propose our most ambitious entrepreneurial partnerships that we are excited about.\u201cThe first deals with agriculture and food. As you know, agriculture is a critical part of our economy. As you also know, there is a growing health concern among consumers about the food we eat \u2014 what is in it and how it was grown. There is a burgeoning market for safe, healthy food. However, consumer confidence is lacking. Many of the labels that are on those products are virtually meaningless and they have no standard and they have no legal definition. Labels like \u2018all natural\u2019 or \u2018no antibiotics\u2019 actually have no legal definition. Much of our quote-unquote organic produce comes from overseas. So consumer skepticism is justified. To reassure and inform consumers, and provide an opportunity for New York farms, we will initiate the first program to certify the bona fides of natural products.\u201cThe Departments of Health and Agriculture will define what are now vague standards and conduct inspections to certify those standards are being met. Labels like \u2018all natural\u2019 will mean something. \u2018No pesticides\u2019 will mean something. \u2018Hormone free\u2019 will actually mean something. The attorney general will police the program so consumers will know when they buy that product, they are getting exactly what that product says it is.\u201cWe are going to call it the NY Certified High Quality program. It will be voluntary for our farmers to participate but we will advertise this program and its products nationwide, and we think there is a significant marketing asset for the farms that participate. It\u2019s an exciting opportunity. It can help grow our farms. Better products for our consumers. It\u2019s exactly what we need. Let\u2019s take a moment and say thanks to Commissioner Ball, Dr. Zucker and Attorney General Schneiderman.\u201cSecond partnership, the problem of climate change is finally being recognized by most world leaders, anyway. Here in New York we have already been actively working to address it. Now, New York State has a business and an environmental opportunity. Let\u2019s become the international capital for clean and green energy products. We have already attracted some of the largest solar manufacturers on the planet to New York State. We\u2019ve already attracted some of the biggest research and development firms on the planet to New York. I now propose a $15 million Clean Energy Opportunity Training Program so SUNY and our community colleges can train the workers with solar technology and installation.\u201cI believe this is the economy of tomorrow and while we\u2019re developing the business plan, we can also employ it in the state of New York. I propose installing solar in over 150,000 homes and businesses and converting SUNY facilities to renewable energy by the year 2020. We can do it and we should.\u201cMy friends, this is the path for the future to ensure that the planet has a future \u2014 let New York lead the way once again on this important topic.\u201cWe all realize that all of these new economic opportunities demand a world-class education. More and more, education is everything if you\u2019re going to get ahead and do well in this economy. I believe in the promise of education and its potential to serve as the doorway to opportunity. For generations of New Yorkers, education has been the ladder to climb out of poverty. Today, the need for that ladder is greater than it has ever been.\u201cTo open the door of opportunity even wider, and provide the highest quality public education, my budget invests $6.9 billion in SUNY and CUNY. I also propose extending our highly successful SUNY and CUNY 2020 rational tuition and challenge grant program. Our goal is to make our public higher education system the envy of the country. I know we can. With Carl McCall and Chancellor Zimpher, that is exactly what we are going to do and we thank them for their leadership.\u201cLikewise, we will not rest until our K-12 system is the best in the nation. Last year we made dramatic changes. We reduced testing, we increased parental participation and empowered local districts. These reforms were essential because we saw that parents were losing faith in the system. Roughly 20 percent of our students opted out of exams and in some districts it as high as 90 percent opted out. Simply put, the education system fails without parental trust. Our goal was to restore that trust and we said we would correct the State Education Department\u2019s Common Core curriculum implementation mistakes and testing regimen. Time has shown that this was the right decision. We urge the State Education Department to do it right this time and we are all fully available to assist in and monitor in this effort.\u201cIt is also essential that our school districts have the necessary funds to do the job. I propose for this two-year cycle, $2.1 billion increase to $25 billion, the highest total spending on education in the history of the state of New York. With that funding increase I want to do two things:\u201cFirst, once and for all, let\u2019s end the Gap Elimination Adjustment. Second, let\u2019s transform every failing school in the state of New York into a community school.\u201cOur charter schools are public schools and serve some of our neediest students \u2014 more than 100,000 of them all across the state. Charters are an important option for parents in communities with failing schools and provide education laboratories. On average, charters are half the cost of public schools. They are an important component of our system and we continue to encourage their development in this budget.\u201cWe are also working to attract and keep the best public schoolteachers, many of whom work very hard under very difficult circumstances. Many teachers even go into their own pocket to pay for food and supplies for the students in their classroom. What a beautiful sign of dedication. But they shouldn\u2019t have to bear that cost. They deserve our encouragement, support and gratitude. I propose a $200 tax credit to reimburse teachers for their expenses. They more than deserve it.\u201cProtecting our environment is a top priority. The Native American proverb is true: \u2018We don\u2019t inherit the land from our parents. We are borrowing it from our children.\u2019 One of the most effective programs to make our state cleaner and greener is the Environmental Protection Fund. I propose raising the Environmental Protection Fund to the highest level in history \u2014 $300 million.\u201cWe previously set a goal that 50 percent of New York\u2019s energy must come from renewables by 2030. This year it\u2019s no longer a goal \u2014 it is now a requirement. And it makes New York the nation\u2019s leader in the fight against climate change and that\u2019s something we should all be proud of.\u201cFinally, we will eliminate all use of coal in New York State by 2020. We will help the few remaining coal plants transition but we must clean our air and protect our health and that must be our first priority.\u201cWhen it comes to public safety, we have much work to do. In addition to what is now called extreme weather and the new normal, I\u2019m sad to say that in many ways we have another new normal to confront and that is the widening threat of terrorism. San Bernardino, Calif., Rochester, N.Y. It can be Anywhere, U.S.A., at anytime. The Internet has opened a portal of hate. What was at one time largely confined to the Middle East can arrive here now with the click of a mouse. We must be diligent.\u201cI propose $40 million to fund the permanent deployment of more New York state troopers and National Guard at key target areas across the state because public safety must be our priority.\u201cThe State Police and the National Guard do an excellent job. They are out there when no one wants to be out there. They ae there when we have to rebuild after floods. They are there to keep us safe. We are blessed to have them. I ask them to stand and let\u2019s give them a sign of our appreciation.\u201cLast year I asked former N.Y.P.D. Commissioner Ray Kelly to do a security audit and tell us the best way to defend ourselves and the state\u2019s counterterrorism operations. Commissioner Ray Kelly recommends moving the state\u2019s counterterrorism operations to the New York State Police to improve intelligence sharing and reduce response time. I believe that recommendation makes sense. I\u2019m going to recommend it in this budget and I want to thank Ray Kelly very much for his service.Terrorist attacks no longer mean just airplanes and buildings. More and more, attacks include heavily armed individuals, active shooters in shopping malls, and even churches.\u201cTo ensure that our State Police have the right equipment to respond to these situations I propose $4 million to provide every on-duty uniformed state trooper with better weapons, body armor and tactical helmets. They give their all for us. They deserve our support. Let\u2019s give them the tools they need. Please rise while we take a moment to acknowledge you.\u201cWe are also joined today by New York state troopers who conducted an around-the-clock search for the escapees of Dannemora. It was a truly difficult feat in difficult terrain that went on day after day, week after week. The climax of the event was a truly heroic event, where a single trooper confronted one of the escapes and it was just that trooper, and that escapee, a stone\u2019s throw from the Canada-state border. The New York state trooper stepped up in the finest tradition of the New York State Police. His name is Sergeant Jay Cook and he is here today. We ask him to rise, and let\u2019s give him a round of applause.\u201cWashington, D.C., still can\u2019t agree on the use of intelligence information concerning terrorists when it comes to gun background checks. This gridlock is not funny and it literally endangers our safety. I believe it is reckless and irresponsible not to share information about possible terrorists who are living or operating within our borders. New Yorkers are concerned and rightfully so. New York has had a history of being a target of terrorist attacks. Don\u2019t tie one hand behind our back. Give us the access to the information because we have a right to defend ourselves.\u201cThis state\u2019s role as the progressive capital of the nation is important to me and should be important to every person in this room. Government\u2019s ability to evolve and grow is essential. Everything is changing \u2014 faster than ever before \u2014 government must progress to stay relevant, not to mention lead.\u201cHubert Humphry said, and I quote, \u2018The moral test of government is how that government treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are in the shadows of life, the sick, the needy and the disabled.\u2019\u201cThis state was one of the first in the nation to start universal pre-K in 1966, believe it or not. Over 60 percent of our communities now participate. We must work to bring that number to 100 percent in our communities. In 2013, this Legislature took the next step by expanding to full day pre-K, offering to local governments across the state including New York City. I propose $800 million in total funding so we can once again partner with our local communities and once again pay 100 percent of the cost because our children deserve the best.\u201cNew York\u2019s economy is growing to be sure. But we must also ensure that the bright sunlight of economic opportunity reaches those who have been left too long in the shadows. We already have the highest M.W.B.E. goal in the nation \u2014 30 percent \u2014 which is about $2 billion in economic opportunity for minority and women-owned businesses across the state. But our current goal only applies to our direct state contracts, not local government contracts. Compounding the omission is the fact that many local governments do not even have their own M.W.B.E. require or if they do, their goal is anemic at best. This must end now. I propose that our M.W.B.E. goals also apply to local government contracts funded by state dollars. This could triple our New York opportunity for minority- and women-owned business and it will lead the nation once again.\u201cFor all of our economic success there are still pockets of poverty that persist. The greatest feast has the most guests at the table. Our Rochester Anti-Poverty Initiative shows great promise. Deputy Leader Joe Morelle has been doing a great job and I would like to recognize him for his service. I am proposing $25 million to expand that initiative to the 10 cities in upstate New York with the highest poverty rate. Let us commit ourselves to the principle that in our great state no child should have to worry about where his or her next meal is coming from. No child should live in poverty.\u201cI was proud last year to appoint the attorney general as a special prosecutor in cases where a police officer kills an unarmed civilian. It was a national precedent. The appointment of an unbiased, qualified individual has helped restore trust in our system and it literally helped to end demonstrations in our streets. I urge you to pass a law making this reform permanent. Assemblyman Keith Wright has advocated for such a law for over a decade. It is an historic achievement and it should not be left to my executive order. Make it yours \u2014 make it permanent pass the bill. Let\u2019s all give the attorney general a round of applause for his great work.\u201cOne of our nation\u2019s greatest challenges is stopping the cycle of incarceration. This nation incarcerates more people than any industrialized nation on the globe. Over 2.2 million people are in prison in this country. We are better at building and equipping a prison cell than a classroom. We are quicker to find a 16-year-old a jail cell than a job interview and that is just wrong.\u201cNew York State is going the other way. I am proud to be the governor who has closed more prisons than any governor in the state of New York. We have the most aggressive re-entry program in the country. We have a new conditional pardon program for youthful offenders. We are working to end warehousing in prisons and moving towards educating and rehabilitating as an operating mantra for our corrections system.\u201cWe all agree that public safety is paramount. But we can also all agree that it is madness to spend over $50,000 a year for a prison cell while ignoring the wisdom of early intervention.\u201cAnd it starts from the very beginning. It starts from the classroom and let\u2019s finally recognize the past flaw in our approach to education in poor districts. Schools in poor communities not only face an educational challenge, they face many, many other burdens that other schools and other communities don\u2019t face. They face the issue of poverty. They face the issue of one-parent households. They face the issue of after-school problems, nutrition issues, crime issues, violence issues. Let\u2019s invest in the right help early on so we are not paying for problems later on.\u201cLet\u2019s make a big change. Let\u2019s make a big difference for thousands of children. Let\u2019s help thousands of children. Let\u2019s do it this year. Let\u2019s dedicate $100 million to transform every failing school in New York into a comprehensive, holistic, full-service community school and change the basic education system in this state and stop the cycle of incarceration in this state and paying for problems, rather than stopping the problems at an early age.\u201cWe must also provide an alternative to the street corner. Young minority males have an unemployment rate of over 40 percent. They need hope and opportunity, they need a light at the end of the tunnel. We pioneered a new approach that has been working for a few a years, providing job vouchers for private sector employers that provide a job and job training. It\u2019s working. Just go to the Bronx and talk to Borough President Diaz, and you can feel on the street where the unemployment rate has come down and young people have jobs and have hopes and crime is down. Let\u2019s build on that and let\u2019s invest another $55 million to provide opportunities to another 10,000 young men and women and keep them on the right course.\u201cAnd we must go further on our social, racial and economic justice agenda.\u201cEconomic anxiety for working families hangs in the air like a thick, stifling fog. This month 560,000 families live in poverty and millions of low-wage workers in this state are forced to choose between paying rent and buying food for their families.\u201cThere is an unhealthy income inequality gap that is only growing.\u201cI say lift up the poor and the working families of this state and pay a real decent wage that honors F.D.R.\u2019s original intent and promise. We can raise the minimum wage to $15 and we can show this nation what real economic justice means\u201cNow, my $15 proposal is reasonable. And it is phased in over an amount of time to allow our economy to grow and to adjust to expand the number of people participating in that success. It\u2019s only fair and it\u2019s only right \u2014 listen to this \u2014 if the minimum wage in the 70s, had been indexed to the rate of inflation you know where it would be? My proposal today at $15 an hour. What that means is that the minimum wage since the 70s has not kept pace. What that means is you\u2019ve had 45 years of economic injustice where the poor were getting poorer, while everyone else was moving up. That\u2019s not America\u2019s way because that\u2019s not fair.\u201cSome argue against this proposal. They say its government interference in the private sector economy, government interference in the private sector economy. That argument is the height of hypocrisy. Listen to this. Companies that pay the minimum wage, like a McDonald\u2019s, have full time workers who are still below the poverty level and since they are below the poverty level they still qualify for welfare and food stamps. That costs taxpayers, on average, $6,800 per worker. So McDonald\u2019s is paying $18,000 and we are paying $6,800 to subsidize that worker. It is a subsidy for McDonald\u2019s. It subsidizes their payroll by 40 percent. It is corporate welfare at its worst. I have not heard the opponents stand up and say \u2018stop the McDonalds subsidy, stop the Burger King subsidy, stop the small business subsidy!\u2019 In New York State, we spend $700 million a year subsidizing workers just to McDonald\u2019s and Burger King. $700 million a year. Explain that to your constituents. I say it\u2019s time to get out of the hamburger business, pay people a decent wage, raise it to $15, join me in the fight. It\u2019s what this state needs. We can get it done. We won\u2019t stop until we get it done. Let them defend McDonald\u2019s and the corporate subsidies to the big corporations with your money.\u201cWe also, my friends, have a true human crisis that is a litmus test for society\u2019s compassion and government\u2019s competence. There has been a recent explosion in the number of homeless people living on our streets. It is a human tragedy.\u201cNow, to me this is personal. I spent my life \u2014 starting in my 20s \u2014 working to help the homeless. Literally building shelters and running them. And it touches me deeply and I know I\u2019m not alone. New Yorkers are troubled by the homeless problem. Why? Because we are a caring, loving people.\u201cWe are joined today by Joey Resto who was in the news this week for literally giving his shirt off his back and the hat off his head to a shirtless, shivering homeless man in the subway. Let\u2019s give Joey Resto a big round of applause for being a good Samaritan. Raise your hand, Joey! Raise your hand \u2026 there he is.\u201cThis is New York. This is New York. And we are New Yorkers and we will not allow people to dwell in the gutter like garbage. It hurts all of us. You can see it on people\u2019s faces. Every time we walk by a homeless person most of us can\u2019t even bear to look, we can\u2019t bear to make eye contact. We pretend that we don\u2019t see them. Why? Because we don\u2019t want them to see us \u2013 because it diminishes us. To walk past a brother and sister, sitting on the sidewalk and doing nothing.\u201cIt\u2019s as if every time we walk by a homeless person we leave a piece of our soul on that curb. This is not who we are as a people, it\u2019s not our values as a society, it\u2019s not what we were taught, it\u2019s not how we live and it\u2019s not what we\u2019re going to do as a government. We are better than this.\u201cNow, we have made significant progress on the problem before and working together we can do it again. I believe our people will support the funding necessary to help protect and support their brothers and sisters.\u201cThat\u2019s why in this budget I propose a record $20 billion over the next five years. This proposal includes $10 billion for 100,000 permanent affordable units. It also includes $10 billion for 6,000 new supported beds over five years, 1,000 emergency shelter beds, and other homeless services.\u201cAnd the plan goes further. Over 15 years, we will be funding a record 20,000 supportive housing beds. And we will continue to fund 44,000 supportive units and 77,000 shelter beds. That\u2019s $28 billion over 15 years. New Yorkers have a big heart, but New Yorkers are also smart. And society\u2019s compassion must be matched with government confidence.\u201cEach jurisdiction requesting or requiring homeless assistance from the state will be asked to design a strategic plan we call the Continuum of Care, which assesses the size and needs of each sub group within the homeless population and identifies exactly what they need. We implemented this system nationwide at the department of housing and urban development, and it was a great success.\u201cIt is also well established that many of our shelters are unsanitary and unsafe. People have been attacked and victimized in some shelters and some would rather stay outside in the frigid cold than risk entering, and they are right to do it. Over this past year, the state has recorded 2,500 health and safety violations in shelters across the state. This suffering has gone on for a long time. Adding insult to injury, taxpayers fund over $1 billion for a dysfunctional statewide shelter system. It\u2019s just unacceptable.\u201cIt is imperative that we improve the conditions of the shelters and restore the public\u2019s trust in the system. We need a true independent review, inspection, and action plan from objective experts to go forward.\u201cRemember you are state officials and this is a state constitutional responsibility. The state\u2019s obligation to the needy goes beyond empty guarantees and is intended to be a social obligation. And we will honor it.\u201cWe have developed a strategy and a plan. Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli will audit shelters statewide and we thank him very much. Comptroller Scott Stringer will review and inspect the New York City shelter system and we thank him very much. Comptroller, Stringer. Buffalo Comptroller Mark Shroeder will do the same with the Buffalo shelter system. Mark Shroeder, where are you (applause)? There he is. Mark is way in the back of the room because he\u2019s on his way out. He\u2019s going to start the inspections now, as a matter of fact. To the extent these gentlemen need additional personnel, we will provide it from the state. Buffalo and New York City because those are our two largest shelter systems.\u201cThey will do on-site inspections and review operating and financial protocols.\u201cThereafter, shelters they find to be unsafe or dangerous will either immediately add local police protection \u2014 or they will be closed.\u201cShelters which they find as unsanitary or otherwise unfit will be subject to contract cancellation, operator replacement, immediate remediation or closure.\u201cIf an operator\u2019s management problem is systemic, a receiver will be appointed to run that system.\u201cThere are many qualified not-for-profits that are capable of running good operations and many of the current shelters are well run. But we need to know which are well run and which are not, and we do to do something about those that are not well run immediately. And that\u2019s exactly what this system will do.\u201cIn addition, we will require all social service districts, municipalities, social service workers, and police departments to operate in full compliance with New York State laws and regulations or they will be subject to state sanctions.\u201cWe have developed this approach in cooperation with our local partners, across the state, and we will be working with them to facilitate the three Comptroller\u2019s efforts. I want to thank all our local leaders but I especially want to thank Mayor de Blasio and Mayor Brown for their cooperation, they\u2019ve been working very hard and this is a priority for them. I believe this will improve shelter services and thereby help bring the homeless off the streets and will give the public confidence that everything that can be done is being done. It also happens to be the right thing to do.\u201cWhile we have done much in New York to be proud of, there is still a threshold issue which must be addressed. We have proven competence, and we have proven we can make government work, but recent acts have undermined the public\u2019s trust in government.\u201cPublic trust is essential for government to function at the level we need. I have a number of recommendations that will be in the budget that I believe will help restore the public trust.\u201cThe original constitutional view of a part-time legislature dates back to colonial charters and our first State Constitution in 1777. Now back then, legislators returned to their farms to tend the crops. But that doesn\u2019t happen today. Today, legislators work at law firms or business that pose real or potential conflicts. I propose we adopt the congressional system of limiting outside income for legislators. It\u2019s a proven, it\u2019s cleaner and it\u2019s more effective model that the people of this nation have confidence in, and I believe we should accept the same.\u201cFor years we have discussed and I have proposed closing the L.L.C. loophole. The time for discussion and debate has passed. It\u2019s time for action. I call on the Legislature to close the L.L.C. loophole this year. It is imperative. Pass it and I will sign it into law the very same day.\u201cIn our current campaign finance system, people without funds are virtually uncompetitive. Public campaign financing can help level the playing field, particularly for those seeking to enter. We should encourage new participation in our democracy. I will again propose public financing of campaigns. Long term, this is healthy for our democracy and healthier for our government, and you should pass it this year.\u201cSenator Valesky is right. Our lobbying law is too often circumvented. It can and should be improved. People who work to procure state contracts currently don\u2019t register as lobbyists \u2014 they should. Political consultants who advise elected officials while also representing clients before the government do not currently register as lobbyists either \u2014 and they should also. I am going to send you that bill, and that\u2019s a bill that you should sign.\u201cIt is perverse that taxpayers\u2019 money would support officials found guilty of committing a felony against the taxpayers. We must take state pensions from those convicted of a crime related to their government service. Anything else shows disrespect for the rule of law and for the taxpayer.\u201cThe Freedom of Information Law is a central component of public integrity and disclosure yet the legislature has exempted themselves. It is indefensible, especially in today\u2019s context for you to say you believe in the Freedom of Information Law and for you to sign bills reforming the Freedom of Information Law, but excluding yourself. Let\u2019s make a statement to the citizens and taxpayers of this state that you get it. If you pass a FOIL bill, include yourselves. I will sign it the very same day.\u201cIt has been 50 years since we had a constitutional convention. All too often, public opinion is not reflected in legislative action in Albany. A constitutional convention that is properly held \u2014 with independent, nonelected official delegates \u2014 could make real change and re-engage the public. We need a citizen-government relationship reboot. This is the time to do it and the constitutional convention could be the vehicle to do it.\u201cThe key to reforming our government is engaging people in the democratic process. We already know government is of the people, by the people, for the people. So why do we make it so difficult for the people to participate? Voter registration should be a presumption, not a hurdle. Let\u2019s flip the paradigm and automatically enroll voters when they get a driver\u2019s license. They can always opt out.\u201cThese ethics reforms are important. Especially considering the context of the past year.\u201cWe have to remember the people we serve, and it\u2019s our responsibility to give them the government that they deserve.\u201cAnd remember the stronger the citizen trust, the stronger the government\u2019s ability. We have a big agenda.\u201cNow my friends in closing, there are two other issues that I would like to speak to. These are the lessons that I learned the hard way but maybe an opportunity for me and the state to learn and grow. 2015 was a tough year on many levels. It was a tough year an ugly year on many levels. For me there were also personal hardships in 2015 just about this time last year, we lost my father. He was in this room many a time, he was at this podium many a time. Many of the people in this room knew him very well.\u201cHe had been failing during the holiday season and I was trying to fortify him against the indignities of bodily failure. My father was a very proud and dignified man and the end of his life was very difficult for him to handle. And I kept trying to give him reason to hang on and to fight and to motivate him and I would say, \u2018You know it\u2019s Thanksgiving, you have to be there for Thanksgiving,\u2019 and then I would say, \u2018It\u2019s my birthday in early December,\u2019 and then I say, \u2018It\u2019s Christmas, Pop, you have to be there for Christmas,\u201d and then I said, \u2018January 1st, it is my inauguration and I need you there for the inauguration.\u2019\u201cHe said, \u2018No you don\u2019t.\u2019 I said, \u2018Oh no I need you to help me write the speech,\u2019 and he said again, \u2018No you don\u2019t.\u2019 That was a losing argument. So he said, \u2018O.K. I will be here for your inauguration.\u2019 I looked him right in the eye and I said, \u2018You have to promise me.\u2019 He said, \u2018I promise you, I will be here for your inauguration.\u2019My father never in his life broke a promise to me. January 1st, the day of the inauguration, I went by his apartment to see him, went down to the Freedom Tower in Lower Manhattan, I was sworn in. We had talked about the speech before, he heard the speech over the phone back in his apartment. I then got on a plane and went to Buffalo, the lieutenant governor and I were doing a second inauguration because Kathy Hochul is from Buffalo. And I was giving the speech in Buffalo. In the back of the room I saw the State Police major take a phone call which was unusual. As I saw him starting to walk back down the main aisle of the hall, I knew at that minute exactly what had happened.\u201cLife is such a precious gift and I have kicked myself every day that I didn\u2019t spend more time with my father at that end period. I could have. I am lucky. I could have taken off work, I could have cut days in half I could have spent more time with him. It was my mistake and a mistake I blame myself for every day. But there are many people in this state who do not have the choice. A parent is dying, a child is sick, they can\u2019t take off of work.\u201cTheir employer says, if you don\u2019t come you are fire, if you don\u2019t come you don\u2019t get paid. People have children and mothers run the risk of losing their job if they stay home with their child. Out of 185 countries, the United States is one of just three that does not have paid maternity leave. The others are Suriname and Papua New Guinea. This is not where New York should be. We should have a paid leave program, paid for by employees, who can get twelve weeks of pay and Senator Jeff Klein is exactly right.\u201cAt the end of the day family matters. Intimate relationships matter and in this 24/7 world let this state make a statement of what is really important and those relationships are important. We should be there, one for another, especially in a family environment. Let\u2019s pass family leave this session.\u201cThe second issue, last March, Sandy mentioned to me she was going for a breast exam. I didn\u2019t think anything of it, Sandy was \u2014 had no family history of cancer, 48 years old so it was just a regular check up. A few days later she called me up, she was crying. What happened? She got the results from the screening and one word changed our life: cancer.\u201cAnd that started weeks and weeks and days of a torturous long road with tears and pain that I cannot even begin to articulate. Sandy was great. You know how they say you can really tell a person\u2019s mettle in tough times and when the heat is on. She got stronger, she got braver, she didn\u2019t complain, she had a double mastectomy. Went through that, was recovering at home and all she was thinking about is how do I take this experience and use the energy to help others. How do I take the negative and how do I make it a positive? I just want her to know she was such an inspiration to me because that strength and that love for community is everything we talk about. But you did it.\u201cNow since Sandy\u2019s operation, she has talked about it, word got out about it. Since her operation three women who work with me in their thirties and forties came to me and said, I heard what happened with Sandy, I went and got a screenings. Three women all three had breast cancer. And they never would have gone but if not for Sandy. I know ask women who are in the target age group, \u2018Do you go for screenings?\u2019 They say, \u2018Well it\u2019s hard, I can\u2019t, my insurance, my kids, work, family.\u2019\u201cEarly detection is the best treatment. Early detection is the best treatment. I propose $90 million to make New York where we have the most aggressive breast cancer screening operation in this country. Mobile unites that can get to women, longer hours for clinics, weekend hours for clinics. D.F.S. making sure insurance companies are willing to pay for the screening. These are our wives, our daughters, our sisters. Let\u2019s stand up and say, \u201cNew York is the place. One out of five women will suffer from breast cancer. We\u2019re going to get that number down in New York because we\u2019re going to do what we need to do to save lives because these are our women. And the best thing we can do is to save the lives of New Yorkers.\u201cIn closing, my friends, there is no doubt that this is an ambitious agenda. What else did you think I was going to give to you? But we need the agenda. Now is the moment to maximize the progress that we have made and we have made progress all across this state on every level and now is the time to double down.\u201cAlso, this nation has real problems that we haven\u2019t seen before. And with the gridlock in Washington, I\u2019m not going to rely on them to solve them. New York has a legacy of leading. We\u2019re going to have to act to protect ourselves and to protect our own people. So yes, it is an ambitious agenda, and yes, it is going to be a challenge. But I know you and I know what you\u2019re capable of and I\u2019ve seen what you can do and I have no doubt that you are going to rise to this challenge. You took a $10 billion deficit, and you made it into a $5 billion surplus. You took a Legislature that couldn\u2019t function and you did give budgets in a row. You took the worst partisanship gridlock and you came together and you put your politics aside.\u201cI believe Senator Flanagan and Assemblyman Heastie are not going to operate as Democrats and Republicans. They\u2019re not going to be partisans and they\u2019re not going to be zealots. They\u2019re going to act first as New Yorkers and do what\u2019s right for the state of New York. And I know who we are. In our DNA we are New Yorkers. There is nothing that we can\u2019t do as New Yorkers. We never say quit, we never say no. that\u2019s who made us, that\u2019s who brought us. We came from people who came from different lands. They came in little boats, they went across oceans. They didn\u2019t know where they were going, but they were going for opportunity. They were daring, they were gutsy, they were strong. That\u2019s the blood in your veins.\u201cWe\u2019re the people who survived 9/11. You knock us down, we get up twice as strong. That\u2019s who we are. And our strength \u2014 our strength is insurmountable because it is a strength rooted in our principles. That\u2019s what drives our ambition and conviction. It\u2019s our belief and it is our values. It\u2019s what we stand for. That makes us unbeatable and that\u2019s why you can\u2019t knock us down, because we\u2019re going to keep getting up, because we are New York and we are New Yorkers and we are the Empire State and what we stand for, we will never give up on. We stand for freedom. We stand for democracy. We stand for being united against terrorism. We stand for the spirit of community that says you can\u2019t discriminate against anyone in our state on the basis of race or color, or creed. We stand for unity that we are one at the end of the day.\u201cWe are upstate and we are downstate, but we are one state. We are gay and we are straight but we are one state. We are black and we are brown but we are one state. And that unity and those principles and those convictions and that honor of public service is going to rise to the surface again this year. We will meet these challenges and we will make this state a better state and we will show this nation how to lead.\u201cThey elected you to lead. Let\u2019s lead. Together. Thank you, and God bless you.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stocks Slide as Worries Persist Over Global Growth", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported byHopes for a recovery in the United States stock market were dashed on Wednesday as investors\u2019 deepening fears about the strength of the world\u2019s largest economies drove another wave of selling.The 2.5 percent slide in the market\u2019s main benchmark, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, was the worst so far this year, and came after two days of slight gains that had suggested some confidence was returning after a rocky start to the year. The index is now in what Wall Street calls a correction: a decline of 10 percent or more from its most recent high.The market decline indicates that investors still see plenty of risks lurking, many of them stemming from China\u2019s slowing economy. The persistent weakness in the price of oil is another market indicator that has raised questions about global growth.The United States economy has been showing some signs of steady growth. But investors are concerned that problems in China\u2019s economy, and the stress that creates for other countries, could unleash forces that ultimately weigh on the United States.\u201cWhen you change perceptions for the growth rate of the third-largest economic region in the world,\u201d said Jim Vogel, interest rates strategist at FTN Financial, \u201cyou have to reprice across all financial markets to account for that slowing growth.\u201dThe last time stocks slid into a correction was in August, when a small but surprising devaluation of China\u2019s currency rattled investors.Stocks rallied after the summer rout, as a recovery in Europe appeared to take hold and the Chinese currency steadied. As the year closed, most Wall Street analysts released mildly optimistic forecasts for the stock market in 2016.But it didn\u2019t take long for the fear to return.One of the headwinds that investors now face is higher interest rates in the United States. The Federal Reserve in December raised interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. Higher rates can tighten financial conditions in markets and push the dollar up against other currencies, which can in turn make it harder for United States companies to compete.Some economists, fearing that the markets are giving an early signal of a slowdown, may now call on the Fed to hold off on any further interest rate increases.And China is again unsettling investors. Figures show that capital is continuing to rush out of the country, a phenomenon that can add downward pressure to its currency, the renminbi.One of the ways that China\u2019s slowing can hurt the United State is through energy prices. As China has less demand for commodities, their prices have fallen. Oil-producing countries have continued to oversupply the markets with cheap crude.Lower oil prices lead to cheaper gasoline prices, which can prompt consumers to increase their spending on other goods and services, usually a fillip for the wider economy. But lower energy prices are hurting the United States companies that produce oil and gas.Energy stocks generally performed poorly on Wednesday. The Williams Companies tumbled 17.7 percent, while ConocoPhillips closed down more than 3 percent.Some of the fiercest selling took place in technology stocks that did extremely well in 2015. Netflix, for instance, plummeted 8.6 percent on Wednesday. Amazon declined 5.8 percent. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index ended down 3.4 percent.Stocks of consumer companies whose products or services are considered nonessential were among the hardest hit on Wednesday. Shares of the hotel chain Marriott closed down 6.3 percent, while Royal Caribbean Cruises ended down 5.3 percent.The market decline has been broad and even some of Wall Street\u2019s most successful and sophisticated investors have not been spared the downturn. William A. Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square Holdings, for example, has already lost 11.4 percent through Jan. 12In this fraught environment, investors are looking for any early clues on how the global economy is performing. They are now scouring the fourth-quarter earnings of large companies, which are starting to come out.\u201cThe low gas prices, the low commodity prices, the strength of the dollar \u2014 all three of those together are really pushing,\u201d he said.Investors will most likely listen carefully to the earnings calls of the large banks, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo included, that will report results on Thursday and Friday.Since the financial crisis of 2008, the major banks have built up buffers that help them withstand turbulent markets. But their earnings are always vulnerable if consumers and companies demand fewer loans and struggle to pay back existing ones. Senior bank executives most likely will be called upon to give their impressions of financial conditions.If the stock market continues to fall and deplete households\u2019 savings, consumers may then pull back on their spending, which can weigh on the economy. Already this year, the value of the companies in the S.&P. 500 has fallen by $1.3 trillion, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.Still, the selling may pass. Many Wall Street analysts say there are reasons a bear market \u2014 a decline of more than 20 percent from a high \u2014 will not occur. Stocks, they say, aren\u2019t wildly overvalued. Jobs growth in the United States is starting to create competition for hiring, which could push up wages, giving consumers more money to spend. Europe appears to have stabilized.But few analysts are expecting a big bounce in the stock market. Investors may now have to get used to lower returns from stocks, after several years of strong gains.\u201cWe believe this year is going to look very much like 2001, 2002,\u201d said Mark Yusko, the chief investment officer at Morgan Creek Capital Management. \u201cPeople forget the markets basically went down for 30 months and the economy slowed and eventually went into a mini-recession.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the decline in the Dow. It closed down 9.9 percent on Wednesday from its most recent high, not 10 percent or more, which would have put it in correction territory.Stanley Reed and Alexandra Stevenson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Their Boss Stays on the Sideline, but Obama Aides Tilt to Clinton", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "Supported bySo far, legacy is winning out.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s eagerness to tie herself to her old boss \u2014 most conspicuously in last Sunday\u2019s debate \u2014 has been gratifying to Mr. Obama\u2019s aides, given the tangled history between the president and his onetime rival turned lieutenant. His aides still view Mrs. Clinton as more electable and better qualified to protect his record than Mr. Sanders, though they have been impressed by the senator\u2019s recent performance and unsettled by hers.Mr. Obama has said he will not endorse a candidate during the primaries; his advisers are careful not to root publicly for anyone. But the White House is working with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign in ways large and small. Their two staffs consult on issues ranging from the campaign\u2019s use of Mr. Obama\u2019s image in advertisements to the positions she takes on his policy priorities, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, which she pushed as secretary of state and then came out against as a candidate.White House officials denied that Mr. Obama was targeting Mr. Sanders, noting that he had already shifted his position on background checks for gun buyers. The White House is sensitive to suggestions that it favors Mrs. Clinton. It does not want to alienate the young voters who are flocking to the Sanders campaign \u2014 voters who are critical for reassembling the coalition that vaulted Mr. Obama to victory.\u201cThere is no question that when it comes time, the president will be out there pounding the pavement for the nominee,\u201d said Jennifer R. Psaki, the White House communications director. \u201cBut right now his focus, publicly and privately, is not on one candidate over another; it is on engaging the American people and about reminding them what is at stake.\u201dMr. Sanders is eager to open his own channels to the White House. At a holiday party last month, Mr. Sanders told the president he wanted \u201cto drop in and chat.\u201d White House officials said they were trying to find a time for the two to sit down. \u201cWe have a very positive relationship,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in an interview on Thursday. And yet, he is not blind to the institutional advantages Mrs. Clinton has in enlisting White House support.\u201cThere are Clinton people in the White House who clearly would like to see Hillary Clinton nominated,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cI understand that, and I simply hope that they will be as fair-minded as they can be,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI take President Obama and Vice President Biden at their word, they\u2019re not going to be tipping the scales here.\u201dThe relationship between Mrs. Clinton and the White House is not without its own baggage. Her about-face on the trade deal angered Mr. Obama\u2019s aides, especially given her previous vocal support for it. Some still recall the bitterness of her campaign against Mr. Obama in 2008. The president himself reacted to the trade deal shift with resignation rather than anger, aides said, viewing it as an understandable, if opportunistic, move.The Clinton campaign is trying to smooth out future bumps by maintaining contacts at multiple levels, including high-level calls on policy between the campaign chairman, John Podesta, and the White House chief of staff, Denis R. McDonough, and routine check-in calls about public statements between the campaign\u2019s communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, and her White House counterparts, Ms. Psaki and Mr. Earnest.\u201cIf we\u2019re going to do something we think we need to give them a heads-up on, Jennifer or I will call our former colleagues and let them know,\u201d said Mr. Podesta, who was a senior Obama adviser before joining the Clinton campaign. \u201cIf we\u2019re out on the campaign trail and rolling out a new policy, building on something he\u2019s done or taking a position different than his, we\u2019ll let him know we\u2019re going to do it.\u201dMrs. Clinton meets periodically with Mr. Obama, most recently last month when he invited her to the White House for a private 90-minute lunch the day after they each delivered speeches about how to confront the terrorist threat from the Islamic State. In her remarks, Mrs. Clinton portrayed the threat posed by the militant group in darker terms than the president and reiterated her proposal to enforce a no-fly zone over northern Syria to protect civilians, a step Mr. Obama has so far resisted.History suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.Shared history makes these contacts easier: In the four years Mrs. Clinton was a member of Mr. Obama\u2019s cabinet, their staffs became friendly. She hired several of his advisers to work on her campaign, including Mr. Podesta, Ms. Palmieri and the pollster Joel Benenson. In addition, her policy adviser, Jake Sullivan, worked closely in the White House with Mr. Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser, Benjamin J. Rhodes.Mr. Obama\u2019s political director, David Simas, speaks periodically with Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, on practical issues, like the use of the president\u2019s image or voice in advertising. The two sides do not coordinate on political strategy and will not unless Mrs. Clinton becomes the nominee. In that case, they will negotiate a list of appearances by Mr. Obama on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s behalf (which would be true for Mr. Sanders as well).In any event, White House aides said, promoting Mr. Obama\u2019s agenda takes precedence over catering to the political interests of Mrs. Clinton or any other candidate. The president, for example, will continue to push for a congressional vote on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, even though Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders both oppose the deal.\u201cWe\u2019ve got 365 days left to go,\u201d Mr. Simas said. \u201cThe sense of urgency to get as much done in that period of time is great. As a general proposition, the things we want to get done, 95 percent to 99 percent of the time, are the types of things that Democrats across the board support. So the president is going to do what the president is going to do.\u201dThese days, neither candidate is likely to complain. In the interview on Thursday, Mr. Sanders, whose rationale as a presidential candidate is based in part on being a more liberal correction to Mr. Obama, said Mr. Obama had a great sense of humor (\u201che is a very, very funny guy\u201d) and a sharp intellect (\u201cone of the smartest guys, smartest people ever to be president\u201d).Mrs. Clinton, for her part, has weaved a stout defense of Mr. Obama into her stump speech. \u201cI don\u2019t think President Obama gets the credit he deserves for saving the American economy,\u201d she says to rousing applause from New Hampshire to Nevada.Mark Landler and Jason Horowitz reported from Washington, and Amy Chozick from Des Moines.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rouhani Goes Shopping in Europe as Iran Enjoys New Economic Freedoms", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byWith the lifting of sanctions after its nuclear deal with the West, Tehran has gone shopping this week, bringing its checkbook and a long list of items it had been unable to acquire for years, like jetliners and European cars, and pharmaceuticals and metals.Despite lingering animosities and the United States\u2019 designation of Iran as a sponsor of terrorist groups, European governments and corporations have made it clear that economic opportunity is going to trump concerns over human rights, security and politics for now.So far, the courtship has worked swimmingly, as Italian and French business leaders have barely been able to sign the contracts fast enough. By the end of Thursday morning, less than 24 hours into Mr. Rouhani\u2019s visit to France, the carmaker Peugeot Citro\u00ebn had signed a deal worth 400 million euros, about $438 million, with the Iranian carmaker Khodro. The oil company Total said it would sign a deal for 150,000 to 200,000 barrels a day. Airbus will sell 118 planes to the Iranians.Even as analysts warn that the Iranian market may not be as easy to access as many hope, and that it may not be the answer that Europe desires to its economic downturn, the allure is proving nearly irresistible.Mr. Rouhani represents one-stop shopping by himself: The Iranian government controls 80 percent of the country\u2019s economy. And with Iran\u2019s population of around 80 million, much of it young and eager to spend after years of cheap Chinese goods, Western companies cannot get there fast enough.As Prime Minister Manuel Valls said Thursday, \u201cFrance is available for Iran.\u201d France, he said \u2014 with Mr. Rouhani at his side at a meeting of the employer\u2019s federation \u2014 is \u201cready to mobilize its companies, its engineers and its technicians, its numerous resources, to contribute to the modernization of your country.\u201dLater, when Mr. Hollande received Mr. Rouhani, the French leader was noticeably unsmiling after a day marked by human rights protests against the Iranian president here. About 20 agreements were signed in the presence of the two presidents, such as pledges to cooperate in health and agriculture, and deals for planes, construction work and pharmaceuticals.Mr. Hollande said Syria had been discussed \u2014 Iran\u2019s support for President Bashar al-Assad has been unwavering, while France insists he must go. \u201cWe spoke of everything,\u201d Mr. Hollande said. \u201cI recalled the attachment of France to human rights,\u201d he added, as Mr. Rouhani looked on grimly.Beyond the money, Mr. Rouhani\u2019s European visit has important political and symbolic overtones, experts said.Signing deals and meeting with Western politicians reinforce his own moderate faction in the face of powerful conservative elements in Iran \u2014 mostly because it shows the president taking an active role to turn around his country\u2019s troubled economy.\u201cThe logic of Rouhani, to get out of this difficult situation, is the normalization of Iran\u2019s economic relations with the world,\u201d said Fereydoun Khavand, a professor of economics at L\u2019Universit\u00e9 Paris Descartes. \u201cHe is supported by the middle classes, the urban population.\u201dMr. Rouhani and the 11-odd ministers accompanying him on the state visit to Europe represent the moderate faction, \u201cand they want to open up and go to the world, to assure the integration of Iran in the global economy,\u201d Mr. Khavand added.Mr. Rouhani\u2019s trip is a calculated gamble against the conservative elements \u2014 that he has the popular will on his side, analysts said.\u201cHis opponents say, \u2018you\u2019ve weakened Iran with the nuclear deal,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Thierry Coville, an Iran specialist at the Institut de Relations Internationales et Strategiques, a think tank. \u201cAnd he says, \u2018My politics of normalization reinforces the role of Iran in the world.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s telling the Iranian population that \u2018we are being taken seriously,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Coville said. \u201cAnd I think the population is receptive.\u201dTo be sure, Mr. Rouhani\u2019s moderation is relative, and several substantial protests against his visit were mounted in Paris on Thursday. A half-dressed woman harnessed herself by rope to a bridge as a reminder that Iran discriminates against women and is a leader in executions by hanging \u2014 carrying out at least 830 for last year by Nov. 1, according to Human Rights Watch.Another rally focused on repression and political prisoners in Iran, where, according to Human Rights Watch, scores of people are held for their affiliation with banned opposition parties, and journalists and bloggers are routinely jailed.The French and Italian businessmen who greeted Mr. Rouhani this week were all smiles, nonetheless, and the politicians who shepherded them were scarcely less benevolent.France also maintains excellent relations with Iran\u2019s archrival Saudi Arabia, itself a leader in human rights violations. Mr. Rouhani for his part appeared pleased with his reception, hailing \u201ca new relationship\u201d with France and saying he wanted to \u201cturn the page.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Labor Department Clarifies Employment Guidelines", "Date": "2016-01-20", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Labor Department on Wednesday waded deeper into the contentious issue of joint employment, seeking to clarify who is accountable for violations of employment laws when two different entities, like a manufacturer and a staffing agency, both have ties to the same worker.\u201cI think there are misconceptions that are out there in the business community, both intentional and unintentional, about what really are their responsibilities,\u201d David Weil, the administrator of the Labor Department\u2019s wage and hour division, said in an interview. \u201cAs many of these industries become more complex, some of those misconceptions have increased.\u201dThe Labor Department, through Mr. Weil\u2019s division, is charged with enforcing the federal employment laws that grant minimum wage and overtime protections. The guidance details, in effect, when a company can be held liable for violations on the part of a contractor or staffing agency it hires or a franchisee it has a relationship with. In some cases the joint employer determination is critical for recovering unpaid wages because the contractor is a shell company with few resources of its own.\u201cWhen you\u2019re crafting an administrator\u2019s interpretation, you don\u2019t craft it for a life span of the next year,\u201d Dr. Weil said. \u201cIt\u2019s an enduring document. It has legs beyond next January.\u201dOne critical source of confusion on the issue is the difference between the joint employer doctrine as it relates to workers\u2019 rights to organize, which are protected by the National Labor Relations Board, and the doctrine as it relates to minimum wage and overtime protections, which the Labor Department is responsible for enforcing.In labor organizing, which applies in the McDonald\u2019s case, the main question is whether the parent company exercises control, directly or indirectly, over employees at another company like a franchise or contractor. For example, if the parent company effectively supervises employees of a franchisee, or can effectively hire and fire them, that is typically a strong indication of joint employment.By contrast, the Labor Department relies on a substantially broader doctrine to determine joint employment when it enforces the laws that grant minimum wage and overtime protections, having to do with the underlying \u201ceconomic realities\u201d of the situation.Under that doctrine, an upstream company can be considered a joint employer of another company\u2019s workers even if it doesn\u2019t exert direct or indirect control over them. If the upstream company handles payroll and provides facilities, equipment and transportation for workers of a contractor that it hires, for example, and if the workers are easily replaceable, this might warrant considering it a joint employer, even if it doesn\u2019t supervise the workers or hire and fire them.According to the guidance, quoting a federal circuit court opinion, \u201ccourts have found economic dependence under a multitude of circumstances where the alleged employer exercised little or no control or supervision over the putative employees.\u201dUnlike a law or a formal regulation, Dr. Weil\u2019s guidance does not receive deference in courts, which are free to disregard it. But Michael C. Harper, an expert on employment and labor law at Boston University School of Law, pointed out that such guidance could influence actions by employers, often under the influence of management lawyers urging clients to take pre-emptive action.Conversely, plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers may find the interpretation helpful when litigating cases. \u201cYou have a document you can present in court,\u201d said Benjamin I. Sachs, a professor of labor and employment law at Harvard Law School. \u201cYou can say the administrator of the wage and hour division sees it this way.\u201dMr. Harper warned, however, that the guidance risked creating confusion around some of the same issues it was written to clarify. He suggested that \u201ceconomic dependence\u201d was itself a vague concept. \u201cIf I operate a hamburger joint across from a big manufacturing plant, I\u2019m dependent on that plant,\u201d he said, \u201cbut my employees are not employees of that plant.\u201dMr. Harper said that as a policy matter he preferred applying the joint employment concept in a way that focused on the capitalization of the downstream company. Under that approach, if the contractor or franchisee runs a fly-by-night operation with little or no capital, then the upstream company should be pursued as a joint employer, he argued. If the contractor or franchisee has capital and can afford to pay back wages, then it would generally be the one the department pursues.Before his Labor Department appointment, Dr. Weil brought attention to what he has termed the \u201cfissuring\u201d of the workplace, thanks to the rise of more arm\u2019s-length employment relationships. Some critics of the new guidance say it unfairly impugns the motives of employers.\u201cI think there\u2019s an unfortunate suggestion that these relationships are structured to deny a fair day\u2019s pay for a fair day\u2019s work,\u201d said Marshall B. Babson, a Democratic lawyer appointed to the National Labor Relations Board by President Ronald Reagan who now represents employers in labor cases. He said that if someone worked for a staffing agency and was not paid properly, then the staffing agency should be liable for the violation.Asked about responses in this vein from the business community, Dr. Weil said that he viewed his guidance on this and other issues as \u201cteachable moments\u201d that would benefit workers and their employers by making enforcement action less necessary.\u201cI fully plan to speak to a lot of business groups in the next few months,\u201d he said. \u201cI want people to understand what we\u2019re doing, why we\u2019re doing it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Puerto Rico Proposes Plan to Delay Its Debt Payments to Free Up Cash", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Supported byPuerto Rican officials, meeting with creditors on Friday, proposed a broad debt exchange program meant to ease the island\u2019s painful cash crisis by slowing down the payments it owes on its $72 billion debt.But as much as the plan had a financial purpose, it also had a political one: It was intended at least in part to help persuade skeptical members of Congress that the island\u2019s government was working in good faith to resolve its financial crisis and deserved Washington\u2019s help.Puerto Rico, which has already defaulted on some bonds, has large bond payments due this spring \u2014 payments it says it will not be able to meet without a reprieve from bondholders and some assistance from Washington, ideally in the form of access to bankruptcy court that the island, as a United States commonwealth, does not now have. Congress has been weighing that possibility, along with other forms of assistance, but Republicans, in particular, have been unenthusiastic, fearing that the island has not put itself on a secure financial footing that would help it avoid a similar financial crisis in the future.The plan announced Friday is the island\u2019s response to those concerns.In a statement released Friday evening, the group of island officials working on the plan said it had held six meetings with various groups of creditors throughout the day, \u201crepresenting the holders of all of the major tax-supported credits.\u201dExpressing hope that a deal could be reached, the statement said: \u201cWe believe the proposal we presented is fair, balanced and reflective of the commonwealth\u2019s actual capacity to pay our creditors over the long term.\u201dIt was unclear Friday afternoon whether creditors were tempted by the offer. They had signed confidentiality agreements before being permitted to hear the details. The deal would most likely help some creditors, whose bonds could be worthless if the island defaults on them. But it might be less attractive to those whose bonds would have priority in a legal fight \u2014 the kind of fight that Puerto Rico would have a better chance of winning in bankruptcy.The delay would give Puerto Rico\u2019s government adequate cash to keep providing essential services while it takes promised steps to restore economic growth. The first class of new bonds would not begin repaying principal for five years, and would by then pay investors 5 percent interest \u2014 a relatively low rate that is intended to reflect the higher security of the new bonds.The second class of new bonds would not begin to repay principal for 10 years. And it would pay interest according to how well the island\u2019s economy responds to the government\u2019s economic reform measures, according to a person with knowledge of the proposal who confirmed the general terms but was not authorized to speak publicly about them because of confidentiality rules.\u201cYour second bond is dependent on future events occurring,\u201d this person said. \u201cIf there is great prosperity and economic growth, then maybe you\u2019ll get paid back.\u201dPuerto Rico proposed to distribute the two classes of bonds according to the existing hierarchy of its creditors. Those who now hold the island\u2019s highest priority bonds \u2014 its general obligation bonds \u2014 would get larger shares of the first class of new bonds. That would reduce their losses in the exchange. Their holdings of the second class of bonds would offer the hope of further recovering their losses if the Puerto Rican economy eventually recovers and flourishes.But the exchange would still mean a loss, even for the general-obligation bondholders, and they have been arguing that the Puerto Rican constitution entitles them to be paid first out of all available resources.The current holders of Puerto Rico\u2019s lesser-priority bonds would get relatively smaller amounts of the first class of bonds in the exchange. The island\u2019s debt involves almost 20 governmental issuers, and varied features like guarantees. In many cases the legal priorities are not clear. The bondholders are varied, with multiple conflicting interests.\u201cIt is without a doubt the most complicated financial puzzle I have ever encountered,\u201d the person with knowledge of the proposal said. \u201cThis is chaos. A process has begun, but every professional person associated with this process knows that it cannot happen fairly without restructuring authority being granted by the Congress of the United States.\u201dPuerto Rico is legally excluded from filing for relief under Chapter 9 of the bankruptcy code, the one that insolvent cities, counties and other municipal governments use to adjust their debts. On Tuesday, a subcommittee of the House Natural Resources Committee is scheduled to consider how some form of bankruptcy might work for Puerto Rico, in tandem with a federal oversight board.Advertisement"}

Ms. Hu initially ignored the message, but after a production deal in China fell apart, she agreed to talk. With her and Ms. Yan\u2019s blessing, the company took over nearly all aspects of the project, including the manufacturing, shipping and customer service.\u201cOne of our priorities is to expand our innovation pipeline,\u201d said Thomas M. Via, Brookstone\u2019s chief executive. \u201cCrowdfunding seemed to be a natural place for us to go.

The Opal ice maker, FirstBuild\u2019s second crowdfunded product, significantly exceeded its $150,000 funding target.But the backers did not just want a device to eventually arrive in their mailboxes. They wanted to feel involved in and informed about its development.\u201cThey want a personal email in their inbox every couple of weeks,\u201d Mr. Venkatakrishnan said. \u201cThat\u2019s something we\u2019re still trying to find a balance on.\u201dAs brands pile in and attach themselves to crowdfunding successes, the original backers of successful projects sometimes feel squeezed out. It is like finding that your favorite indie band has gone corporate and booked a stadium tour.For some entrepreneurs, though, going mass-market is not a risk \u2014 it is the entire goal.Fizzics, based in Newark, gave Brookstone a few months of sales exclusivity in the United States, but in March, it plans to begin selling its machine through several more national retailers. The company also sees a commercial fit for its device at any place that serves beer, like breweries and sports bars.\u201cThis is a whole new category that we\u2019re building,\u201d Mr. Petracca said. \u201cWe\u2019re working on products with lower price points, and we\u2019re working on a higher-end product that does some very unique things.\u201dHe isn\u2019t worried about big brands overrunning the crowdfunding market.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1963 and tried to tie the theme of Dr. King\u2019s speech to his economic message of ending inequality.\u201cOur job is not just to honor the life and work of Dr. King,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cThat march on Washington was for jobs and freedom.\u201dAccording to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.Mrs. Clinton, who spoke after Mr. Sanders, leaned heavily on Mr. Obama\u2019s legacy and popularity here, vowing to continue the progress he has made on health care, gun control and overhauling the criminal justice system. \u201cHe does not get the credit he deserves for saving the American economy,\u201d she said, to a roar of applause.On Sunday, Mr. Sanders, Mrs. Clinton and Martin O\u2019Malley, a former governor of Maryland who also spoke at the dinner on Saturday, will appear in Charleston in the fourth Democratic presidential debate. After the dinner, all three candidates went to an annual fish fry in downtown Charleston that was hosted by Representative James E. Clyburn.In recent weeks, Mrs. Clinton, who for months hardly mentioned her Democratic rival by name, has intensified her criticism on Mr. Sanders\u2019s record on gun control issues and his health care plan. But on the eve of the debate, the they avoided critiquing each other and instead delivered robust vows to overhaul the criminal justice system, to protect voting rights and to carry out tougher gun control measures.Mrs. Clinton praised her \u201cdistinguished rivals\u201d and said, \u201cI could really say an \u2018amen\u2019 to a lot of what they said.\u201dBoth Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton pledged to address the growing gap between rich and poor. \u201cToday in America, we have a level of wealth income inequality that is beyond grotesque,\u201d Mr. Sanders said.History suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.In her remarks, Mrs. Clinton noted, \u201cWe have to take on the deeper, systemic inequities that hold too many Americans back.\u201d Typically admiring of the president, Mrs. Clinton was on Saturday even more effusive in her praise of Mr. Obama, who remains wildly popular among black Democrats. Mr. Obama defeated Mrs. Clinton in a contentious South Carolina primary in 2008 that strained the Clintons\u2019 relationship with black voters here after former President Bill Clinton seemed to dismiss Mr. Obama\u2019s victory. She implied that the Republican presidential candidates had used coded racial language in the debate Thursday night to criticize Mr. Obama and Americans who rely on government assistance.\u201cWhat I really find so appalling,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, \u201cIs the insulting, meanspirited, derogatory language that is used \u2014 starting first and foremost against our president,\u201d drawing hums of \u201camen\u201d from the crowd.Mrs. Clinton reminded the crowd that Republicans frequently tried to link her policies to those of Mr. Obama\u2019s. \u201cNow, I personally consider that a great compliment,\u201d she said.Mrs. Clinton received a standing ovation later on Saturday night when she delivered brief remarks to a crowd assembled for the casual fish fry held at an outdoor pavilion in downtown Charleston. \u201cHe saved the auto industry, he signed the toughest new rules on Wall Street since the Great Depression,\u201d she said of Mr. Obama after she gave Mr. Clyburn a long hug.

{"Headline": "How China Lost Taiwan", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorTAIPEI, Taiwan \u2014 On a drizzly Tuesday night earlier this month, Chen Li-hung, a celebrity news television host, strode onto a stage in Changhua, in central Taiwan, and launched into a passionate speech, feeding red meat to his Democratic Progressive Party\u2019s assembled faithful.\u201cMy parents are from mainland China,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cYet I was born in Taiwan. I grew up in Taiwan. So why did the teachers in school tell me I am still Chinese? Since my youth, I have felt that I am not Chinese, I am Taiwanese!\u201d He ripped into the incumbent president, Ma Ying-jeou. \u201cEight years ago, President Ma won himself a pretty nice electoral victory, but he is walking us closer and closer to China, and has Taiwan gotten any better?\u201dFor hours, speakers like Mr. Chen raised the crowd to a fever pitch. Then Tsai Ing-wen, the party\u2019s presidential nominee, arrived to cool them down.Ms. Tsai, a former law professor and trade negotiator, let her surrogates fire up the base during the election campaign that ended on Jan. 16 in victory for her and her party. She knew that if voters detected too much populism, they would have turned on her. And she realized that Beijing and Washington watch her words closely.The range in performances between Mr. Chen and Ms. Tsai helps explain the Democratic Progressive Party\u2019s crushing margin of victory two weeks ago over Mr. Ma\u2019s Kuomintang party, which lost both the presidency and, for the first time, Parliament. The rally highlighted why, with this election, China has lost Taiwan for good.When the Kuomintang was defeated in a civil war by Mao\u2019s Communists in 1949, its leadership retreated to Taiwan with millions of mainlander refugees like Mr. Chen\u2019s parents, establishing an independent authoritarian government that gave way to democracy in the 1990s. Since 1949, Beijing has claimed Taiwan as a wayward province that must be reunited with the mainland, peacefully if possible but by force if necessary. The United States is Taiwan\u2019s security guarantor, but also wishes to avoid offending Beijing and has been unsympathetic to Taiwanese leaders who rock the boat. Taiwan\u2019s voters punish candidates who needlessly provoke China, or alienate Washington.Beijing has pursued a decades-long strategy of patience and economic courtship, hoping that Taiwan would peacefully rejoin the mainland. And the Taiwanese do want stable, functional ties with China. Polls show most Taiwanese favor the status quo of de facto independence, without any official declaration that would enrage Beijing and possibly provoke an invasion.But with the mainland\u2019s economic miracle running aground, many Taiwanese are questioning the wisdom of lashing themselves to the mast. The Taiwanese worry that Mr. Ma\u2019s rapprochement with Beijing has gotten too close, without enough trickle-down benefits to average Taiwanese. A free-trade bill that would have opened sensitive industries, such as media, to mainland Chinese ownership, stalled in Parliament in 2014 amid student protests, which became known as the Sunflower Movement.Meanwhile, the Taiwanese see an increasingly repressive mainland government across the strait \u2014 and want no part of it. President Xi Jinping\u2019s crackdown on dissent and nationalist appeals to the glory of Chinese culture are uncomfortable reminders of Taiwan\u2019s own experiences under martial law.But it was the sentiment expressed by Mr. Chen during the rally that suggests why, unless Beijing resorts to force, the China-Taiwan divorce could be permanent. Polls show that the generation of islanders who identify as \u201cChinese\u201d is fading, and more people are identifying themselves as \u201cTaiwanese.\u201d Decades of de facto independence have whetted Taiwanese appetites for the real thing. Polls show most Taiwanese are unwilling to rejoin even a democratic China.These feelings will deepen as a younger generation of Taiwanese finds its political voice. Indigenous identity and attachment to liberal civic values are strongest among the increasingly assertive youth, whose Sunflower Movement spawned the New Power Party, which in coalition with Ms. Tsai\u2019s Democratic Progressive Party toppled several Kuomintang incumbents in the election.Still, while Taiwanese may increasingly identify with a unique local culture \u2014 and the passion of someone like Mr. Chen \u2014 for now they prefer Ms. Tsai\u2019s more measured public persona. A cerebral technocrat, she is different from the earthier elders in her party, some of whom started their political careers in Kuomintang prisons.Even as Ms. Tsai\u2019s surrogates played the identity card, her campaign stressed economic competence and promised no formal independence, a position meant to avoid offending Beijing and Washington. Yet Ms. Tsai\u2019s party platform still advocates independence, and her victory will give her power to entrench Taiwan\u2019s separateness with subtle policy tweaks.The Pacific Rim\u2019s shifting politics may tilt Washington\u2019s calculus as well. Since the Nixon administration, Washington has prioritized a realpolitik relationship with Beijing over any attachment to Taiwan. America\u2019s current stance toward China\u2019s claims on Taiwan is implicit acquiescence. But Beijing\u2019s growing assertiveness along its periphery has raised alarms for American allies in Tokyo, Seoul and Manila, all of whom are watching to see how China tests America\u2019s defense commitments to Taiwan.Ms. Tsai will not miss chances to remind Washington of the importance of that alliance. Her party intends to use its parliamentary majority to navigate Taiwan into the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an agreement that will hedge the island\u2019s economy away from China and bind it more closely to America and its regional allies.As Mr. Chen finished his stemwinder, the finale of Beethoven\u2019s Fifth Symphony blasted over the speakers. \u201cProtect our way of life, uphold our character ... come out to vote!\u201d he implored. \u201cLet\u2019s give the Democratic Progressive Party a powerful start to its time in office!\u201dTaiwan\u2019s voters have done just that, pushing Beijing\u2019s dream of reunification even further from reach.Nick Frisch is an Asian studies doctoral student at Yale\u2019s graduate school and a resident fellow at Yale Law School.Advertisement"}

Tell us how you teach it. ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS: Tackle Shakespeare With Yoda, You WillIn \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Empire Strikes Back,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yoda admonishes his apprentice, Luke Skywalker, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWars not make one great.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Later, in \u00e2\u0080\u009cReturn of the Jedi,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he quips, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen 900 years old you reach, look as good you will not.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In case you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t catch on, Yoda inverts his syntax. In other words, Yoda practically speaks Shakespearean.Taking inspiration from Yoda and Mr. Doescher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mash-ups, students can try \u201cShakespearifying\u201d scenes from the \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise \u2014 or from other popular films or TV shows.HISTORY: Finding Echoes of the Past in FictionThe events in \u00e2\u0080\u009cStar Wars,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the opening credits reveal, happened \u00e2\u0080\u009ca long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But did similar events happen before?That is the question posed by \u00e2\u0080\u009cStar Wars and History.\u201dBut, even without knowing or trying to guess Mr. Lucas\u2019s inspiration, students can apply their knowledge of history to make connections between the fictional universe in \u201cStar Wars\u201d and actual past events. SCIENCE: The Physics of Space BattlesShoer, a Ph.D. candidate in aerospace engineering, says any real space battles would likely have \u00e2\u0080\u0094 yawn \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u009crelatively long periods during which Newtonian physics govern the motions of dogfighting spacecraft, punctuated by relatively short periods of maneuvering.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because spacecraft typically are sharply curtailed by the realities of propulsion and orbit dynamics \u00e2\u0080\u0093 \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot just of their own ships in orbit around planets and suns, but those planets\u00e2\u0080\u0099 orbits.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Of course, special effects in movies are designed to be dramatic. But to what extent do they defy physics?Have students watch almost any battle scene in \u201cStar Wars\u201d and consider: Are the laws of physics being bent or ignored? How might reality differ from the fantasy depicted?MATH: Creating Fractal IslandsTo incorporate math into this activity, students can generate fractal islands to represent a planet\u2019s continents \u2014 a hands-on activity adapted from Dr. Chartier\u2019s book \u201cMath Bytes: Google Bombs, Chocolate-Covered Pi, and Other Cool Bits in Computing.\u201d  Students can make these continents by hand using a pencil, paper and two dice. (We will assume one die is red and the other blue, although you could just roll twice.)  To start, begin with a square. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s endpoints are at (0,0), (0,16), (16,0) and (16,16). Now, follow these steps, for each of the four line segments:Here are different shapes generated by this activity:Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t imagine these shapes appearing as masses of land on distant planets? To add sophistication to the end product, students can use a computer.  As they iterate, students are creating a fractal island \u2014 or a newly revealed continent on a distant planet in a galaxy far, far away. ECONOMICS: The Death Star, Too Big to Fail?At the end of \u00e2\u0080\u009cStar Wars: Episode VI \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Return of the Jedi,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the heroic Rebel Alliance defeats the evil Galactic Empire, destroying the second Death Star, the empire\u00e2\u0080\u0099s central space station (and superweapon). Audiences typically respond to the destruction of the Death Star with triumphant cheers.But over the years, a number of perhaps more reflective fans have paused to question the consequences of this event. In his movie \u00e2\u0080\u009cClerks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d for example, the writer and director Kevin Smith has his protagonists debate the ethics of destroying the second Death Star, whose construction was still underway, given the collateral damage to the contractors (\u00e2\u0080\u009cplumbers, aluminum siders, roofers\u00e2\u0080\u009d) building it.As a financial engineer, I have another concern: the economic repercussions for the \u00e2\u0080\u009cStar Wars\u00e2\u0080\u009d galaxy. In a recent working paper, I brought the analysis of financial systemic risk to bear on this question. I found that the resulting financial crisis would cause a serious galactic depression of astronomical proportions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 so large, in fact, that it suggests the rebel victory might have been a pyrrhic one.Students can read through Dr. Feinstein\u2019s economic analysis and offer their critique. Do they accept his assumptions? Does his conclusion make sense? And, does his \u201cStar Wars\u201d investigation help to make the case for continuing to study how to model financial contagion and measure systemic risk?ART: Take a Selfie, Create a New \u201cStar Wars\u201d CharacterStudents might be surprised to learn that the character Yoda was essentially modeled after its creator\u2019s own face. Stuart Freeborn built his reputation by staring deep into the faces of others, defining their best features and digging into his makeup kit to make sure everyone else noticed them, too. He learned how to accentuate a cheekbone from none other than Marlene Dietrich. The arch in Vivien Leigh\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyebrow owed some of its impish charm to him. But decades into his career, when George Lucas asked him to create a centuries-old Jedi master, Freeborn took a long look at a face that he had never considered with much professional interest: His own. The character of Yoda would become a fun-house distortion of Freeborn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own reflection.The article continues:In the mirror, Freeborn could examine the contours of the crown of his skull, fully exposed by a hairline that completed a retreat years before. Freeborn etched deep wrinkles into Yoda\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bald scalp that were exaggerated replicas of the lines that creased his own forehead when, for example, he zeroed in on the tight-focus particulars of Yoda\u00e2\u0080\u0099s physiognomy. The pointed chin, the compact nose and the thin, pursed lips all made the leap from the mirror to the model. The only feature he borrowed from someone else was the upper lip: It was a hairless version of Albert Einstein\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, Freeborn said. He hoped that it might trigger a subconscious association and that viewers might intuit Yoda\u00e2\u0080\u0099s extraordinary intelligence.Inspired by Mr. Freeborn\u2019s creation, students can design their own \u201cfun-house distortion\u201d of their reflection or selfie. Together, the class can assemble a new cast of characters for the not-yet-released \u201cStar Wars\u201d films.JOURNALISM: \u201cStar Wars\u201d in The New York TimesHere are but a few.

He was raised on a farm and began his education in a one-room schoolhouse.He is survived by his wife, the former Christine Holmes; their children, Andrew and Allison Bosworth and Stacey and William Rutledge; 10 grandchildren; and his brothers, Barry and Brian Bosworth.After graduating from Dartmouth College in 1961 (he was later chairman of its board of trustees), Mr. Bosworth entered the Foreign Service instead of going to law school because, he recalled years later, \u201cI was broke.\u201d By the time he was 38, he was a full-fledged ambassador, among the youngest ever.He served as the envoy to Tunisia from 1979 to 1981, chairman of the State Department\u2019s Policy Planning Council and ambassador to the Philippines from 1984 to 1987 \u2014 a tumultuous period that followed the assassination of Benigno Aquino, Mrs. Aquino\u2019s husband, at the Manila airport in 1983 as he returned from exile in the United States to challenge Mr. Marcos.Mr. Bosworth later directed the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, a multinational consortium formed in the mid-1990s to provide energy to North Korea in exchange for guarantees that it would dismantle nuclear reactors that might be used to produce weapons. He was ambassador to South Korea from 1997 to 2001 and special representative for North Korea from 2009 to 2011.Fluent in Spanish, Mr. Bosworth was also well versed in economics, which he maintained was as important as the political and military aspects of diplomacy.\u201cThere has always been a feeling in the State Department and Foreign Service,\u201d he told The New York Times in 1998, \u201cthat economics officers were not quite the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me, that what you really wanted to be was a political officer carrying diplomatic notes to the Foreign Ministry and making d\u00e9marches.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "London Lost and Found", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Supported byOpinion7 PhotosLONDON \u2014 I LEFT London and moved to India in August 2008. Four weeks later, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, and the global economy went into a tailspin. People who had known the word \u201cderivative\u201d only as an adjective in book reviews were now using it as a noun; \u201csubprime\u201d entered the vocabulary of the uninitiated. The City of London seemed to be at the heart of this disaster whose effects were surging out over the cobbled streets of the Square Mile and into the farthest corners of the world, including my new home in the small southern Indian city Mysore.Since then I have returned to London once or twice a year, emerging from the sliding doors at Heathrow with a feeling of evermore imprecise familiarity. What exactly happens when you leave a city and then return year after year, still not prepared to call yourself an ex but increasingly bewildered, like a tourist?Some of the changes I can see only as benign. As I walk around the city, I look up rather than straight ahead. Sights I\u2019d never glimpsed before crowd into view: the strange crenelations at the top of a wall behind Guy\u2019s Hospital, the branches of a bowed lime tree in St. Paul\u2019s churchyard, an elegant hand holding a cigarette out of a top-floor window in Arlington Square. It seems absurd to admit that in the whirl of daily life I missed so many small particularities of the place I called home for over 13 years. And yet I did.When I now visit London, I adopt new lines of inquiry. While I lived in the city, it never occurred to me that I might be interested in the history of some of its striking street names: Birdcage Walk, Bleeding Heart Yard, Hanging Sword Alley, Cold Blow Lane. Now, after years of absence, I can\u2019t stop imagining the scenes behind the names: the Royal Aviary, say, or the beating heart ripped out of a body in a sunless passage.In some respects I have not changed: Making eye contact with other passengers on the Tube still is repugnant. But I no longer hiss and tut at people who stand to the left on escalators. When a group of tourists on Regent Street suddenly stop to rummage in their rucksacks and force me to slacken my pace, I do not fill up with a murderous rage. A lady in the line at the bank strikes up a conversation, and I do not recoil. Rather than doing everything possible to avoid Leicester Square, I now amble across it, even pausing in front of one of the souvenir shops. Briefly.Yet some aspects of my transformation are more than a little disquieting. One evening I find myself in Soho at a junction that I must have crossed a thousand times over the years. Suddenly my journey turns into a series of stop-motion frames. I step off the pavement. I step back on to it. I look in every direction, at the street names, at the awning over a restaurant, at a sign above a theater\u2019s stage door. There is a remembered flash of neon and a suggestion of a well-worn shortcut down an alley. But then my mind goes blank, and I realize I no longer know which road to take.Readers sent photos from all around the world of a place they once overlooked, but now treasure.In his essay \u201cLondon,\u201d Henry James writes, \u201cIt is a kind of humiliation in a great city not to know where you are going.\u201d But how much more humiliating when it\u2019s a city that you once roamed, sometimes in a frenzied rush, sometimes in a slow haze, but almost always with a sense of possession.The wallet dropped on a street corner, the elderly man bursting into his rendition of \u201cForever and Ever\u201d on that snowy stairway, the date that ended badly in front of the convenience store. The memories remain, but the landmarks are lost. Where does this imprinted knowledge go? And what do you do with the slow sense of panic that results? Suspended somewhere in a fade to black is the realization that you are incrementally losing the city where you spent most of your adult life.Most jarring, I\u2019ve lost my old relationship with the map of the Tube. Its lineations, loops and hard angles had always seemed to provide as recognizable a connection as the grooves on my palms. The progression of stations, the interchanges, the locus of destinations \u2014 none of these required thought: I had internalized them. But on my last visit, as commuters surged around me at Westminster station, I could no longer quite remember what \u201ceastbound\u201d meant, and as I stood in front of the giant map in the ticket hall for a few seconds, the lights seemed to dim.In \u201cThe Lonely Londoners,\u201d Sam Selvon\u2019s seminal novel about post-World War II immigration to the city, London is harsh and elusive, a place that simultaneously delivers a feeling of propinquity and a feeling of dislocation to men recently arrived from the West Indies. Some of the novel\u2019s descriptions could just as well apply to London as experienced by a former resident: \u201cwith a fog sleeping restlessly over the city and the lights showing in a blur as if it is not London at all but some strange place on another planet.\u201d Mr. Selvon\u2019s Londoners mark urban boundaries through their sense of security, community and language \u2014 \u201cthe Gate\u201d for Notting Hill, \u201cthe Arch\u201d for Marble Arch, \u201cthe Water\u201d for Bayswater. We all create our own personal geography to help explain who we are, where we\u2019ve come from and why. What happens when those coordinates come unmoored?The refectory-style restaurant near the Barbican, where once the helpings were enormous and the air was filled with the scent of stewed cabbage, is now a smart dining club with a giant stone urn on each side of the door. As I pressed my nose against its plate-glass window, small personal changes seemed all too evident \u2014 the haunts that have disappeared, the friends who have moved away. But in the amber corona of the new pendant lights I perceived larger changes, too: neighborhoods that have been cored out, the proliferation of food banks and the homeless, the elderly and the disabled marooned at home.On my last day in London I received an old gas bill that had been redirected twice and was paid several years ago. The postal code was legible, but most of the rest was a dark blue smudge.There will be new maps and compasses for those of us who leave, new points of departure that will eventually become wholly real. But at the end of my most recent visit, as I flew out of Heathrow, over the tower blocks and the discs of green parkland and the sweep of the motorway, I caught a glimpse of a bend in the Thames, so familiar and so alien, and I wondered if it had all been a trick of the light.Mahesh Rao is the author of \u201cThe Smoke Is Rising\u201d and \u201cOne Point Two Billion.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oil Prices Decline More Than 5 Percent as Stockpiles Increase ", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byThe Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, the main benchmark for the United States stock market, declined 1.3 percent Wednesday and breached the psychologically important 2,000 level to close at 1,990.26.Among the steepest declines, though, were shares of some independent oil and gas companies, including Apache and Southwestern Energy, which declined by more than 10 percent.Oil prices plunged despite reports that terrorists affiliated with the Islamic State had attacked oil storage facilities in two major Libyan ports, setting fire to seven tanks. The continuing sabotage of the Libyan oil industry was another blow to the prospects that Libya, North Africa\u2019s primary oil producer, can reverse sagging exports.Adding to the uncertainty, Saudi Arabia and Iran continued their saber-rattling in the Persian Gulf, threatening a spread of hostilities in Iraq, Bahrain and other countries with deep sectarian divides.But traders shrugged off the geopolitical risks and looked to the fundamentals of supply and demand.Economic data released in China this week showed slower growth, while the Energy Department reported that gasoline stockpiles last week rose by 10.6 million barrels, the largest weekly amount since 1993, to 232 million barrels. Nationwide oil stocks climbed to a record 2.1 billion barrels, including the strategic petroleum reserve, sending the American benchmark price tumbling to just more than $34.\u201cOversupply will continue to hold down commodity prices in 2016,\u201d said Terry Marshall, a senior vice president at Moody\u2019s. \u201cOPEC and many non-OPEC oil producers continue to produce without restraint as they battle for market share. Increased production has vastly exceeded growth in oil consumption, including from major consumers like China, India and the U.S.\u201dOver the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.A new report by Moody\u2019s Investors Service projected a rise in company defaults and a decline in capital spending of 20 to 25 percent, a drop in investment nearly as large as that last year.Analysts at Moody\u2019s and other consultant firms are predicting that companies will increasingly be forced to sell assets, particularly because a growing number of them are under pressure to meet debt payments and are losing price hedges that buttressed their balance sheets in the last two years of slumping prices.\u201cMounting distress will force more companies to market,\u201d said Luke Parker, corporate analysis research director at Wood Mackenzie, a consultancy. \u201cBalance sheets will become ever more stretched without asset sales to balance the books.\u201dOil executives have been equally downbeat about 2016, especially as it compares with recent years in which producers nearly doubled output as they learned to produce in vast shale fields with hydraulic fracturing that blasted through hard rock with water, sand and chemicals.\u201cWe\u2019re in a capital-constrained world,\u201d Darrell E. Hollek, executive vice president for onshore exploration and production at Anadarko Petroleum, said in a recent interview. \u201cWe won\u2019t have the cash flow with oil and gas prices where they are.\u201dConsumers have benefited, as gas prices have continued to slide. The average price of a gallon of regular gas nationwide fell to slightly less than $2 this week, 4 cents below a month ago and 19 cents below last year, according to the AAA motor club.But the economies of oil-producing states like Texas and North Dakota are slowing. This week, Gov. Bill Walker of Alaska announced a state government hiring freeze, after proposing the state\u2019s first income tax in 35 years.Many of the factors that reduced oil prices by a third in 2015 show no signs of changing. Saudi Arabia, Russia and several other important oil suppliers are producing at record or near-record levels to sustain their income and market share in global markets, particularly China. Iran hopes to export more than 500,000 barrels a day once nuclear sanctions are lifted, probably this year.American oil producers have decommissioned more than half of their rigs, and production growth has been halted since last April when output peaked at nearly 9.6 million barrels a day. But production is not falling fast enough to balance the market.A big reason American production is so resilient is that offshore Gulf of Mexico production continues to recover from the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon disaster and subsequent federal exploration moratorium with new wells continuing to come online. Meanwhile, shale drilling continues to become more efficient.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Economy Barely Grew Last Quarter, Stoking Concerns About Momentum in 2016", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Supported byThe American economy finished the year on a flat note, much as it started 2015, stoking concern about its vulnerability in the months ahead to turmoil in China and elsewhere in the global economy.But most economists expect activity to rebound as the year unfolds and continue to grind out steady but hardly spectacular growth.Over all, the economy expanded at an annual rate of just 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015, the Commerce Department said Friday.It could have been worse: Ahead of the report, a few economists on Wall Street predicted that the economy might have contracted last quarter, while others forecast no growth.As it turned out, the slowdown was brought on by anemic sales of durable goods like cars and appliances, a weaker trade picture caused by the stronger dollar and falling business investment and shrinking inventories. But consumer spending overall was healthy, and services held up better, underscoring how domestically driven sectors are faring much better than industries that depend on overseas demand.\u201cThere is noise from quarter to quarter, but we\u2019re still in that 2.5 percent growth environment,\u201d said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman.\u201cThis year is going to look a lot like the past couple of years,\u201d said Gus Faucher, senior economist at PNC Financial Services in Pittsburgh. \u201cGrowth in 2016 will be good but not great.\u201dHe predicted that steady hiring and falling unemployment would prompt better wage gains than most Americans have seen so far in the six-and-a-half-year-old recovery.\u201cWe will see workers getting more of the benefits from economic growth in 2016,\u201d he said. \u201cTogether with rising wages, more hiring will allow consumers to continue to spend, and that will be more than enough to power through weakness from trade and the stronger dollar.\u201dWhile the muted report was not a surprise, it will most likely influence the way the Fed thinks about future rate increases, Mr. Clemons predicted.\u201cI think this takes another rate hike off the table for the first half of 2016,\u201d he said. \u201cThe continued improvement in the labor market allows the Fed to think about raising rates, but the lack of inflation means they\u2019re not required to act. They can have their cake and eat it, too.\u201dOther economists, though, are still looking for at least one rate increase during the first half of the year, possibly as early as March.Friday\u2019s report is the first of three estimates the Commerce Department will make for growth in gross domestic product, and as more data comes in, the figure could be revised. The next estimate will be released on Feb. 26.In a separate report on Friday, the University of Michigan survey of consumer confidence showed a slight drop in sentiment from the initial estimate for January, but the outlook remained healthy by historical standards.One headwind for the economy has been a slower accumulation of inventories, which reduced growth by nearly half a percentage point last quarter. After big increases in goods at warehouses and on store shelves lifted growth in the middle of the year, \u201cthere was some payback in the fourth quarter,\u201d said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS, a research and consulting firm.\u201cThat affects top-line growth but doesn\u2019t really say so much about the fundamentals of the U.S. economy,\u201d he added.Looking ahead, Mr. Behravesh expects the economy to expand at a rate of about 2.5 percent in the first half of 2016, with the unemployment rate continuing to fall and companies delivering higher pay increases to help hold on to employees and attract new workers in a tighter labor market.\u201cI think it\u2019s entirely possible we could see unemployment fall to 4.5 percent by the end of the year,\u201d he said.Still, expectations for the coming quarters have been drifting lower as weaker data for the fourth quarter of 2015 has accumulated in recent weeks.Big business has been noticeably cautious to invest, despite healthy profits in many industries. The strong dollar and weakness in Asia and Europe have hurt many manufacturers, commodity producers and other exporters, especially in the Midwest.Steel companies and other manufacturers that supply metal pipe and other equipment to drillers have felt the chill as oil prices dived below $30 a barrel this month. Crude has rebounded slightly, and the American benchmark now stands at about $34 a barrel.One explanation is that Americans are saving a substantial portion of the windfall at the gas pump or using it to pay down debt, which ultimately benefits the economy even if it represents a drag in the short term.Another possibility is that consumers remain skeptical about how long gasoline prices will stay below $2 a gallon on average, the lowest they have been since the depths of the financial crisis in late 2008.Nonetheless, consumer demand rose at a decent rate, 2.2 percent last quarter, to provide some forward motion. Government spending also helped.\u201cThere are definitely problem areas,\u201d Mr. Behravesh said, \u201cbut consumer spending, housing and the nonenergy parts of capital spending are still fairly solid.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Vast Inequality Necessary?", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byHow rich do we need the rich to be?That\u2019s not an idle question. It is, arguably, what U.S. politics are substantively about. Liberals want to raise taxes on high incomes and use the proceeds to strengthen the social safety net; conservatives want to do the reverse, claiming that tax-the-rich policies hurt everyone by reducing the incentives to create wealth.Now, recent experience has not been kind to the conservative position. President Obama pushed through a substantial rise in top tax rates, and his health care reform was the biggest expansion of the welfare state since L.B.J. Conservatives confidently predicted disaster, just as they did when Bill Clinton raised taxes on the top 1 percent. Instead, Mr. Obama has ended up presiding over the best job growth since the 1990s. Is there, however, a longer-term case in favor of vast inequality?It won\u2019t surprise you to hear that many members of the economic elite believe that there is. It also won\u2019t surprise you to learn that I disagree, that I believe that the economy can flourish with much less concentration of income and wealth at the very top. But why do I believe that?I find it helpful to think in terms of three stylized models of where extreme inequality might come from, with the real economy involving elements from all three.Third, we could have huge inequality based on power: executives at large corporations who get to set their own compensation, financial wheeler-dealers who get rich on inside information or by collecting undeserved fees from na\u00efve investors.But the real question, in any case, is whether we can redistribute some of the income currently going to the elite few to other purposes without crippling economic progress.Don\u2019t say that redistribution is inherently wrong. Even if high incomes perfectly reflected productivity, market outcomes aren\u2019t the same as moral justification. And given the reality that wealth often reflects either luck or power, there\u2019s a strong case to be made for collecting some of that wealth in taxes and using it to make society as a whole stronger, as long as it doesn\u2019t destroy the incentive to keep creating more wealth.And there\u2019s no reason to believe that it would. Historically, America achieved its most rapid growth and technological progress ever during the 1950s and 1960s, despite much higher top tax rates and much lower inequality than it has today.So coming back to my original question, no, the rich don\u2019t have to be as rich as they are. Inequality is inevitable; the vast inequality of America today isn\u2019t.Advertisement"}

The Trump campaign distributed more than 20,000 tickets to the event, sending the theater\u2019s administrators and the local police department into a frenzy on how to handle the huge overflow.Those bundled up outside just wanted to see the billionaire businessman in the flesh. Surprisingly, some were fans of both Mr. Trump and Mr.\u00c2\u00a0Sanders, the Vermont senator seeking the Democratic nomination, and were trying to decide which one to back.\u201cI think he\u2019s smart, and he has the best chance of winning support and maybe flipping the state,\u201d Daniel Nadeau, 22, of St. Albans, Vt., said of Mr. Trump. \u201cBernie is my No. 1 choice, and Trump is No. 2. They\u2019re not that different.\u201dVoters who were on the fence between the seemingly polar-opposite candidates said that both communicated well with working-class people and made strong cases for how they would boost the economy, despite their differing policy ideas.\u201cI\u2019m a Trump guy, but I do like Bernie,\u201d said Peter Vincenzo, 59, who works installing hardwood floors and traveled from Ohio for the rally. \u201cThere are a lot of parallels between these two guys.

{"Headline": "New York to Gain 30 Acres of Parkland From Catholic Nuns", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byUPPER NYACK, N.Y. \u2014 Sister Veronica Mendez adjusted her glasses and tried to remember the last time someone joined the religious order here. \u201cJoined and stayed?\u201d she pondered. \u201cIt would have been the 1970s.\u201d Sister Veronica, 73, said the order, whose members are better known as the Marydell sisters, chose to hold on to 10 acres, which include all 19 of its buildings. Among the structures are a convent, an outdoor chapel and rustic cabins used for weekend retreats and day-camp programs in summer.The order, which operates the Marydell Faith and Life Center, is selling the 30 acres to the trust for $3.1 million, an amount that Sister Veronica said was below market rate. \u201cSome people have suggested that we could get $10 million,\u201d she said matter-of-factly, as she showed off the land on a bitterly cold afternoon.The sloping property, which the order acquired in 1924, includes dense woodland and meadow stretching down to the Hudson. The sisters, who range in age from 68 to 98, believe the property is sacred and should be enjoyed by the public. \u201cWhen you see the land, you see what a gift it has been,\u201d Sister Veronica said. \u201cFor almost 100 years, it has been a summer camp and blessed by the laughter of children. It has also been blessed by people\u2019s prayers.\u201dFor the trust, which began discussions with the order more than a decade ago, the deal has involved pulling together several financing sources.The Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation has agreed to contribute $2.1 million of the purchase price. Another $450,000 is coming from the state\u2019s Mid-Hudson Regional Economic Development Council. The Village of Upper Nyack and the Durst Organization, which supports the Trust for Public Land, have each committed $100,000. And this past week, the Town of Clarkstown, which includes the village, pledged up to $300,000.At Marydell, negotiations were complicated by the need for the sisters to remain in residence. Carving out the 10 acres for the order made sense, given that all of the buildings were clustered there. Nine of the nuns live on the property, and eight others are in nursing homes or residences in Westchester County, New York City and Puerto Rico.For much of its history, Marydell\u2019s focus was the eight-week summer camp that it operated for some 130 girls. Most came from low-income neighborhoods in New York City. The girls slept in the cabins and swam, hiked, played baseball, did arts and crafts and watched movies.\u201cWe got too old and too few,\u201d said Sister Veronica, who was the camp director until 1988, when Marydell Camp officially closed. \u201cCamping is hard work.\u201dSince then, the order has rented out the cabins to a few camp programs, including one for children with disabilities. At the moment, the order is reaping some much-needed revenue by renting its property to Universal Television, which is using the cabins as the backdrop for a Hulu original series about a cult.The income has allowed the sisters to finally address maintenance on its buildings. \u201cThere were repairs that just weren\u2019t being made,\u201d Sister Veronica said.As for the $3.1 million the order will receive for its land, Sister Veronica said it would be used for both its ministry and medical expenses. \u201cIt will go into our savings to provide for the needs of us as we die off,\u201d she said.The sisters are also trying to sell a separate eight-acre parcel down the street from the Marydell Faith and Life Center. That property does not adjoin state parkland, and the order is willing to sell to a housing developer.But the sisters said they could not abide the idea of houses blanketing the 30 acres that would soon become state parkland. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Sister Veronica said, as a winter sunset bathed Hook Mountain in amber light. \u201cIt really is a priceless piece of property, no matter how much money anyone offered us.

{"Headline": "E.U. Balances Pragmatism and Idealism", "Date": "2016-01-18", "News": "Supported byInside EuropeBRUSSELS \u2014 The European Union is torn between upholding its values and pursuing its interests in the multiple crises over refugees, challenges to the rule of law, relations with Russia and Turkey, and Britain\u2019s membership that are shaking the bloc.Political and economic interests are mostly prevailing over the European Union\u2019s declared values and governance standards, but it is not clear that the outcomes are any more effective. To critics including human rights campaigners, Europe is too willing to betray its principles. To supporters, it is \u201cgrowing up\u201d and acting less na\u00efvely.\u201cPolitics is the art of the possible, but this is very different from the conception of Europe promoted for the last half century,\u201d said Michael Leigh, a former senior European Commission official and now a senior adviser at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a think tank on trans-Atlantic relations. After more than a million migrants flooded into Europe last year, European Union governments are divided on whether the bloc should give priority to its commitment to give asylum to refugees, or whether the main aim should be to toughen border controls and pay other countries to keep potential asylum-seekers at bay.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany is under fire at home and across Europe for having taken the moral high ground by welcoming hundreds of thousands of refugees. The sullen reluctance of most of the Union \u2014 not just central European states but core partners like France \u2014 to take in quotas of refugees to which they agreed months ago is driven by fear of a domestic political backlash.Brussels faced another of those values-versus-interests dilemmas last week when the European Commission had to decide whether to begin disciplinary action over Polish laws shackling the constitutional court and the state media. The Union was widely criticized as failing to act to uphold its values of democracy and the rule of law when the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, began a similar crackdown in 2010 on the judiciary, the media and civil society organizations.The European Commission did take a first step on Poland, but it emphasized that it wanted to resolve the issue in dialogue with Warsaw and that there was no likelihood of moving to sanctions, such as suspending the country\u2019s European Union voting rights or access to funds. Within the commission, officials are reluctant to appear to be lecturing a democratically elected government as it goes about implementing campaign promises.After big demonstrations in Warsaw in defense of liberal values, many in Brussels are pinning their hopes on the self-correcting strength of Polish democracy. Others are looking for someone else to take the lead, such as the Council of Europe\u2019s Venice Commission, a pan-European constitutional watchdog.European Union officials struggle to cope with the growing crisis.Germany and Britain have mostly kept quiet about Poland on pragmatic grounds. Berlin wants to preserve as cooperative a relationship as possible with the more nationalist government of Jaroslaw Kaczynski\u2019s Law and Justice party. London needs Polish good will as it renegotiates sensitive aspects of its own European Union membership. It is also eager to curb the access of migrants from within the Union \u2014 mostly Poles \u2014 to welfare benefits to deter further mass immigration to Britain.Indeed, Europe\u2019s willingness to seek a formula to permit Britain to deny European Union citizens who enter its labor market the same benefits as its own nationals highlights a willingness to compromise on core values for the sake of expediency.While the European Parliament, which sees itself as Europe\u2019s conscience on human rights, is likely to criticize Poland in a special debate this week, other European Union bodies are cautious. Similar mixed feelings guided the Union\u2019s schizophrenic response to Russia\u2019s 2014 seizure and annexation of Crimea and moves to destabilize eastern Ukraine. While the bloc did agree under German leadership to impose sanctions that have pushed the Russian economy into recession and restricted its access to capital, there are charges of double standards when it comes to energy policy.European Union regulatory pressure forced Russia to cancel the South Stream gas pipeline, which was to supply southern European countries, bypassing Ukraine. But Berlin is resisting pressure to halt a second project, Nord Stream, which will run from Russia and under the Baltic Sea to Germany, also bypassing Ukraine.With Turkey, the Union is drawing a veil over its criticism of deteriorating civil liberties, media freedom and judicial independence in a candidate country for the sake of its vital interest in stemming the refugee flow to Europe.The European Commission delayed a critical report on Turkish compliance with Union standards until after parliamentary elections in November to avoid upsetting President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Union officials acknowledge that they have muted criticism of Ankara because they are desperate for Turkish help to stem the flow of refugees.Across North Africa, the Union is playing down the human rights and good-governance elements of its policy toward Egypt, Morocco and Algeria because of Europe\u2019s need for security cooperation against Islamist militants.\u201cWe are not abandoning our values,\u201d said a European Union official involved in managing those relationships, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. \u201cBut we are perhaps being more pragmatic.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Pinot Noir From Argentina That Stands Out in a Sea of Malbecs", "Date": "2016-01-21", "News": "Supported byThe PourMAINQU\u00c9, Argentina \u2014 The flat, dry R\u00edo Negro Valley on the northern end of Patagonia won\u2019t strike anybody as a glamorous wine region. For one thing, apple and pear orchards, along with platoons of poplar trees, far outnumber grapevines. For another, the restaurants, hotels and the usual camp followers of the winemaking life are nowhere to be found.But glamour did not draw Piero Incisa della Rocchetta to the R\u00edo Negro. The old pinot noir vines did, along with promising soils, a sparkling climate and a dream of creating a self-sustaining wine estate the way his grandfather the Marchese Mario Incisa della Rocchetta did in Italy 50 years ago. The marchese created Sassicaia, a paradigm-breaking cabernet blend that proved greatness could be achieved in Bolgheri, on the Tuscan coast.Argentina is known for one wine, malbec. The prevailing style of these wines, grown mostly in the province of Mendoza to the northwest, is the antithesis to good pinot noir; powerfully fruity, opulent and often highly alcoholic and oaky. By contrast, good pinot noir is known for its elegance and finesse, characteristics that Mr. Incisa has managed to achieve in his Chacra wines in just a decade.A 2012 Treinta y Dos, made from pinot noir vines planted in 1932 by Italian immigrants, is a savory delight, graceful and lithe with flavors of red fruits and flowers tempered by minerals. A 2013 Cincuenta y Cinco, from vines planted in 1955, is likewise beautifully balanced and floral, with an umami quality. Even Mr. Incisa\u2019s bigger-production 2014 Barda, made from younger vines, shares their tangy, floral, energetic qualities, though without the extra depth of the other pinot noirs.While pinot noir may not be associated with Argentina, it\u2019s not unknown. Fifty years ago, Mr. Incisa said, more than 4,000 acres in Patagonia were planted with pinot noir. Most of those grapes went into sparkling wines. Chandon Argentina, for example, a subsidiary of the Champagne producer Mo\u00ebt & Chandon, has been making sparkling wines in Argentina for more than 65 years. But many of those grapes are now in other regions. By 2000, Mr. Incisa said, less than 500 acres of pinot noir remained in Patagonia.He found an old stand of pinot noir dating from 1932. He was struck by the dry climate, the fresh breeze that seemed to blow constantly from the Andes in the west and the brilliance of the sunlight. Though technically a desert, bounded by rivers flowing from the mountains into the R\u00edo Negro, the region was irrigated by canals dug by British colonists in the 19th century.But Mr. Incisa was disturbed by the condition of the vines, which had long been neglected, and of the soils \u2014 gravel, sand, limestone and clay \u2014 which seemed gray and lifeless. Taking a chance, he bought the land and the vines and set about building his estate. He has since supplemented the oldest vines with several additional pinot noir vineyards.\u201cI was the idiot guy with a fair dose of not knowing what I didn\u2019t know,\u201d Mr. Incisa said as we walked the vineyards, now alive with birds, bees, bats and other signs of a healthy environment, the result of biodynamic viticulture. \u201cMaybe I had the idea of getting out of a family trajectory, which was very privileged but maybe not so much of a challenge for me. Plus, I had a passion for pinot.\u201dMr. Incisa, now 48, has a history of adapting to new environments. He was born in Bolgheri, and spent his early childhood there and in Florence. He went to boarding school in Switzerland, college in California, and now commutes between Patagonia, New York and Italy.\u201cI wanted to use a local word,\u201d he said. \u201cHere, I\u2019m very much of a stranger.\u201dDespite the condition of the vines and soil, Mr. Incisa said, the vineyards came with built-in advantages. In the fresh Patagonian climate, there were none of the usual problems \u2014 humidity, fungus, mildew, pests. Unlike the vines in most of the great vineyards of Europe and the world, which are grafted onto American rootstocks to combat the threat of phylloxera, an aphid that devastates grapevines, Mr. Incisa\u2019s vines, even the younger ones he has planted to supplement his old stands, are ungrafted.\u201cWe know it\u2019s sort of a gamble,\u201d he said, \u201cbut if at 85 years old the vines are doing well, we figure we don\u2019t need to change.\u201dAdapting to local custom, Mr. Incisa has planted rows of poplars around the vineyards and in between different blocks to protect the vines from the stiff, incessant wind. He has planted cover crops in between the rows of vines to absorb heat from the summer sun and has sculpted the canopy of leaves over the vines so that the grapes ripen slowly in the luminous light.\u201cWe\u2019re looking for something on the feminine, softer side rather than big and tannic,\u201d he said. \u201cI always want freshness, good acidity and, as a byproduct, low alcohol.\u201dIn the low, sandstone winery Mr. Incisa built, the grapes are handled as little as possible. They are fermented in epoxy-lined cement tanks, mostly as whole bunches, with indigenous yeast. The wine then ages in French oak barrels until bottling. The wines are neither fined nor filtered, and receive a minimal dose of sulfur dioxide as a preservative. Mr. Incisa is experimenting with small cuv\u00e9es that receive no sulfur at all.As he has become more confident in his winemaking, his wines have become more precise and transparent. He has cut back on the use of new oak, harvested earlier and become more delicate in the winery.\u201cThere is not a right or wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is just personal taste.\u201dWorking in virtually the middle of nowhere (the nearest city, Neuqu\u00e9n, is more than an hour\u2019s drive away) and in an often dysfunctional Argentine economy has its challenges. Equipment is difficult to repair or replace, and a lack of technical support means Mr. Incisa and his local team must figure things out for themselves.\u201cYou learn to make do, conserve, be efficient,\u201d he said. \u201cKeep everything cheap, local and good for the environment.\u201dWinemaking can also be dangerous. In 2012, while working in his winery, Mr. Incisa slipped off the edge of a tank and fell backward onto the floor below, where he remained for hours until he was discovered. He broke his leg in many places and was in a wheelchair for three months.He decided life was too short to play it safe. He would take chances to make the wines that he wanted.\u201cThe most beautiful thing in my life was the accident,\u201d he said. It has given him perspective on his project. \u201cIt\u2019s taken a small series of miracles to make this work,\u201d Mr. Incisa added. \u201cI attach more to the process than the outcome.\u201dHis 2015s may be his best wines yet. Tasted from barrels, where they are still aging, they are fresh and energetic with crunchy fruit flavors and that characteristic savory quality.Nonetheless, persuading the rest of the world to take interest in Argentine pinot noir has proved a challenge. With so much other good pinot noir in the world, why should anybody drink his?\u201cHopefully, because you are curious and want to explore,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an expression of pinot noir that\u2019s different.\u201dEmail: asimov@nytimes.com.

{"Headline": "In Puerto Rico\u2019s Debt Crisis, an Absence of Enforcers", "Date": "2016-01-07", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsThe municipal bond market in the United States is desperately lacking enforcers. Puerto Rico\u2019s debt crisis is the latest example to expose the shortcoming. Foolish financial crowds had better wise up to other danger zones.Since the investment strategist Ed Yardeni coined the term \u201cbond vigilantes\u201d in the 1980s, it has become somewhat accepted wisdom that if public officials are unwilling to rein in spending, markets will do it for them by making it more expensive to borrow. That failed to happen in Puerto Rico.The public debt of the United States commonwealth in the Caribbean has soared to around $70 billion from under $40 billion in 2006, when expiring manufacturing tax breaks pushed its economy into a recession from which it has yet to recover. The burden is crippling for the island of 3.6 million people, where the poverty rate exceeds 40 percent. High unemployment and rising departures of residents mean last week\u2019s decision to skip $37 million of scheduled interest and principal payments is probably only the beginning.As recently as 2012, yields on Puerto Rico\u2019s general obligation debt were just 2 percentage points higher than an index of similar bonds rated AAA, according to the Thomson Reuters Municipal Market Monitor. That\u2019s about as much as other government borrowers on the low end of the investment-grade scale were paying at the time, despite debt levels already topping $60 billion. It was only in 2013, after years of deficit spending and economic stagnation, that borrowing costs belatedly started to surge.Several factors came into play. First, failure to pay is rare. For 2015, the default rate on municipal debt through November was less than 0.2 percent, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Puerto Rico bonds are also exempt from federal, state and local income tax, making them hugely appealing to retail investors and mutual funds. Throw in near-zero United States Treasury rates, and it\u2019s no wonder discipline weakened.Other cash-poor local governments, including those of New Jersey, Illinois and the City of Chicago, also might have been spared some of the trouble they now face by more discerning debt investors. Without bond vigilantes, fiscal profligacy is all but inevitable. Puerto Rico at least represents a chance to relearn the lesson.Advertisement"}

Trailing them are Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, at 15 percent, and Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon, whose support has dropped to 7 percent.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Iowa Republican caucuses are tight as a tick entering the final two weeks of the campaign,\u201d said Peter A.

But Mr. Trump has been attacking the Texas senator more aggressively of late, raising questions about the Cruz family\u2019s roots in Cuba and Canada. A December poll from Quinnipiac also showed Mr. Trump leading Mr. Cruz by a single percentage point, suggesting the dynamics in the state are starting to stabilize. While Mr. Trump remains polarizing in Iowa, he is viewed by many as the best suited to handle the economy and terrorism, which Iowans view as the most important issues facing the country. Republicans in the state also like his stance on immigration, which includes building a wall along the border with Mexico and deporting anyone who has entered the country illegally.Mr. Cruz is seen as stronger generally on foreign policy, more trustworthy and more empathetic than Mr. Trump.

{"Headline": "A New Economic Era for China Goes Off the Rails", "Date": "2016-01-07", "News": "Supported byA stock market plunge last summer, and a messy currency devaluation that followed, had faded from global view. In the relative calm, he seemed to usher in a new era of economic management, promising policy coordination at the highest levels to prevent another bout of turmoil.Less than three weeks later, his plans have been derailed as China\u2019s stock market and currency once again rattle investors around the world. The latest rout sets up a challenge for Mr. Xi, who has positioned himself as the master of the country\u2019s economy.At every turn, the president\u2019s efforts to manage the economy, market and currency have been undercut by global headwinds and haphazard policy making. Three initiatives this week, involving currency depreciation and two sets of stock market rules, have been particularly discordant. All three were hastily suspended after China\u2019s stock market plunged on Thursday morning.He also cannot move forward on the bolder actions needed to head off a more serious economic slump, such as forcing hopelessly indebted state-owned enterprises to stop borrowing money and shut down. Otherwise, he risks further eroding short-term confidence and growth, which have depended heavily on this borrow-and-spend mentality, and mass layoffs could follow.Mr. Xi\u2019s options are also more limited than in the past. He and his aides engineered the elevation of the renminbi to the ranks of the world\u2019s leading currencies, a status bestowed by the International Monetary Fund in November. But in doing so, he gave up some control, allowing market forces to play a bigger role.In the last couple of years, China had begun allowing, even encouraging, companies and people to invest more of their wealth overseas. Doing so helped reduce deflationary pressures at home from chronic overinvestment and overcapacity, and increased China\u2019s influence around the world.But a trickle of money leaving China to buy houses and other overseas investments has become a flood this winter. The central bank has responded by trying for the last three weeks to slowly guide the currency down as a way to help bolster exports and also make overseas investments seem more expensive and less appealing.The result has been chaotic. With the renminbi worth less by the day in the international markets, Chinese families and companies worry that their renminbi wealth will buy less tomorrow, spurring faster capital flight and worsening the currency turmoil.This week, regulators also put in place a so-called circuit breaker for the stock market, a mechanism that halts trading when shares fall too steeply. The new measure, which followed last summer\u2019s market slide, was aimed at stabilizing stocks. But in practice, it has amplified anxiety.Another measure, which banned large shareholders from selling stock, was supposed to expire on Friday. The looming deadline prompted smaller investors to dump shares.\u201cThese very high-level bodies were supposed to coordinate policy, and in this case there really was a failure of coordination,\u201d said Victor Shih, a specialist in Chinese financial policy at the University of California, San Diego.The resulting stress has driven share prices in China down 12 percent so far this week. The fall would have been even steeper if the new rules had not shut down the market repeatedly.In a stark about-face, the Chinese stock market regulator said Thursday night it would suspend the new measure, \u201cin order to preserve market stability.\u201d It is also extending the selling ban for another three months.With circuit breakers repealed on Thursday night and large shareholders told that they would have to wait another three months before they would be allowed to resume selling shares, the Shanghai Composite Index rebounded 1.5 percent on Friday morning.The combination \u2014 a troubled stock market and currency \u2014 has proved worrisome for global investors. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, the main benchmark in the United States, was off 2 percent on Thursday, and European and Asian shares were down broadly.Few analysts had expected such a quick retreat. \u201cRemoving the circuit breakers now means they have to admit they made a mistake,\u201d Hao Hong, the chief strategist at Bank of Communications International, the overseas arm of a big Chinese bank, said earlier in the day.For years, the response to economic weakness has been the same in China: spend, spend, spend.In some way, China is reverting to its old tactics.Over the last few months, the government has cut interest rates and introduced numerous measures to help stimulate growth. The central bank\u2019s response to the latest stock market fall has been to inject more money into the financial system, so that banks can keep lending.In the face of Monday\u2019s tumult, Prime Minister Li Keqiang visited one of the country\u2019s largest and most troubled state-owned steel companies, Taiyuan Iron and Steel Group. There, Mr. Li reassured workers, urging them to \u201crevive your strength and power.\u201dThe strategy, though, risks deeper problems down the road.By not shutting down struggling companies, China is putting off a much-needed shakeout. The country is also piling on debt to keep such businesses on life support.That makes it difficult to discern the underlying health of the economy, and runs counter to Mr. Xi\u2019s tough promise that China will clean up its corporate mess.Mr. Xi also cannot easily ask the central bank to print huge sums of money to bail out the stock market and struggling companies. Doing so now would risk flooding the economy with cash, causing a further decline in China\u2019s currency against the dollar.Some economists see ominous signs of a broader slowing.A quarterly survey of 2,000 Chinese manufacturers and other industrial companies shows that almost none are currently investing in new equipment and factories. \u201cIn the past four quarters, it\u2019s only 2 to 3 percent that are making expansionary investments,\u201d said Gan Jie, the director of the Center on Finance and Economic Growth at the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business in Beijing, who oversees the quarterly survey.Controlling the currency is already a problem. China has found itself in the difficult position of setting the value of the renminbi lower and lower each day, culminating in a fall of 0.51 percent Thursday morning alone. But the central bank tried to halt the renminbi\u2019s slide on Friday morning by fixing it 0.015 percent higher than the day before in mainland trading.China faces a similar steady drip of stock declines.China\u2019s stock markets have tended to be less correlated with the local economy than most countries\u2019 markets. That is because trading tends to be a speculative activity in China, mainly undertaken by retail investors who frequently have a herd instinct.The problem was on full display this week, as the new circuit breaker mechanism kicked in. The rule imposed a cooling-off period, halting trading for 15 minutes when losses reached 5 percent. After trading resumed, the steep slide continued, prompting the markets to close early twice this week when they reached a second circuit breaker of 7 percent.To some analysts, it was unnecessary. China already has a rule that each stock cannot drop more than 10 percent in a day.Even China tacitly admitted it had made a mistake. When the country\u2019s regulator abandoned the policy on Thursday night, it noted in a statement that it had imposed the policy despite having \u201cno experience\u201d in using a circuit breaker.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Tumultuous Housing Program in Algeria", "Date": "2016-01-09", "News": "Supported byALGIERS \u2014 The air was festive on a recent morning as families moved into their new apartments, courtesy of the Algerian government. Women\u2019s shrieks of joy sounded from the balconies as children tried out the swings beneath a large banner that declared, \u201cOur aim, Algiers, a capital without slums.\u201dBut the celebrations were quickly followed by disappointment, even anger. The construction was shoddy. Water coursed down the walls of the main hallway. And the apartments, at Cit\u00e9 Kourifa, were too small for families that had grown in the many years since they had applied for government housing.\u201cLast night, I had to spend the night in the car,\u201d said Ali Mehdad, 60, a retired taxi driver who had moved in the previous day with his family of eight, including a grandson. \u201cOne son is 35 and cannot get married, because how can you add more people here?\u201dThe government program, one of the most ambitious in the region, is Algeria\u2019s answer to galloping population growth, rapid urbanization and a housing crisis that, many argue, lies at the base of much of the country\u2019s despair.Critics, however, say the housing handouts are creating as many problems as they solve, fueling corruption, violence and a culture of dependency while opportunities to spur growth outside Algeria\u2019s vast oil sector are ignored.Even much of the construction, intended to generate employment and to diversify Algeria\u2019s economy from its dependence on the oil sector, has been outsourced to Chinese companies. Recently, Turkish and Egyptian companies have also joined the building boom.The housing program is nonetheless popular, and vastly oversubscribed. Nearly 70 percent of Algeria\u2019s 39 million people now live in cities along the northern coast, often in slums or in densely packed 1950s tenements rife with drugs and crime.The program amounts to a big government transfer of oil revenue to head off the kind of strains that could lead to unrest.Apartment blocks in pastel shades have sprung up in four new towns and scores of suburbs across the north of the country. The cost of the program is not public, but has run into billions of dollars after more than a decade, analysts say.\u201cIt is the only good thing that happened to Algeria,\u201d said Hakim Ghazi, 25, sitting with a friend outside a 10-year-old social housing project in Bab Ezzouar, on the southeast of Algiers.The World Bank and the United Nations say, however, that Algeria\u2019s problem is not so much a lack of housing as its exorbitant cost \u2014 caused by rigid government policies.Algeria is indeed a particularly volatile society, uprooted by two brutal wars in 60 years and chafing under authoritarian rule. Even the way the houses are distributed would hardly pass for a social program in most other countries.Riot police officers armed with Taser guns turn out in force each time housing lists are announced and relocations are carried out.The families who moved in December to the apartments at Cit\u00e9 Kourifa, in a suburb 20 miles east of the city center, said they had been told to prepare their belongings the day before and then ordered at 4 a.m. to vacate their homes in a slum across town.Only then were they shown the list of families allocated apartments and handed keys. By 10 a.m., bulldozers moved in to destroy the slum, to prevent others from occupying the homes. Five people whose names were not on the list were left homeless, former residents said.Nabila Ounas was one of those celebrating the move to Cit\u00e9 Kourifa last month. \u201cI\u2019m so happy,\u201d she said, showing off the apartment.\u201cWe were living in such conditions, surrounded by snakes and scorpions,\u201d she said. \u201cI lost my first child because of the conditions.\u201d Born prematurely in the slum, the baby survived only an hour, she said.But her joy was fragile. She began to weep as she recounted the turmoil of the move, how bulldozers destroyed the slum as they watched, and how a teenage neighbor slit his throat when he learned he had not been assigned an apartment.\u201cHis name was not on the list, and he committed suicide,\u201d she said, wiping her cheeks. \u201cHe was 16 or 17 years old. He was completely lost.\u201d The youth, named Abdennour, came from a broken family and fell through the net, she said.The government has created a time bomb by handing out apartments, said Rachid Tlem\u00e7ani, a professor of political science at the University of Algiers.\u201cWhy did the government not liberalize housing?\u201d he asked. \u201cIn Tunisia, you do not have this problem, because they had a strategy. Here, you rely on the state, which is very authoritarian and at the same time corrupt.\u201d \u201cAfter each decision, we have riots,\u201d he said.Elected mayors and heads of communes have been replaced over the years by government functionaries, who have been accused of selling apartments or taking bribes, Professor Tlem\u00e7ani said.In 2009, the General Inspectorate of Finance found that nearly 500 names on a housing list for 3,200 homes were children of high-level government officials and even of presidential staff members, El Watan newspaper reported.Housing has become such a source of anger and discontent that the mayor of one province stopped posting lists of people to be assigned apartments because each time, it set off violence.\u201cWe can manage the other problems, except the housing,\u201d said Amar Kamiche, a retiree who lives in a 1950s tenement in west Algiers. He never received government housing, despite applying in 1970, and he and his wife raised seven children in a tiny apartment where the toilet is in the kitchen.He recalled the optimism of the 1960s, when he traveled to France to train as a patisserie chef. \u201cWe never thought Algeria would be what it is today,\u201d he said in sadness. \u201cI left a great country, and I expected it to be greater when I came back.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Clinton, Sanders and O\u2019Malley Save Sharpest Jabs for G.O.P. in Las Vegas", "Date": "2016-01-07", "News": "LAS VEGAS \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Using strikingly similar pitches, Hillary Clinton, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Gov. Martin O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Malley of Maryland tried their best on Wednesday to persuade a room full of Nevada Democrats to support their bids to be the next Democratic presidential nominee.The sold-out event, the Battle Born Battleground First in the West Caucus Dinner, was hosted by the state Democratic Party and Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the minority leader. There was no debate or a question-and-answer session with the audience. Instead, each candidate made separate remarks, pointedly criticizing Republicans. They touched on their plans to keep Americans safe from terrorism, to strengthen the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy, to move toward cleaner energy sources and to address social issues like protecting the working class.About 2,200 people attended the $125-a-seat event, which at times felt like a sporting event with supporters of Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders sitting in large sections on opposite sides of the room and taking turns cheering, waving signs and blowing horns with chants of \u00e2\u0080\u009cH.R.C.\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cBernie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Malley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supporters did not have a similar large section at the dinner but his campaign did set up a table nestled in between his opponent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tables.The candidates only briefly appeared on stage together before going backstage and coming out one at a time to address the boisterous crowd, where they tried to differentiate themselves from their opponents.Mrs. Clinton seemed to question Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plan\u00c2\u00a0to make public colleges tuition-free, saying that taxpayers shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u00e2\u0080\u009cpay for Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kids to go to college for free.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders appeared to be taking a shot at Mrs. Clinton by arguing that the change America needs will not come from \u00e2\u0080\u009cestablishment politics and establishment economics.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut the candidates saved their harshest critiques for the Republicans. Each said that an immigration overhaul should not include mass deportations, that the American economy should better serve the middle class, and that keeping the country safe from terrorism should not mean vilifying ethnic groups. They also all talked about raising the minimum wage and strengthening the ability of workers to organize and bargain with employers.Mrs. Clinton, a former secretary of state, energetically framed herself as the best candidate to match up against the Republican nominee in the general election. She criticized Senator Marco Rubio of Florida for helping write a 2013 immigration bill and then renouncing it, and Donald J. Trump for wanting to deport millions of immigrants and for referring to Mexicans as criminals.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Republicans, what do they do? They just promise more new big giveaways to the wealthy at a time when the superrich and big corporations are already gaming the system,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey should pay their fair share, and under my administration they will.\u00e2\u0080\u009dShe also laid out her experience as first lady, as a senator from New York and as secretary of state, while adding that Republicans were afraid of her and had already begun attacking her in advertisements.\u00e2\u0080\u009cAsk yourself this, if the Republicans weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worried, then why are the hedge fund billionaires already running ads against me?,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy are the Koch brothers throwing in everything they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to stop me? You know why. They know I will stand up to them and defeat their right-wing, top-down agenda that is bad for America.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Sanders, an independent and self-described Democratic socialist, continued his focus on income inequality, improving life for working-class Americans and on his plan to break up \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoo big to fail\u00e2\u0080\u009d commercial banks. He also said that while he agreed with Mrs. Clinton and Mr. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Malley that the Affordable Care Act had accomplished great things, he added that Americans need an expanded system that guarantees health care for everyone.Mr. Sanders also said that electing Republicans would widen the gap between the rich and poor, and he acknowledged that he would need to galvanize voters if he is to be elected.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe only way that Democrats win elections is when we have a large voter turnout,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRepublicans win, as they did last year, when people are demoralized and people give up on the political process. What we need in this campaign is energy. We need youth. We need working people. We need a Democratic Party that makes it clear to every worker in this country that we are on their side, and that we are prepared to take on the billionaire class.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Malley sought to portray his experience as what differentiates him from Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders. But he spent most of his time on Wednesday explaining why electing a Republican president would take the country backward. He took several jabs at Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plan to bar foreign Muslims from entering the United States, and at Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, while also praising President Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s executive actions on gun regulations.\u00e2\u0080\u009cTed Cruz actually says the answer to gun violence is more guns,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Malley said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSenator, the answer to cancer is not more cancer.\u00e2\u0080\u008b The answer to poverty is not more poverty. And the answer to gun violence isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t more guns.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWednesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s event was intended to raise awareness about the Nevada caucuses, the power of the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s increasingly diverse electorate and the West\u2019s growing political influence. Nevada will hold its Democratic caucuses on Feb. 20, making it the third state in the nominating process to vote, after Iowa and New Hampshire.Sue Stephens, 59, a retired budget analyst who lives in Las Vegas, said that she was a registered Republican but that she would consider voting for a Democratic candidate, as she did in the presidential elections of 2008 and 2012. Ms. Stephens said she was most concerned about the economy, gun control, the threat of terrorism and how young people will fare in the future.On Wednesday, she said she would be most supportive of the candidate who delivered a rational message that was focused on the future. Although she had heard all three candidates for the Democratic nomination speak before, she said she had yet to really connect with their messages.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hear what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re saying, but I feel like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just blah, blah, blah,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Stephens said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt sounds so scripted.\u00e2\u0080\u009dShe added that she might be swayed by \u00e2\u0080\u009csomeone who sounds authentic, and someone who impresses me with their knowledge and with some plans about how to move forward without being extremely radical.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMichelle Gack, 62, a retired insurance adjuster, came to the event with campaign gear showing her support for Mrs. Clinton. Though she has already decided to vote for Mrs. Clinton, she said she hoped her candidate would show a more personable and relatable side so that she draws more support from voters in Nevada.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t realize what a nurturing mother and grandmother she is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Gack said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see that side of her, and it is tough for women to go up against what has traditionally been a man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s world politically. I think it does her a lot of good to show her strength as well as her calm demeanor.\u00e2\u0080\u009dEduardo Ruiz, 24, of Las Vegas, said that he planned to vote for Mr. Sanders, and that he hoped the senator would show people that he is willing to take somewhat moderate stances if elected, to work with lawmakers. He also said he hoped Mr. Sanders would more thoroughly explain his views as a Democratic socialist and would emphasize the importance of taking part in the political system.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI feel like the biggest problem is that a lot of people who support him don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe he can make it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Ruiz, who works at an electronics store. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are not the most political people, and are just getting started. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my biggest concern. I have friends who write #FeelTheBern.

{"Headline": "The End of Lawyers?  Not So Fast.", "Date": "2016-01-04", "News": "Lawyers have been described as the canaries in the coal mine in the face of a wave of automation now beginning to displace highly skilled white-collar workers.In recent years, the increasing reliance on so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009ce-discovery\u00e2\u0080\u009d software in lawsuits raised the specter that $35-an-hour paralegals as well as $400-an-hour lawyers would fall victim to programs that could read and analyze legal documents more quickly and accurately than humans.The fate of lawyers has been seen as a harbinger of a broader wave of worker displacement. The rapid commercialization of a new generation of artificial intelligence-derived technologies has led to concerns that technological disruption will extend from white- and blue-collar occupations of largely routine work that can be automated, into highly-paid professions like legal workers and doctors.Not so fast.Despite the fears of some of a \u00e2\u0080\u009cjobs-pocalypse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the economy has stubbornly refused to cooperate with the doomsayers. Last month, there were 149 million people employed in the United States, the most in history. And in recent months a growing array of new studies have indicated that the relationship between technological advances and job displacement is more complex and nuanced than pessimists have suggested.Those studies support another recent paper written by David Autor, an M.I.T. labor economist known for his research indicating that middle-income, mid-skilled jobs in the United States have undergone a significant decline in recent years.The research suggested that, for now, even the most advanced A.I. technology would at best make only modest inroads into the legal profession. Based on their analysis of actual billed hours, the researchers examined the work that lawyers do in broad general categories. They then analyzed how much of each category might be displaced by existing A.I. and automation technologies.As it turns out, being a lawyer involves performing a range of tasks, from reading and analyzing documents, to counseling, appearing in court and persuading juries. Indeed, reading documents accounts for a relatively modest portion of a lawyer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s activities.The researchers noted that many of the tasks that lawyers perform fall well within what Polanyi defined as human behavior that cannot be easily codified. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen a task is less structured, as many tasks are,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the researchers wrote, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit will often be impossible to anticipate all possible contingencies.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAnd current e-discovery software programs still require significant involvement on the part of human lawyers, they wrote.In an analysis of actual legal work practices from billing invoice data, the researchers estimated that about 13 percent of all legal work might ultimately fall prey to automation. If that amount of work disappeared in a single year, it would be devastating, of course. But implemented over many years, this amount of technological change would be less noticeable, they said.They added that even in the case of start-ups like LegalZoom and Rocket Lawyer, two sites that can aid in the preparation of legal documents, the impact of automation would more likely be in expanding into underserved markets rather than in displacing existing legal services.Artificial intelligence technologies will continue to wend their way into the workplace, but they are more likely to change work, rather than end it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEven where automation has made significant progress, its impact has been far less than the headlines would have us believe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the authors of \u00e2\u0080\u009cCan Robots Be Lawyers?\u00e2\u0080\u009d wrote.FollowAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Markets Rise After Volatile Opening", "Date": "2016-01-07", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 With Beijing\u2019s grip slightly looser, Chinese markets steadied on Friday.Exchanges in Europe also rose modestly at the start, and futures trading indicated that Wall Street would open higher.Trading on Friday followed a decision by the Chinese government to stop using measures known as circuit breakers that were intended to keep China\u2019s markets from dropping disastrously over the course of a single trading day. The circuit-breaker system, used for the first time on Monday and scrapped Thursday night, was tripped twice this week. Those halts, once activity resumed, seemed to spur nervous investors into broader sell-offs.On Friday, shares in both Shanghai and Shenzhen rose despite a shaky opening hour, with sharp drops and rises within minutes of each other.Markets seemed \u201ca little more normal,\u201d said Thomas Gatley, a corporate analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics, a financial research company. Of the seesawing early in the morning, Mr. Gatley said, \u201cWe think that is in part a bunch of mutual funds who couldn\u2019t liquidate the previous day.\u201dChina\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.\u201cThe removal of the circuit breaker has removed that magnet effect that when things were down 3 percent, there was the other risk that everyone got stuck,\u201d Mr. Gatley added.The China Securities Regulatory Commission also extended a ban on sales by major shareholders, which had been set to expire on Friday. Some feared the sell-off was in part prompted when those with smaller holdings sold before the bigger shareholders did.Stocks opened higher on Friday morning in China, but in the early volatility, a quick sell-off within 30 minutes was followed by another increase by midmorning. Shares continued to rise after lunch, and by the close of trading, the CSI 300 blue-chip index was up about 2 percent. The Shanghai composite index finished nearly 2 percent higher, while the Shenzhen composite index, which had been down as much as 4 percent, ended 1.2 percent higher.Hao Hong, the chief market strategist at Bank of Communications International, noted that funds had been forced to sell at the open as investors pulled out their money. He added that it also seemed likely that the so-called national team of state-influenced brokerage firms had been pushed to shore up the markets.On Friday morning, the country\u2019s central bank slightly raised the trading range for the renminbi and strengthened the currency, whose depreciation in the preceding three weeks had stoked concerns among investors. It was set at 6.5636 renminbi to the dollar, compared with 6.5646 on Thursday. It remains near its weakest point since early 2011.\u201cIt certainly helped to stabilize sentiment today,\u201d said Mitul Kotecha, head of Asia foreign exchange and rates strategy for Barclays. \u201cThere were major concerns that China would continue to weaken the fixings.\u201dThe Chinese government has been allowing the value of the renminbi to decline steadily, which could bolster exports and growth. But the movement has also unsettled investors and pushed money out of the country.Although the shift on Friday was slight, it still provided a sense of respite, Mr. Kotecha said.\u201cWhen you have several days of weaker fixings, markets are fearing the worst,\u201d he said. \u201cTo have a break is a calming factor.\u201dThe aftershocks of Thursday\u2019s plunge rippled through global markets. The S.&P. 500 ended the day on Thursday down 2.3 percent, while the Euro Stoxx 50 finished 1.7 percent lower.In the early afternoon on Friday, the Euro Stoxx 50 was flat, and the FTSE 100 in London was up 0.5 percent.Markets were mixed in Asia and Australia. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 finished down almost 0.4 percent. The S.&P./ASX 200 in Australia closed down nearly 0.4 percent after spending most of the day down, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index ended up 0.6 percent.Although the Chinese markets looked a little more stable on Friday, Mr. Gatley, the corporate analyst, said he expected more volatility, noting that valuations were pretty high.\u201cThe other thing you can\u2019t write out is more policy missteps from C.S.R.C. and more anticorruption probes, which are profoundly destabilizing,\u201d he added.Mr. Hong at the Bank of Communications was similarly apprehensive.\u201cWe have a small reprieve,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be jumping for joy. The fundamentals are still weak. Valuations are still high.\u201d\u201cThe stock market is starting to reflect what is really going on in the economy,\u201d he added.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s Paid Speeches to Wall Street Animate Her Opponents", "Date": "2016-01-21", "News": "Supported byFor a fee of $275,000, she had agreed to appear before the clients of GoldenTree Asset Management, the capstone of a lucrative speechmaking sprint through Wall Street that earned her more than $2 million in less than seven months.Mrs. Clinton said the Dodd-Frank rules, while unpopular among some on Wall Street, were a necessary response to the financial crisis, according to one person who attended, while making clear she viewed Wall Street as a partner in securing the country\u2019s economic future, not an enemy. We have to win together, she said, not divide ourselves.But her paid speeches are now emerging as the central line of attack in an increasingly bitter primary clash with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. In Sunday\u2019s debate in South Carolina and at a series of campaign appearances in Iowa this week, Mr. Sanders has argued that Mrs. Clinton is too personally beholden to Wall Street to effectively rein in the industry\u2019s excesses.In Iowa on Wednesday, Mr. Sanders went even further, seeming to mock her sizable speaking fees as borderline bribes from a powerful industry. \u201cYou got to be really, really, really good to get $250,000 for a speech,\u201d he said.The attacks have become one of Mr. Sanders\u2019s biggest applause lines in Iowa, where the median household earns about $52,229 a year. And Republican strategists are testing how to turn Mrs. Clinton\u2019s speaking fees against her in an election defined by rising economic inequality and stagnant middle-class wages. Even some of her supporters are questioning the wisdom of accepting the fees when she knew she might run for the presidency again.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.But the new attacks strike at what even some allies believe may be one of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s biggest vulnerabilities: not her positions on financial regulation, but her personal relationships with Wall Street executives, along with the millions of dollars Mrs. Clinton, her husband, and their family foundation have accepted in speaking fees or charitable contributions from banks, hedge funds and asset managers. Unlike Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Obama has never earned speaking fees from Wall Street.\u201cThe reason that Bernie is focusing on the speaking fees is that Hillary can\u2019t use the Obama defense,\u201d said Ed Rendell, a former Pennsylvania governor, who has supported Mrs. Clinton.In retrospect, Mr. Rendell conceded, Mrs. Clinton would have been better off giving fewer such speeches.\u201cAlthough they needed money, I think that Bill was raking in enough that Hillary didn\u2019t have to do it,\u201d Mr. Rendell said. \u201cTo people who earn $200,000 in seven years, it looks ridiculous.\u201d\u201cGoldman Sachs also provides very, very generous speaking fees to some unnamed candidates,\u201d he told voters at a winery in Carroll, Iowa, on Tuesday.In highlighting Mrs. Clinton\u2019s ties to Wall Street, Mr. Sanders is tapping into suspicion that remains potent in both parties years after the last Occupy Wall Street tents disappeared from Zuccotti Park in Lower Manhattan. Donald J. Trump, who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, has mocked hedge fund managers as \u201cguys that shift paper around\u201d and \u201cget lucky.\u201d Other Republicans have likewise sought to tap into popular discontent with Wall Street, blaming the Dodd-Frank legislation for letting \u201cthe big banks get bigger and bigger and bigger,\u201d as Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, another Republican presidential candidate, put it last fall.Sensitive to the sour public mood, Mrs. Clinton has layered her own speeches with calls to reduce income inequality and overhaul the country\u2019s \u201crigged\u201d economic system. In what was billed as a major economic speech before a Wall Street audience in July, Mrs. Clinton called for expanding Dodd-Frank and denounced fraud in the financial sector.Dennis M. Kelleher, the president of Better Markets, a financial industry watchdog group, said Mr. Sanders appeared intent on opening a new front on the issue of financial regulation.\u201cHe\u2019s got a plan, and she put out a plan. Your eyes glaze over,\u201d said Mr. Kelleher. With his attacks on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s speaking fees, Mr. Kelleher said, Mr. Sanders was trying to \u201cget out of the fight over whose plan is better.\u201d\u201cWall Street made her a multimillionaire,\u201d the ad, titled \u201cHillary\u2019s Bull Market,\u201d asserts. \u201cDoes Iowa really want Wall Street in the White House?\u201dOn Wednesday, the group escalated its attacks, targeting Mrs. Clinton\u2019s daughter, Chelsea Clinton, who in her 20s worked for a New York-based hedge fund run by a Clinton friend and campaign donor, Marc Lasry.But a Crossroads official said that its polls and focus groups of voters in battleground states suggested that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s speaking fee \u2014 typically around $225,000, or almost five times the median American household income \u2014 could be a potent line of attack with swing voters in November.One poll, from June, found that when informed that the Clintons had made $25 million in speaking fees since the beginning of 2014, slightly more than half of respondents said she \u201cdoes not understand\u201d the \u201cstruggles of ordinary Americans.\u201d Another poll, from November, found that Wall Street campaign contributions to Mrs. Clinton made a similar proportion of voters less likely to vote for her.\u201cOur focus groups with swing and independent voters, especially women, responded very negatively to the contrast between Hillary\u2019s rhetoric on Wall Street and her close financial ties to the industry,\u201d said Steven J. Law, the president of American Crossroads.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign has seized on the group\u2019s intervention to discredit Mr. Sanders. In a statement, Jennifer Palmieri, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s communications director, said Mr. Sanders was \u201ctaking his cues\u201d from Republicans and \u201cusing a Karl Rove attack to go after her.\u201dStill, interviews with voters in Iowa suggest that Mr. Sanders\u2019s attacks are finding an audience.\u201cIt\u2019s a gentle jab at Hillary,\u201d Joe Driscoll, 71, an architectural restorer from Honey Creek, said after one Sanders speech. He called the gibe \u201cclassy\u201d when compared with Chelsea Clinton\u2019s suggestion that Mr. Sanders would strip Americans of their health care. He said the connection of Mrs. Clinton to Goldman resonated with him and others who equated Goldman with Wall Street misdeeds. At an appearance before 1,200 people in Sioux City on Tuesday, Mr. Sanders attacked \u201cthe revolving door of politics and Wall Street,\u201d with two Treasury secretaries, one from each side of the political aisle, having Goldman Sachs on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. He called it a travesty that the executives who \u201cripped off\u201d Americans never did jail time, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s wrong, and we are going to change that.\u201dMr. Sanders seemed ready to move on when another thing suddenly seemed to occur to him: \u201cOh, by the way, I forgot to mention they also provide a lot of campaign contributions and speaking fees to unnamed candidates.\u201dRuss Gifford, from South Sioux City, said he had always figured that the relationship between Goldman Sachs and the Clintons was beneficial to the Clintons personally and the bank institutionally, but also to Americans who benefited from a strong economy fueled by success on Wall Street.Now, Mr. Gifford said, he is not so sure.\u201cBernie\u2019s calling it into question. \u2018Just how beneficial is it for us?\u2019\u201d Mr. Gifford said. He described himself as a longtime supporter of Mrs. Clinton but called Mr. Sanders \u201cvery impressive.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of the president of American Crossroads. He is Steven J. Law, not Stephen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Canada, the 8-Dollar Cauliflower Shows the Pain of Falling Oil Prices", "Date": "2016-01-20", "News": "Supported byOTTAWA \u2014 Steamed, saut\u00e9ed or stir-fried, cauliflower is standard fare on many dinner tables. In Canada, it is a luxury.A head of cauliflower there now goes for around 8 Canadian dollars, a tripling in price, the strange foodie fallout from the low price of oil and other commodities.The recipe for high-priced cauliflower starts with the currency.As prices for commodities have dropped, the value of the Canadian dollar has fallen, a direct link to an economy that is dependent on oil and other resources. It makes imports, like fresh American vegetables during the dark Canadian winter, look especially costly. Two years ago, one Canadian dollar was worth 93 American cents. On Wednesday, it stood at 69 American cents.The drought in California, where Canadians get most of their vegetables in the off-season, just compounds the sticker shock. With less bounty in the fields, farmers\u2019 prices, in American dollars, are higher.As a result, fresh vegetables feel more like a splurge for Canadian consumers.Iceberg lettuce sells for 3 Canadian dollars, up from the typical 90 Canadian cents. One head of broccoli goes for $4, compared with $1.50 for two in the past. Last winter, a head of cauliflower was selling for 2.50 Canadian.\u201cWe\u2019ve gone through this cycle before with the dollar,\u201d said Jim McKeen, owner of McKeen Metro Glebe, a grocery store in downtown Ottawa. \u201cBut there were issues on prices anyways because of supply in addition to this whole fiasco with the Canadian dollar. It\u2019s a perfect storm.\u201dThe Canadian dollar, in part, reflects the trouble in the country\u2019s economy.For years, Canada rode the global commodities boom. The rapidly growing Chinese economy \u2014 and its seemingly insatiable appetite for commodities \u2014 helped increase the price of oil, potash, nickel and the other Canadian resources.With China\u2019s demand now faltering, commodity prices have reversed course. Oversupply of oil has similarly devastated its price. Both factors are taking their toll on the Canadian economy. The gross domestic product increased just 0.6 percent in the third quarter of 2015, after six months of negative growth.Since October, the decline in the Canadian dollar, already looking shaky against a surging American currency, has picked up speed.In many ways, a weaker currency is helpful to the economy. The United States is overwhelmingly the largest market for Canadian exports, which are now less expensive across the border because of the currency\u2019s fall.A glut of crude oil on the markets is pushing the price of oil down to levels not seen since the global financial crisis.And commodity exports are almost all priced in American dollars. So foreign exchange gains have helped cushion some of the blow to Canadian oil producers and mining companies.\u201cFrom a household point of view, what Canadians see is that their dollar isn\u2019t going as far,\u201d said Craig Alexander, vice president of economic research at the C.D. Howe Institute, an economic analysis and policy group. \u201cBut it\u2019s good for Canadians, it\u2019s good for jobs. The primary driver for economic growth going forward has to come from nonresource export sectors.\u201dCanada\u2019s tourism industry and other service sectors, which had been suffering, are already experiencing gains from the currency drop. Luke Azevedo, the film commissioner for Calgary Economic Development, said there had been a notable rise in production in Alberta, where large portions of the movie \u201cThe Revenant\u201d and the television series \u201cFargo\u201d were filmed last year.\u201cIt\u2019s across the country and the dollar plays a fairly significant role,\u201d Mr. Azevedo said.Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau emphasized Canada\u2019s strengths in technology and education rather than its ailing natural resource sector.\u201cOur natural resources are important and always will be,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said. \u201cBut Canadians know that growth and prosperity is not only based on what\u2019s under our feet but particularly on what we have between our ears.\u201dConsumer costs are creeping up in a number of areas.Just over a year ago, a 16-gigabyte iPad Mini 2 cost roughly the same in Canada and the United States. But this week, it was priced at $269 in the United States and 329 Canadian dollars.Still, it could be worse. If the device\u2019s price were based on the full movement in the exchange rate, the iPad would have been around 390 Canadian dollars.Food is more price-sensitive.The turnover in the grocery aisle, compared with, say, a clothing store, is faster, so changes in currency are more quickly reflected. And profit margins are thin, so grocery stores are less willing to absorb the losses.The current collapse of the country\u2019s dollar could have a more significant impact in supermarkets than it did in the early 2000s, according to Sylvain Charlebois, a professor at the University of Guelph in Ontario and an author of an annual study of Canadian food prices.Professor Charlebois estimated that about 140 Canadian food processing plants have closed in recent years. Many were owned by multinationals that have replaced Canadian production with imports from their larger American plants. Kellogg\u2019s ended a century of production in London, Ontario, just over a year ago.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.The result, Professor Charlebois said, is that price increases will be seen throughout grocery stores and not just in their fresh produce aisles. Already, he said, some breakfast cereals have hit 10 Canadian dollars.\u201cWe\u2019re only 35 million people in Canada,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very small market on the global scale.\u201dCertain foods may be more insulated. Professor Charlebois said prices had risen only slightly for dairy, poultry and eggs. Those products are protected by a government-sanctioned cartel. The system limits production by farmers to keep prices stable, if high, in comparison with the United States, while effectively shutting out price competition from imports through high tariffs.After announcing on Wednesday that the country\u2019s key lending rate would stay at 0.5 percent, Stephen Poloz, the governor of the Bank of Canada, noted the impact of oil prices on the cost of groceries. \u201cI sympathize very much for those for who food is a bigger percentage of their spending,\u201d he said during a news conference. But he added that over all, savings from lower energy costs had more than offset price increases for imported products.Fishermen in Prince Edward Island now send most of their oyster harvest to the United States to capitalize on the currency difference. That\u2019s leading to shortages at Canadian fishmongers, forcing some restaurant owners to reimport from the United States.\u201cIt\u2019s mind-boggling that I have to buy Malpeque oysters from my American importer in Boston,\u201d said David McMillan, the co-owner of Joe Beef and two other restaurants in Montreal, adding that the cost of the oysters from Prince Edward Island had risen to 120 Canadian dollars a box from about 90 Canadian dollars. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of money for not a special oyster.\u201dA similar pattern is developing with Canadian beef heading to the United States. It has prompted Mr. McMillan to develop menus based around less expensive cuts and the recipes that suit them, like stews.\u201cWe\u2019re getting back to basics,\u201d he said. \u201cYou roll with the punches. A good restaurant adapts.\u201dSal Howell, the owner of two Calgary restaurants, River Caf\u00e9 and Boxwood, said she was placing a renewed focus on locally available produce, not easy during Canada\u2019s winter. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to do to wean yourself off of head lettuce from California,\u201d she said. \u201cI think root vegetables will definitely be the kind of thing people are talking about.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cubans, Fearing Loss of Favored Status in U.S., Rush to Make an Arduous Journey", "Date": "2016-01-09", "News": "Supported by7 PhotosLA CRUZ, Costa Rica \u2014 In Gretchen L\u00f3pez\u2019s slumber, during whatever winks of sleep she could get in a crowded open air shelter, she dreamed she was sending money to her mother in Cuba to renovate her crumbling house and buy delicious food.\u201cBut I woke up and I was here,\u201d she said, looking around a fire station here in rural Costa Rica, where she sleeps beside hundreds of other Cubans who got stuck while trying to make a perilous journey through eight countries to reach the United States.Now, after two months languishing in a shelter, Ms. L\u00f3pez and nearly 11,000 other Cubans who were stranded because of a political impasse in Central America will soon be back on the trail, heading to the United States in an exodus that some officials have likened to a stampede.While American politicians debate whether to accept Syrian refugees and lament the crush of Central Americans who make their way illegally into the United States, the border is about to be crashed in the coming weeks by another wave of newcomers.But in this case, the Cubans have a trump card: American law has long given them special status to live in the United States and apply for a green card \u2014 provided they make it there.This latest wave of Cuban migration stems from a number of changes enacted by Cuba\u2019s communist government in recent years, in part to jump-start the island\u2019s feeble economy. People are allowed to sell their cars and real estate, a move that suddenly enabled many more to pay smugglers to get them to the United States. Cuba also began allowing its citizens to obtain passports and leave the country more freely, unleashing a rush for the exits.\u201cThere\u2019s a rush of Cubans now, because a lot of people are afraid of that law being repealed,\u201d said L\u00e1zaro Clarke, 34, who worked as a barber and fruit vendor in Havana, as he waited in Costa Rica. \u201cWith the law or without the law, I\u2019m going.\u201dTens of thousands of Cubans have plunked down the profits of their home and car sales to pay for a treacherous 5,000-mile journey by plane, bus, boat and foot. Most have begun by flying to Ecuador, which did not used to require a travel visa. Then they have moved on to Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico in hopes of reaching the American border. The circuitous route allows Cubans to bypass the dangerous trip through the Florida Straits, a crossing that cost many Cubans their lives and where, because of an American policy known as \u201cwet foot, dry foot,\u201d they would be turned back if caught by the Coast Guard.Kathya Rodr\u00edguez, the director of Costa Rica\u2019s immigration service, said, \u201cIn 2015, the numbers just shot up.\u201dCosta Rica said it warned its neighbors last year that a tidal wave was building.\u201cMany countries turned to look the other way, as though they were ghosts \u2014 they knew they were there, but paid no attention,\u201d said Costa Rica\u2019s foreign minister, Manuel Gonz\u00e1lez. Then in November, Costa Rica broke up a smuggling network that had been ferrying migrants through the country. Without the guides to lead the way, migrants who had been quietly slipping past border crossings suddenly became conspicuous. Thousands of them.Costa Rica gave them transit visas and sent them on their way, but Nicaragua \u2014 a longstanding ally of Cuba \u2014 balked, refusing to let them pass. Cubans started to pile up at the Nicaraguan border. In November, throngs of them pushed their way past the border agents.They were repelled by Nicaraguan soldiers with tear gas and swift beatings. \u201cAs much as we lived under a regime, nothing like that had ever happened to us before,\u201d Ms. L\u00f3pez, 22, said. \u201cTear gas? Bullets? Some of us had been beaten by the police before, but not like that.\u201dThousands of Cubans who said they were fleeing political and economic repression at home learned about the unexpected perils of free societies, including the proliferation of guns. Armed bandits preyed upon Cubans on the road, especially those who had not thought to first wire their life savings to relatives in the United States.\u201cI would tell anyone not to take this trip,\u201d said Pedro Enrique Duarte, a 48-year-old accountant who was attacked in Colombia and rescued by a local family. \u201cYou spend the whole time straddling between life and death.\u201dMany people were financially wiped out.\u201cI sold my house for $3,000, and I will arrive in debt,\u201d said Dayana Fern\u00e1ndez, a 22-year-old hairdresser who hopes to join her in-laws in South Florida.With Nicaragua still refusing to offer passage, Costa Rica has spent $1 million to house and feed the Cubans in schools and other shelters around the country.\u201cNever before have we, even in a natural disaster, had the necessity to attend to this many people for this long,\u201d Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez said.Late last month, Costa Rica and the other Central American countries agreed on a plan to hasten the Cubans\u2019 departure. On Tuesday, a group of 180 Cubans are scheduled to fly over Nicaragua to El Salvador, which had not been part of the migrant trail. From there, they will take a bus to Guatemala, then another to southern Mexico.If the effort goes smoothly, two flights will leave each day, with the expectation that it will take three weeks to evacuate the approximately 8,000 Cubans stuck in Costa Rica. The hope is to hatch a similar plan for the 3,000 Cubans in Panama, too.The Cubans will pay $555 for the charter flight, the bus and food arranged by a travel agency. Once in Mexico, the Cubans will be on their own to reach the United States border. Unlike Hondurans and other Central Americans trying to reach the border, Cubans can receive a 20-day transit visa from Mexico. Nations in the region stressed that the deal was a one-time offer. To stem the flow of migrants, Ecuador started requiring visas in December. Costa Rica says it will deport any additional Cubans caught in its territory.The Cuban government has long condemned the American policy of accepting Cuban migrants, saying it encourages human trafficking and \u201cthe politicization of immigration policies.\u201d\u201cWe see it as a double standard,\u201d said Hugo Mart\u00ednez, El Salvador\u2019s foreign minister. \u201cIt\u2019s a policy that allows one set of migrants to be treated in a privileged manner and another set of migrants in a discriminatory fashion.\u201dThere has been ample talk of modifying or revoking the 1966 Cuban Adjustment Act, but the likelihood of action by Congress appears slim.\u201cNobody should be given preferential treatment,\u201d said Representative Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat who visited the Cubans at the shelters in Costa Rica. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair at all.\u201dEven some staunch opponents of the Cuban government say the law needs to be rethought.\u201cThis notion that you\u2019re going to have people coming up Central America and into the United States through the southern border is unacceptable,\u201d said Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a Cuban-American running for the Republican presidential nomination.The State Department said in a statement that the United States is \u201ccommitted to supporting safe, orderly and legal migration from Cuba,\u201d but added that \u201cthe administration has no plans to alter current migration policy regarding Cuba.\u201dThe only bill to repeal the act came from Representative Paul Gosar, Republican of Arizona, who said Cubans should be treated like other \u201cillegal immigrants.\u201d He drew little support from Cuban-Americans, and his bill has gained little traction.\u201cMaybe people think it\u2019s not fair for us to get that privilege,\u201d said Igor Thondike, who has been sleeping on a basketball court in Costa Rica since November. \u201cIt\u2019s also unfair that we Cubans have gone more than 50 years without an election.\u201dHe is eager to continue his journey and hopes to find a job installing windows in the United States.Azam Ahmed contributed reporting from Mexico City, and Julia Preston from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In 2016 Race, Local Matters Give Way to National Tone", "Date": "2016-01-17", "News": "Supported byIn 2016, all politics is national. The hometown industries and parochial peeves that once shaped the early primary contests are rapidly losing clout this election season, overcome by the intensifying ideological cast of Republican politics and a potent anger about the economy and terrorism that has thoroughly overshadowed priorities closer to home.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.In New Hampshire, where the most important campaign issue seems to be how often candidates show up, the leading contender, Donald J. Trump, has spent far less time there than other Republicans.One factor, some Republicans said, is the rising importance of the debates. Surveys by TargetPoint, a market research firm with Republican clients, indicated that voters have reacted far more powerfully to candidates\u2019 debate performances than to their political ads, said Alexander Gage, TargetPoint\u2019s chief executive.And the debates have been far more focused on national issues like immigration and terrorism than on regional ones. (In 2008, some Republicans recalled, one debate featured a sharp exchange over how to bring down the cost of hurricane insurance in Florida.)\u201cDebates are the bigger driver, and they by their nature don\u2019t focus on the local issues as much,\u201d Mr. Gage said. \u201cWhat we hear from the focus groups is, \u2018It\u2019s the country, not my state, not my town, that I am most focused on.\u2019\u201d\u201cYears ago, most of the news people got was local, so local issues dominated their news consumption,\u201d Mr. Tyler said. \u201cToday people get most of their news from New York-centric news organizations that focus on national and international stories.\u201dHistory suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.\u201cPeople are more likely to know what\u2019s going on a thousands of miles away than they are a mile down the street,\u201d he added.But perhaps the biggest force, Republican officials and strategists said, is that voters this year are paying close attention to issues like so-called crony capitalism and government spending. Some of the most engaged conservative voters, they said, are less willing to let slide a special tax break or earmarked boondoggle, even one benefiting their state.\u201cRank-and-file primary and caucus voters are angry and frustrated with the leadership in Washington, D.C., precisely because of those kinds of backdoor deals,\u201d said Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity. \u201cThey\u2019re more willing to respond to people with the guts to take a stand.\u201dThe strength of that response is being tested most intensely in Iowa, where Mr. Cruz hopes to become the first Republican to win the first-in-the-nation caucuses without supporting the ethanol mandate. Determined to prevent that outcome, ethanol producers have mounted a seven-figure campaign to press Mr. Cruz and other candidates on the issue.The group has attacked Mr. Cruz repeatedly, claiming that the Texas senator is currying favor with oil producers in his state and that he has changed his stance on the mandate. (Mr. Cruz once supported a bill that would have immediately ended the ethanol standard; he more recently introduced a bill that would phase it out over five years.)Mr. Cruz faced at least a dozen questions on ethanol from residents during his recent trip, but appeared largely unruffled. At one stop, his adviser Mr. Tyler invited reporters to watch him place a Cruz campaign sticker on the back of the ethanol group\u2019s R.V.By the end of the tour, Mr. Cruz had begun bringing up his ethanol position even without prompting from the audience, joking that the negative mailers from the ethanol lobby would make \u201cgreat kindling\u201d for voters\u2019 fireplaces.\u201cThere are a whole bunch of lobbyists and Democrats who are spending a bunch of money trying to scare folks in Iowa,\u201d Mr. Cruz told voters, adding that the subsidy \u201ckeeps Iowans dependent on Washington.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s how they like it,\u201d he continued, \u201cwith Iowa farmers having to go on bended knee to Washington to maintain the mandate.\u201dMatt Flegenheimer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

He has set a deadline for making a final decision in early March, the latest point at which advisers believe Mr. Bloomberg could enter the race and still qualify to appear as an independent candidate on the ballot in all 50 states.His aides have sketched out a version of a campaign plan that would have the former mayor, a low-key and cerebral personality, give a series of detailed policy speeches backed by an intense television advertising campaign. The ads would introduce him to voters around the country as a technocratic problem-solver and self-made businessman who understands the economy and who built a bipartisan administration in New York.Mr. Bloomberg would face daunting and perhaps insurmountable obstacles in a presidential campaign: No independent candidate has ever been elected to the White House, and Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s close Wall Street ties and liberal social views, including his strong support for abortion rights and gun control, could repel voters on the left and right.But his possible candidacy also underscores the volatility of a presidential race that could be thrown into further turmoil by a wild-card candidate like Mr. Bloomberg.Edward G. Rendell, the former governor of Pennsylvania and a past Democratic National Committee chairman, said he believed Mr. Bloomberg could compete in the race if activist candidates on the left and right prevailed in the party primaries.A look at the latest results for Iowa and New Hampshire, and how this year compares to previous election seasons.\u201cMike Bloomberg for president rests on the not-impossible but somewhat unlikely circumstance of either Donald Trump or Ted Cruz versus Bernie Sanders,\u201d said Mr. Rendell, a close ally of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s who is also a friend of Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s. \u201cIf Hillary wins the nomination, Hillary is mainstream enough that Mike would have no chance, and Mike\u2019s not going to go on a suicide mission.\u201dIn a three-way race featuring Mr. Sanders and Mr. Bloomberg, Mr. Rendell said he might back the former New York mayor.\u201cAs a lifelong Democrat, as a former party chairman, it would be very hard for me to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I would certainly take a look at it \u2014 absolutely.\u201dMr. Bloomberg declined to comment on his interest in the 2016 race, and most of his associates would speak only on the condition that they not be named. Mr. Bloomberg is irked by the perception that he has toyed too often with running for national office, according to several associates, and is said to be wary of another public flirtation.At a dinner party late last fall at the home of Roger C. Altman, an investment banker and former deputy Treasury secretary, Mr. Bloomberg delivered a piquant assessment of Mrs. Clinton as a presidential candidate.In the presence of Mr. Altman, a longtime supporter of Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, Mr. Bloomberg described her as a flawed politician, shadowed by questions about her honesty and the continuing investigation into her email practices as secretary of state, according to two people in attendance.The outcome of that investigation, Mr. Bloomberg said, was anyone\u2019s guess.Setting a March deadline for making a decision allows Mr. Bloomberg to see how Mrs. Clinton and the more mainstream Republican candidates fare in the early primaries. And because of his vast wealth, there is no downside in laying the groundwork for a possible campaign, even if he ultimately decides against it.Even a victory by Mrs. Clinton in the Democratic primaries might not preclude a bid by Mr. Bloomberg, his associates said, if he believed she had been gravely weakened by the contest.One adviser said that Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s preparations reflected the unsettled state of the race, and the perception that Mrs. Clinton was flagging against Mr. Sanders.Mr. Bloomberg, this adviser said, believes voters want \u201ca nonideological, bipartisan, results-oriented vision\u201d that the early primary favorites have not presented.\u201cThis isn\u2019t about Hillary Clinton,\u201d the adviser said in an email. \u201cThe fact is Hillary Clinton is behind in Iowa and New Hampshire. That should scare a lot of people \u2014 and it does.\u201d (Public polls have shown Mr. Sanders leading in New Hampshire, a close race in Iowa and Mrs. Clinton with a solid lead nationally.)Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign declined to comment on Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s interest in the race. But on a campaign conference call with supporters on Saturday, Jennifer Palmieri, a top Clinton aide, told allies that she believed Mr. Bloomberg would only run if Mr. Sanders won the nomination, and that the Clinton camp intended to foreclose that possibility.Since the 2012 election, Mr. Bloomberg has repeatedly mused at private events about Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign as a cautionary tale for candidates from the business world. Mr. Romney assembled an impressive record as a private equity investor before serving as governor of Massachusetts; the Obama campaign branded him as a heartless corporate raider.Social acquaintances and political and business leaders said they had been surprised to find their encouraging remarks about a possible 2016 campaign answered with intense seriousness by Mr. Bloomberg, who has stressed that he would run if he saw a path to victory.Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s brain trust has examined previous third-party efforts dating to Theodore Roosevelt in 1912, giving closest attention to the campaigns of John Anderson in 1980 and H. Ross Perot in 1992.It is unclear whether Mr. Bloomberg would be more likely to draw voters\u2019 support from a Democrat, like Mr. Sanders or Mrs. Clinton, or a conservative Republican.While Mr. Bloomberg supports many of the Democratic Party\u2019s social policies, he has been a fierce defender of the financial services industry, which is unpopular with many liberals, and enacted aggressive policing policies in New York City that are anathema to left-leaning voters.And when he first ran for mayor in 2001, he did so as a Republican. But he has also poured energy and money into advocating policies that conservative Republicans detest, most notably gun control and immigration reform.Mr. Bloomberg has seen Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric on immigration as especially distasteful. But in an interview in Iowa on Saturday, Mr. Trump said he \u201cwould love the competition\u201d of having Mr. Bloomberg in the race, and alluded to their different business backgrounds and divergent policy views. \u201cHe\u2019s the opposite of me in many ways,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cOpposite on guns, opposite on numerous issues.\u201dA spokesman for Mrs. Clinton declined to comment on Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s interest in the race and his comments about her campaign.Alan Patricof, a financier and longtime donor to the Clintons who is also friendly with Mr. Bloomberg, said it would be \u201ca terrible thing\u201d for the Democratic Party\u2019s prospects of winning the White House if the former mayor ran as an independent.\u201cIf it was President Trump or President Bloomberg, I\u2019d certainly rather have President Bloomberg,\u201d Mr. Patricof said. \u201cBut it certainly can\u2019t help the Democrats.\u201dSome Republicans are less certain of the effect Mr. Bloomberg would have on the race. In swing states like Ohio and Virginia, suburban moderates who recoil from certain liberal policies might be more likely to support Mr. Bloomberg than a candidate like Mr. Trump or Mr. Cruz.Representative Daniel M. Donovan Jr., a New York Republican who is a friend and golfing partner of Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s, said that many voters \u201cwho aren\u2019t totally satisfied with any of the people who are running right now, would welcome a Mike Bloomberg candidacy.\u201dMr. Donovan said he could consider supporting Mr. Bloomberg, depending on how the rest of the race develops.\u201cHe governed more in pragmatic ways than in ideals,\u201d Mr. Donovan said, adding, \u201cThat may be different from some of the folks, like Senator Cruz, who are apparently doing well among primary voters.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rams\u2019 Departure Is Another Blow to St. Louis Area, and a Chance to Shift Priorities ", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported byST. LOUIS \u2014 Five years ago, it was grim census data showing that the city\u2019s population had decreased by 8 percent at a time when officials were expecting it to grow.Two years ago, a fatal police shooting of an unarmed black man in Ferguson, a northern suburb, exposed deep racial divisions in the region.And then on Monday came another blow: news that the Rams, a source of entertainment and civic pride for many in this proud riverfront city, were heading west to Los Angeles, the city from which they came.Like other struggling industrial cities in the Midwest, St. Louis has been rocked in recent decades by a changing economy that has drained it of jobs, investment, civic institutions and residents. So for many jilted fans, the departure of its N.F.L. team \u2014 despite its mediocre 7-9 finish this year \u2014 seemed like piling on. \u201cFans should boycott the N.F.L.,\u201d said Bernard Anderson, 61, the owner of Bernie\u2019s Place, two miles north of downtown. \u201cThey\u2019re holding cities hostage. We\u2019re in a whole new quagmire now. I am totally devastated.\u201d Adding to the sting is the fact that the city\u2019s latest misfortune comes as its rival city on the state\u2019s western fringe, Kansas City, is still gloating over the victory in last year\u2019s World Series and cheering on an N.F.L. franchise that is two victories from going to the Super Bowl.Now as city officials, civic leaders and residents confront the latest defeat, they find themselves calculating what the loss means and how to move forward. Some stressed that they still had their sporting crown jewel, the St. Louis Cardinals, 11-time World Series champions. \u201cWhile football is a great amenity and something we want, we will persevere,\u201d Mayor Francis Slay said during a news conference on Wednesday.The way Malik Ahmed sees it, St. Louis knows how to turn a negative into a positive. The shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson painfully demonstrated deep-rooted problems, he said. But it has also motivated some people from different neighborhoods and different races to work toward change in a way that Mr. Ahmed says he has rarely seen in his nearly 35 years here.\u201cThere\u2019s a resiliency in the city and that could only increase in time,\u201d said Mr. Ahmed, the chief executive and founder of Better Family Life, a community development organization that works in the underserved communities in St. Louis\u2019s North Side. What partly blunts the blow of losing the Rams is the reality that keeping them here would have eaten further into the region\u2019s pockets.After losing an N.F.L. team that also uses the name Cardinals to Phoenix in 1987, St. Louis built a $280 million stadium to lure a team back to town. The city welcomed the Rams from Los Angeles in 1995 with what was a relatively generous 30-year lease agreement for the team that gave the franchise an opt-out every 10 years.Even with the Rams as tenants of the Edward Jones Dome, the city had about a $2 million deficit to fill each year on the bonds, which run through 2021. Part of the plan to get the Rams to stay would have been to build a new $1.1 billion stadium by extending existing bonds, putting even more of a burden on the region\u2019s coffers.Antonio French, an alderman who represents parts of the city\u2019s north side, called the Rams\u2019 move unfortunate, \u201cgiven what our community has been going through.\u201dBut, he added, \u201cI, for one, am in one way pleased that we can now turn our attention back to those issues that matter most to the people who live here.\u201dMr. Slay offered an optimistic view of what could be done with a stadium without a full-time tenant.\u201cWe will be able to book more citywide conventions, which will help offset the revenue loss,\u201d he said.But in the short term, Mr. Slay said, the city will lose money. Ray Hartmann, a co-owner of St. Louis Magazine and a columnist, said he believed that the long-term economic effect of the Rams\u2019 leaving would be minimal.\u201cIt\u2019s the same as losing any company of a couple hundred folks that did a lot of charity work,\u201d said Mr. Hartmann, 63, who has lived here nearly his entire life.He added that the city struggled economically even with the team here. Its population dipped to less than 320,000 residents, according to the 2010 census, an 8 percent drop from a decade earlier.St. Louis\u2019s downtown remains stable with busy office towers, businesses and bars, including an entertainment village right outside Busch Stadium, where the Cardinals play. But long gone are the days when this was a manufacturing hub that built cars and airplanes. St. Louis has been recovering from the recession at a slower rate than the rest of the country.But even if the economy remains steady, Mr. Hartmann said, the loss of the Rams could hurt the city\u2019s already bruised morale.\u201cIt\u2019s a big emotional loss,\u201d he said.D.

{"Headline": "The Anxieties of Impotence", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "Supported byAs Orwell walked, gun in hand, toward the elephant, a crowd of over 2,000 Burmese gathered behind him. They hated him, but it would be a diverting spectacle to see an elephant shot and they could use the meat. Orwell didn\u2019t want to shoot the poor creature, whose \u201cmust,\u201d or frenzied state, had passed and who was peacefully eating grass. But he felt the pressure of the crowd behind him. They\u2019d laugh at him if he didn\u2019t kill the thing.\u201cI was only an absurd puppet pushed to and fro by the will of those yellow faces behind,\u201d Orwell wrote. And so he subjected the animal to a long and agonizing death.In his essay nobody feels like they have any power. The locals, the imperial victims, sure didn\u2019t. Orwell, the guy with the gun, didn\u2019t feel like he had any. The imperialists back in London were too far away.That\u2019s sort of the way much of the world is today. As Anand Giridharadas writes in The International New York Times, \u201cIf anything unites America in this fractious moment it is a widespread sentiment that power is somewhere other than where you are.\u201dThese days people seem to underestimate their own power or suffer from what Giridharadas calls the \u201canxiety of impotence.\u201dSometimes when groups feel oppressed, they organize by coming up with concrete reform proposals to empower themselves. The Black Lives Matter movement is doing this.But in other cases the feeling of absolute powerlessness can corrupt absolutely. As psychological research has shown, many people who feel powerless come to feel unworthy, and become complicit in their own oppression. Some exaggerate the weight and size of the obstacles in front of them. Some feel dehumanized, forsaken, doomed and guilty.Today we live in a world of isolation and atomization, where people distrust their own institutions. In such circumstances many people respond to powerlessness with pointless acts of self-destruction.In the Palestinian territories, for example, young people don\u2019t organize or work with their government to improve their prospects. They wander into Israel, try to stab a soldier or a pregnant woman and get shot or arrested \u2014 every single time. They throw away their lives for a pointless and usually botched moment of terrorism.In a different way, the American election has been perverted by feelings of powerlessness.Americans are beset by complex, intractable problems that don\u2019t have a clear villain: technological change displaces workers; globalization and the rapid movement of people destabilize communities; family structure dissolves; the political order in the Middle East teeters, the Chinese economy craters, inequality rises, the global order frays, etc.To address these problems we need big, responsible institutions (power centers) that can mobilize people, cobble together governing majorities and enact plans of actions. In the U.S. context that means functioning political parties and a functioning Congress.Those institutions have been weakened of late. Parties have been rendered weak by both campaign finance laws and the Citizens United decision, which have cut off their funding streams and given power to polarized super-donors who work outside the party system. Congress has been weakened by polarization and disruptive members who don\u2019t believe in legislating.Instead of shoring up these institutions, many voters are inclined to make everything worse. Plagued by the anxiety of impotence many voters are drawn to leaders who pretend that our problems could be solved by defeating some villain. Donald Trump says stupid elites are the problem. Ted Cruz says it\u2019s the Washington cartel. Bernie Sanders says it\u2019s Wall Street.The fact is, for all the problems we may have with Wall Street or Washington, our biggest problems are systemic \u2014 the disruptions caused by technological progress and globalization, mass migration, family breakdown and so on. There\u2019s no all-controlling Wizard of Oz to slay.If we\u2019re to have any hope of addressing big systemic problems we\u2019ll have to repair big institutions and have functioning parties and a functioning Congress. We have to discard the anti-political, anti-institutional mood that is prevalent and rebuild effective democratic power centers.This requires less atomization and more collective action, fewer strongmen but greater citizenship. It requires the craft of political architecture, not the demagogy of destruction.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Needs to Keep Countries on Democratic Path", "Date": "2016-01-17", "News": "Supported byPolitical EconomyAs if the European Union didn\u2019t have enough to worry about. Its latest concern is that the Polish and Greek governments may be flouting the rule of law.The flood of refugees, the risk that Britain may quit the European Union, and the euro crisis are bad enough. But if countries in what is supposedly a club of liberal democracies undermine the rule of law, it contravenes a core value. What\u2019s more, if people can\u2019t rely on the rule of law, it is bad for investment.The Polish situation has garnered the most headlines. Last week, the European Commission started a preliminary assessment of whether Poland\u2019s new right-wing nationalist government was complying with the rule of law.This was partly because the government passed a law in December requiring the country\u2019s constitutional court to secure a two-thirds majority for most of its rulings, rather than a simple majority. Critics said this neutered the court as a check on government power.Then, this month, the government in Warsaw pushed through a law giving it the power to appoint the heads of state-run broadcasters. The next day it parachuted in a former member of Parliament from the governing party to run state television.Poland seems to be following a playbook pioneered by Hungary, whose nationalist government reduced the power of its top court and undermined the independence of its central bank earlier in the decade. Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister, said last week that he would block any proposed European Union sanctions against Poland.The European Union is founded on a series of principles that include democracy and the rule of law. When a country flouts these values, the Union can, as a last resort, remove that government\u2019s right to vote on Union matters.Although the European Commission has only started a preliminary investigation, this has already provoked a war of words. One Polish minister compared European Union \u201csupervision\u201d to the Nazi occupation in World War II.Investors have reacted badly. The zloty fell to a four-year low against the euro on Friday after Standard & Poor\u2019s cut the country\u2019s credit rating, saying the government had weakened the independence of major institutions.Now look at Greece. The chief executive of Piraeus Bank, the country\u2019s largest lender, resigned on Friday after rumors circulated that the government, led by the leftist Syriza party, was putting pressure on him to quit via the head of the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund, the vehicle that receives bailout money and injects it into Greece\u2019s banks. Piraeus\u2019s shares fell 22 percent in two days.When these rumors started circulating, Paulson & Co., a hedge fund that owns more than 9 percent of Piraeus, wrote to the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund to complain. It said it had invested in the bank in last month\u2019s share issue on the understanding that Anthimos Thomopoulos, whom it rated as \u201chighly capable,\u201d would remain as chief executive. John Paulson, the hedge fund\u2019s founder and manager, argued that the stability fund would not have the authority to request the chief executive\u2019s resignation and that, if it had delivered such a request on behalf of the government, it \u201cwould clearly have been in violation of the laws governing the HFSF and, in particular, safeguarding its independence from political interference.\u201dThe stability fund put out a statement on Thursday denying that it had made any such request. Later that day, the Eurogroup \u2014 the group of eurozone finance ministers \u2014 made clear that it wanted Greece to depoliticize its banks and public administration. Despite this, Mr. Thomopoulos resigned the following day.Given that the eurozone has lent Athens vast sums of money (some of it to recapitalize Piraeus Bank) and the European Central Bank is now Piraeus Bank\u2019s supervisor, there is a need to get to the bottom of what happened.There are also other worrying signs that the government of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras may be flouting the rule of law. Last year, it fired the head of the supposedly independent tax authority. It also passed a law giving the government more control over television broadcasting.Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who was elected leader of the opposition this month, said there had been an attempt \u201cto control the justice system, to tamper with independent authorities, to stuff the state with friends and family, and to roll back reforms in education.\u201dWhen Mr. Tsipras fired the tax boss, Greece\u2019s eurozone creditors barely murmured, despite the fact that tax evasion is one of the country\u2019s biggest problems. The European Commission seemingly didn\u2019t want to be too harsh on the government because it wanted to believe that its latest bailout plan, of 86 billion euros, or $94 billion, was working.But respect for the rule of law is probably even more important for Greece\u2019s economic future than balancing budgets and freeing up markets. It is also important for Poland\u2019s economy.The European Union is in a quandary over how to respond. It doesn\u2019t want to pick more quarrels when it is already fighting battles on multiple fronts. But if it turns a blind eye, bad behavior could spread.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Latest Sales Tax Controversy: Tampons", "Date": "2016-01-07", "News": "Supported byTax PolicyTwo members of California\u2019s state assembly are trying to give residents a tax break with a bill that would exempt tampons and sanitary napkins from the state\u2019s sales tax.There\u2019s precedent for this idea.Most sales taxes, including California\u2019s, exempt various necessities. Legislators have done this to shield lower-income consumers from tax on the things they must buy in daily life \u2014 like food. While 45 states collect a sales tax, only 13 of them charge it on groceries. Only one state \u2014 Illinois \u2014 charges sales tax on prescription drugs.As Cristina Garcia, a state Assembly member, points out, tampons are pretty necessary. \u201cYou can\u2019t just ignore your period,\u201d she said in a statement.Five states have already created tax exemptions for tampons. One, Pennsylvania, threw in a tax break for toilet paper and diapers, reasoning that these items also seemed pretty necessary.Individually, these exemptions make a lot of sense. But as arguments for tax exemptions have gotten sympathetic ears in state capitals over the decades, states\u2019 sales tax revenues have suffered.\u201cLegislatures always love to give the base away,\u201d said John Mikesell, an expert on sales taxes at the Indiana University School of Public and Environmental Affairs. By his calculations, the typical state sales tax is applied to just 36 percent of that state\u2019s residents\u2019 personal income in 2012, down from nearly 60 percent in the late 1970s.That means the average American spends less than half of his or her income on items subject to sales tax. In California, the sales tax is already narrower than the national average, applying to just 27 percent of state residents\u2019 incomes.Sales tax bases have shrunk over time partly because states have created new exemptions, partly because untaxed online sales have expanded, but most of all because the economy increasingly consists of services. Most state sales taxes exclude most services, and state lawmakers and voters have resisted efforts to tax services in part because many of the largest service categories (housing, medical care and education) can also be reasonably counted as life\u2019s necessities.\u201cIt\u2019d be nice if necessities weren\u2019t taxed, but necessity is subjective,\u201d says Joseph Henchman, who oversees state policy for the Tax Foundation, a conservative think tank that generally opposes sales tax exemptions. He notes that the nuanced arguments about what constitutes necessity have often led to very complicated sales tax rules.For example, the idea of exempting groceries from sales tax sounds simple enough, but most states want to continue collecting taxes on takeout and other prepared foods, on the grounds that having someone else cook for you is a luxury.As a result, they need to lay out rules explaining what is, and is not, a prepared food.It turns out, it\u2019s surprisingly hard to define the place where toiletries end and medication begins. Unlike most states, Illinois needs a rule saying that medicated lip balm is not medication, and neither is dandruff shampoo \u2014 not even the kind that smells like an industrial byproduct.Mr. Henchman noted one other reason to be wary of a tampon tax break: Sales taxes that exclude necessities and services tend to end up relying heavily on restaurant meals and durables like electronics and furniture, which are categories of spending that consumers cut back on when the economy weakens. This makes sales tax receipts more volatile, worsening the budget crises that arise in recessions.That is, one advantage of keeping the sales tax on tampons is that people will buy them whether the economy is good or bad \u2014 which is more or less exactly the same reason to exempt them from tax in the first place.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alibaba Searching for New Revenue Sources", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsAlibaba is benefiting from China\u2019s shift toward a consumer economy. The e-commerce group\u2019s earnings in the last three months of 2015 offer another insight into China\u2019s economy as well. Both the company and the country need to find new ways to grow.Revenue surged 32 percent year-on-year to $5.3 billion in the quarter, beating expectations. Transactions on Alibaba\u2019s online marketplaces grew 23 percent, the slowest expansion in more than three years. But the $175 billion company\u2019s \u201ctake rate\u201d \u2014 how much, as a share of transaction value, the company captures from advertising fees and commissions \u2013 increased to 3 percent at the end of 2015, compared to 2.7 percent in the same period in 2014. Advertisers and sellers are paying more to Alibaba even as volume growth declines.The company, founded by Jack Ma, is benefiting as Chinese consumers get richer. China\u2019s gross domestic product expanded 6.9 percent in 2015, the slowest pace in 25 years. Growth in property investment, a major driver of the economy, dropped to an unimpressive 1 percent \u2013 a seven-year low. The country\u2019s retail sales of consumer goods were up 10.7 percent, though. Add the continuing trend from bricks-and-mortar to online retailing, and that\u2019s positive for Alibaba\u2019s top-line growth story.As with China\u2019s economy, however, Alibaba\u2019s sheer size makes growth harder to come by. After years of expanding at a breakneck pace, the e-commerce group commands 80 percent of its market and is now making a push for rural shoppers. Mr. Ma and his colleagues are also seeking new sources of revenue in areas like food delivery and cloud computing. Revenue for the latter accounted for just 2 percent of the company\u2019s total, but it more than doubled to $126 million in the three months to December.Shares of Alibaba have fallen more than 15 percent since the start of the year. Rivals like JD.com and Baidu have experienced worse slumps. Alibaba\u2019s fortunes may increasingly decouple from China\u2019s macroeconomy, but that gives investors an even more challenging task trying to look into the company\u2019s future.Advertisement"}

The conversation was recounted by an American diplomat familiar with the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of angering the Chinese.Since coming to power in 2012, Mr. Xi has pushed the limits of Chinese foreign policy, challenging America\u2019s influence in the Pacific and using China\u2019s financial heft to win allies across the globe. But while Mr. Xi has taken a tougher approach than his predecessors on North Korea, he has resisted inflicting crippling punishments on the North, an ally for six decades and a valuable counterweight for Beijing to American military might in Asia.\u201cIf North Korea becomes an enemy state, it would have plenty of ways to harm China,\u201d said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. \u201cBeijing cannot afford to have North Korea become permanently hostile.\u201dAdding to the complications, Mr. Xi, 62, and Mr. Kim, believed to be 33, have a fraught relationship, say American, Chinese, and South Korean officials.North Korea claimed on Wednesday that it had tested a hydrogen bomb, the most powerful kind of nuclear weapon.\u201cXi has been through a very exacting training program where status comes from age,\u201d said Kerry Brown, a former British diplomat who is now director of the Lau China Institute at King\u2019s College London. \u201cHere we have this guy who is 33, who has been to Geneva for a couple years, who has got no executive experience whatsoever, basically running this parasitical economy, which isn\u2019t functioning very well.\u201dMr. Xi has long recognized China\u2019s sense of camaraderie with the North, which dates to their Korean War alliance in the 1950s. (Mao called the relationship \u201cas close as lips and teeth.\u201d) In a speech in 2010, when Mr. Xi was vice president, he called that conflict \u201ca just war\u201d and spoke of a \u201cfriendship forged by blood.\u201d His father, Xi Zhongxun, served as an envoy to North Korea for the Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping in the 1980s and had a close relationship with Kim Il-sung, the North\u2019s founding leader and Kim Jong-un\u2019s grandfather.But the two countries have followed starkly divergent paths. While China is now a sophisticated economy and a rising power, North Korea has become increasingly isolated, enfeebled and erratic, depending on China for most of its food and energy.Yang Xiyu, a former senior Chinese official who oversaw talks with North Korea, said the chance of a meeting between the two leaders, which was discussed privately by Chinese officials last year, was now \u201csharply reduced.\u201d\u201cThe nuclear test will seriously damage the bilateral relationship,\u201d Mr. Yang said. \u201cXi Jinping has been forced to be more assertive.\u201dIn an unusually public rebuke, Mr. Xi warned that no country should be able to throw the world into chaos for \u201cselfish gain.\u201d Later that year, he imposed sanctions, limiting shipments of materials used in weapons and cutting ties to some North Korean banks, though enforcement was lax.Mr. Xi has made clear to the North that its future lies in economic reform, not military development, and that China will not accept a nuclear state, current and former Chinese and American officials said. Increasingly, he has come to see the North as a liability, at odds with his vision of making China a pre-eminent superpower.\u201cKim has kept challenging China\u2019s fundamental interests, policies and the security of the whole northeast of Asia,\u201d Professor Shi said.In a sign of his displeasure, Mr. Xi has cultivated better relations with Ms. Park, the South Korean president, traveling to Seoul for a state visit in 2014. Those efforts seem in part aimed at undermining American power in Asia. Beijing considers Seoul the \u201cweakest link\u201d among American allies in the region, said Seong-Hyon Lee, an assistant professor at Kyushu University in Japan.Privately, officials at the Chinese Foreign Ministry have become more vocal about their distrust of the North and Mr. Kim, as unease among the Chinese public about the country\u2019s erratic ally has grown, American diplomats said.Jon M. Huntsman Jr., who served as the American ambassador to China from 2009 to 2011, said there was a generational divide among Chinese officials about how to deal with North Korea. \u201cThe older apparatchiks would defend the North Korean line,\u201d he said. \u201cThe younger ones wanted this issue to go away. There\u2019s no emotional connection, there\u2019s no war being waged.\u201dIn recent months, Mr. Xi extended several olive branches to Mr. Kim, concerned that the relationship had deteriorated to the point that Mr. Kim might lash out again, American and Chinese diplomats said. In October, Mr. Xi dispatched a top official to a military parade in Pyongyang, carrying a letter from Mr. Xi extolling Mr. Kim\u2019s achievements, which some officials viewed as a precursor to a meeting between the two leaders.John Delury, an associate professor at Yonsei University in Seoul, said those efforts showed that Mr. Xi could accept Mr. Kim\u2019s leadership of North Korea. \u201cBut what he needs and expects from Kim is to show the kind of deference that Korea, a \u2018small country,\u2019 owes China, a \u2018great power,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Delury wrote in an email. \u201cKim, for his own reasons, refuses to give it.\u201dAt the parade in October, Mr. Kim stood next to Mr. Xi\u2019s envoy, smiling and waving. He spoke of a \u201cblood-tied friendship\u201d and said that \u201cbilateral ties are more than neighborliness,\u201d according to coverage in the North Korean news media.\u201cTraditions should not be confined to history books,\u201d Mr. Kim said. \u201cThey should be carried out in practice.\u201dIn its report on the visit, Xinhua, the official news agency of the Chinese Communist Party, omitted Mr. Kim\u2019s remarks.Yufan Huang and Zhang Tiantian contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republican Candidates Grapple With a Touchy Topic: Poverty", "Date": "2016-01-12", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneNot even Democrats, who by Republicans\u2019 own admission pretty much own the subject, have dedicated this kind of campaign time to those at the very bottom of the ladder. The votes simply aren\u2019t there. And that\u2019s especially true for Republicans.What\u2019s going on? Those on the left will argue that Republicans offer nothing more than a poison pill to pre-empt effective actions to help the poor. But conservatives have a coherent theory about the causes of America\u2019s entrenched poverty that fits well with their underlying worldview: it\u2019s largely the government\u2019s fault.The War on Poverty, started by President Lyndon B. Johnson half a century ago, failed to end it, they say, even after spending trillions of dollars. Moreover, welfare weakened the poor\u2019s moral spine. It sapped their self-reliance, undermined their belief in family. The fear of losing benefits entangled the poor in a web of dependency, deterring them from seeking jobs.Moderated by House Speaker Paul Ryan, who has made poverty a signature issue, Republican candidates unequivocally proclaimed that conservatism offers a better shot at pulling people up from the bottom. The first, most critical step is to get the federal government out of the poverty business, take the money from federal welfare programs and hand it to the states, which are closer to the problem and will have better ideas.\u201cFrom the government standpoint, we have actually been building a trap,\u201d Mr. Ryan said.Trouble is, the evidence doesn\u2019t much mesh with this view.There are nuggets worth mining. Mr. Ryan, like President Obama, supports expanding the earned-income tax credit \u2014 a wage subsidy largely limited to poor working parents \u2014 to make it more generous to childless adults. On another front, the candidates at the forum here in Columbia highlighted how the draconian incarceration policies embraced on both sides of the ideological divide in the last several decades have helped entrench poverty.Moreover, the standard Republican prescription that government help must be attached to employment could fit a bipartisan antipoverty program, as long as there were a way to exempt those incapable of working and to ensure that there were in fact jobs for the poor to do.For Republicans to retake the White House, they need to come up with something more than bromides.\u201cWe as Republicans have to go back to campaigning in places where we are uncomfortable,\u201d argued Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey.The growing concentration of income at the top over the last 30 to 40 years is making it increasingly difficult to ignore the lopsided distribution of economic spoils. \u201cThe American idea is that the condition of your birth does not determine the outcome of your life,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cThere are a lot of people who do not believe it is there for them.\u201dRepublicans will try, but it is becoming hard for them to simply make the case for more growth, supposedly stimulated by more tax cuts, counting on its fruits to be shared widely. They will have a hard time arguing that a growing income gap will naturally spur workers to improve their education.Unwilling to tackle inequality per se \u2014 to view society as pitting the top 1 percent against the rest \u2014 the thinkers in the party have turned to poverty as a challenge with which they can more readily engage.\u201cThe conservative movement has not been involved enough in poverty and has given over the entire territory to the left,\u201d said Arthur C. Brooks, president of the nonprofit American Enterprise Institute, which co-sponsored the event, organized by the Jack Kemp Foundation.\u201cWe know that if conservatives capture the traits that are typically associated with liberals \u2014 empathy and compassion \u2014 that fact will swing independent, persuadable voters by 10 percentage points to the right,\u201d Mr. Brooks argued. \u201cThat\u2019s not something that can win. It\u2019s the only thing that will.\u201dStill, it is going to be difficult to pull this off, because many Republicans, particularly those who are financing the campaign, care more about other things.All of them provide most of their benefits to the rich.As an antipoverty strategy, it\u2019s impossible to square the circle of the largess of Republican tax plans and military spending plans with their parsimony everywhere else. As Senator Rubio of Florida noted: \u201cWhat the other side is going to say is the Republicans, the conservatives, they are just looking to gut the antipoverty programs.\u201dYes, they will. And Republicans\u2019 priorities are helping the other side make its case.Email: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Saudi Aramco I.P.O. Prospect Reflects Kingdom Looking Beyond Oil", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s biggest petroleum exporter, is staring into a future in which its most valuable asset \u2014 the oil under its sands \u2014 is shrinking in value.So, in a potential strategic shift made public this week, Saudi Arabia is considering a public offering of shares in its giant state-owned oil company, Saudi Aramco, or possibly some of its subsidiaries.While investors might want to think twice before snapping up shares backed by a diminishing asset \u2014 huge in value though that asset might be \u2014 the Saudi kingdom has many good reasons to seek to monetize at least some of its oil wealth and begin diversifying its economy.\u201cThere is a political agenda behind this,\u201d said Val\u00e9rie Marcel, an independent consultant and author of a book on national oil companies. \u201cI think they are responding to the expectations of a new generation.\u201dAs the Saudi kingdom is engaged in a face-off with Iran that has further escalated tensions in the Middle East, it is well aware of the need to address the rising desires of its own people, despite the erosion of Saudi Arabia\u2019s vast wealth.In the view of Ms. Marcel and other Saudi watchers, the country\u2019s new leadership is trying to use the oil price collapse over the last two years to remake the economy and shift away from an oil-funded, government-dominated system to one where private business has a larger role. The leaders were appointed by King Salman, who came to power early last year after the death of his brother King Abdullah.\u201cThey are using this crisis as an opportunity to make structural changes in the economy\u201d that should have been made several years ago, said Rachel Ziemba, an analyst at Roubini Global Economics in New York.As is the case with other major oil producers, Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil income, which furnishes about 90 percent of government revenue, has been slashed by the fall in oil prices \u2014 about $35 a barrel now, down from $110 in early 2014. Although the Saudis still have about $630 billion in financial reserves, they are burning them at a rate of $5 billion to $6 billion a month, Ms. Ziemba estimates.But analysts say that an effort to list a stake in Saudi Aramco would present enormous complications. For one thing, the company annually hands over more than 90 percent of its profit, on average, to the government. Public shareholders would demand a piece of that money, which the government has often used for public projects having little to do with oil.Because Saudi Aramco has many talented managers, the company often acts as prime contractor to put these big projects into effect, often with little regard to whether they are profitable. Saudi Aramco, for example, is a key contractor for Jazan Economic City, an industrial zone in an impoverished area in the southwest part of the country. The company also builds sports stadiums, including the King Abdullah Sports City in Jeddah.\u201cFrom a cost-benefit analysis, these are good projects, but for a private investor, they are not a good investment,\u201d said Paul Stevens, a Middle East oil analyst at Chatham House, a London-based research organization. Mr. Stevens said that while Saudi Aramco was generally well managed, it would be \u201ca lousy company for a private investor.\u201dIn addition, a public listing of Saudi Aramco would require detailed revelations of its financial performance, which are not provided now, as well as scrutiny of matters like the size of its oil reserves, which have been questioned in the past. \u201cI think they would never list the full company,\u201d said Ms. Marcel, the author. \u201cThe government would not want those finances to be exposed.\u201dInstead, Ms. Marcel and others think that the Saudi government is probably considering putting a small portion of Saudi Aramco on the market or perhaps a package of refineries and other assets.As to why would the government want to go to the trouble of listing the company and facing controversy, the answer might be economic diversification.With the country\u2019s oil wealth slowly dwindling, Prince Mohammad is looking for ways to cut the budget, find new revenue and energize the private sector. He and his aides have already taken steps that were long considered almost impossible politically, like raising gasoline prices. Price increases for electricity and water are in the works, as is a value-added tax, a radical step in a country that has no income tax. They are also considering selling other assets, like airports.\u201cThe government is under a great deal of fiscal pressure,\u201d said Farouk Soussa, a Middle East economist at Citigroup in London. \u201cThey are looking at what assets might give them the biggest bang for their buck.\u201dThe Saudi leadership also seems to be hunkering down for a long siege of oil prices around the current levels. If prices of $30 to $50 per barrel are the new normal, then the government is going to need to find other ways of financing economic growth.With more than half of the Saudi population younger than 25, a recent study by the consultants McKinsey warns of a coming demographic bulge that will require creating almost three times as many jobs for Saudis as were created during the oil boom of 2003-13. Otherwise unemployment, estimated at 12 percent, could soar, creating a potentially volatile political environment in a country that is near war-torn Syria and is engaged in fighting in Yemen, its neighbor to the south.\u201cThe private sector has to do more of the heavy lifting going forward,\u201d Mr. Soussa said.Other big oil companies that are listed on stock exchanges but remain government-controlled include Statoil of Norway. Ms. Marcel said that many governments of emerging-market countries are considering partial listings of their national oil companies as a way of opening up to public scrutiny and curbing corruption. But she warned that having so much power in the hands of the deputy crown prince is a source of concern.\u201cThe new master is too powerful,\u201d she said. \u201cWho is going to hold him to account?\u201dAn earlier version of this article erroneously attributed a distinction to Saudi Arabia. It is the world\u2019s largest petroleum exporter, not the largest petroleum producer.An article on Saturday about the possibility of a public offering of shares in Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia\u2019s giant state-owned oil company, misstated the proximity of Saudi Arabia to Syria. They are separated by Iraq and Jordan; they do not border each other.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "America\u2019s Best Days May Be Behind It", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneTake a look back at some of the most popular TV programs of the mid-1960s \u2014 \u201cThe Dick Van Dyke Show,\u201d \u201cBewitched,\u201d even \u201cThe Beverly Hillbillies\u201d \u2014 and what do you see?Like today, middle-class Americans typically had washing machines and air-conditioning, telephones and cars. The Internet and video games were not yet invented. But life, over all, did not look that different.There were TVs and radios in most homes. Millions of people worked in downtown offices and lived in suburbs, connected by multilane highways. Americans\u2019 average life expectancy at birth was 70, only eight years less than it is today.But flash back 50 years earlier. Then, less than half the population lived in cities. Though Ford Model T\u2019s were starting to roll off the assembly line, Americans typically moved around on horse-drawn buggies on dirt or cobblestone roads. Refrigerators or TVs? Most homes weren\u2019t even wired for electricity. And average life expectancy was only 53.Americans like to think they live in an era of rapid and unprecedented change, but this kind of comparison \u2014 pitting the momentous changes of the mid-20th century against the seemingly more modest progress of our present era \u2014 raises a critical question about the nation\u2019s future prosperity.What does this portend for our well-being over the next half century? Has technological progress slowed for good?The idea that America\u2019s best days are behind us sits in sharp tension with the high-tech optimism radiating from the offices of the technology start-ups and venture capital firms of Silicon Valley. But it lies at the heart of the current political unrest. And it is about to elbow its way forcefully into the national conversation.The hefty tome, minutely detailed yet dauntingly broad in scope, offers a lively portrayal of the evolution of American living standards since the Civil War. It also adds up to a dispiriting forecast for American prosperity in the decades to come. \u201cThis book,\u201d he writes in the introduction, \u201cends by doubting that the standard of living of today\u2019s youths will double that of their parents, unlike the standard of living of each previous generation of Americans back to the late 19th century.\u201dInnovation will trundle along at the same pace of the last 40 years, Professor Gordon predicts. Despite the burst of progress of the Internet era, total factor productivity \u2014 which captures innovation\u2019s contribution to growth \u2014 rose over that period at about one-third the pace of the previous five decades.That\u2019s hardly the worst part of the story. The labor force will continue to decline, as aging baby boomers leave the work force and women\u2019s labor supply plateaus. And gains in education, an important driver of productivity that expanded sharply in the 20th century, will contribute little.Moreover, the growing concentration of income means that whatever the growth rate, most of the population will barely share in its fruits. Altogether, Professor Gordon argues, the disposable income of the bottom 99 percent of the population, which has expanded about 2 percent per year since the late 19th century, will expand over the next few decades at a rate little above zero.Science has piggybacked on technology ever since Galileo used a telescope to develop a new understanding of the heavens. This new science, in turn, led to new technological innovations.What Professor Gordon fails to account for, Professor Mokyr argues, is that the information technology revolution and other recent developments produced mind-blowing tools and techniques, from gene-sequencing machines to computers that analyze mountains of data at blistering speed. This is creating vast new opportunities for innovation, from health care to materials technology and beyond.\u201cThe tools available to science have been improving at a dazzling rate,\u201d he told me. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how, but the world of technology in 30 to 40 years\u2019 time will be vastly different than it is today.\u201dNonetheless, Professor Gordon\u2019s argument is not easy to dismiss. He does not forecast that technological progress will slow to a crawl. His argument, rather, is that the explosion of innovation and prosperity from 1920 through 1970 was a one-time phenomenon. From now on, progress will continue at the more gradual pace of both the last 40 years and the period before 1920.\u201cThere is plenty of room in my forecast for evolutionary change,\u201d he told me. \u201cWhat is lacking is sharp, discrete change.\u201dProfessor Gordon\u2019s view of slowing technological opportunities meshes with other bits of evidence.\u201cPeople who invest money in the markets are saying the rate of return on capital investments is lower than it was 15 or 30 years ago,\u201d Mr. Bernanke said. \u201cGordon\u2019s forecast is not without some market reality.\u201dSkepticism is warranted, to be sure. Since the time of Thomas Malthus, eras of depressed expectations like our own have inspired predictions of doom and gloom that were proved wrong once economies turned up a few years down the road.Optimism, though, is also subject to cognitive biases. It\u2019s not just that the income of our optimistic techno-entrepreneurs is growing faster than gross domestic product. A lot of new innovation \u2014 the rockets to vacations in orbit, the Apple Watch and Google Glass \u2014 also seems custom-designed for them.\u201cIf you are sitting in Silicon Valley, rich and at the frontier of technology,\u201d said Lawrence F. Katz of Harvard, \u201cit is probably true that things are getting better.\u201dThe same can\u2019t always be said for the rest of us.Email: eporter@nytimes.com;\nTwitter: @portereduardo Advertisement"}

By 15, he said in an interview conducted in a jungle clearing by the actor and director Sean Penn for Rolling Stone magazine, he had begun to grow marijuana and poppies because there was no other way for his impoverished family to survive.\u00a0Now, unapologetically, he said: \u201cI supply more heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine and marijuana than anybody else in the world. I have a fleet of submarines, airplanes, trucks and boats.\u201d\u00a0Though his fortune, estimated at $1 billion, has come with a trail of blood, he does not consider himself a violent man. \u201cLook, all I do is defend myself, nothing more,\u201d he told Mr. Penn. \u201cBut do I start trouble? Never.\u201dThe seven hours Mr. Guzm\u00e1n spent with Mr. Penn, and the follow-up interviews by phone and video \u2014 which began in October while he was on the run \u2014 marked another surreal turn in his long-running effort to evade the Mexican and American authorities. Mr. Guzm\u00e1n, one of the world\u2019s most wanted fugitives, who had twice escaped jail, was captured in his home state of Sinaloa in northwest Mexico on Friday after a gun battle with the authorities.The interviews were held in a jungle clearing atop a mountain at an undisclosed location in Mexico. Surrounded by more than 100 cartel troops, and wearing a silk shirt and pressed black jeans, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n sat down to dinner with Mr. Penn and Kate del Castillo, a Mexican actress who once played a drug kingpin in the soap opera \u201cLa Reina del Sur,\u201d according to Rolling Stone.\u00a0Here is what you need to know about the secret mountaintop meeting between Sean Penn and the drug lord Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Loera, also known as \u201cEl Chapo.\u201dEven though Mexican troops attacked his hide-out in the days after the meeting, necessitating a narrow escape, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n continued the interview by BlackBerry Messenger and in a video delivered by courier to the pair later.\u00a0In the end, the Mexican authorities said Friday night that Mr. Guzm\u00e1n had been caught partly because he had been planning a movie about his life, and had contacted actors and producers, which had helped the authorities to track him down. Mr. Penn\u2019s story says Mr. Guzm\u00e1n, inundated with Hollywood offers while in prison, had indeed elected to make his own movie. Ms. del Castillo, whom he contacted through his lawyer after she posted supportive messages on Twitter, was the only person he trusted to shepherd the project, the story says. Mr. Penn heard about the connection with Ms. del Castillo through a mutual acquaintance, and asked if he might do an interview.\u00a0It is not clear whether the contacts described in the story are the ones that led to Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s arrest. Mr. Penn wrote that he had gone to great lengths to maintain security while arranging to meet Mr. Guzm\u00e1n. He described labeling cheap \u201cburner\u201d phones, \u201cone per contact, one per day, destroy, burn, buy, balancing levels of encryption, mirroring through Blackphones, anonymous email addresses, unsent messages accessed in draft form.\u201d Nevertheless, he wrote, \u201cThere is no question in my mind but that DEA and the Mexican government are tracking our movements,\u201d referring to the United States Drug Enforcement Administration. A Mexican government official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe confidential matters, said the authorities were aware of the meeting with Mr. Penn.Mr. Penn and Mr. Guzm\u00e1n spoke for seven hours, the story reports, at a compound amid dense jungle. Mr. Guzm\u00e1n does not speak English, and the interview was conducted in Spanish through translators.It was not immediately clear what the ethical and legal considerations of the article might be. In a disclosure that ran with the story, Rolling Stone said it had changed some names and withheld some locations. An understanding was reached with Mr. Guzm\u00e1n, it said, that the story would be submitted for his approval, but he did not request any changes. The magazine declined to comment further Saturday.A Mexican official said late Saturday that all actors and producers who met with Mr. Guzman, which includes Mr. Penn, were under investigation. But it remained unclear whether the circumstances of the meeting were the subject of inquiry or the individuals themselves would face scrutiny from the Mexican government.See the route that Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Loera, a drug kingpin known as El Chapo, used to escape from Mexico\u2019s most secure prison.The topics of conversation turned in unexpected directions. At one stage, Mr. Penn brought up Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential candidate; there were some reports that Mr. Guzm\u00e1n had put a $100 million bounty on Mr. Trump after he made comments offensive to Mexicans. \u201cAh! Mi amigo!\u201d Mr. Guzm\u00e1n responded.\u00a0In a wider-ranging interview, for which Mr. Penn submitted questions that were put to Mr. Guzm\u00e1n on video by one of his associates, he detailed his childhood and said he had tried drugs during his life but had never been an addict and had not touched them for 20 years. He said that he was happy to be free, and that the pressure of evading the authorities was normal for him.\u00a0Pushed on the morality of his business, he said it was a reality \u201cthat drugs destroy.

{"Headline": "U.S. Growth and Employment Data Tell Different Stories", "Date": "2016-01-17", "News": "Supported byThink of it as the looking-glass economy.\u201cIt is a real mystery how you can have nearly 300,000 new jobs created in December with the economy growing by 1 percent or less,\u201d said Torsten Slok, chief international economist for Deutsche Bank Securities in New York. \u201cWe can\u2019t have this discrepancy for a long period of time.\u201dThe divergence in the data is not just a puzzle for Wall Street. With the 2016 presidential candidates about to face their first test with voters, the split is also shaping the campaign debate of Democrats and Republicans alike.The explanation for this dissonance may lie at least in part in the changing nature of the American economy.Indeed, a crucial cause of the split is that the sectors that have been hardest hit \u2014 manufacturing and energy production \u2014 nowadays count for much less in terms of employment than they do in output.The nation\u2019s vast array of service industries, which are more labor-intensive, are actually doing far better, said Laura Rosner, senior United States economist at BNP Paribas.And the thriving, domestically driven sectors like restaurants, health care, and professional and business services are serving as a firewall protecting the American economy from growing turbulence overseas.\u201cWe are predominantly a services economy,\u201d Ms. Rosner said. \u201cIn 2016, the test will be how service industries fare, and if hiring holds up.\u201dLast year, employment in services, which account for 86 percent of the American work force, jumped by more than 2.3 million, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Manufacturing, which accounts for a mere 9 percent of employment these days, experienced an increase of just 13,000 jobs.Given the recent numbers for hiring, said Michael Gapen of Barclays, the job market appears to be fundamentally sound. For those seeking to discern the future direction of the economy, he added, \u201clabor markets have sent the better signal.\u201dAnd according to those in a position to know, like Tom Gimbel, a Chicago recruiter, demand for new workers remains brisk.\u201cI\u2019ve got more open job orders than I\u2019ve had in a long, long time,\u201d Mr. Gimbel said. His staffing company, LaSalle Network, places workers ranging from operators in call centers who hold just a high school diploma to specialists like accountants and engineers with salaries in the six figures.Small to medium companies, in particular, are providing the growth. \u201cIt\u2019s a tale of two cities,\u201d Mr. Gimbel said. \u201cWith big companies being more cautious, there\u2019s an opportunity for smaller firms to hire and take market share.\u201dOverall growth last year was dragged down by weakness in trade and the factory sector, reflecting the sting of the strong dollar on exporters and softness in key markets like Europe and China, Mr. Gapen said.\u201cConsumption was likely held back by transitory factors,\u201d Mr. Gapen said. Based on the data reported so far, he estimates the economy expanded by a mere 0.3 percentage point in the fourth quarter of 2015, even worse than the anemic 0.6 percentage point gain recorded in the first quarter of last year.In a parallel to the broader split, Ms. Rosner of BNP Paribas does not think the economy grew at all last quarter \u2014 but she thinks it could actually pick up momentum and expand faster than expected in the first half of 2016.\u201cThe resources are there to support more consumer spending because of hiring,\u201d she said.To be sure, some experts are not convinced that healthy payroll increases necessarily portend faster growth, arguing that the economy is on very shaky ground.\u201cPeople commonly use employment as a leading indicator,\u201d said David A. Levy, a veteran independent economist in Mount Kisco, N.Y., \u201cbut it\u2019s a lagging indicator.\u201dMr. Levy said the optimists were underestimating just how big the impact from weakness overseas will be.\u201cThe U.S. economy is going to be pulled into a recession for the first time since World War II by overseas events,\u201d he said. \u201cEmerging markets, including China, are this cycle\u2019s housing bubble.\u201dNo matter who is right about this year, another conundrum faces economists looking at long-term trends. Experts like Mr. Slok at Deutsche Bank are concerned that weak productivity growth may lift hiring now but ultimately undermine future prosperity.At many companies, there is not much room left to cut costs or improve efficiency, but executives remain hesitant about investing heavily in new machines and technology that would increase output. That means adding more workers, he explained.While that is certainly beneficial for employment, without productivity gains the economy\u2019s real potential will continue to go unrealized.With the annual pace of growth in the current recovery averaging 2 percent \u2014 well below the trajectory of past expansions \u2014 and future projections not looking much better, some prominent economists say the United States has settled into a lengthy period of what they term \u201csecular stagnation.\u201dThe surge in hiring late last year could be a sign that the American economy has better days ahead. But no one says it\u2019s a sure thing.\u201cHaving 300,000 more consumers last month is unambiguously good news for the U.S. economy,\u201d Mr. Slok said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve argued for several years that we haven\u2019t been in secular stagnation and I\u2019ve been wrong.\u201dDespite a few prominent pockets of weakness, like manufacturing or energy industry investment, demand for the services that consumers want remains healthy, and that ultimately is what now drives the American economy, said Drew T. Matus, an economist at UBS Securities.\u201cExports look worse and demand for goods is volatile but services are holding up,\u201d Mr. Matus said. \u201cIf people aren\u2019t worried about buying a coffee or going to the doctor or the barbershop, there\u2019s less of a reason to worry.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Too Big to Fail\u2019 Banks Thriving a Few Years After Financial Crisis", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "Supported byStreet SceneNearly eight years after the onset of the financial crisis, its unintended consequences continue to startle and amaze.For instance, who would have thought that many of the big European banks \u2013 among them Barclays, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and UBS \u2013 would have new chief executives, two of whom are American, and be more or less in retreat from the global investment banking business?Who would have thought that the big banks would pay nearly $200 billion in fines and other considerations to various branches of federal and state governments and that not a single top Wall Street executive would be held responsible for perpetrating the wrongdoing represented by those huge fines?(The lone related exception is Kareem Serageldin, a former senior trader at Credit Suisse who inflated the value of his trading positions to receive a bigger bonus; he will be released from federal prison in March.)And who would have thought that nearly a decade after the start of the crisis some of those big banks, in particular JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, would have year after year of record, or near-record, profits?These days, the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d banks have less competition than ever, they get their raw material \u2014 cash from depositors \u2014 nearly free and they have never had more ways to make vast amounts of money.In other words, despite the endless complaining about how difficult Washington has made things for bankers, we have entered a new Golden Age of Wall Street, where competition is minimal, profits will continue to be high (as long as the economy continues its rebound) and regulation, while present as never before, can be \u201cmanaged\u201d as just another cost of doing business.No wonder the chief executives of JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America are in no hurry to give up their posts, much to the frustration of their direct reports. It\u2019s another surprising consequence of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression: Wall Street chiefs who stick around.Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks\u2019 bottom lines.Jamie Dimon, 59, has been chief executive of JPMorgan Chase for 10 years. He\u2019s not going anywhere, as he has made abundantly clear. He seems reinvigorated after surviving throat cancer last year; his bank just reported its highest net income ever in 2015, of $24.4 billion. He also has seen the departure of a steady stream of potential successors to lead other institutions \u2013 among them, William Winters to Standard Chartered, Jes Staley to Barclays, Charles W. Scharf to Visa and Frank Bisignano to First Data.There\u2019s little doubt the JPMorgan Chase bench is deep, but at the moment, there is no obvious Dimon lieutenant with Mr. Dimon\u2019s stature, and it\u2019s reasonable to think he prefers it that way.At Goldman Sachs, the leadership dynamic is slightly different. Like Mr. Dimon, Lloyd C. Blankfein, 61, has been chairman and chief executive a long time, since June 2006, when his predecessor, Henry M. Paulson Jr., left the company to become George W. Bush\u2019s Treasury secretary. Mr. Blankfein steered Goldman through the worst of the financial crisis in impressive fashion \u2014 including years of record profits, since diminished \u2014 while also overcoming a tsunami of awful publicity.In September 2015, Mr. Blankfein announced that he had a \u201chighly curable\u201d form of lymphoma and, according to Gary D. Cohn, the Goldman president and chief operating officer who has been thrust into the role of Prince Charles for nearly a decade, Mr. Blankfein is \u201cin the office every day\u201d and \u201cengaged.\u201d The days he is not in the office, \u201che\u2019s on the phone all day long,\u201d Mr. Cohn said.Mr. Cohn has said his relationship with Mr. Blankfein has never been better, even though many have wondered how long he will wait for his chance to run Goldman. A few weeks ago, The New York Post reported that Mr. Blankfein, who has declined recent requests for interviews, made a rare appearance at the annual Goldman alumni event, where he seemed to be his \u201cold jovial self\u201d and reportedly said he intended to be running Goldman for \u201ca long time to come.\u201dAt Morgan Stanley, 2016 ushered in an old-fashioned power play. James P. Gorman, 57, the bank\u2019s chief executive for the last six years, conveyed to employees his intention to stay put for at least another five. He also announced that he was appointing Colm Kelleher the company\u2019s sole president. (Mr. Kelleher, a year older than Mr. Gorman, is unlikely to succeed him if Mr. Gorman sticks around for the full five years.)What is increasingly clear is that we have come to yet another fork in the road on Wall Street. Under new leadership, the big European banks are desperately looking for ways to make money outside of the capital-intensive businesses of trading and investment banking. The big American banks, however, will continue to rule the roost in investment banking, free of material competition in any business that requires capital, and, for the time being, without any meaningful change in leadership at the top.Given that the 2008 financial crisis started because Wall Street banks packaged shoddy mortgages on a withering number of American homes and then sold them as securities around the globe, this is a particularly surprising and unexpected outcome.William D. Cohan is a former senior mergers and acquisitions banker who has written three books about Wall Street. His latest book is \u201cThe Price of Silence: The Duke Lacrosse Scandal, the Power of the Elite, and the Corruption of Our Great Universities.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Signs of a Retail Rebound as Consumers Take On More Debt", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byConsumer debt is rising. How Americans handle that load and how much cash they spend will determine the fortunes of an important stock sector.Stocks that benefit from consumer spending \u2014 including those in categories like autos, home furnishings, retailers and restaurants \u2014 have been very strong performers recently. Over the three years through December, consumer discretionary stocks returned more than 18 percent annually, on average, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.But what does the future hold for this sector? On the positive side, unemployment rates continue to decline, wages have grown modestly among lower-income earners, and plummeting energy prices have given consumers more spending firepower.Consumer debt cuts both ways, of course. In moderation, it can help encourage economic activity. Carried too far, it can create bubbles that threaten the economy. Some analysts say debt is still in the helpful stages and consumer spending therefore has room for nontoxic growth. \u201cWe still see the consumer leading economic growth,\u201d said Sam Stovall, United States equity strategist with S&P Capital IQ. He predicted consumer spending would grow 3.1 percent in 2016, spurred by gains in jobs and wages.Jay Nogueira, head of the global consumer sector for T. Rowe Price, was cautiously bullish about the consumer discretionary sector. Credit card debt per household is $6,900, he said, placing it only at 2004 levels, well below the 2007 peak of $8,600. In addition, he said, \u201cHousing is set up for a long and steady recovery, as opposed to boom and bust.\u201d He favors stocks like Home Depot, Williams-Sonoma, Whirlpool and Mohawk Industries.One argument for a continuing housing rebound comes from Brad Sorensen, head of market and sector analysis for the Schwab Center for Financial Research. Homeownership peaked before the financial crisis at 69 percent, he said, and has fallen to about 63 percent. There is room for growth, he said.But even bulls on consumer spending see areas of concern. For example, auto lending has emerged as a highly profitable area for banks, and just about anyone can get a car loan these days, said Ernesto Ramos, head of equities for BMO Global Asset Management. \u201cOnce you walk into a showroom, money will be no object,\u201d he said.Similarly, Mr. Sorensen warned: \u201cThe standards have loosened, and all people are able to get loans. They are letting the weakly creditworthy get loans.\u201dMark Hamrick, senior economic analyst with Bankrate.com, said only a small fraction of auto loans were made at the zero percent interest rates trumpeted on television. In an auto showroom recently, he said, a salesman told him that at that moment the dealership was negotiating several loans at \u201c20 percent or above.\u201dStill, auto loans are not that big, in aggregate, compared with housing debt. Statistics from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York show that auto loans increased by more than 12 percent from the third quarter of 2014 to the third quarter of 2015. That left the total of auto credit at $1.05 trillion, a small fraction of the more than $8 trillion of mortgage debt.Also of concern for the consumer sector, some large retailers have had disappointing performances recently. Among the worst hit was Macy\u2019s. Its stock has fallen to roughly $35 a share from a mid-July peak above $70.Mr. Nogueira of T. Rowe Price said the sell-off had gone too far. \u201cI think it\u2019s an overreaction,\u201d he said. One big reason for poor sales at Macy\u2019s and other chain stores was the warm November and December weather, he said. Macy\u2019s has also been hurt by the strong dollar, which has depressed its traditionally robust tourist business.The level of prevailing interest rates will affect consumer spending, but the impact of the Federal Reserve\u2019s recent increase in short-term rates is far from clear. Mr. Stovall said that even if the Fed continued to raise rates, they were likely to remain very low for some time.It is even possible that if inflation increases as the Fed expects, real interest rates will lag, essentially giving consumers negative inflation-adjusted interest rates down the road. That would be good news for borrowers and for an economy that depends on hefty but manageable consumer debt. \u201cConsumers will be leading the way in economic growth,\u201d Mr. Stovall said. Investors in the consumer discretionary sector will certainly hope so.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Airbnb Takes Its Case to U.S. Mayors Conference", "Date": "2016-01-21", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Chris Lehane, Airbnb\u2019s head of global policy, appeared on Thursday before hundreds of American mayors with an enticing pitch: Team up with us to collect millions of dollars in taxes for you.On Wednesday, however, the head of the hotel industry\u2019s lobbying group had sent the same audience a very different message: Airbnb isn\u2019t a good partner; it is breaking your city laws.The heated battle between Airbnb, the popular room-sharing app, and the hotel industry is playing out in city halls across the country, including those in New York and Los Angeles, which have either passed or are considering restrictions on the service. Airbnb has fought back with a political ground campaign led by former White House advisers like Mr. Lehane, deploying them to small towns and organizing the company\u2019s dedicated hosts and guests to protest restrictions.This week, those differences are being aired at the United States Conference of Mayors, an event attended by local politicians with heavy influence over the future of the fast-changing lodging industry.The appeals are taking many forms. Airbnb and the American Hotel & Lodging Association are both leading sponsors of the winter meeting, for example. But perhaps the sharpest debate is over numbers and facts.In the speech on Thursday, Mr. Lehane asked mayors to team up with the company. In turn, Airbnb would begin to collect taxes. It now collects hotel, tourist and occupancy taxes, totaling around $42 million, in 16 cities and jurisdictions. And, according to a study commissioned by the company that Mr. Lehane presented, if the 50 biggest American cities teamed up with Airbnb, that number would rise to $200 million a year in taxes.\u201cWe want to demonstrate a seriousness of purpose\u201d to city leaders, Mr. Lehane said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m not aware of any company standing up at the U.S. Conference of Mayors and saying, \u2018Please tax us.\u2019\u201dKatherine Lugar, president of the hotel association, on Wednesday presented a study her own group had commissioned. It said that an estimated $500 million in revenue had been collected by Airbnb hosts, whom the hotel group described as essentially professional landlords renting out rooms full time, a violation of many local laws.\u201cOur data is showing a tremendous growth of commercial operators who are exploiting sites like Airbnb to avoid paying taxes, following zoning rules and following basic laws for health and safety,\u201d Ms. Lugar said in an interview.The dueling data are not particularly new for these two sides. (Each says the other\u2019s numbers have problems, too.) The data does show, though, how intense and local the debates about Airbnb have become.Several mayors at the conference said their cities were struggling with laws that address the growing concerns about companies like Airbnb and Uber. The mayors of Columbus, Ohio; East Hartford, Conn.; and Aurora, Colo., described Airbnb\u2019s offer to collect taxes as a first step.Marcia A. Leclerc, the mayor of East Hartford, said Airbnb was banned in her city of 51,000. She said the city\u2019s leaders wanted to see more efforts to ensure that guests receive the same level of safety and health guarantees as hotels.\u201cThere is a reason why hotels are trusted brands,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause they have so many more regulations, and we\u2019d want to see the same kinds of assurances from Airbnb.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s different about Airbnb and other sharing-economy firms is that the wall between market strategy and nonmarket strategy like politics is completely broken down,\u201d said Edward T. Walker, an associate professor of sociology at U.C.L.A. and the author of \u201cGrassroots for Hire,\u201d a book about industry campaigns to mobilize the public for political advocacy. \u201cA lot of the action is on the local level, where you need a municipal strategy in place which requires a huge amount of specific local knowledge.\u201dMr. Lehane is trying to replicate some of that success, organizing 100 clubs around the world to act as resources for Airbnb supporters who are protesting restrictions.\u201cThe fact that Airbnb is creating what is a grass-roots army to fight this out in local city councils and local legislative districts,\u201d Professor Walker said, \u201ctells you a lot about how much they know they need to win in all of those localities, each with its own politics and history and incumbent actors.\u201dThe company\u2019s most recent tactic has been to try to work with local cities to collect lodging taxes. But some municipalities are turning down the offer, saying the downsides of letting residents rent out rooms on Airbnb are not worth the trade-offs.Last month, despite Airbnb\u2019s hiring of local lobbyists and organizers, the Santa Barbara City Council voted for a ban on short-term rentals, saying guests using the service had become a nuisance and were squeezing residents out of the local housing market. Within an hour\u2019s drive from there, the City of Oxnard and Ventura County are proposing similar regulations. This week, the tiny wine town of Ojai unanimously approved rules that prevent short-term rentals on sites like Airbnb.\u201cWe could probably collect somewhere in the range of $6 million a year of taxes from website companies, but in the end we felt that in order to limit growth and preserve the local quality of life, we would have to make difficult choices,\u201d Gregg Hart, a Santa Barbara City Council member, said of the recent vote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018This Should Be Written in the Present Tense,\u2019 by Helle Helle", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "Supported byFor the last 20 years, Helle Helle\u2019s novels and short stories have made her a star in her native Denmark, where she regularly receives awards and acclaim. Denmark is also where, according to her biography, Helle \u201clives in a forest.\u201d What a fittingly magical dwelling for Helle, who \u2014 judging from her first novel to be translated into English, \u201cThis Should Be \u00adWritten in the Present Tense\u201d \u2014 has enchanting gifts as a storyteller.The book\u2019s protagonist is named Dorte. She\u2019s in her early 20s, and her life is a fog of existential ennui occasionally punctuated by tenuous connection. In short chapters covering various points over the last few years of her life, Dorte describes living with Per, an earnest guy she soon leaves for his more interesting cousin Lars, and sleeping with her neighbor Knud while his girlfriend\u2019s away. Dorte\u2019s parents, meanwhile, are present but perfunctory, about as effective as the authority figures in \u201cPeanuts.\u201d Only her Aunt Dorte provides genuine guidance and a source of solace, though their shared name has ambivalent origins: Dorte is named after her aunt \u201cbecause she couldn\u2019t have children of her own,\u201d effectively christening the protagonist\u2019s life from Day 1 as consolation for \u00adsomeone else\u2019s.Helle\u2019s prose, translated from the Danish by Martin Aitken, is at once frank in its directness and elusive in its selective \u00adeconomy. Much of the novel reads like this: \u201cI counted my money. I needed to get some more out. Shortly before half past 9 I went down to the bank. I bought an enormous ice cream from the sweet shop. I was the first customer of the day. I sat on the little square with the hanging baskets and ate it.\u201dNote how many of those sentences begin with \u201cI,\u201d and how many locations that \u201cI\u201d swiftly moves through, and how little time the reader gets to contemplate the significance of any of it. This is, on the surface, serviceable if not particularly remarkable prose, but it suits a character like Dorte by allowing her to gloss over certain events like sex or, in one instance, an abortion. Her ostensible honesty is a form of duplicity. Yet despite her attempts to hide herself, Dorte is the kind of narrator who doesn\u2019t understand just how revealing she\u2019s being.Something wonderfully unexpected happens as the pages turn. Despite the repetitive rhythms of Dorte\u2019s language, its flatness and its tendency to summarize, the cumulative effect is not boring but in fact quite hypnotic. It\u2019s such a \u00adquiet novel, the words so light they nearly float off the page; this, coupled with the brief chapters and the nonlinear structure, leaves the reader unanchored to the earth, drifting instead through the vast space of a mind. Some of the novel\u2019s efficacy has to do with occasional passages of soft but stunning power, but its real success lies wholly in the strange alchemy of Helle\u2019s storytelling. Although a majority of the book consists of nondramatic events described nondramatically, and although (as the title suggests) the past tense Dorte employs may as well be the present \u2014 although, in other words, even the narrator doesn\u2019t place much significance on the particular events of the text \u2014 \u201cThis Should Be Written in the Present Tense\u201d possesses an immediacy that tenderly and consistently compels.

{"Headline": "Climate Deal\u2019s First Big Hurdle: The Draw of Cheap Oil", "Date": "2016-01-25", "News": "Supported byIn China, government officials are also taking steps to ensure that the recent plunge in oil prices to under $30 a barrel does not undermine its programs to improve energy efficiency. Earlier this month, the country\u2019s top economic planning agency introduced a new regulation, effective immediately, aimed at deterring oil consumption.For the climate accord to work, governments must resist the lure of cheap fossil fuels in favor of policies that encourage and, in many cases, require the use of zero-carbon energy sources. But those policies can be expensive and politically unpopular, especially as traditional fuels become ever more affordable.\u201cThis will be a litmus test for the governments \u2014 whether or not they are serious about what they have done in Paris,\u201d said Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency.So far, there is no sign that the world\u2019s two largest energy consumers \u2014 the United States and China \u2014 are wavering. With those two countries staying the course, albeit in the early days since the signing, there is optimism among backers of the accord that the momentum is too strong to stop. And despite the recent turmoil in energy markets, renewable industries are prospering.A glut of crude oil on the markets is pushing the price of oil down to levels not seen since the global financial crisis.\u201cThe trend toward much greater penetration of low-carbon energy driven by policy and technological advancements is going to continue,\u201d said Jason Bordoff, director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University and a former top aide to President Obama. Despite the lower fuel costs, he added, \u201ctechnological alternatives and policy drivers that are reducing demand for fossil fuels are already really starting to take a bite.\u201dA few days ago, the Energy Department projected that total renewable power consumed in the United States this year will increase by 9.5 percent, and the longer-term outlook appears bright as costs continue to plummet and after congressional action last December extended federal tax credits for new wind and solar projects.In China, the world\u2019s biggest greenhouse gas emitter, the government implemented a new rule that no matter how low world crude oil prices may fall, the price of gasoline and diesel will continue to be set as though the world price of oil were still $40 a barrel. The goal is to prevent gasoline and diesel from becoming so cheap that China\u2019s citizens would start consuming it indiscriminately.China\u2019s heavily state-owned refining industry will also not be allowed to keep the extra profits from buying crude oil cheaply and selling gasoline and diesel as though the crude oil still cost $40 a barrel. Instead, the Chinese government will take the extra refining profit margin and put the money into a special fund for energy conservation and pollution control.But across the globe, the picture is not entirely rosy for zero-emission technologies.Low oil prices also jeopardize the development of alternative fuels to replace petroleum in transportation and industry, including the advanced biofuels that once looked so promising. Cheap oil also reduces the price of diesel, the primary competitor of renewables in spreading electricity generation to impoverished rural areas of Africa and Southeast Asia.The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.And if governments\u2019 support wanes, the alternative fuel industries could take a hit.\u201cThe challenge for governments is to continue appropriate clean energy subsidies even while the fossil fuel industry clamors over low prices,\u201d said Paul Bledsoe, who was a staff member of the White House Climate Change Task Force under former President Bill Clinton.Saudi Arabia, one of the top energy-consuming nations, this month increased gasoline prices by 50 percent, and natural gas for industry and electrical generation by 67 percent.Ultimately, supporters of the climate accord say that low oil prices can cut both ways in the march to renewables.\u201cIt\u2019s a double-edged sword,\u201d said Amy Myers Jaffe, executive director for energy and sustainability at the University of California, Davis. She noted that low oil prices were cutting investments in drilling, which meant fewer emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, at well sites, and \u201cit has clearly not slowed down the switch toward renewable energy.\u201dBut at the same time, Ms. Jaffe said, low gasoline prices make driving more attractive, and in larger vehicles as well.\u201cIt\u2019s crippling for electric cars,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause the thing that made you think about buying an electric car was it was so painful for you to fill up your car with gasoline that was so expensive.\u201dKeith Bradsher and Bill Vlasic contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Transcript of the Main Republican Presidential Debate", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byBRET BAIER: Nine p.m. on the East Coast. Eight o\u2019clock here in Des Moines, Iowa. Welcome to the seventh Republican presidential debate of the 2016 campaign. I\u2019m Bret Baier, along with my comoderators Megyn Kelly and Chris Wallace. KELLY: Tonight, we are coming to you live from the Iowa Event Center in downtown Des Moines, in the shadow of the Iowa state capitol. In just four days, people here in the Hawkeye State will caucus and cast the first votes of the 2016 election.CHRIS WALLACE: Tonight, we\u2019re partnering with Google for an exclusive second-screen experience. Search Fox News debate on Google any time in the next two hours to access exclusive content.BAIER: Google sees political searches spike during televised presidential debates \u2014 no surprise there. But they spike by more than 440 percent on average, as voters across America seek to learn more about what\u2019s happening on the live debate stage.MEGYN KELLY: Seven candidates are on that stage tonight, their position on the stage determined by their standing in the latest national polls, as well as polls in Iowa and New Hampshire. And here they are.Texas Senator Ted Cruz.(APPLAUSE)Florida Senator Marco Rubio.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson.(APPLAUSE)Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush.(APPLAUSE)New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Ohio Governor John Kasich.(APPLAUSE) And Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Apparently Iowa\u2019s near Kentucky.BAIER: Tonight\u2019s rules are simple. Up to 60 seconds for each answer, 30 seconds for each follow-up response. And if a candidate goes over the allotted time, you will hear this.(BELL RINGS)Double.KELLY: Wow.BAIER: I think the double is the one we want. Very pleasing.(LAUGHTER)We have a crowd of about 1,600 here, and while they have agreed to respect the candidates and listen intently, we can tell you they are very excited to be here. Am I right?(APPLAUSE)KELLY: So let\u2019s get started.Senator Cruz, before we get to the issues, let\u2019s address the elephant not in the room tonight.(LAUGHTER)Donald Trump has chosen not to attend this evening\u2019s presidential debate. What message do you think that sends to the voters of Iowa?CRUZ: Well, Megyn, let me say at the outset to the men and women of Iowa, thank you for the incredible hospitality over this past year.By Monday, you will have welcomed me into all 99 counties in Iowa. You will have welcomed my dad to preach at your churches. You will have welcomed Heidi and our girls, Caroline and Catherine, into your homes. And I\u2019m so grateful for the diligence, for the seriousness with which the men and women of Iowa approach this process.If I am elected president, keep an eye on the tarmac, because I\u2019ll be back, because Iowa in 2017 will not be fly-over country. It will be fly-to country.(APPLAUSE)Now, secondly, let me say I\u2019m a maniac and everyone on this stage is stupid, fat, and ugly. And Ben, you\u2019re a terrible surgeon.(LAUGHTER) Now that we\u2019ve gotten the Donald Trump portion out of the way...(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)I want to thank everyone here for showing the men and women of Iowa the respect to show up and make the case to the people of this state and the people of the country why each of us believe we would make the best commander in chief.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: The divide between you and Mr. Trump has turned into one of the biggest stories in the country. And for six months that \u2014 your campaign, during this campaign, you praised Mr. Trump as somebody who you thought was an effective voice against the Washington cartel. You said you were glad that he was running as a Republican.But when he started to criticize you, your message changed, and you suddenly started to portray him as the voice of the Washington cartel, and suggested he would do the Democrats\u2019 bidding. Which is it?CRUZ: Well, let me be clear, if Donald engages in insults or anybody else, I don\u2019t intend to reciprocate. I have not insulted Donald personally and I don\u2019t intend to.I am glad Donald is running. I\u2019m glad he has produced enormous enthusiasm, and, every Donald Trump voter or potential voter, I hope to earn your support. I know everyone else on this stage hopes to earn your support.Now, there is a difference between personal insults and attacks \u2014 between going into the mud with ad hominems and focusing on issues and substance. CRUZ: I think issues and substance, policy and vision and record should be the meat of politics. That\u2019s fair game but that\u2019s where I\u2019m going to focus. That\u2019s how I focused from the beginning of the campaign and it is how I intend to continue going forward.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Senator Rubio, I want to explore this sort of larger issue. The campaign has in a sense turned into a battle for the soul of the Republican party: establishment versus grassroots, pragmatic versus principle. You say that you can unite all of the factions inside the GOP. How?RUBIO: Chris, let\u2019s begin by being clear what this campaign is about. It\u2019s not about Donald Trump. He\u2019s an entertaining guy. He\u2019s the greatest show on earth. This campaign is about the greatest country in the world and a president who has systematically destroyed many of the things that made America special.You see, we usually elect presidents in America that want to change the things that are wrong in America. Barack Obama wants to change America. Barack Obama wants America to be more like the rest of the world. We don\u2019t want to be like the rest of the world. We want to be the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: That is why Hillary Clinton cannot win this election. Hillary Clinton this week said Barack Obama would make a great Supreme Court justice. The guy who systematically and habitually violates the constitution on the Supreme Court? I don\u2019t think so. If I\u2019m our nominee, I will unite this party and we\u2019ll defeat Hillary Clinton and we will turn this country around once and for all, after seven years of the disaster that is Barack Obama.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Governor Bush, it\u2019s hard for anyone of your pedigree to avoid being called establishment. But isn\u2019t that part of the problem in this race, that three others on this stage are splitting the main stream Republican vote and there by possibly handing this nomination over to an anti-establishment candidate?BUSH: Bret, we\u2019re just starting. The first vote hasn\u2019t been counted. Why don\u2019t we let the process work. I trust Iowans, Granite staters (ph), people in South Carolina, people in Nevada, to start this process out. I kind of miss Donald Trump. He was a little teddy bear to me.(LAUGHTER)We always had such a loving relationship in these debates and in between and the tweets. I kind of miss him. I wish he was here. Everybody else was in the witness protection program when I went after him on behalf of what the Republican cause should be: conservative principles, believing in limited government, believing in accountability. Leading by fixing the things that are broken.Look, I am in the establishment because my dad, the greatest man alive was president of the United States and my brother, who I adore as well as fantastic brother was president. Fine, I\u2019ll take it. I guess I\u2019m part of the establishment Barbara Bush is my mom. I\u2019ll take that, too.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: But this election is not about our pedigree, this is an election about people that are really hurting. We need a leader that will fix things and have a proven record to do it. And we need someone who will take on Hillary Clinton in November. Someone who has a proven record, who has been tested, who is totally transparent. I released 34 years of tax returns...(BELL RINGS)... and 300,000 e-mails in my government record. To get the information from Hillary Clinton, you need to get a subpoena from the FBI.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Thank you governor.KELLY: Senator Christie, you began this campaign touting your record as a Republican from a blue state who knows how to get things done and reach across the aisle. However, many Republicans feel that reaching across the aisle and getting things done isn\u2019t great if you get the wrong things done. And they prefer to stand on principle rather than compromise. Why are they wrong and you\u2019re right?CHRISTIE: They\u2019re not wrong. But what\u2019s wrong is your premise in the question. You can do both. There is no reason why you can\u2019t stand for principles, go and fight for them and be able also, to have to get things done in government.You know, what people are frustrated about in Washington, D.C.., and I know the folks out there tonight are incredibly frustrated because what they see is a government that doesn\u2019t work for them. You know, for the 45-year-old construction worker out there, who is having a hard time making things meet.He\u2019s lost $4,000 in the last seven years in his income because of this administration. He doesn\u2019t want to hear the talk about politics Megyn and who is establishment and who is grassroots. And who\u2019s compromised and who is principled. What he wants is something to get done.And that\u2019s the difference between being a governor and having done that for the last six years in New Jersey and being someone who has never had to be responsible for any of those decisions. Barack Obama was never responsible for those decisions.Hillary Clinton has never been responsible for those kind of decisions where they were held accountable. I\u2019ve been held accountable for six years as the governor of New Jersey and with a Democratic legislature, I\u2019ve gotten conservative things done. That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ll do as president of the United States.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Senator Paul, you are definitely not in the establishment category. But at the beginning of this campaign, you said you were your own man when asked about your father, former Texas Congressman and three-time presidential candidate Ron Paul.Senator Cruz\u2019s campaign is out with a video saying that Cruz is the intellectual and political heir to your father\u2019s 2012 campaign and the liberty movement. And your father now says it\u2019s realistic that Donald Trump will be your party\u2019s nominee.So did you make a mistake by not fully \u2014 more fully embracing your father politically at the beginning of this campaign?PAUL: You know, I\u2019ve always had a great deal of respect. There\u2019s probably no person I respect more in the country or in recent history than my father. I think he was probably the most honest man in politics that we\u2019ve ever seen in a generation.And so in no way have I ever said that I don\u2019t embrace my father or love my father or appreciate everything that he has done for the country. I think what\u2019s interesting about where that liberty vote goes that my father brought to the Republican Party is, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re necessarily going to go for Ted.You know, Ted didn\u2019t show up. We had an audit-the-Fed vote, which was the biggest thing my dad had been advocating for, for 30 years, Ted didn\u2019t have time to show up. He was the only Republican that didn\u2019t show up for it.And so I think really that vote is going to stay in the Paul household. I think more of it is coming and it\u2019s going to grow.The NSA is another big issue. Ted said he was for NSA reform, but then he told Marco Rubio, no, no, no, I voted for the bill because I\u2019m for the government collecting 100 percent of your cell phone records.I don\u2019t think Ted can have it both ways. They want to say they\u2019re getting some of the liberty vote. But we don\u2019t see it happening at all. We think we\u2019re going to do very well in Iowa with the liberty vote.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Senator Cruz, your response to that?CRUZ: Well, I agree with Rand that I very much respect Ron Paul and that I think anyone who is able to win in the Republican Party has to be able to bring together the disparate elements of the Reagan coalition. You\u2019ve got to be able to bring together conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians, and stitch together a winning majority.When it comes to the audit the Fed bill, as Rand knows well, I was an original sponsor of the bill, I\u2019m strongly supportive of it. It didn\u2019t have the votes to pass. And I had commitments to be at a town hall in New Hampshire.But I look forward to signing that bill into law as president and auditing the Fed and providing needed accountability at the Federal Reserve.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Senator Rubio?RUBIO: I think, you know, Rand and I have some significant issues on policy, but I respect Rand. He believes everything he stands for.(APPLAUSE)I do respect Rand.But I want to be frank about what I stand for. I believe the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest power in the world. And I believe only with a strong America will we defeat this radical group, this apocalyptic group called ISIS.That\u2019s why when I\u2019m president we are going to rebuild our intelligence capabilities. And they\u2019re going to tell us where the terrorists are. And a rebuilt U.S. military is going to destroy these terrorists.And if we capture any of these ISIS killers alive, they are going to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we\u2019re going to find out everything they know, because when I\u2019m president, unlike Barack Obama, we will keep this country safe.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Thank you, Senator.PAUL: May I respond?(CROSSTALK)BAIER: We\u2019ll come back to...PAUL: Well, I mean, I was talked about in the question.BAIER: OK. Go ahead, go ahead. PAUL: Just very quickly, I would like to respond.The bulk collection of your phone data, the invasion of your privacy did not stop one terrorist attack. I don\u2019t think you have to give up your liberty for a false sense of security.When we look at this bulk collection, the court has looked at this. Even the court declared it to be illegal. If we want to collect the records of terrorists, let\u2019s do it the old fashioned way. Let\u2019s use the Fourth Amendment. Let\u2019s put a name on a warrant, let\u2019s ask a judge for it. Let\u2019s respect the history of our country.John Adams said that we fought a War for Independence because we wanted to fight against generalized warrants. Let\u2019s don\u2019t forget that.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Governor Kasich, I want to get back to this question of where conservatives are this year. You call yourself a, quote, \u201cinside-outside guy, a reformer who knows how to get things done,\u201d but you reject the establishment label.First question is why do you reject it? And secondly, what do you say to Republican voters this year who view practical government experience as a liability and not an asset?KASICH: Well, first of all, I had a national reporter say, you know, there\u2019s three lanes. There\u2019s the establishment lane, the anti- establishment lane, and then there\u2019s the Kasich lane.And the reason is, is that I\u2019ve been a reformer all of my career, fighting to reform welfare, fighting to reform the Pentagon, also being in a position to balance the budget, because that is very, very hard to do.And then in Ohio, of course, I had to bring about big reform, again, because we were so far in the hole and now we just found out we are up over 400,000 jobs since I took over as governor.KASICH: You know, the situation is this. We cannot fix things in this country \u2014 the Social Security, the border, balancing the budget, getting wages to grow faster \u2014 unless we lead as conservatives, but we also invite people in from the other party. We have to come together as a country. And we have to stop all the divisions.And, you know, that\u2019s been my message in New Hampshire. And having been in New Hampshire and here in Iowa, but in New Hampshire, I just received the support of seven out of eight of the newspapers in that state because they see positive, they see unity, they see coming together, and they see a record of change and a record of accomplishment.And it isn\u2019t because I\u2019m all that great. It\u2019s because I\u2019ve been assembling a team of people who want to be involved in something that\u2019s a little bigger than themselves. I\u2019ll keep \u2014 I\u2019ll keep heading in that direction, believe me.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Dr. Carson, I want to pick up on that with you. Governor Kasich likes to say he knows how to land the plane. You\u2019ve landed a lot of planes in the O.R. But what about the idea of running for president with no experience in government at all?CARSON: Well, I will gladly confess that I\u2019m the only one on this stage with no political title. You\u2019re not going to hear a lot of polished political speech from me, but you will hear the truth. And I don\u2019t think you have to be a politician to tell the truth. In fact, sometimes it\u2019s not that way...(APPLAUSE)... and I\u2019ve had more two a.m. phone calls than everybody here put together, making life and death decisions, put together very complex teams to accomplish things that have never been done before. And we are in a situation right now in our country that we have never been in before. We need people who think out of the box and can solve problems; can utilize the resources around them; very smart people, to focus on the problem and solve the problem.The American people are terrified. That\u2019s why we have this abnormal situation going on right now. We don\u2019t need more of the same solutions. We need different solutions to solve the problems and to save our nation. (APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Gentlemen, we\u2019re now going to start to drill down into specific issues that are on voters\u2019 minds. I\u2019m going to start with one of the biggest ones, which is foreign terror.According to Google, ISIS was by far the most searched foreign policy topic over the last year. Senator Cruz, you talk tough about fighting terrorism. You talk about carpet bombing into oblivion. You talk about seeing if the sand will glow at night. But critics say that your record does not match up to that. You opposed giving President Obama authority to enforce his red line in Syria. Three years in a row now, you have voted against the Defense Authorization Act.How do you square your rhetoric with your record, sir?CRUZ: Well, Chris, I will apologize to nobody for the vigorousness with which I will fight terrorism, go after ISIS, hunt them down wherever they are, and utterly and completely destroy ISIS.(APPLAUSE)You know, you claim it is tough talk to discuss carpet bombing. It is not tough talk. It is a different, fundamental military strategy than what we\u2019ve seen from Barack Obama. Barack Obama right now, number one, over seven years, has dramatically degraded our military. You know, just two weeks ago was the 25th anniversary of the first Persian Gulf war. When that war began, we had 8,000 planes. Today, we have about 4,000. When that war began, we had 529 ships. Today, we have 272.You want to know what carpet bombing is? It\u2019s what we did in the first Persian Gulf war; 1,100 air attacks a day, saturation bombing that utterly destroyed the enemy. Right now, Barack Obama is launching between 15 and 30 air attacks a day. He\u2019s not arming the Kurds. We need to define the enemy. We need to rebuild the military to defeat the enemy. And we need to be focused and lift the rules of engagement so we\u2019re not sending our fighting men and women into combat with their arms tied behind their backs.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Senator Rubio, does Senator Cruz\u2019s record match his rhetoric?RUBIO: Well, again, I mean, obviously, as already has been pointed out, the only budget that Ted has ever voted for is a budget that Rand Paul sponsored that brags about cutting defense spending. And I think that\u2019s a bad idea for the following reason.ISIS is the most dangerous jihadist group in the history of mankind. ISIS is now found in affiliates in over a dozen countries. ISIS is a group that burns people alive in cages; that sells off little girls as brides. ISIS is a group that wants to trigger an apocalyptic showdown in the city of Dabiq \u2014 not the city of Dubuque; I mis-said \u2014 mis-said that wrong once (inaudible) time \u2014 the city of Dabiq in Syria. They want to trigger an apocalyptic Armageddon showdown.RUBIO: This group needs to be confronted and defeated. They are not going to go away on their own. They\u2019re not going to turn into stockbrokers overnight or open up a chain of car washes. They need to be defeated militarily, and that will take overwhelming U.S. force.Today, we are on pace to have the smallest Army since the end of World War II, the smallest Navy in 100 years, the smallest Air Force in our history. You cannot destroy ISIS with a military that\u2019s being diminished. When I\u2019m president, we are rebuilding the U.S. military because the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest military in the world.(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: Senator Cruz, you\u2019ve got 30 seconds. You were mentioned.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: Chris, in 1981, when Ronald Reagan came to the Oval Office, he encountered a military that had been debilitated just as the current military has, just like Jimmy Carter weakened our readiness, undermined our ability to defend this country, so too has Barack Obama. Just as morale in the military has plummeted in the last seven, so it had then.What Reagan did is he began with tax reform and regulatory reform, unleashing the engine of the American free enterprise system. It brought booming economic growth and that growth fueled rebuilding the military. I intend to do the exact same thing to defeat radical Islamic terrorism \u2014WALLACE: Gentlemen.CRUZ: ... and to devote the resources from the booming economy to rebuilding our Navy, rebuilding our Air Force, rebuilding our Army and ensuring we have the capacity to keep this country safe.PAUL: My budget was mentioned. My budget was mentioned.WALLACE: May I \u2014 may I just say, we are going to continue the questions about foreign terror, gentlemen, right after this break.BAIER: Welcome back. Let\u2019s get right back to the questions. Chris.WALLACE: Thank you. Governor Christie, you have compared both Senators Cruz and Rubio to Barack Obama, saying that we cannot afford another inexperienced President. You\u2019ve also said that Senator Cruz\u2019s vote to curtail the NSA surveillance program made America less safe. Is either of them ready to be Commander in Chief?CHRISTIE: Well, let me say that I do believe that the vote on NSA made the country less safe. Well, let me tell you what the country should really be worried about. I watched that town hall meeting with the Democrats the other night, and I heard Hillary Clinton asked a direct question by an Iowan, and that\u2019s what Iowans like to do. They like to ask direct questions.And, they asked about her email situation. And, here\u2019s what she said to the American people. She did it for convenience. For her convenience. She put America\u2019s secrets at risk for her convenience. She put American intelligence officers at risk for her convenience. She put American strategy at risk for her convenience.Let me tell you who\u2019s not qualified to be President of the United States, Chris. Hillary Rodham Clinton did that to our country. She is not qualified to be President of the United States.(CHEERING)The fact is what we need is someone on that stage who has been tested, who has been through it, who has made decisions, who has sit (ph) in the chair of consequence and can prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton on...(BELL RINGING)CHRISTIE: ... that stage, and that is exactly what I am ready to do.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Governor Bush...CRUZ: Chris? Chris I was mentioned in that question.BUSH: No, you weren\u2019t. Your name wasn\u2019t mentioned, Ted.CRUZ: ... Actually, I was...BUSH: ... Chris, keep it coming...WALLACE: ... I don\u2019t think that your name was mentioned...CRUZ: ... Chris, your questions that you...WALLACE: ... Sir, I think \u2014 I think the question was...CRUZ: ... What was your question...WALLACE: ... It\u2019s not my question that you get a chance to respond to, it\u2019s his answer.(LAUGHTER)WALLACE: You don\u2019t get 30 seconds to respond to me...CRUZ: ... Your question was you have disagreed...(AUDIENCE REACTION)WALLACE: ... You don\u2019t get 30 seconds to respond to me...CRUZ: ... (inaudible) opening statement.WALLACE: ... If I could go on. Sir, I know you like to argue about the rules, but we\u2019re going to conduct a debate...BUSH: ... Thank you Chris...WALLACE: ... Governor Bush...CRUZ: ... This entire question was an attack, but that\u2019s (inaudible)WALLACE: Governor Bush, here\u2019s the question \u2014 I\u2019m going to ask Governor Bush the question.You criticized several candidates in this field on this stage for what you call unrealistic ideas about how to fight terrorists, including Rubio, and Cruz on the issue of their refusing to give the President authority to enforce the redline in Syria.But, given the fact that your brother got us into two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that have still not ended.That have still not ended, what lessons have you learned from his mistakes, sir?BUSH: Well, first, I was critical of the Senators not giving the authorization for the use of military force. They should have made it more open ended for the next president. We shouldn\u2019t have the war fighters have their arms tied behind their back as President Obama wanted to do, but they had a chance to show support and it wasn\u2019t popular at the time. It became popular after the attack in Paris, and San Bernardino. Now we hear the tough talk.Prior to that, in the Reagan Library, I gave a detailed plan. Exactly what to do as it relates to ISIS. And it is from the lessons from history that we do this because if we allow this to fester, we\u2019re going to have Islamic terrorism, multi-generations of it all across this country. The caliphate of ISIS has to be destroyed, which means we need to arm directly to Kurds, imbed our troops with the Iraqi military, re engage with the Sunni tribal leaders. Get the lawyers off the damn backs of the military once and for all.(CHEERING)BUSH: Have a no fly zone in Syria and create safe zones to deal with the refugees. But, more importantly, to train a Sunni-led force in Syria to take out ISIS with our support...(BELL RINGING)BUSH: ... ground and air. That\u2019s what we need to to, and I laid that out prior to the crisis with the advice of a lot of people, including 12 Medal of Honor recipients that I\u2019m proud that they\u2019re supporting my campaign.History suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Senator Cruz, now you get a chance to respond.CRUZ: Chris, I would note that that the last four questions have been, \u201cRand, please attack Ted. Marco, please attack Ted. Chris, please attack Ted. Jeb, please attack Ted...\u201d(AUDIENCE)CRUZ: Let me just say this...WALLACE: ... It is a debate, sir.CRUZ: ... Well, no, no. A debate actually is a policy issue, but I will say this. Gosh, if you guys ask one more mean question I may have to leave the stage.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: Chris, the most important determination any voter is going to make in this election is who\u2019s best prepared to be Commander in Chief. Who has the experience, who has the knowledge, who has the judgement, who has the clarity, and vision and strength of resolve to keep this country safe. That is what this debate is all about, and I would suggest let\u2019s stay focused on those issues \u2014 rather than just attacks directed at each other.WALLACE: I think the questions were about issues. Senator Rubio, what would you like to respond sir...(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)PAUL: ... Senator Cruz, I\u2019d like to respond...RUBIO: ... First of all \u2014 Let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after.(LAUGHTER)RUBIO: First of all...PAUL: ... and I\u2019d like to respond.RUBIO: ... do I go \u2014 let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after. But...(LAUGHTER)... first of all...WALLACE: Thank you.PAUL: Thank you, Marco.RUBIO: ... first of all, I\u2019m \u2014 don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not leaving the stage no matter what you ask me.WALLACE: Good.RUBIO: And second of all...(APPLAUSE)... and I think \u2014 you know, Governor \u2014 Jeb, you \u2014 the attack that \u2014 the authorization that Barack Obama asked for was not against ISIS. It was against Assad. And John Kerry described it as attacks that would be unbelievably small.I don\u2019t think the United States should be engaged in symbolic military activity. So it was not against ISIS, it was against \u2014 it was against Assad.I think the United States military is operating under rules of engagement that are too strict...(BELL RINGS)...and that do not allow us to pursue victory. When I\u2019m president, that will change.(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: Senator Paul, go ahead. PAUL: Thank you.The issue in Syria\u2019s a very important one, and it\u2019s one we need to get right. The question is, should we be bombing both sides of the war? Some want (ph) to topple Assad. In fact, they want to bomb ISIS and Assad simultaneously.I think that\u2019s a really, really bad idea. In fact, I\u2019ve said for several years that arming the allies of ISIS will make the situation worse, That what we really need to do is defeat ISIS.But if you defeat Assad, what you will wind up with is a larger and more powerful ISIS that occupies that space. You might \u2014 you may well see an ISIS that takes over all of Syria.(BELL RINGS)KASICH: Chris...(APPLAUSE)... there was a question about foreign policy, by the way, and experience. And I \u2014 I thought, if I didn\u2019t jump in, I might not be able to tell everybody this. I think they\u2019d want to hear it.Look, I served on...WALLACE: Well...(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: ... we\u2019ll be talking about foreign policy a little bit later. We\u2019re going to talk...KELLY: We have a lot \u2014 we have a lot to cover. But we want to \u2014 we want to turn the page to domestic...(CROSSTALK)KASICH: ... but wait a minute...KELLY: No, no. No.KASICH: ...the only reason is \u2014 look...KELLY: No no no, because we want to turn the page to domestic terror, and let me tell you why: we\u2019re partnering with Google on this debate, and they\u2019re telling us...KASICH: OK.KELLY: ... that their search results have gone through the roof on \u2014 on people...KASICH: I\u2019ve always listened to you, Megyn. Go ahead.KELLY: ... you\u2019re a good man, Governor Kasich.KASICH: Yes \u2014 thank you.KELLY: People \u2014 the search results \u2014 the searches for terror issues, for safety issues in America have gone through the roof, increased over 400 percent since 2008.People are worried. They\u2019re worried about what\u2019s happening in the country and about a domestic terror attack, as all of you know. Now, when combating this threat, Senator Rubio, you\u2019ve advocated closing down mosques \u2014 we\u2019ll get back to you.Well, you have advocated closing down \u2014 closing down mosques, diners, any place where radicalization is occurring. You told me that. But the Supreme Court has made clear that hateful speech is generally protected by the First Amendment.In other words, radical Muslims have the right to be radical Muslims, unless they turn to terror. Doesn\u2019t your position run afoul of the First Amendment?RUBIO: Megyn, that\u2019s the problem. Radical Muslims and radical Islam is not just hate talk. It\u2019s hate action. They blow people up. Look what they did in San Bernardino.Look at the attack they inspired in Philadelphia, that the White House still refuses to link to terror, where a guy basically shot a police officer three times.He told the police, \u201cI did it because I was inspired by ISIS,\u201d and to this day, the White House still refuses to acknowledge it had anything to do with terror.Look, the threat we face from ISIS is unprecedented. There has never been a jihadist group like this. They have affiliates in over a dozen countries now.They are the best funded radical jihadist group in the history of the world, and they have shown a sophisticated understanding of the laws of other countries on how to insert fighters into places, and they are actively plotting to attack us here at home and around the world.We must keep America safe from this threat. And yes, when I am president of the United States, if there is some place in this country where radical jihadists are planning to attack the United States, we will go after them wherever they are, and if we capture them alive, they are going to Guantanamo.(APPLAUSE)PAUL: (inaudible).KELLY: Senator Paul, do you agree with that? We\u2019re gonna close down mosques, we\u2019re gonna close down diners where we think radical thinking\u2019s (ph) occurring? (CROSSTALK)PAUL: Yeah (ph), no, I think that\u2019s a \u2014 that\u2019s a huge mistake, to be closing down mosques. But I would say that if you want to defend the country, it begins with border security. And this is where I\u2019ve had my disagreement with Senator Rubio.When he brought forward the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d bill to give citizenship to those who came here illegally, I put forward an amendment that says we should have more scrutiny on those who are coming as students, those who are coming as immigrants, those who are coming as refugees, because we had two refugees come to my town in Bowling Green and try to attack us.Marco opposed this because they made a deal. He made a deal with Chuck Schumer that he would oppose any conservative amendments. And I think that\u2019s a mistake, and I just don\u2019t think Marco can have it both ways. You can\u2019t be in favor of defend us...(BELL RINGS)... against Islam \u2014 radical Islam \u2014 if you\u2019re not for border security.RUBIO: Might I respond?(APPLAUSE)The first thing \u2014 I don\u2019t know of anyone who\u2019s not in favor of fully vetting people that are trying to come into this country, other than perhaps Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. I think we all support that. Rand\u2019s amendment was not the right way to do it.I do believe that people who are trying to come to the United States \u2014 this country has a right to know who they are and why they are coming. And that\u2019s why I\u2019ve been clear, when I am the president of the United States of America, we don\u2019t know who you are, and we don\u2019t know why you\u2019re trying to come to the United States, you are not going to get in, because the radical threat that we now face from ISIS is extraordinary and unprecedented...(BELL RINGS)... and when I\u2019m president, we are keeping ISIS out of America.KELLY: Governor Christie, let\u2019s talk about profiling.(APPLAUSE)In December...CHRISTIE: Talk about what? I...KELLY: ... profiling. Profiling. In December, two radical Muslims killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California. Neighbors of the terrorists said that they did not report the couple to law enforcement prior to the crime, because they were afraid that they would be accused of profiling.Now, you have said that we should not profile. How do you square that with the San Bernardino case?CHRISTIE: Well, because you can do it without profiling, Megyn, when you do it on the facts. What those facts knew was that these folks had weapons. They knew that they were talking about trying to take our country and attack it.That\u2019s not profiling, that\u2019s law enforcement. And that\u2019s the difference between somebody who knows how to do this and somebody who\u2019s never done it before.KELLY: They didn\u2019t know they were going to attack the country.CHRISTIE: They knew they were talking about the issues of attacking people, Megyn. They knew that.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: That\u2019s not true. The neighbors said they saw men going in and out of the garage. They saw packages being delivered. They saw Muslims, and they did not think that was enough to call the cops. Do you?CHRISTIE: Listen, I think that what people should do is use their common sense. And the fact is, let law enforcement make those decisions. I\u2019ve told people that from the time I was U.S. attorney 13 years ago.It\u2019s not for them to make those decisions about whether or not something is legal or illegal, or profiling or not. You see something that\u2019s suspicious, you call law enforcement and let law enforcement make those decisions.That\u2019s what should be done. That can be done. That can be done without profiling people. What that is, is just common sense. They thought something was wrong.And here\u2019s the problem in this country right now. The problem is that Barack Obama has made law enforcement the enemy, Hillary Clinton has made law enforcement the enemy.They\u2019re not supporting our law enforcement officers, it\u2019s making everybody nervous to get out of their cars, if you\u2019re a law enforcement officer. It\u2019s making... (BELL RINGS)CHRISTIE: ... everybody nervous to get out of their cars if you\u2019re a law enforcement officer.(BELL RINGS)It\u2019s making people in neighborhoods nervous to go to law enforcement. As president, I will support law enforcement and we\u2019ll stop radical terrorist attacks in this country by supporting our intelligence community and law enforcement community.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Dr. Carson, this week a female Muslim who served in the U.S. Air Force asked Hillary Clinton the question, she asked whether the United States is still the best place in which to raise her three Muslim children. Given what she perceives as a rise in Islamaphobia in this country. Do you think the GOP messaging on Muslims has stoked the flames of bias on this as the Democrats suggest, and how would you answer this veteran?CARSON: Well, I don\u2019t know about the GOP messaging, but I can tell you about my messaging. You know, need to stop allowing political correctness to dictate our policies, because it\u2019s going to kill us if we don\u2019t.(APPLAUSE)CARSON: And in the Holy Land Foundation trial in 2006 in Texas, they had a memorandum, an explanatory memorandum that talked about the fact that Americans would be easy to overcome and to commit civilization jihad because they were going to be trying to protect the rights of the very people who were trying to subvert them.But I believe in the Teddy Roosevelt philosophy. Teddy Roosevelt said, we are a nation of immigrants. As such, everybody is welcome from any race, any country, any religion, if they want to be Americans. If they want to accept our values and our laws. If not, they can stay where they are.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Governor Kasich, stand back. You appear to back in another debate, a so-called back door to encrypted cell phone technology, which protects most smartphones that we all have from hacking. And it includes our phones and it also protects the cell phones of the terrorist.Now the tech companies and a group of MIT scientists, smart guys, right, warn that if they create a way for the FBI to have a back door into our encrypted communications, then the bad guys will exploit it too. And they say that this is going to cause more security problems than it would solve for everyday Americans. Are they wrong?KASICH: Well, look the Joint Terrorism Task Force needs resources and tools. And those are made up of the FBI, state and local law enforcement. And Megyn, it\u2019s best not to talk anymore about back doors and encryption, it will get solved, but it needs to be solved in the situation of the White House with the technology folks.MEGYN: But this is public testimony.KASICH: But I just have to tell you that it\u2019s best with some of these things not be said. Now I want to go back something. See, I was there when Reagan rebuilt the military. I was there in \u201989 when the wall came tumbling down because we were strong.And I was there when we went into the Gulf War. We didn\u2019t win that war just from the air, we won that war by assembling a group of Arab leaders who stood in the Rose Garden and stood with America. We want to destroy ISIS, it has to be in the air and on the ground. It has to be with our friends in the Arab world and our friends in Europe, the coalition that we had when we went to the first Gulf War.And then when we win that, and we will win that against ISIS as it settles down, and we should leave. Because we shouldn\u2019t be policemen of the world. But what we need to do is turn it over to the regional powers to be able to handle that.KASICH: But we have a unique time in America to connect with people all around the world that understand that there\u2019s an existential threat against all of them, the Arabs, the Jordanians, the Saudis, the Egyptians, our friends in Europe, including the Turks. So we have a unique opportunity to bring everybody together.I saw Reagan do it, I\u2019ve seen other presidents do it. And frankly, if you want to be commander in chief, you have to have the experience. At the same time we\u2019re doing all that, the Pentagon must be reformed so we get what we need for our men and women in uniform. All of that together, we\u2019re going to be just fine and America is going to continue to lead the world.KELLY: Governor, thank you.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Governor Bush, just today, a wounded warrior organization designed to help wounded veterans and their families is coming under fire for raising tens of millions of dollars, but spending almost half of that on travel and hotels and dinners and luxury, lavish conferences. So taking care of veterans is obviously a huge issue in the country that has asked so many to serve and sacrifice so much.If you were president. would you police these charity organizations that say they\u2019re helping vets?BUSH: Of course. And there\u2019s all sorts of ways that can be done at the state, local and federal level to do that. But the first duty of the next president of the United States is to fix the mess at the Department of Veterans Affairs. That\u2019s his first responsibility.(APPLAUSE)Look, we have waiting lists for veterans that are \u2014 that are leaving because of the sequester where we\u2019re gutting the military. More and more military personnel are leaving becoming veterans, and the waiting list grows. They\u2019ve given out $140 million of bonuses to Veterans Department employees, including reducing the waiting lists, without giving veterans care. People died, and only three people have been fired.I will make sure that we fire the sheer incompetence inside the Department of Veterans Affairs and then we\u2019ll give veterans a choice card so that they don\u2019t have to travel hours and hours to get care if they want to go to their private provider. You want to make the Veterans Administration do a better job, give them \u2014 give veterans choices and you\u2019ll get a much better result. And as it relates to all the other organizations, let me give you a good example.In Houston, Texas, there\u2019s an organization in place because someone acted on their heart, wanted to make sure that there\u2019s no homeless veterans in Houston. And they\u2019ve come pretty close to that without federal government assistance. We need to mobilize the entire country to treat our veterans and treat them with much more respect than they get today.BAIER: Governor Bush, thank you.(APPLAUSE)Speaking of veterans, we have a question from a veteran who is one of the top Youtube creators. Over the course of the evening, gentlemen, we will hear from some of Youtube\u2019s most followed stars. And here\u2019s one of them.QUESTION: I\u2019m Mark Watson. I\u2019m known for my (inaudible) views on Youtube, but I\u2019m also a veteran who served in the Army for eight years.As an African-American living near Ferguson, I\u2019ve seen the strain between police officers and the communities they serve firsthand. Now, there are great tools like body cameras that \u2014 to protect both officers and citizens, but we all currently have better cameras in our pockets than in our precincts. Why aren\u2019t we using the technology available to better protect our communities?BAIER: Senator Paul, that question to you.PAUL: You know, I\u2019ve supported legislation to allow body cameras. I\u2019ve been to Ferguson, I\u2019ve been trying to look for solutions to our criminal justice problem.One thing I discovered in Ferguson was that a third of the budget for the city of Ferguson was being reaped by civil fines. People were just being fined to death. Now you and I and many of the people in this audience, if we get a $100 fine, we can survive it. If you\u2019re living on the edge of poverty and you get a $100 fine or your car towed, a lot of times you lose your job.I also think the war on drugs has disproportionately affected our African-American community, and what we need to do is make sure that the war on drugs is equal protection under the law and that we don\u2019t unfairly incarcerate another generation of young African-American males.In Ferguson, for every 100 African-American women, there are only 60 African-American men. Drug use is about equal between white and black, but our prisons \u2014 three out of four people in prison are black or brown. I think something has to change. I think it\u2019s a big thing that our party needs to be part of, and I\u2019ve been a leader in Congress on trying to bring about criminal justice reform.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Senator Paul, thank you.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Welcome back, everybody. We are live in Des Moines, Iowa. And let\u2019s get right back to the questions \u2014 Bret.BAIER: Thank you, Megyn.Gentlemen, I\u2019ll ask you some questions about federal spending and the role of the federal government. Everybody always said they want to cut federal spending and usually they start by saying they\u2019ll cut waste, fraud, and abuse, but that really doesn\u2019t ever materialize. We all know that.Governor Christie, you talk a lot about entitlement reform and you say that that\u2019s where the federal government can get savings needed to balance the budget. But can you name even one thing that the federal government does now that it should not do at all?CHRISTIE: Yes. You want one?(LAUGHTER)BAIER: I want one. Yes.(LAUGHTER)CHRISTIE: How about one that I\u2019ve done in New Jersey for the last six years. That\u2019s get rid of Planned Parenthood funding from the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Anything bigger than that?CHRISTIE: Bigger than that? Let me tell you something, when you see thousands upon thousands upon thousands of children being murdered in the womb, I can\u2019t think of anything better than that.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: And, Governor, I realize everyone on this stage opposes Obamacare and you\u2019re not alone. Google Data shows that in the last month when people searched \u201cpolicy repeals,\u201d that there were a lot of them. Obamacare took the top two spots. But today there are millions of people who gained health insurance from Obamacare and they now rely on it.So the question, Senator Cruz, if you repeal Obamacare, as you say you will, will you be fine if millions of those people don\u2019t have health insurance? And what is your specific plan for covering the uninsured?CRUZ: Sure. Well, let\u2019s take it one at a time. First of all, we have seen now in six years of Obamacare that it has been a disaster. It is the biggest job-killer in this country. Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work, have lost their health insurance, have lost their doctors, have seen their premiums skyrocket.If I\u2019m elected president, we will repeal every word of Obamacare. (APPLAUSE)CRUZ: Now, once that is done, everyone agrees we need healthcare reform. It should follow the principles of expanding competition, empowering patients, and keeping government from getting in between us and our doctors.Three specific reforms that reflect those principles. Number one, we should allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines. That will create a true 50-state national marketplace which will drive down the cost of low-cost, catastrophic health insurance.Number two, we should expand health savings accounts so people can save in a tax-advantaged way for more routine healthcare needs. And number three, we should work to de-link health insurance from employment so if you lose your job, your health insurance goes with you and it is personal, portable and affordable.And I\u2019ll tell you, Bret, I think that\u2019s a much more attractive vision for healthcare than the Washington-drive, top-down Obamacare that is causing so many millions of people to hurt.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Senator Cruz, thank you.Governor Bush, you\u2019ve advocated for statehood for Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rican economy is collapsing under unsustainable debt burden. Only about 1 million of its 4 million residents are currently employed. So should American citizens who you say are already overtaxed, bail out Puerto Rico as well?BUSH: No, they shouldn\u2019t. And I believe that Puerto Rico ought to have the right of self-determination. If I was a Puerto Rican, I\u2019d vote for statehood so that they have full citizenship. They serve in the military. They would have to pay federal taxes. They would \u2014 they would accept the responsibilities of full U.S. citizenship. But they should have the right of determine \u2014 self-determination.Before you get to that, though, Puerto Rico is going to have to deal with the structural problems they face. You know, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a fact that if you can pay for a $79 one-way ticket to Orlando, and you can escape the challenges of a declining economy and high crime rates, you move to Orlando.And a lot of people are doing that. And the spiraling out-of- control requires Puerto Rico to make structural reforms. The federal government can play a role in allowing them to do that, but they should not \u2014 the process of statehood or the status of Puerto Rico won\u2019t be solved until we get to the bigger issue of how you deal with the structural economic problems they\u2019re facing right now.BAIER: Governor Kasich, you\u2019re one of two remaining sitting governors still in the race. Your colleague, Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan is under fire \u2014 he and his administration \u2014 for the Flint, Michigan water crisis and the botched response to it. How would you have handled that?KASICH: Well, you\u2019ve got to be on top of it right away. And, you know, I don\u2019t know all the details of what Rick Snyder has done. I know there have been people who have been fired; people who are being held accountable. But the fact is, every single engine of government has to move when you see a crisis like that.And I\u2019ve had many situations in the state of Ohio where we\u2019ve had to move, whether it\u2019s storms, whether it was a horrible school shooting. There are many crises that come \u2014 a water crisis in Toledo. You\u2019ve got to be on top of it. You\u2019ve got to go the extra mile. You\u2019ve got to work with local communities and you\u2019ve got to work with the federal government.Because you realize that people depending on you. And so, you go the extra mile. But people have to be alert. They have to be alert to problems. And when you see a problem, you must act quickly to get on top of it. And people at home are saying they\u2019ve got a problem, listen to them. Because most of the time, they\u2019re absolutely correct.So the fact is that we work for the people. The people don\u2019t work for us. And we have to have an attitude when we\u2019re in government of serving-hood. That\u2019s what really matters. We serve you. You don\u2019t serve us. We listen to you and \u2014 and then we act.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Senator Rubio, on the issue of climate change, in 2008, you wanted Florida to get ahead of other states and establish a cap- and-trade system, a program for carbon emissions, which many Republicans thought at the time would hurt the Florida economy. Now, you\u2019re a skeptic of climate change science. And in fact, you warn that federal efforts to fight climate change will cost U.S. jobs and hurt the U.S. economy.So why the change?RUBIO: Well, Bret, first that\u2019s not entirely the story. At the time, the liberal governor of Florida, who claimed he was a Republican \u2014 his name was Charlie Crist \u2014 he wanted to impose cap-and-trade on Florida. And I opposed it. I was the first person out of the box that opposed him on it.And then we saw that the leading candidates for president at the time, both the Republican and the Democrats, all supported it. And what we said is, if they\u2019re going to impose this on us, we better prepare to protect the state from it. But I have never supported cap- and-trade and I never thought it was a good idea. And I was clear about that at the time.And I do not believe it\u2019s a good idea now. I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment. And especially what these programs are asking us to pass that will do nothing to help the environment, but will be devastating for our economy.When I am president of the United States of America, there will never be any cap-and-trade in the United States.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Thanks, Senator.KELLY: All right. We\u2019re going to move on. Because coming up, immigration, and something you\u2019ve never seen before.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.Stay tuned, right after this break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Welcome back everyone. Live, in Des Moines, Iowa. Now, we move onto the topic of immigration. Senator Rubio, we\u2019ll start with you. When you ran for Senate in 2010, you made clear that you opposed legalization and citizenship for illegal immigrants. You promised repeatedly that you would oppose it as a U.S. Senator as well. Here are just a few examples. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUBIO: Never support. Never have and never will support any effort to grant blanket legalization amnesty to folks who have entered, or stayed in this country illegally.(END VIDEO CLIP)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUBIO: First of all, earned path to citizenship is basically code for amnesty. It\u2019s what they call it. And, the reality of it is this, it is unfair to the people that have legally entered this country to create an alternative for individuals who entered illegally, and knowingly did so.(END VIDEO CLIP)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUBIO: You cannot grant amnesty. If the American people see us granting amnesty they will never again believe in legal immigration. They will never again support it, and that\u2019s wrong for our country, bad for our future.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Within two years of getting elected you were co-sponsoring legislation to create a path to citizenship, in your words, amnesty. Haven\u2019t you already proven that you cannot be trusted on this issue?RUBIO: No, because if you look at the quote, and it\u2019s very specific. And, it says blanket amnesty, I do not support blanket amnesty...KELLY: ... But, you went on from there...RUBIO: ... I do not support amnesty...KELLY: ... You said more than that, Senator...RUBIO: ... No, I said I do not support blanket amnesty...KELLY: ... You said earned path to citizenship is basically code for amnesty. You...RUBIO: ... It was...KELLY: ... supported earned path to citizenship...RUBIO: ... It absolutely has been, and at the time in the context of that was in 2009, and 2010, where the last effort for legalization was an effort done in the Senate. It was an effort led by several people that provided almost an instant path with very little obstacles moving forward.What I\u2019ve always said is that this issue does need to be solved. They\u2019ve been talking about this issue for 30 years, and nothing ever happens. And, I\u2019m going to tell you exactly how we\u2019re going to deal with it when I am president.Number one, we\u2019re going to keep ISIS out of America. If we don\u2019t know who you are, or why you\u2019re coming, you will not get into the United States.RUBIO: Number two, we\u2019re going to enforce our immigration laws. I am the son and grandson of immigrants. And I know that securing our borders is not anti-immigrant and we will do it.We\u2019ll hire 20,000 new border agents instead of 20,000 new IRS agents. We will finish the 700 miles of fencing and walls our nation needs. We\u2019ll have mandatory E-verify, a mandatory entry/exit tracking system and until all of that is in place and all of that is working and we can prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control, nothing else is going to happen.We are not going to round up and deport 12 million people, but we\u2019re not going to hand out citizenship cards, either. There will be a process. We will see what the American people are willing to support. But it will not be unconstitutional executive orders like the ones Barack Obama has forced on us.KELLY: Governor Bush, do you agree Senator Rubio has not reversed himself on his immigration promise?BUSH: Well, I\u2019m kind of confused because he was the sponsor of the Gang of Eight bill that did require a bunch of thresholds but ultimately allowed for citizenship over an extended period of time. I mean, that\u2019s a fact. And he asked me to support that. And I \u2014 I supported him because I think people, when you\u2019re elected, you need to do things.And he led the charge to finally fix this immigration problem that has existed now for, as Marco says, for 30 years. And then he cut and run because it wasn\u2019t popular amongst conservatives, I guess.Here\u2019s what I believe. And I wrote a book about this called Immigration Wars. You can get it at $2.99 on Amazon. It\u2019s not a bestseller. I can promise you.(LAUGHTER)There won\u2019t be any \u2014 you can get it. It\u2019s affordable for everybody. We should have a path to legal status for the 12 million people that are here illegally. It means, come out from the shadows, pay a fine, earn legal status by working, by paying taxes, learning English. Not committing crimes and earn legal status where you\u2019re not cutting in front of the line for people that are patiently waiting outside.(APPLAUSE) I think that is the \u2014 I think that\u2019s the conservative consensus pragmatic approach to how to solve this problem.RUBIO: May I respond?KELLY: Go ahead, senator.RUBIO: It\u2019s interesting that Jeb mentions the book. That\u2019s the book where you changed your position on immigration because you used to support a path to citizenship.BUSH: So did you.(LAUGHTER)RUBIO: Well, but you changed the \u2014 in the book...BUSH: Yeah. So did you, Marco.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: You wrote a book where you changed your position from a path of citizenship to a path of legalization. And the bottom line is this, we are not going to be able to do anything on this issue until we first bring illegal immigration under control. The American people have been told for 30 years they\u2019re going to enforce the border, they\u2019re going to build a wall and it never gets built and it never happens.It is very clear there will be no progress on this issue in any way, shape or form, until you prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control. And when I\u2019m president, we are going to bring it under control once and for all after 30 years of talking about it.BUSH: Marco, Marco \u2014 he brought up my name. I have supported a consensus approach to solving this problem wherever it came up. and in 2007 it almost passed when my brother was president of the United States. A bipartisan approach got close. Barack Obama actually had the poison pill to stop it then.And when you led the charge with the Gang of Eight, I supported it because you asked me to. I think it\u2019s important for people in elected office to try to forge consensus to solve problems. There\u2019s never going do be perfect bill.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: All right.BUSH: But when you didn\u2019t do that and you ask people to support, you shouldn\u2019t cut and run.RUBIO: But Megyn...BUSH: You should stick with it and that\u2019s exactly what happened. He cut and run. And that\u2019s a tragedy because now...(BELL RINGS)... it\u2019s harder and harder to actually solve this problem.KELLY: All right. This will be the last one.RUBIO: There\u2019s not going to be consensus on this issue until we enforce our immigration laws. That is abundantly clear. You\u2019re not going to be able to ram down the throat of the American people your approach. The only way we\u2019re are going to be able to move forward after two migratory crises with minor, after two unconstitutional executive orders, the only way forward on this issue is to first bring illegal immigration under control. And until that happens there\u2019s not going to be consensus on this issue.KELLY: OK. Let\u2019s move on. Senator Cruz, when Senator Rubio proposed that bill creating a path to citizenship, you proposed an amendment. It would have allowed for legalization but not citizenship. Yes, it would.Pressed last month on why you supported legalization, you claimed that you didn\u2019t. Right? Like you just did. Saw that.(LAUGHTER)You argued that this was just a poison pill amendment, basically it\u2019s something designed to kill the bill and not actually get it through. But that is not, however, how it sounded at the time. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CRUZ: I want this bill to be voted down. I don\u2019t want immigration reform to fail. I want immigration reform to pass. I believe if this amendment were to pass, the chances of this bill passing into law would increase dramatically.I believe if the amendments I introduced were adopted, that the bill would pass. And my effort in introducing them was to find a solution that reflected common ground and that fixed the problem.CRUZ: If the proponents of this bill actually demonstrate a commitment not to politics, not to campaigning all the time, but to actually fixing this problem, to finding a middle ground. That would fix the problem, and also allow, for those 11 million people who are here illegally, a legal status, with citizenship off the table.KELLY: Was that all an act? It was pretty convincing.CRUZ: You know, the amendment you\u2019re talking about is one sentence \u2014 it\u2019s 38 words. Anyone can go online at tedcruz.org and read exactly what it said. In those 38 words, it said anyone here illegally is permanently ineligible for citizenship. It didn\u2019t say a word about legalization. I introduced...KELLY: But the bill allowed both. The bill you were amending allowed citizenship and legalization.CRUZ: But \u2014 but Megyn, the bill was 1,000 pages. I introduced a series of amendments, each designed to fix problems in the bill. The fact that each amendment didn\u2019t fix every problem didn\u2019t mean that I supported the rest of the bill.And I\u2019ll tell you who supported my amendment \u2014 Jeff Sessions, the strongest opponent of amnesty in the United States Congress. And he did so because taking citizenship off the table was important, and it revealed the hypocrisy of the proponents of this bill, who were looking for votes.(APPLAUSE)... we have the tools in federal law to do this now. We can build the fence. We can triple the border patrol. We can end sanctuary cities by cutting off...(BELL RINGS)... funding to them. We can end welfare for those here illegally. And what is missing is the political will, because too many Democrats and, sadly, too many Republicans don\u2019t want to solve this problem. If I am elected president...(BELL RINGS)... we will secure the border...KELLY: OK, sir.CRUZ: ... and we will end the illegal immigration.KELLY: Senator Paul.(APPLAUSE)You know how Washington works. Do you buy that?PAUL: I was there and I saw the debate. I saw Ted Cruz say, \u201cwe\u2019ll take citizenship off the table, and then the bill will pass, and I\u2019m for the bill.\u201dThe bill would involve legalization. He can\u2019t have it both ways. But what is particularly insulting, though, is that he is the king of saying, \u201cyou\u2019re for amnesty.\u201d Everybody\u2019s for amnesty except for Ted Cruz.But it\u2019s a falseness, and that\u2019s an authenticity problem \u2014 that everybody he knows is not as perfect as him because we\u2019re all for amnesty. I was for legalization. I think, frankly, if you have border security, you can have legalization. So was Ted, but now he says it wasn\u2019t so. That\u2019s not true.KELLY: Go ahead, sir.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: You know, John Adams famously said, \u201cfacts are are stubborn things.\u201d The facts are are very, very simple. When that battle was waged, my friend Senator Rubio chose to stand with Barack Obama and Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer and support amnesty.And I stood alongside Jeff Sessions and Steve King, and we led the fight against amnesty. And if you want to know who\u2019s telling the truth, you should look and ask people like Jeff Sessions and Steve King and Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin, all of whom say, as Jeff Sessions said, responding to these false attacks just recently in Alabama \u2014 he said, \u201cif it wasn\u2019t for Ted Cruz, the Gang of Eight Rubio/Schumer bill would have passed. But because Ted stood up and helped lead the effort, millions rose up to kill it.(BELL RINGS)(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Senator Rubio, even Chuck Schumer, your co-sponsor of that bill...RUBIO: Yeah, but let me respond...KELLY: ... agrees with Ted Cruz on this. RUBIO: ... no, I understand, but let me respond. I (ph) was mentioned on this \u2014 in this answer, and so I\u2019m going to respond this way.This is the lie that Ted\u2019s campaign is built on, and Rand touched upon it \u2014 that he\u2019s the most conservative guy, and everyone else is a \u2014 you know, everyone else is a rhino.The truth is, Ted, throughout this campaign, you\u2019ve been willing to say or do anything in order to get votes. Ted, you worked for George W. Bush\u2019s campaign...(BOOING)You \u2014 you \u2014 you helped design George W. Bush\u2019s \u2014 you helped design George W. Bush\u2019s immigration policy. And then, when you got to the Senate, you did an interview with CBS News \u2014 I (ph) wasn\u2019t even part of the video \u2014 where you said, on the issue of people that are here illegally, \u201cwe can reach a compromise.\u201dAnd then in the committee, you said, \u201cI want to bring people out of the shadows.\u201d(BELL RINGS)Now you want to trump Trump on immigration. But you can\u2019t \u2014 we\u2019re not gonna beat Hillary Clinton with someone who\u2019s willing to say or do anything to win an election.KELLY: Go ahead, Senator Cruz.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: You know, I like Marco. He\u2019s very charming. He\u2019s very smooth. But the facts are simple. When he ran for election in the state of Florida, he told the people of Florida, \u201cif you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty.\u201dWhen I ran in Texas, I told the people of Texas, \u201cif you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty.\u201d We both made the identical promises. But when we came to Washington, we made a different choice.Marco made the choice to go the direction of the major donors \u2014 to support amnesty because he thought it was politically advantageous.(BELL RINGS)I honored my commitments, and as president, I will honor every commitment that I make to the men and women of this country.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: All right.CHRISTIE: Megyn? KELLY: Go ahead, Governor Christie.CHRISTIE: I want to ask the people of the audience. Like, I\u2019m standing here, I \u2014 I watched the video of Senator Cruz. I watched the video of Senator Rubio. I heard what they said. And this is why you need to send someone from outside of Washington to Washington. (APPLAUSE)CHRISTIE: I feel like...(APPLAUSE)... I feel like I need \u2014 I feel like I need a Washington to English dictionary converter, right?(LAUGHTER)I mean, I heard what they both said, I saw it on the video. And the fact is this is what makes a difference when you\u2019re a governor. You can change your mind. Ted can change his mind. Marco can change his mind. It\u2019s perfectly legal in this country to change your mind. But when you\u2019re a governor, you have to admit it. You can\u2019t hide behind parliamentary tricks. That\u2019s the difference, and that\u2019s the kind of leader we need in the White House. Stop the Washington bull and let\u2019s get things done.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Let\u2019s go to a Youtube question. Let\u2019s get to a Youtube question. This is a question from a Youtube creator with over 2 million subscribers. Watch.QUESTION: I\u2019m Dulce Candy, a Youtube creator who immigrated to the United States from Mexico when I was a little girl. Since then, I am proud to say I served in the armed forces in Iraq, became a citizen and I am now an entrepreneur.There are many immigrants who contribute positively to the American economy, but some of the comments in the campaign make us question our place in this country. If America does not seem like a welcoming place for immigrant entrepreneurs, will the American economy suffer?KELLY: Dr. Carson, that\u2019s one \u2014 that one\u2019s for you.CARSON: Oh, great.(LAUGHTER)As I said before, we are a land of immigrants, but we have to be intelligent about the way that we form our immigration policies, and that\u2019s one of the reasons that I have called on us to declare war on the Islamic State because we need to reorient our immigration policies and our visa policies for people who are coming into this country because there are many people out there who want to destroy us.Now, I recognize that the vast majority of people coming in here probably are not those kinds of people, but that\u2019s not good enough. If you\u2019ve got 10 people coming to your house and you know one of them is a terrorist, you\u2019re probably going to keep them all out.You know, we probably have to figure out a way to make sure that we keep America safe.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: Can I \u2014 can I \u2014 I just...KELLY: Go ahead.BUSH: That beautiful young woman who\u2019s an entrepreneur who served in the military, first of all, is deserving of our respect for service in the military and the fact that she\u2019s an entrepreneur.(APPLAUSE)And we should be a welcoming nation. Our identity is not based on race or ethnicity, it\u2019s based on a set of shared values. That\u2019s American citizenship. And Dulce Candy \u2014 a pretty cool name, actually \u2014 that is now an entrepreneur over Youtube is part of that American spirit, and we should celebrate it as conservatives. That\u2019s what we believe in.You can \u2014 you can deal with the threat of terror and also recognize that this country should be aspirational across the board.RUBIO: And I think that\u2019s the false choice...(APPLAUSE)... that\u2019s the \u2014 that\u2019s the false choice in this whole debate about immigration. Of course, we\u2019re going to be a nation of immigrants. By the way, no nation on earth is more generous than America is. Every single year close to a million people emigrate to the United States legally. There\u2019s no nation on earth that comes close to that number.I think the only argument is are we a sovereign country, are we not allowed to choose who comes in, when they come in and how they come in? And that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening now.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: All right.RUBIO: I think the other problem is we have a legal immigration system that\u2019s outdated, it\u2019s primarily based on whether you have family members living here. In the 21st century, it has to be more of a merit-based system, and that is why our legal immigration system is in need of modernization. And we will always celebrate legal immigration like Dulce\u2019s great story.KELLY: All right. We\u2019re moving on.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Gentlemen, we\u2019re going to turn now to what we call electability, issues that you\u2019re either facing in the primaries or issues that you\u2019re certainly going to face in a general election. So you may not be altogether unhappy if you\u2019re not included in this round.(LAUGHTER)Senator Cruz, you pride yourself on standing up to the D.C. cartel, but as we\u2019ve seen to a certain degree tonight, there\u2019s a price for standing up to the D.C. cartel. Thirteen Republican senators have endorsed other candidates, none have endorsed you.You \u2014 twice last year, you asked for a colleague to second a motion, a routine courtesy on the Senate floor, and no senator would do it. Top GOP officials worry that if you\u2019re at the top of the ticket \u2014 some officials \u2014 that not only will you lose the White House, but it will tank the ticket all the way down the line.The question is does your style sometimes get in the way of your ability to get things done, sir?CURZ: Well, Chris, you are exactly right that I am not the candidate of career politicians in Washington. (APPLAUSE)This is a grassroots campaign and, you know, when I ran for senate in Texas, I told the people of Texas that I\u2019m not going there to go along to get along. Washington is broken.And the people I have been accountable to every single day in the Senate are the 27 million Texans who I represent and I made a promise to them that I make to you today, which is, if I am elected, every single day I will do two things: tell the truth, and do what I said I would do.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Thank you.KELLY: Governor bush, poll after poll shows you running among the worst in your party against Hillary Clinton. Even Mitt Romney said that a Bush v. Clinton head-to-head would be too easy for the Democrats.Yet still you and the super PACs supporting you continue to blanket the airwaves with cutting ads, not against Mrs. Clinton, but against your fellow Republicans, especially Senator Rubio.Do these attacks do more harm than good by targeting those candidates who appear to have the best chance of defeating Mrs. Clinton?BUSH: Well, first of all, I\u2019ve seen polls where I\u2019m beating Hillary Clinton pretty regularly.And I believe I can, because I have a proven record, a record of accomplishment, a record of cutting taxes, of shrinking the government, of reforming education, of challenging the status quo, eliminating career civil service protections, shrinking the government workforce by 11 percent, but leading the nation in job growth. That\u2019s the record of accomplishment that should be taken to Hillary Clinton, who has no record of accomplishment. So I\u2019m confident if I win this nomination, I will aggressively go against her and beat her.As it relates to the super PACs, I have no control over that. And this is beanbag compared to what the Clinton hit machine is going to do to the Republican nominee. The simple fact is, we all have a record. It all will be scrutinized. There\u2019s give and take. It\u2019s called the politics. And that\u2019s the way it is.I\u2019m running hard and I believe I\u2019ll be the Republican nominee and I\u2019ll be the one best suited to beat Hillary Clinton, who should not be president of the United States.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Senator Rubio, first before I ask you a question, any response to Governor Bush?RUBIO: Well, I believe, and I know that if Iowa helps make me the Republican nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton. Hillary doesn\u2019t want to run against me, but I cannot wait to run against her. And I cannot wait to earn the opportunity to do it because she cannot be the president of the United States.She wants to put Barack Obama on the Supreme Court of the United States of America. She said that here in Iowa just two days ago. That would be a disaster for this country.So I hope and pray and cannot wait until this state and others give me an opportunity to serve this party as its nominee because I will defeat Hillary Clinton.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)BAIER: Now let\u2019s talk about electability, Senator. TIME magazine once called you \u201cthe Republican savior.\u201d Rush Limbaugh and others said you likely will be president some day.But if you look at the recent average of polls in your home state of Florida, you\u2019re in third trailing Donald trump by 24 points. If the people who know you best have you there, why should the rest of the country elect you?RUBIO: Well, let me be clear about one thing, there\u2019s only one savior and it\u2019s not me. It\u2019s Jesus Christ who came down to earth and died for our sins.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: And so \u2014 and I\u2019ve always made that clear about that cover story.As far as the polls are concerned, Iowa, on Monday night you\u2019re going to go to a caucus site and you\u2019ll be the first Americans that vote in this election. You will be the first Americans that get to answer the fundamental question, what comes next for this country after seven disastrous years of Barack Obama?And let me tell you what the answer better not be. It better not be Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders is a socialist. I think Bernie Sanders is good candidate for president of Sweden.(LAUGHTER)We don\u2019t want to be Sweden. We want to be the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)And Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being the commander-in-chief of the United States. In fact, one of her first acts as president may very well be to pardon herself because Hillary Clinton...(LAUGHTER)Hillary Clinton stored classified information on her private server. And Hillary Clinton lied to the families of those four brave Americans who lost their life in Benghazi. And anyone who lies to the families of Americans who have died in the service of this country can never be commander-in-chief of the United States.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Thank you, Senator.WALLACE: Governor Christie, two of your former top aides go on trial in May for fraud and conspiracy in the \u201cBridge-gate\u201d case, the politically motivated closure of lanes to the George Washington Bridge.Another former aide who has already pleaded guilty and will likely testify for the government, as you know, says that you knew about this whole deal. Can the GOP take the chance of nominating you with this scandal still out there, sir?CHRISTIE: Sure, because there has been three different investigations and proven that I knew nothing. And the fact is that what I did do, what I did do from the beginning, Chris, as soon as I found out about it, I fired the people who were responsible. And that\u2019s what you expect from a leader.CHRISTIE: And, I\u2019ll tell you something else. I inherited a state in New Jersey that was downtrodden, and beaten by liberal democratic policies, high taxation, high regulation. And, this year, in 2015, New Jersey\u2019s had the best year of job growth that our state has ever had in the last 15 years. That\u2019s because we\u2019ve put conservative policies in place.And, I\u2019ll tell you one other thing, you know why the Republican party will want to take a chance on me? Because they know that Hillary Clinton will never be prosecuted by this justice department, and they\u2019re going to want to put a former federal prosecutor on the stage to prosecute her next September. And, there is no one on this stage better prepared to prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton than I am.I will be ready. I will take her on, and when I take her on I guarantee you one thing, she will never get within 10 miles of the White House. The days for the Clintons in public housing are over.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Welcome back, everybody. Let\u2019s get back to the questions. Chris?WALLACE: Gentlemen, almost 60% of Republican caucus-goers identify themselves as Evangelicals, so I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes exploring social issues.Governor Kasich, you talk a good deal about your faith. In fact, you say it played a role in your decision to expand Medicaid, and you say that when you meet Saint Peter at the Pearly Gates, he\u2019s going to ask what you did for the poor, not what you did to keep government small.Senator Cruz is on the opposite side of this issue from you, so does that mean that you\u2019re getting in and he isn\u2019t?(LAUGHTER)KASICH: No. You know, Chris, here\u2019s what happened with Medicaid in my state. We took the growth of Medicaid from over 10 percent in my second budget to 2.5 percent, without cutting off one person or cutting one benefit, because we \u2014 we innovated the government.And now mom and dad can stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home. And then we decided we could bring $14 billion of our money \u2014 I mean, Washington doesn\u2019t have any money. It was our money, and we brought them back to tend to the mentally ill. Because I don\u2019t think they ought to live in prison or live under a bridge; to treat the drug-addicted so they\u2019re not in an in-and-out-of- the-door policy out of the prisons; and to help the working poor so they don\u2019t live in emergency rooms.How has it worked? Well, we have treated the drug-addicted in our prisons and we released them in to the community, and our recidivism rate is less than 20 percent. That\u2019s basically bordering on a miracle because of our great prison director. The mentally ill? They\u2019ve been stepped on for too long in this society, and we are beginning to treat them.In terms of my faith, look, all I say is that when I study scripture, I know that people who live in the shadows need to have a chance. But I\u2019m not deciding that anybody\u2019s got to make these decisions the way that I do, on the basis of what I do. But what \u2014 I will tell you this. The time has come to stop ignoring the mentally ill in this country and begin to treat them and get them on their feet, along with, of course, with treating the drug-addicted.(APPLAUSE)Because we don\u2019t want them in and out \u2014 we don\u2019t want them in and out of the prisons. Give people a chance. We talked about criminal justice reform. We\u2019ve enacted it in our state. Look, the conservative message is economic growth and along with economic growth goes opportunity for everybody in America. Everybody ought to have a chance to be able to rise to their God-given purpose.And that is what we have done in Ohio. We\u2019re running surpluses. We\u2019re up 400,000 jobs. And guess what? The formula is working. I\u2019d suggest people take a look at it.Thank you.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Gentlemen, we had a case study on religious liberty just this last summer. A county clerk in Kentucky named Kim Davis refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples after the Supreme Court ruling, saying that it violated her religious beliefs.Governor Christie, you said that she must follow the law or be moved to another job that would be in keeping with her conscience. But some conservatives say that that violates her religious liberty.CHRISTIE: No, what I said, Chris, was that the law needs to be followed. And that someone in that office has to do their job. So if Ms. Davis wanted to step aside and get rid of her ability to be able to do that, there should be someone else in that office who it didn\u2019t violate their conscience so they could follow the law of the state of Kentucky.I never said that Ms. Davis should either lose her job or that she had to do it. But what I did say was that the person who came in for the license needed to get it. And so if there\u2019s someone in that organization, and it turns out there was, who was willing to be able to do that, that\u2019s what we should do.But just as importantly, and I agree with what John said. You know, we all have our own individual interpretations of our faith. And here\u2019s the problem with what\u2019s going on around the world. The radical Islamic jihadists, what they want to do is impose their faith upon each and every one of us \u2014 every one of us. And the reason why this war against them is so important is that very basis of religious liberty.They want everyone in this country to follow their religious beliefs the way they do. They do not want us to exercise religious liberty. That\u2019s why as commander in chief, I will take on ISIS, not only because it keeps us safe, but because it allows us to absolutely conduct our religious affairs the way we find in our heart and in our souls. As a Catholic, that\u2019s what I want to do. And no matter what your faith is, that\u2019s what I want you to be able to do.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Thank you, sir.Senator Rubio, during the last debate, you said Governor Christie had changed his position and his mind on gun control, on common core, and backing President Obama\u2019s nomination of Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court. He said you\u2019re wrong on the facts and you can\u2019t, quote, \u201cslime your way to the White House.\u201d I assume in the last two weeks, you\u2019ve done some fact-checking. Do you want to take anything back?It is not because of the tax writeoff. It is because in this nation, we are influenced by Judeo-Christian values that teach us to care for the less fortunate, to reach out to the needy, to love our neighbor. This is what\u2019s made our nation so special.And you should hope that our next president is someone that is influence by their faith. Because if your faith causes you to care for the less fortunate, it is something you want to see in your public figures. And when I\u2019m president, I can tell you this, my faith will not just influence the way I\u2019ll govern as president, it will influence the way I live my life.RUBIO: Because in the end, my goal is not simply to live on this earth for 80 years, but to live an eternity with my creator. And I will always allow my faith to influence everything I do.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Thank you, senator.Senator Paul, in May on the campaign trail you, said you didn\u2019t get into politics to fight about abortion. You said you were more concerned about the national debt. Your answer is to turn abortion back to the states the way it was before Roe v. Wade.Does that mean that if a liberal state, let\u2019s say, wants to make abortion legal, that you\u2019re okay with that and what do you say to conservative voters who believe deeply that abortion is murder?PAUL: You know, I think abortion is always wrong. I\u2019ve supported a variety of solutions, both state as well as federal. In fact, just last week, I introduced the Life at Conception act, which would say that the 14th amendment would defend an individual even in the womb.But I think on the broader question of religion and politics, you know, I think liberty, itself requires a virtue \u2014 requires a virtuous people. In fact, Washington said that democracy requires a virtuous people.Oz Guinness, the theologian, said that liberty requires restraint but the only restraint consistent with liberty is self-restraint. There\u2019s a lot packed into that statement. But the bottom line is we must have virtue, we must have a religious bearing as a nation. The government is not always going to save us and it\u2019s not always going to come from government.But if we don\u2019t know right and wrong, I think we have lost our way. I think we become unmoored and I think without the religious foundation that guides us all, I think we have a great risk of going horribly in the wrong direction.WALLLACE: Sir, just 30 seconds to answer my specific...(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Just 30 seconds to answer my specific question. Do you favor the idea that abortion should be a states\u2019 rights issue and if a liberal state wants to make it legal, that that\u2019s their choice? Yes or no?PAUL: Both. No, both the federal and a state approach. I have said that we could leave it to the states but I\u2019ve also introduced a federal solution as well. So the federal solution would be the Life at Conception act which is an act that would federalize the issue.But I\u2019ve also said for the most part, these issues would be left back to the states. So there might be an occasion if we did overturn Roe v. Wade \u2014 Roe v. Wade nationalized the issue. If you had the court reverse Roe v. Wade, it would become a state issue once again.I think it would be better the more \u2014 the less abortions we have, so the more states that we have that made abortion illegal, the better, as far as trying to save and preserve lives.WALLACE: Thank you, sir.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Gentlemen.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: I\u2019d like to ask you a few questions about foreign policy broadly.Dr. Carson, many experts believe Russian leader Vladimir Putin has greater ideas, bigger designs for the region beyond Russia\u2019s actions inside Ukraine. Fast forward to February 2017 and it is President Carson, and Russian uniformed commandos cross the Estonian border and they occupy a city in Estonia. Estonia, a member of NATO, essentially invokes Article IV, an attack on one is an attack on all. What do you do?CARSON: Look, first of all, I recognize that Vladimir Putin is an opportunist and he\u2019s a bully, and we have to face him down. And I would \u2014 first of all, face him down in that whole region, the whole Baltic region. I think we need to put in some armored brigades there. We only have one or two. We need much more than that. We need to be doing military exercises if not only Estonia but Latvia and Lithuania. They\u2019re terrified by the saber rattling. I think we ought to put in our missile defense system.I think we ought to give Ukraine offensive weapons and I think we ought to fight them on the economic basis because Putin is a one- horse country: oil and energy. And we ought to fight them on that level.We ought to be helping in terms of the technology for fracking, keeping the price low, quite frankly, because that\u2019s what\u2019s keeping him contained. So, yes, I\u2019d absolutely would go in if he attacked. I think on Article IV of NATO, we would definitely protect all of our allies.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Gentlemen, you\u2019ve all said that the Iran nuclear deal is a bad one.Senator Rubio, you were among the candidates who\u2019ve said you would tear it up on day one. But as you know, Iran has already received tens of millions of dollars \u2014 tens of billions of dollars in this deal and has quickly reestablished ties economically with Europe.The major concessions, in other words, are up front in this deal. So should you win by the time you take office, the remaining parts of the deal would be the constraints on Iran. So why blow up those constraints on day one, letting Iran off the hook?RUBIO: Well, let me first describe Iran because they\u2019re not just a normal nation state. And we have no quarrel with the Iranian people. But the Iranian leader, their supreme leader is a radical Shia cleric who has an apocalyptic vision of the future. RUBIO: He views himself not simply as the leader of Iran, but as the leader of all Muslims \u2014 all Shia Muslims on the planet. And they have a desire not simply to conquer the Middle East and to become the dominant power in that region, but ultimately to be able to hold America hostage.That is why they\u2019re building an \u2014 right now, developing long- range missiles capable of reaching the United States, and that is why there\u2019s going \u2014 they\u2019re going to use those $100 billion to expand their conventional capabilities and to one day buy or build a nuclear weapon.We will \u2014 when I am president of the United States, on my first day in office, we are canceling the deal with Iran, and nations will have to make a choice. They can do business with Iran, or they can do business with America, and I am very confident they\u2019re going to choose America before they choose the Iranian economy.BAIER: Governor Kasich, you\u2019ve said that Marco Rubio is wrong...(APPLAUSE)... that Senator Rubio is wrong with tearing it up on day one.KASICH: Look, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in ten months. And if I were president of the United States right now, I\u2019d be lining up our allies to say that, if one crossed T or one dotted I does not occur, they are \u2014 violate the agreement, we slap back on sanctions.We can slap on sanctions alone, on day one, but it\u2019s not gonna be anywhere near as effective. But the president needs to be laying the groundwork right now for the ability to slap those sanctions back on worldwide.And I\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019m worried about \u2014 I\u2019m worried about money. You read about all the companies now that are doing business \u2014 about to do business in Iran, and if we don\u2019t get this settled now, with other countries in the world, about sanctions, then Iran could violate that agreement, and we\u2019re the only ones putting the sanctions on.We need to move aggressively now. But I would say this to you, Bret. Number one, if they violate it, we need to move against them. And number two, if we find out they\u2019re developing a nuclear weapon and we know how to get to it, we\u2019re gonna go take it out. That is what we have to do. We cannot let things get farther down the road, like we did with North Korea.BAIER: But Governor Kasich, you know that the most powerful sanctions are the multilateral ones.KASICH: That\u2019s right. Yes.BAIER: And these European countries are already reestablishing these ties.KASICH: I know, Bret.BAIER: They don\u2019t want...KASICH: But Bret, here\u2019s the problem. You take a look at the \u2014 at Belgium. I talked to a diplomat from Belgium. I said, \u201chow\u2019s it going?\u201d He said, \u201cwe have the military in the streets right now. We never dreamt we\u2019d ever see it.\u201dSee, I think there is an opportunity to bring the world together. The Turks are being threatened. We know about the French. We know about the Belgians. We know about the Brits. Everybody is under fire and under attack, and we have to stand together as an alliance.So actually, the opportunity is there, because of the threat to all of these countries, to bring all of us together...(BELL RINGS)... and say there is something more important than money. It is the future of the world and the future of our children and grandchildren. That\u2019s the kind of leadership this country needs. It has not been in effect during the administration of Barack Obama.And that\u2019s only the beginning of the failures that they have committed, not only in the Middle East, but all over the world, including Russia and China.BAIER: Governor, thank you. Governor Christie...(APPLAUSE)... Libya is the newest base for ISIS. Just today, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said ISIS is consolidating their footprint there and also setting up training facilities.So if you were president, would you deploy U.S. troops to Libya to take out ISIS there?CHRISTIE: Bret, let me tell you, this is another one of those places where Hillary Clinton has so much to answer for, and why she is completely unqualified to be commander in chief.In a previous Democratic debate, Martha Raddatz, three times, asked Hillary Clinton about the failure in Libya, a policy that she took credit for, and said, \u201cwhat is your measure of responsibility, Madam Secretary, for the failure in Libya?\u201d Three times, she refused to answer the question, because she refuses to be held accountable for anything that goes wrong. If it had gone right, believe me, she would have been running around to be able to take credit for it.Here\u2019s what I\u2019d do. This is about the bigger, broader war against ISIS. We need to bring together our European and our Sunni Arab allies, and we need to develop a strategy together to take on ISIS every place that it is around the world, so that together, all of us can take ISIS out, destroy it, and then move on to come back to our country, protect our homeland security and make sure that the American people are safe.As president of the United States, that is exactly what I will do.BAIER: Thank you, Governor.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Welcome back to Des Moines. Let\u2019s resume the debate. Megyn?KELLY: Senator Paul, you have suggested that former President Bill Clinton\u2019s history with women is fair game in this campaign. How do you answer those who say you don\u2019t hold the sins of the husband against the wife?PAUL: You know, I\u2019ve never really brought this up unless asked the question, but I have responded to the question. I don\u2019t blame Hillary Clinton at all for this. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s responsible for his behavior. But I do think that her position as promoting women\u2019s rights and fairness to women in the workplace, that if what Bill Clinton did any CEO in our country did with an intern, with a 22-year- old, 21-year-old intern in their office, they would be fired. They would never be hired again.(APPLAUSE)Fired, never hired again and probably shunned in their community. And the thing is, she can\u2019t be a champion of women\u2019s rights at the same time she\u2019s got this that is always lurking out there, this type of behavior. So it is difficult.KELLY: Of her husband\u2019s?PAUL: Yeah. But I combine this also with the millions upon millions of dollars they\u2019ve taken from regimes in the Middle East who treat women like cattle.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: We have another question from one of Youtube\u2019s top creators. Here it is.QUESTION: I\u2019m Nabela Noor. I\u2019m a Muslim American born and raised in the U.S. who creates beauty and lifestyle videos on Youtube.In 2015, the number of hate crimes against Muslims in the U.S. has tripled, and on social media, where I spend a lot of time, I\u2019ve seen many attacks directed towards fellow Muslims. This culture of hatred is only driving ISIS to radicalize, recruit and incite violence.As president, what would you do to address this toxic climate and promote increased tolerance in the United States?WALLACE: Governor Bush, how do you answer Nabela?BUSH: Well first of all, I think it\u2019s important that when we\u2019re running for the highest office in the land that we recognize that we\u2019re living in dangerous times and we have to be serious about it, that our words have consequences.Donald Trump, for example \u2014 I\u2019m glad \u2014 I mentioned his name again just if anybody was missing him... (LAUGHTER)BUSH: ... Mr. Trump believed that in reaction to people\u2019s fears that we should ban all Muslims. Well, that creates an environment that\u2019s toxic in our own country. Nobela (ph) is a rising entrepreneur. She wants to pursue the American dream. She\u2019s an American citizen. She should not feel uncomfortable about her citizenship. She\u2019s not the threat. The threat is Islamic terrorism.We need to focus our energies there, not these broad, blanket, kind of statements that will make it harder for us to deal with ISIS. We need to deal with ISIS in the caliphate. We need a strategy to destroy ISIS there. You can\u2019t do that without the cooperation of the Muslim world because they\u2019re as threatened as we are.So, I think it\u2019s important for us to be careful about the language we use, which is why I\u2019ve been critical of Donald Trump. Disparaging women, disparaging hispanics, that\u2019s not a sign of strength. Making fun of disabled people...(BELL RINGING)BUSH: ... We\u2019re never going to win elections if we don\u2019t have a more broader unifying message.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Governor, thank you. Senator Cruz, change of subject. You called for an end to the renewable fuel standards which mandate that refineries blend biofuels, including ethanol into gasoline. As you well know, ethanol\u2019s a big industry in this state, $10 billion dollars a year.Last week, Terry Branstad, the popular Governor of Iowa...(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: ... Who is in the hall tonight, said that you\u2019re bankrolled by big oil, and that Iowa voters would be making a mistake supporting you. Why should those voters side with you over the six- term governor of the state, sir?CRUZ: Well, Chris, I\u2019m glad to discuss my views on ethanol and energy. I think God has blessed this country with enormous natural resources, and we should pursue all of the above. We should be developing oil, and gas, and coal, and nuclear, and wind, and solar, and ethanol, and biofuels. But, I don\u2019t believe that Washington should be picking winners and losers. And, I think there should be no mandates, and no subsidies whatsoever.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: And, indeed, my tax plan that I\u2019ve introduced, it\u2019s available on our website. It\u2019s a simple flat tax for everyone. It\u2019ll produce enormous economic growth, and it eliminates every mandate, every subsidy, so there\u2019s no subsidies for oil and gas, no subsidies for anyone.Now, it is true that there are a bunch of lobbyists, and a bunch of Democrats in this state spending millions of dollars trying to convince the people of Iowa that I somehow oppose ethanol. It\u2019s not true. I have introduced legislation that would phase out the ethanol mandate over five years, but that is in the context of having no mandates whatsoever for anyone.And, I would not that there\u2019s a much more important government regulation to ethanol, and that\u2019s the EPA\u2019s blend wall that makes it illegal to sell mid-level blends of ethanol in gasoline. I will...(BELL RINGING)CRUZ: ... Tear down the EPA\u2019s blend wall which will enable ethanol to expand its market share by up to 60%, all without mandates. All without any government mandates whatsoever through the marketplace. And, I\u2019ll note finally, Chris, there is a reason that Iowa\u2019s Congressman Steve King, perhaps the fiercest defender of farmers in this state, is sharing my campaign. Because he understands that I\u2019m committed to a fair, and level playing field for every energy source without lobbyists, and without Washington picking winners and losers.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Dr. Carson, I\u2019d like to ask you about exactly that issue. Where are you on the mandatory ethanol standard, and precisely this question. Should government be in the business of picking winners and losers, or should it be left to the market place?CARSON: Well, as anyone knows who\u2019s been listening to me, you know? I\u2019m very much against the government being involved in every aspect of our lives, you know? We last year there was an additional 81,000 pages of government regulations. If you stack that up it would be a three-story building. This is absolutely absurd. And, they\u2019ve insinuated themselves into everything.Now, as far as the renewable fuel standard is concerned, certain promises were made, certain government contracts were issued which extend all the way into the year 2022, and I believe that it\u2019s probably unfair to withdraw the rug because people have invested money. People have invested a lot of energy into that.But, you know, we are blessed with tremendous energy in this nation, and we need to be talking for new sources of energy. Seventy percent of our population lives by costly (ph). What about hydroelectric power? We can develop that, you know? We have so much natural gas now, and we can liquify it, and we can transfer it across the sea so we can make Europe dependent on us instead of Putin \u2014 put him back in his little box where he belongs.CARSON: Those are the kinds of things that we ought to be doing. And, you know, take advantage of the tremendous opportunities in energy that God has given us, not get involved in these little petty arguments.And we can get a lot of them out if we get the government out of our lives.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Doctor, thank you.BAIER: Coming up, closing statements from the candidates as our debate continues, live, from Des Moines, Iowa.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Welcome back, everybody. And now, it is time for closing statements. The candidates each get 30 seconds.And we begin with Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.PAUL: Well, thanks for having me. It\u2019s great to be back.(APPLAUSE)I\u2019m an eye surgeon from Bowling Green, Kentucky, I miss doing eye surgery, still get to do a little bit. Did a couple of cataract surgeries over Christmas holidays. Got to go to Haiti last year. I\u2019ve gotten to do some incredible things. Got to be on the floor of the Senate. And it has been amazing to me.But the thing that is most important to me and caused me to run for office is I\u2019m worried about the country and how much debt we\u2019re adding. And I am the one true fiscal conservative who will look at all spending. And that\u2019s the only way we\u2019ll ever balance our budget.Thank you.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Ohio Governor Kasich.KASICH: You know, one of our biggest national security issues is the world looks at us some time, and we look at each other and say, why can\u2019t we solve problems? Well, I\u2019ve got news for you, we can. We can in fact create jobs and provide job security. We can create a situation where wages begin to rise. We can create a situation for our children to be able to get a decent job to pay down their college debt. We can re-assume our role in the world.But all of this has to come together when we have a positive attitude, an optimistic approach, an ability for us to set the tune as conservatives, to invite other people in to be part of that orchestra. KASICH: You see, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of the day, I\u2019m an optimist(BELL RINGS)Because I\u2019ve seen so many things get accomplished in my lifetime. And we can do it again together, all of us, to strengthen this country, work together. Thank you.(APPLAUSE) BAIER: New Jersey governor, Chris Christie.CHRISTIE: On September 11, my wife was two blocks from the World Trade Center. When those buildings came down, she was trapped in her building and I didn\u2019t hear from her over six hours.We have three children, eight, five and one. And I had to confront the possibility of being a single parent. Terrorism in this country scares everyone. And the fact is that we need a commander-in- chief who not only understands how to protect us, but feels in here what it means to face the possibility of loss.I\u2019ve faced it. I\u2019ve prosecuted terrorists. I have made the decisions that need to be made as a governor to protect us and as president of the United States, no one will keep this country safer than I will.BAIER: Thank you governor.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. Governor.BUSH: We desperately need a conservative leader as president of the United States. I have a proven record as governor of the state of Florida, as a conservative leader. And I also have detailed plans to fix the mess in Washington, D.C.As president I will restore and rebuild our military, restore the alliances and keep us safe. And as our party\u2019s nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton in November. I ask for your support on the caucuses come Monday night and I will make you proud as our party\u2019s nominee. Thank you very much.(APPLAUSE) WALLACE: Dr. Ben Carson.CARSON: I want to thank the people of Iowa for being so welcoming to me. Please think of our founding fathers as you listen. We the people of the United States in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the benefits of liberty to ourselves and our prosperity, do ordain and establish this constitution of the United States of America. Folks, it\u2019s not too late. Enough said.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Florida Senator Marco Rubio.RUBIO: The bible commands us to let our light shine on the world. For over 200 years, America\u2019s light has been shining on the world and the world has never been the same again. But now, that light is dimming a little, after seven years of Barack Obama. And that\u2019s why Monday night, what will happen here in Iowa is so important.I\u2019m asking you for your vote. Caucus for me on Monday night because if I am your nominee, I will unite this party and I will defeat Hillary Clinton and when I\u2019m president, America\u2019s light will shine again and the 21 century will be a new American century.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Thank you senator.KELLY: Texas Senator, Ted Cruz. Senator.CRUZ: Ninety-three hours. The media noise will soon be over and it\u2019s now for the men and women of Iowa to decide. Our country is in crisis. We\u2019re worried the future of our children and we\u2019ve have been burned over and over again.The central question in this race is trust. Who do you know will kill the terrorists, defend the constitution and repeal Obamacare? Who do you know will stop amnesty and secure the borders? Who do you know will defend life, marriage and religious liberty? Examine our records, pray on it and I will be honored if you and your family will come caucus for us on Monday night.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Gentlemen, thank you all so much for being here tonight. We appreciate it greatly. And that does it for the seventh Republican primary debate of the 2016 presidential race. But we\u2019re not done. The Kelly file starts in a moment and guess who is going to be there? Senator Ted Cruz.WALLACE: And don\u2019t forget, after all the talk, the first voting of the 2016 campaign happens in just four days. The first Americans to vote, the Iowa caucuses are Monday and Fox News will have complete coverage.BAIER: And we have you covered from Iowa, all the way to the conventions and on to the general election. Thanks again for joining us. For all of us here in Des Moines, have a great evening.ENDAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Roller Coaster Year Ends With U.S. Markets Mostly Down", "Date": "2015-12-31", "News": "Supported byInvestors may be disappointed with the lackluster performance of the United States stock market in 2015, but, given all that happened, it could have been worse.It was a year when corporate earnings underwhelmed, Greece nearly crashed out of the euro, China carried out a shock devaluation of its currency, the price of oil slumped and the Federal Reserve increased interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.After its close on Thursday, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index finished the year down 0.73 percent. The performance was well below the solid gains of the last three years.But the index was still up 63 percent over the last five years. What is more, the stock market was able to bounce back from a summer rout that dragged the S.&P. 500 more than 10 percent below the nominal high it reached in May. After reinvesting dividends, the benchmark was up 2.35 percent in 2015.\u201cI don\u2019t remember a year where there were so many roller coasters along the way,\u201d said David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff. \u201cThe whole year was like a giant theme park.\u201dIn short, after many months of low volatility in the markets, the convulsions of 2015 were a jarring reminder that investing in stocks can be a risky business. And while plenty of analysts on Wall Street have relatively optimistic forecasts for 2016, many of the forces that upset markets in 2015 \u2014 like uncertainties about currencies and commodities and the potentially chilling effect of higher interest rates \u2014 could continue to buffet markets.The S.&P. 500 on Thursday fell 19.42 points, or 0.94 percent, to close at 2,043.94. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 178.84 points, or 1.02 percent, leaving it down 2.2 percent for the year, its first annual decline since 2008. The technology-heavy Nasdaq index did better than the other two benchmarks in 2015, rising 5.73 percent for the year.And technology firms were among the top performers in 2015.Shares in Netflix, which continues to add subscribers at a fast pace, were the biggest gainer in the S.&.P 500 index in 2015, soaring 133 percent. Amazon\u2019s stock was the second-best performer, more than doubling in 2015 as the company surprised investors with stronger profits. In contrast, Walmart, its bricks-and-mortar rival, dropped 29 percent.Lower oil and gas prices hurt the prospects of energy companies. This caused the energy companies within the S.&P. 500 to lose nearly one-fourth of their value in 2015.The pain in the oil and gas sector also caused stress in the junk bond market, where energy companies have borrowed huge amounts in recent years. The prices of junk bonds fell over 10 percent in 2015, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch\u2019s United States high-yield master index.The selling in the more speculative reaches of the credit markets is a sign that several years of speculation, brought about by ultralow interest rates, may now be unwinding. Some analysts expect the shakeout to intensify.\u201cHigh-yield credit is going to get a lot worse,\u201d said Atul Lele, chief investment officer at Deltec International, an investment firm. He also thinks emerging markets, where stock markets fell steeply in 2015, will continue to suffer in 2016, as companies in developing countries struggle to repay dollars that they borrowed in recent years. \u201cThe problem is that they are going to be defaulting on U.S. dollar debt and they don\u2019t have the dollar liquidity,\u201d Mr. Lele said.The crucial question is whether the United States economy can continue growing at around its current rate as the Fed raises interest rates. Away from the stock market, there were indications that investors are not confident about the outlook for the economy. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note might have been expected to rise considerably in 2015 as the economy grew and unemployment fell. Yet the note closed on Thursday with a yield of 2.27 percent, barely higher than the 2.17 percent at the end of 2014.Likewise, the price of oil, as measured by the benchmark United States crude contract in New York, fell by nearly a third in 2015. Some analysts saw the plunge as a portent of weak global growth, since it might indicate that companies are buying less oil to fuel their operations.Yet despite such indicators, many analysts said they saw activity within the United States economy that could keep it growing at a moderate pace. For instance, they said, United States consumers, benefiting from potentially higher wages and lower energy costs, could gain further confidence in 2016. While higher wages might dent profit margins for firms, higher spending by consumers could also bolster sales for certain companies. \u201cNext year is going to be the year of the wage breakout,\u201d said Mr. Rosenberg, the strategist. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be a pervasive theme.\u201dGloomier stock market watchers, however, said that problems they perceived in the global economy would most likely deepen in 2016, undermining the United States\u2019 recovery and the country\u2019s stock market. In their view, the monetary stimulus of the world\u2019s central banks has been of limited effectiveness. As a result, countries are choosing to let their currencies fall as a way of stoking their exports and thus their economies. The starkest example of this occurred in August, when China shocked the world by letting its long-stable currency, the renminbi, devalue slightly.As others have devalued, the United States dollar has strengthened. This can hurt companies based in the United States in two ways. They might find it harder to export and they might have to sell their goods at lower prices within the United States to compete with foreign firms. Their profits would suffer as result, and the deflationary forces in the economy might gain strength. To the bearish analysts, the devaluations and the problems they cause are an indication that policy makers are running out of ideas.\u201cI look around the world and see financial markets believing that the authorities are in control \u2014 but they are not,\u201d said Albert Edwards, a strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale in London.The bulls, of course, scoff at such pessimism. But even they say the days of indiscriminately buying stocks and watching them go up are over for now. Many of the financial moves that companies have recently deployed to increase profits \u2014 like stock buybacks and borrowing at ever-lower interest rates \u2014 may become harder to carry out.\u201cThe era of throwing a dart against the wall, of the rising tide lifting all boats, is behind us,\u201d Mr. Rosenberg said, \u201cYou\u2019ll have to do more homework in the coming year.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Investors, led by Carl C. Icahn, have pushed for a radical breakup so that A.I.G. can avoid the regulatory burden of being labeled a systemically important financial institution, or SIFI, by the government. The SIFI designation only costs $150 million a year, but that could change once regulators complete the rules for insurers. Carving up A.I.G. now, though, would mean forgoing almost 10 times that amount in tax benefits. The numbers raise questions about how Apple will satisfy investors who want growth and consumers who want new, cutting-edge technology. Steven Davidoff Solomon writes in the Deal Professor column.In a down market, what was volatile on the upside is now shooting downward, bringing this exuberance tumbling back to earth. This happened in the financial crisis of 2008, and history seems to be repeating itself this year with hedge funds, including Pershing Square and Icahn Enterprises, buffeted by the downturn. The result would not only be a reduction in the number of activist attacks. One or two highflying funds may collapse, and some of the stronger funds may survive and buy opportunistically.

{"Headline": "Court Rejects a Bid to Block Coal Plant Regulations", "Date": "2016-01-21", "News": "Supported byIn a significant victory for President Obama, a federal appeals panel on Thursday rejected an effort by 27 states and dozens of corporations and industry groups to block the administration\u2019s signature regulation on emissions from coal-fired power plants while a lawsuit moves through the courts.The rule, issued last summer by the Environmental Protection Agency, is at the heart of Mr. Obama\u2019s efforts to tackle climate change. It would require each state to significantly cut greenhouse gas pollution from electric power plants, the nation\u2019s largest source of such emissions. Once fully in place, the regulation \u2014 which would cut emissions from existing power plants by 32 percent from 2005 levels by 2030 \u2014 could transform the electricity system, closing hundreds of heavily polluting coal-fired plants and sharply increasing production of wind and solar powers. But the 27 states, many of which have economies that rely on coal mining or coal-fired power, have sued the administration to kill the plan. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit set June 2 to hear arguments in that case, although it is widely expected to be ultimately decided by the Supreme Court, most likely in 2017.\u201cWe are pleased that the court has rejected petitioners\u2019 attempts to block the Clean Power Plan from moving forward while litigation proceeds,\u201d said Josh Earnest, the White House spokesman. \u201cWe look forward to continuing to work with states and other stakeholders taking steps to implement the Clean Power Plan.\u201dBy rejecting the petition on Thursday, a three-judge panel of the court required states to move forward with plans to shut down polluting coal plants and build new wind and solar sources.\u201cObviously, we\u2019re extremely pleased, since today\u2019s order rejects extreme mischaracterizations of the Clean Power Plan and efforts to delay its implementation,\u201d said Sean Donohue, a lawyer for the Environmental Defense Fund. \u201cWe\u2019re not that surprised, since E.P.A. was able to show that the rule rests on a firm statutory and factual footing, and that the agency built into it ample time to allow states, regulated sources and the agency to work together to reduce carbon emissions.\u201dMr. Donohue said Thursday\u2019s action made him optimistic that the courts would ultimately uphold the rule.The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.Attorney General Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia, a coal mining state that has led the legal push against Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change agenda, noted that the court did not rule on the merits of the lawsuit. \u201cWe are disappointed in today\u2019s decision but believe we will ultimately prevail in court,\u201d Mr. Morrisey said. \u201cWe remain confident that our arguments will prevail as the case continues,\u201d potentially to the Supreme Court, he added.Opponents of the rule said they were pleased that the court set a relatively quick schedule for hearing the broader case.\u201cToday\u2019s decision to expedite the legal review of the Obama administration\u2019s electricity regulations indicates that the court agrees that it is important to review the rules quickly,\u201d said Karen Harbert, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s Institute for 21st Century Energy. The chamber is a plaintiff in the case. \u201cWe look forward to presenting our arguments to the court as part of an expedited review process, and we will continue our efforts to halt the E.P.A.\u2019s unprecedented effort to restructure the American economy,\u201d she added.The court\u2019s decision came as Mr. Obama is pushing forward with a series of initiatives on climate change, in an effort to leave as large a mark on the issue as he can before leaving office in a year.Last week, the Interior Department announced a moratorium on new leases for coal mining on public lands, part of a review by the agency that is expected to lead to an increase in the rates and royalties charged to mining companies.As soon as Friday, the department is expected to propose new regulations aimed at curbing the release of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, from oil and gas drilling operations on public lands.On Thursday, the White House also announced that the Department of Housing and Urban Development would award $1 billion in \u201cclimate resilience\u201d funding to communities in 13 states to help them rebuild from and prepare for disasters linked to climate change, such as wildfires in California, flooding in Iowa, and hurricanes and extreme storms in Louisiana, New York and New Jersey.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Make Sense of Plummeting Global Markets", "Date": "2016-01-20", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsThe price of oil is where most of the action is, with West Texas Intermediate Crude trading below $27 a barrel Wednesday, down from around $37 at the end of December, $60 in June and $100 in mid-2014. The broad S.&P. is down 9 percent so far in 2016, and stock indexes in many emerging economies are down even more. Bond and currency markets point to economic troubles in oil-producing nations. (Considering a trip to Quebec? Good move. The Canadian dollar is down 19 percent against the United States dollar since May).What makes these falling prices unnerving is that it\u2019s hard to tell a simple story about what is driving them. It could be that the markets are moving according to their own internal logic, driven by money managers\u2019 psychology, with their habitual toggle between fear and greed turning back toward the former. More frightening: The markets could be pricing in some darker facts about the outlook for the world that economists don\u2019t fully understand.In the past, when signals were so negative, there usually was a clearer story to tell.In the summer and fall of 2011, markets were tumbling on fears that the union using the euro currency would dissolve; in 2008, it was fears that the global financial system would collapse; in 2000 it was on the realization that stock prices, especially for tech companies, had gotten out of line.Oil prices are down so much that profits of oil companies will suffer mightily, and some will surely go bankrupt. They have already been cutting way back on investment in oil exploration. But traditionally, that has been counterbalanced by celebrations from industrial and transportation companies and from ordinary people over lower bills for gasoline and other forms of fuel.The impulse when the stock market falls hard for a few days in a row is to do something but it probably doesn\u2019t make much sense to overhaul an investment strategy based on a blip of market activity.One piece of evidence for this theory: Bank stocks have fallen even more in 2016 than the stock market over all, implying that investors believe banks did a little too much oil-field lending, though certainly this won\u2019t amount to the kinds of declines and major troubles of 2008.Another possibility is that this sell-off reflects the unwinding of \u201cherd\u201d behavior among global asset managers, who piled into similar investments during the 2009 to 2014 stock market rally and are now racing to unload the same high-yield bonds, emerging market stocks and energy investments all at once. In this telling, the moves in market prices reflect more the psychology of money managers than fundamental information about the state of the global economy.Financial markets are always more volatile than the underlying economy; the stock market has predicted nine of the last five recessions, as an old line often credited to the economist Paul Samuelson has it.At the same time, sometimes markets know something that smarty-pants economists (or economic writers) don\u2019t. It was certainly true in the fall of 2007, when the stock and bond markets were more prescient about the looming recession in the United States than the consensus view of economists.The challenge for investors is to determine whether the stock market moves of the last few weeks represent the rational kind of fear or the irrational kind of fear, and we probably won\u2019t know the answer anytime soon.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Taiwan\u2019s New Leader Faces a Weak Economy and China\u2019s Might", "Date": "2016-01-16", "News": "Supported byTAIPEI, Taiwan \u2014 Before Tsai Ing-wen felt the thrill of victory on Saturday by becoming the first woman to be elected president of Taiwan, she was no stranger to the sting of defeat.\u201cThat was probably the lowest moment ever for the D.P.P.,\u201d said Joseph Wu, the party\u2019s secretary general. \u201cThe party was seriously in debt. We had very low morale after the presidential defeat, and no one was willing to serve as party chairperson to pick up the pieces.\u201dShe stepped down as party chairwoman after the loss, but took up the position again two years later. D.P.P. officials said they returned to her because she represented the best hope of winning. \u201cEven though she lost in 2012, her campaign gained a lot more support than we had in 2008,\u201d Mr. Wu said. \u201cThe party and her followers seemed to recognize she was the most popular politician and the one most capable of leading the party to ultimate victory.\u201dFour years ago, she was undercut by criticism from Kuomintang and American officials that her election would raise tensions with China, which considers Taiwan a part of its territory. In this round, Ms. Tsai changed her approach and defended herself more effectively against those attacks. The D.P.P. has traditionally favored formal independence for Taiwan, but in the most recent campaign, Ms. Tsai pledged to maintain the status quo.\u201cShe has developed this complex and veiled way of speaking about cross-strait relations,\u201d said Shelley Rigger, a professor of East Asian politics at Davidson College in North Carolina. \u201cIt is a much more subtle position and allows for, and actively invites, interpretation.\u201dChina\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office said it had noted the results of the election and was willing to develop exchanges with \u201call parties and groups that recognize both sides of the strait are one China.\u201d A commentary published by China\u2019s state-run Xinhua news agency called on Ms. Tsai to be prudent, saying Taiwan independence was a \u201cpoison\u201d that was rejected by mainstream opinion on the island.A former law professor, Ms. Tsai, 59, is single and has no children. She was educated at National Taiwan University, Cornell and the London School of Economics. And she differs from many D.P.P. politicians, having risen through a series of bureaucratic positions rather than grass-roots campaigning.Ms. Tsai was a trade negotiator in the 1990s, then served as an adviser to the National Security Council under President Lee Teng-hui. When Mr. Chen was elected in 2000, he named her chairwoman of the Mainland Affairs Council, the body that manages ties with China. She later joined the D.P.P. and was elected to Parliament in 2004.\u201cShe isn\u2019t tainted with the old, ideological nationalism of Chen and further back, and is able to portray herself as rational and moderate to a greater extent than any other potential D.P.P. candidate, which is very important to assuage voters\u2019 concerns and inoculate against KMT attacks,\u201d said Jonathan Sullivan, an associate professor at the School of Contemporary Chinese Studies at the University of Nottingham.Ms. Tsai is also known for her strong will and ability to corral sometimes fractious party elements.\u201cShe is a very strong political actor,\u201d Professor Sullivan added. \u201cDon\u2019t be fooled by the quiet demeanor.\u201dAt a D.P.P. campaign rally last Wednesday, at a baseball stadium in the central city of Taichung, thousands of people waited in the rain to hear Ms. Tsai speak. They waved flags and sounded air horns as legislative candidates exhorted them to oust the Kuomintang from power. When Ms. Tsai finally took the stage, the crowd roared. She criticized the Kuomintang for fear mongering by warning voters of potential instability if the D.P.P. came to power. She said that if she became president, she would welcome voters\u2019 criticism if she failed to live up to their expectations. \u201cThere is no turning back on this road,\u201d she said. \u201cI know that other than reform, there is no other path.\u201dChen Chih-chuan, 49, a bakery owner standing at the back of the huge crowd, said he appreciated Ms. Tsai for being different from the D.P.P.\u2019s traditional politicians.\u201cShe\u2019s calm and rational,\u201d he said. \u201cHer speeches aren\u2019t about inciting people or confrontational. She\u2019s more like a leader.\u201dMr. Chen said he supported Ms. Tsai because he believed she would pull Taiwan back from the deepening embrace of China that he feels is being pushed by the current government. \u201cShe can help Taiwan to walk its own road,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to be united with China.\u201dIn office, Ms. Tsai\u2019s immediate concern will be reviving the economy. The gross domestic product contracted in the last quarter of 2015 and is estimated to have grown at just 1 percent last year. Her campaign emphasized innovation and improving trade ties with Southeast Asia, Japan and the United States. The Kuomintang, in comparison, have continued to focus on the importance of trade with China.\u201cI think her priorities will mainly be domestic, mainly the economy and trying to nurture opportunities for young people,\u201d Professor Rigger said.Some in Taiwan have questioned whether Ms. Tsai has presented a strategy that could stimulate growth.\u201cFrom the perspective of the business community, there\u2019s a perception problem,\u201d said Ross Darrell Feingold, a Taipei-based senior adviser at DC International Advisory, a political risk consultancy. \u201cThe D.P.P.\u2019s record on economic development during the eight years it held the presidency from 2000 to 2008 wasn\u2019t much better than Ma over the past eight years.\u201d And while managing the relationship with China might not top Ms. Tsai\u2019s agenda, it will remain a huge task, Professor Rigger said. \u201cEven if she wants to just keep things the way they are, she\u2019ll have to work at it,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u00adIn Oregon, Myth Mixes With Anger", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorTO outsiders, one of the puzzling aspects of the anti-government militia\u2019s takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge is its location. Twenty-five million birds a year visit the refuge in the high desert of southeastern Oregon, but few people have heard of it. Yet Malheur is a place of bitterly contested human histories that remain potent today.Years ago, when I first visited the refuge, I stumbled upon five dead coyotes tossed across a trail, their necks sliced open, blood clotted on their fur, paws hacked off, entrails draining into the river. Ranchers on the edge of failure feel threatened by predators snatching away their calves, and some lash out against that threat. But these five dead coyotes signaled more than just economic anxiety \u2014 they were emblematic of past hatreds that are still a powerful force in the Malheur basin. Anger at predators, environmentalists and federal managers who threaten the mythic past of cowboys on the range is as strong there as anywhere in the West.In the late 1970s and the 1980s, many Western ranchers, miners and loggers felt increasingly threatened, partly by globalization, which created new competition, and partly by federal regulations that seemed to value wildlife more than people. What became known as the Sagebrush Rebellion gave locals a focus for their concern.Environmentalists, they argued, were conspiring to destroy America, starting with rural communities. Many ranchers bitterly complained about the federal land management agencies. They felt powerless, hemmed in by policies they had little hand in shaping. They feared that economic gains were passing them by.These complaints contain elements of truth: Rural communities in the West are poorer than urban communities, and environmental protections enacted since the 1980s have reduced grazing on federal lands. But locals told an interesting version of this history. Before the federal agencies came, they said, we lived in paradise. The grass was thick, the water was abundant and the towns were thriving. We were independent, working out our problems. When the feds came, they stole our resources, and our economies collapsed.The implication was clear: If they got rid of the federal government, they\u2019d have control over their land and lives again.This version of history bears little resemblance to the actual past. Before the federal agencies came to eastern Oregon, large ranching operations from California had monopolized hundreds of thousands of acres of rangeland. Irrigation developers controlled water, cattle barons controlled the grass, and settlers were essentially locked out. Tensions were high.During the 1890s, a populist, anti-monopolist rhetoric emerged among settlers and news editors. The local newspaper deplored the fact that the great Western ranges were passing into \u201cthe hands of a few big cattle or sheep companies,\u201d and predicted that soon \u201can aristocracy of range lords and cattle kings would rule our mountains and plains.\u201d In 1897, Peter French, the cattle baron who controlled the largest ranching empire in America, along the Blitzen River, was murdered by an angry homesteader. Arson, violence and grinding poverty flourished.In the first decades of the 20th century, the conservationist William Finley paddled a little boat through the marshes of the basin and came upon a colony of egrets slaughtered by plume hunters, the young left to starve. Out of hundreds of thousands of egrets that had once nested in Malheur Lake, only 121 were left.Horrified, Mr. Finley did his best to publicize Malheur\u2019s remaining bounty of waterfowl, shorebirds, egrets, herons, cranes and ibises. In 1908, he persuaded President Theodore Roosevelt to designate Malheur Lake a wildlife refuge. But Congress denied any funding for its management, water rights were not granted and, as droughts hit and lake levels dropped, settlers squatted on the lake bed. By the 1930s, after four decades of overgrazing, irrigation withdrawals, grain agriculture, dredging and channelization, followed by several years of drought, Malheur had become a dust bowl.Ranches failed, livestock starved, homesteaders went bust and the primary occupation in the valley became suing one\u2019s neighbor over water rights.Conservationists won a major victory in 1934 when French\u2019s former cattle empire was sold to the refuge, ensuring it had the water needed to flourish. John Scharff, the refuge manager from 1935 to 1971, worked closely with ranchers to establish grazing leases that funded the restoration of former wetlands and won public support for the effort. By 1968, cattle use was nearly as intense as during the days of the cattle barons. Ranchers still imagined themselves as the rugged individualists of their romantic past, though they had become heavily subsidized, grazing their herds on refuge meadows for fees that were often lower than those on private lands.In the 1970s, government concern grew over the effects of grazing on waterfowl, trout and aquatic health. When Mr. Scharff retired, the new refuge manager had the difficult task of restoring wildlife habitat by reducing cattle numbers. By law, on federal wildlife refuges, the first priority is wildlife. Other uses are allowed when they enhance wildlife habitat, but not when they harm it. Nonetheless, when the new manager lowered the number of grazing permits, controversy erupted over cows versus birds \u2014 anger that continues to simmer in the basin.When mythic histories supplant the complexities of the past, the results can be lethal. Equitable futures for Western public lands won\u2019t be achieved when ideologues swagger in, brandishing guns and taking over federal buildings. Rather, they develop from the hard work of collaboration, like the 2013 effort that brought together the local community, tribes, conservation groups and the state and federal governments to develop a new management plan for Malheur. These are the efforts that best respect the region\u2019s history while pointing the way to a sustainable future.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Robust Hiring in December Caps Solid Year for U.S. Jobs", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "Supported byThe last time the American economy registered such a prolonged stretch of impressive job creation, Facebook didn\u2019t exist and Beyonc\u00e9 was still a member of Destiny\u2019s Child. \u201cI think this really is illustrative of the fact that economic momentum in the United States is still awfully strong,\u201d said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust. \u201cIn spite of the craziness we\u2019ve seen from Asian markets this week, the fundamentals here at home are still solid.\u201dThe year ended with a particularly strong sprint. In December, employers hired an additional 292,000 people, the Labor Department said, and October and November were revised up by a total of 50,000, pushing the average for the last three months to 284,000.At 5 percent, the jobless rate, which was unchanged from the previous month, has fallen by more than half since exceeding 10 percent in October 2009.Democrats, who are fighting to retain the White House and retake the Senate, would seem best poised to take advantage of the positive economic news. Republican presidential candidates have attacked President Obama and his party\u2019s economic policies, but such criticisms have been muted lately and could lose their sting if the employment picture keeps improving.Still, many voters continue to express widespread dissatisfaction with their own prospects and those of the larger economy. The main shadow darkening the latest monthly jobs report was further evidence that wage growth for the typical worker remains sluggish. Average hourly earnings fell slightly in December, leaving the overall yearly gain at a meager 2.5 percent.\u201cIf we take the rise of the outsider as a dominant theme in American politics now, clearly part of that is the general feeling that the recovery has been much slower than it should be, particularly for less educated workers and individuals with lower incomes,\u201d said Peter Ireland, an economist at Boston College. He called such trends something \u201cthe American people can be justifiably excited about.\u201dBased on the latest figures, which are still subject to revision, the average monthly gain in jobs last year of 221,000 was up from the 2013 average of 199,000, though short of the 260,000 reached in 2014.\u201cThe remarkable thing is how consistent employment growth has been over the past three or four years,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cThat\u2019s quite an achievement.\u201dPressure to raise pay at a faster pace will eventually mount, he said.Analysts noted that wages, which are measured in nominal terms, are better than they might seem at first glance, because inflation fell to such low levels last year. Adjusted for changes in prices, the real gain was roughly 2.1 percent, the highest since the recovery began more than six years ago.While that is not a bad showing, said Betsey Stevenson, an economist at the University of Michigan and a former member of President Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, most of those gains have occurred at the top end of the wage distribution.\u201cThe middle class has continued to get hammered, and what we\u2019ve seen is increasing inequality,\u201d Ms. Stevenson said. \u201cThat was true in the recovery, and also true prior to the recovery.\u201dDouglas Holtz-Eakin, a former adviser to President George W. Bush and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, said that disparity helped explain why many Americans are so discontented with their fortunes.\u201cMedian family income has fallen, not risen, so there\u2019s a great disgruntled-but-employed majority out there,\u201d Mr. Holtz-Eakin said. \u201dPeople want a raise,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think raising the minimum wage is the right way to solve this problem, but I understand why it might look appealing.\u201dMr. Holtz-Eakin blamed the anemic growth in productivity, which he said helps depress wages.Moreover, many Americans have no choice but to settle for part-time work or are too discouraged to keep looking for employment after years of fruitless searching. A broader measure of unemployment that includes these people stayed at 9.9 percent in December. And a relatively low labor participation rate, which barely ticked up to 62.6 percent last month from 62.5, continues to bedevil the recovery.The wage challenge long predates the recession, said Thomas E. Perez, the secretary of labor. \u201cWhen I look at the data over the last 40 years, the last stretch where we had respectable real wage growth was in the late \u201990s, and we had unemployment of 4 percent,\u201d Mr. Perez said. \u201cI think we still have slack in this labor market.\u201d\u201cThe picture is clear: Employment in nonroutine occupations \u2014 both cognitive and manual \u2014 has been increasing steadily for several decades,\u201d the report concluded. \u201cEmployment in routine occupations, however, has been mostly stagnant.\u201dMuch of Friday\u2019s report seemed to validate that decision.Unemployment among African-American men, whose jobless rate is typically twice as high as white\u2019s, fell to 8.7 percent from 10.9 percent, the lowest in more than seven years. The jobless rate for women dropped to 4.4 percent from 4.6 percent. Employment grew most vigorously in professional and business services, which added 73,000 workers, while the construction industry added an unexpectedly strong 45,000 jobs last month, with at least part of the gain because of unseasonably warm weather.Sitel, a customer care provider in Nashville, has been celebrating its biggest growth in years. Sean Erickson, an executive vice president, said that Sitel hired 7,500 people in the United States last year for sales, customer service, technical support and front-line management positions.\u201cWhere we saw the greatest growth was in financial services, retail, travel and transportation,\u201d Mr. Erickson said, with weaker demand in manufacturing and communications. He said the company, with 62,000 employees worldwide, had poured money into employee training.The company\u2019s success also highlights how much the job market has shifted. One of the biggest areas of growth has come from providing flexible, temporary or part-time employees who can work from home to help businesses quickly scale staff up, or down in response to demand, Mr. Erickson said.It is still scaling up.Gardiner Harris contributed reporting.

I don\u2019t mean to, but I find it hard not to look around and wonder whether the recent turmoil in international markets isn\u2019t just the product of tremors but rather of seismic shifts in the foundational pillars of the global system, with highly unpredictable consequences.What if a bunch of eras are ending all at once?What if we\u2019re at the end of the 30-plus-year era of high growth in China, and therefore China\u2019s ability to fuel global growth through its imports, exports and purchases of commodities will be much less frothy and reliable in the future?What if the $100-a-barrel oil price era is over and all these countries whose economies were directly or indirectly propped up by those prices will have to learn to grow the old-fashioned way \u2014 by making goods and services others want to buy? Thanks to steady technological advances in America for fracking, horizontal drilling and using big data to identify deposits, OPEC\u2019s pricing power has disappeared. Countries that have set their budgets based on $80- to $100-a-barrel oil will find themselves vastly underfunded just when their populations \u2014 in places like Iran, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Indonesia and Venezuela \u2014 have surged.What if average is over for countries? During the Cold War you could be an average, newly independent state with artificial borders drawn by colonial powers. There were two superpowers ready to throw foreign aid at you, educate your kids in America or Moscow, build up your armed forces and security services and buy your crummy manufactured exports or commodities.But what if the rise of robots, software and automation mean that these countries can\u2019t rely on manufacturing to create mass labor anymore, that the products they can make and sell can\u2019t compete with Chinese goods, that climate change is pressuring their ecosystems and that neither Russia nor America wants to have anything to do with them because all either wins is a bill?Many of these frail, artificial states don\u2019t correspond to any ethnic, cultural, linguistic or demographic realities. They are caravan homes in a trailer park \u2014 built on slabs of concrete without real foundations or basements \u2014 and what you\u2019re seeing today with the acceleration of technology, climate change stresses and globalization is the equivalent of a tornado going through a trailer park. Some of these states are just falling apart, and many of their people are now trying to cross the Mediterranean \u2014 to escape their world of disorder and get into the world of order, particularly the European Union.What if the era of Iranian isolation is over, just as the Arab system is collapsing and the two-state solution between Israelis and Palestinians is history? How will all those molecules interact?What if our 2016 election ends up being between a socialist and a borderline fascist \u2014 ideas that died in 1989 and 1945 respectively?And what if all of this is happening at a time when our government\u2019s ability to stimulate the economy through either monetary or fiscal policy is constrained? Unless we go to negative interest rates, the best the Fed can do now is rescind the tiny rate hike made in December. Meanwhile, after all the vital government spending to stimulate demand after the 2008 crisis, there is no consensus in the country for another big round.These what-ifs constitute the real policy landscape that will confront the next president. But here\u2019s the worst \u201cwhat if\u201d: What if we\u2019re having a presidential election but no one is even asking these questions, let alone \u201cwhat if\u201d all of these tectonic plates move at once? How will we generate growth, jobs, security and resilience?There\u2019s still an opportunity for someone to lead by asking, and answering, all of these \u201cwhat ifs,\u201d but that time is quickly coming to an end, just like the last dinner party I ruined.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Biggest Challenges of 2016", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "At the end of 2015, we asked what you felt was the greatest challenge facing the United States in the coming year. Over a thousand readers responded, and while their answers varied widely, a few common themes emerged. Below are some of the issues readers brought up the most frequently:Climate change The climate crisis dwarfs all other issues. Climate change has put weather on steroids. The oceans are becoming acidified. The adverse consequences are already having a disparate impact on the poor. And it will only get worse. We need to use less energy, replace fossil fuels with renewable energy (like wind and solar) for our remaining energy needs, and adopt land use practices that stop deforestation and unsustainable agriculture. Even if we stopped all carbon pollution today, impacts would continue to increase for some time due to the time lag in our climate system. It is important that we both move to eliminate fossil fuels, and begin to prepare for the impacts we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t avoid through smarter planning and actions to improve the resilience of communities to stronger and more frequent storms, droughts, heat waves and sea level rise.The biggest challenge faced by America in 2016 is that of moving our energy use away from fossil fuels in order to address climate change.There is overwhelming scientific consensus that the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases due to use of fossil fuels is warming earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s climate, and will result in sea level rise, loss of agricultural areas and increasingly severe weather events. The challenge is to create the political will to take aggressive action consistent with this knowledge by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels.The EPA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Clean Power Plan, and recent Paris agreement are steps in the right direction, but aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sufficient to put us on a safe path. We can achieve a greater reduction of carbon emissions by creating incentives which work throughout the economy to encourage conservation and a shift to low-carbon energy. Incentives such as a tax on fossil carbon can accomplish this without damaging the economy, if carbon-tax revenues are returned to households, for example as a dividend similar to a tax refund.As Bernie Sanders so simply said in the debate, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTerrorism can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bring down our civilization, but climate change can.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMoney in politicsThe biggest problem the United States faces in 2016 is the restoration of a constitutional democracy run by the people and for the people. We are on a slippery slope where gerrymandering, voter suppression and above all, limitless dark money in elections, has placed our country in the hands of a powerful ruling oligarchy. If any of the G.O.P. candidates is elected in 2016, through subsequent appointments, the Supreme Court will become an even more powerful tool of corporations and the super-rich. America will definitely continue on an irreversible slide into corporate fascism.There are many important issues (guns, terrorism, climate change, labor, immigration, globalization, infrastructure, defense, investment, taxation, healthcare, education, research) but they are all at the mercy of campaign finance reform. Fix the fixing of elections by the wealthy and corporations, and we can fix anything.EducationThe greatest challenge is to change our educational system so that it encourages and teaches critical thinking, the evaluation of claims and evidence, and the understanding of logical argument. American citizens could then understand the evidence for and consequences of global climate change, understand other cultures and their values, and understand how to evaluate candidates\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and legislators\u00e2\u0080\u0099 claims and lies. We could then move beyond ignorance and hatred to empathy, compassion, and more active participation in ridding ourselves of injustice and inequality.Education reform \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not just in 2016, but in every year. If we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really serious about giving every child an opportunity in this country, then we will work to have quality education \u00e2\u0080\u0094 good teachers, adequate resources, diverse classes \u00e2\u0080\u0094 available to all communities. This should require creative solutions, maybe more charter schools, or integration policies between districts, and above all, a greater commitment to change. It is a tragedy that with every passing year, more and more kids go through the American school system with a semblance of an education and little opportunity to attain more.America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest challenge is our shortfall in civic education. Its absence and the resulting dysfunction make us more vulnerable to every foreign and domestic threat. The whole country, from Senators to voters to candidates, needs remedial classes in basic governance. This lack of understanding leads to disappointment, a sense of betrayal, powerlessness and cynicism. Congress is certainly not modeling good government, but I suspect the uninformed electorate, lacking the information to direct its outrage, helps perpetuate the problem.Some years ago the teaching of Civics (how-a-bill-becomes-a-law, the balance of powers, and the basics of the electoral process) as a required course was ended. It was supposed to be integrated into other classes, but in many cases was simply set aside. The right and duty of every citizen to know about our government, to engage is the civil process and to vote needs to be elevated again. Oh where are those 7th grade civics teachers of my youth?PolarizationOur own culture of divisiveness is our biggest challenge. Tragically, this self-inflicted problem prevents us from dealing effectively with any of our other challenges (climate change, race relations, income inequality, Middle East Policy, declining infrastructure, underfunded basic science, etc., etc, etc.).The biggest threat to the United States is \u00e2\u0080\u009ca house divided against itself cannot stand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The poisonous political state this country has seen develop over the past ten years or so has caused almost a standstill for economic and social growth. There are too many people with anti-attitudes about immigrants, social reforms, and economic disadvantages for the working class. People seem to be turning on each other instead of embracing what has made our country great over the centuries. We should be past the hate mongers, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re far from it. In fact, it seems to be getting worse.The greatest challenge that U.S. society faces is the loss of capacity for meaningful national dialogue. As greater numbers of citizens lose their trust not just in institutions from government health agencies to grounded journalism, we seem to become more focused on truthiness than on a skeptical relationship with reliable data. If we cannot even agree on basic facts and reasonable scientific hypotheses (such as climate change), finding ways to take meaningful action becomes increasingly difficult.As someone who grew up in a tiny politically conservative agricultural community who now lives in a politically liberal urban area, I have friends on varying sides of these epistemological divides. I experience ever widening gaps as I navigate these relationships.InequalityThe widening disparity between the rich and the poor, with the shrinking of the middle class is a challenge that might just tear into the democratic fabric of America. Historically, America has rarely been threatened by the specter of inequality of this magnitude.The biggest challenge facing the United States in 2016 is social and economic inequality and how to narrow the gap between rich and poor. The way American institutions are performing now (for example, the education system from kindergarten to university, the tax system, the impoverished public sector, our social and religious values) we will soon arrive at a caste system in which reform will be impossible and America will become a very different country.The biggest threat facing the United States in 2016 is the same one that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s faced us for almost four decades: Class warfare by the wealthy on the working class. Bernie Sanders understands this, while none of the other candidates do.We are watching the elimination of our middle class without a shot fired. We are on a steady march towards another era of the Robber Barons where there will be just two classes: rich and poor, and with the majority of Americans having less money, who will provide the fuel for our consumer-driven economy? And what will happen to our tax revenues? And then how will we service our debt to creditors like China and others? Most empires fail within before they fail to external enemies, and unless we reverse this war on the working class by our oligarchy, our empire will fail too.\u00a0Though the concerns above came up frequently, they were far from the only ones readers mentioned. Below, a sampling of other readers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 thoughts on the year ahead:Reducing gun violence. About 90 Americans die every DAY from homicide, suicide, and accidents with guns. This dwarfs that of every other developed country. The proliferation of guns is a big reason for this (yes there are other factors too). Despite the fact that most Americans want sensible and enforceable gun laws, Congress refuses to act \u00e2\u0080\u0094 because of the NRA and their ilk. This cannot be blamed on Citizens United, because it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the money \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the political will of a determined few against the apathy of the many. Until Americans stand up (at the ballot box, statehouse, and Congress), they will continue to be injured and killed by guns at theaters, schools, their own homes, and virtually anywhere. We must care enough about our fellow Americans to stop this national suicide.The biggest challenge America faces in 2016: getting people out to vote.We are faced with opportunities to make a difference in various aspects of making our votes count in 2016. The person who is elected to president will no doubt in their tenure have the responsibility to choose and appoint a Supreme Court Justice. There are many ramifications from this choice \u00e2\u0080\u0094 women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reproductive rights, health care opportunities, just election rights, civil rights.People, such as in Wisconsin, have been shown that elections have consequences. Our state was lax in voting. We have been left with government leaders who have taken away jurisdiction over open records, voting, court actions, environmental issues, health care benefits, educational opportunities, workplace statues \u00e2\u0080\u0094 many aspects of our every day living that used to be taken for granted. Perhaps through this turmoil, citizens will realize yes, their votes do make a difference \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and even more, the lack of their votes makes a huge difference.Racism, in all its aspects and manifestations. Implicit racism affects relationships and interactions among people and within communities. Although different ethnic groups experience the negative effects of racism in different degrees and intensities, whenever incidents occur that are horrific or even simply incompatible with what we consider to be commensurate with our American values, it plays a role in virtually every social conflict in the U.S. We need to confront racism openly, honestly and with as much integrity as we can muster. Maybe we can then deal with manifest discrimination.A federal national debt of $20 trillion with no meaningful plan of repayment is a national disgrace. Both parties are to blame. As interest rate rise, the cost of this debt will further squeeze the federal budget for years to come. Just ridiculous. We must cut current spending or raise taxes and embark on a meaningful plan of repayment.Our biggest challenge will be resisting the urge to panic. Terrorists will inevitably strike somewhere, sometime, more than once. We will require calm and resolve, not politicians who seek advantage by scaring us to death, nor public officials who, good intentions aside, cannot display empathy. Never have Franklin Roosevelt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe have nothing to fear but fear itself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d seemed wiser. We have, of course, much more to fear, but fear itself is likely to be the worst danger.Overcoming the widespread ideas that rich people are the root of all evil and that more government is the answer to our problems would be at the top of my list.Right now the biggest challenge is to elect a president who can be trusted to lead this nation with competence \u00e2\u0080\u0094 someone who is rational, sane, level-headed, open-minded \u00e2\u0080\u0094 no cronyism, no ego trips.The greatest challenge is designing a work/home environment in which both mothers and fathers may earn a living and take care of their children and domestic life as a family. The old 40-hour work week model, in which fathers brought home the bacon while dependent-spouse mothers fried it up in a pan, is pass\u00c3\u00a9. Children need to be nurtured by both parents, and females as well as males need to earn our keep and use our talents and skills in the marketplace.In my view the biggest challenge that we face is restoration of our faith in the American way of life. We need to restore our pride in America and our can do ways. We need to restore our confidence in our ability to lead. We need to embrace our emerging diversity as a strength. We need to confidently look to the future and our place in that future. We need to reject talk of fear and rejoice in our ability to confront the overcome the challenges that we will face in the days ahead. As a country we are too good, too strong, too wise to give in to defeatism and negativity. As a country we have been blessed; let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use our blessing to return with strength and confidence to our place as a model for others to emulate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cuomo Lays Out Renovation Plan for Penn Station and Farley Post Office", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byDuring a news conference at Madison Square Garden in Manhattan, Mr. Cuomo called on New Yorkers to \u201cthink big\u201d as they did in the past, with equal measures of ambition and audacity.At Madison Square Garden, he characterized his plans, which also include new air and rail terminals, new transit stations and a Hudson River rail tunnel, as \u201cthe biggest construction program in our state\u2019s history.\u201d\u201cWhat happens tomorrow depends on what we do today,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said. \u201cLet\u2019s be as bold and ambitious as our forefathers before us.\u201dThe governor\u2019s initiative in Manhattan involves projects on both sides of Eighth Avenue, between 31st and 33rd Streets, where Madison Square Garden sits atop the warren of narrow and confusing passageways in Penn Station.Mr. Cuomo said the state, along with Amtrak and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, would solicit proposals from developers whose options would include the creation of a grand glass-walled entrance to Penn Station on Eighth Avenue.The project could entail razing the 5,600-seat theater that sits beneath Madison Square Garden, upgrading the shops in the complex, and adding new entrances on Seventh Avenue or 33rd Street.Developers would undertake the project, Mr. Cuomo said, in return for the rights to control all the retail shops in Penn Station.Simultaneously, the state and its partners will solicit a developer for the long-gestating plan to turn the nearly vacant James A. Farley Post Office into a train station and a giant waiting room for Amtrak passengers, as well as shops and office space.Developers could submit proposals for either project or both.The announcement was a blow to two of the city\u2019s most prominent developers \u2014 Related Companies and Vornado Realty \u2014 who the state selected 10 years ago to transform the post office building into what was to be called Moynihan Station, after Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who first championed the idea in the early 1990s.The developers had agreed to pay the state more than $200 million for the Farley building and $110 million for development rights that they planned to transfer across Eighth Avenue for a residential tower.Late last year, the state appeared close to a deal with Related and Vornado that would have had the developers signing a contract without a tenant and paying the state. But in December the state suddenly shifted its stance, leading to Wednesday\u2019s announcement of a new request for proposals.\u201cIt went on too long,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said in an interview after the announcement. \u201cThe integration of the two complexes could excite imagination.\u201dVornado and Related are not out of the running. Indeed, they have a huge advantage over rival bidders, especially since the state wants developers to respond to its solicitation in 90 days. They have an intimate understanding of both Penn Station and the post office, and the complexity of building at a working train station.Mr. Cuomo said he wanted to send a message: \u201cWe wanted people to know we\u2019re looking for an aggressive, ambitious design. This will get done.\u201dUnder the terms of their agreement, the state would be required to reimburse Vornado and Related for more than $30 million if they do not go forward with the post office project. Vornado is the largest property owner in the neighborhood surrounding Penn Station and has its own plans for the area.Still, at least two other major developers \u2014 Brookfield and Extell Development \u2014 have told state officials over the past year that they would be interested in taking on the projects.It is unclear exactly how the more than $3 billion project, which the governor is calling the Empire Station Complex, will be paid for, but Mr. Cuomo is expected to unveil a financial plan for his transportation network at next week\u2019s State of the State speech. The governor said that $325 million would come from government sources. He also said that the request for proposals would go out to developers later this week.Mary Rowe, executive vice president of the Municipal Art Society, a proponent of a renovated Penn Station, lauded the governor for highlighting the need for urgent and ambitious change.\u201cHowever,\u201d she added, \u201cthese improvements won\u2019t be enough to fully address Penn Station\u2019s severe overcrowding or meet the growing needs of its rapidly developing neighborhood and our regional economy.\u201dOn any given day more than 600,000 commuters and travelers \u2014 triple what the station was originally designed for \u2014 move through the underground labyrinth of Penn Station.On Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo also announced that he wanted to freeze tolls on the Tappan Zee Bridge and the New York State Thruway until 2020. He suggested the state spend $700 million to keep tolls on the Thruway at their current level.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Eases Restrictions on Financing Exports to Cuba", "Date": "2016-01-26", "News": "Supported byThe revised rules that will take effect on Wednesday will allow United States banks to provide direct financing for the export of any product other than agricultural commodities, still walled off under the trade embargo.Until now, American products sent to Cuba had to be paid for in advance in cash or routed through a third country, a costly and burdensome process. Items that have been banned for decades because they might benefit the Cuban government, such as textbooks, construction cranes or sanitation equipment, can now be approved by the American government case by case.Mr. Obama is pushing to do as much as possible to normalize relations with Cuba before he leaves office next year. He would like to travel to Cuba before his term ends, a visit that senior officials said would \u201chighlight progress\u201d in the relationship.But each incremental move underscores the steep obstacles facing two countries with fundamentally different governments and economies. American officials said they continued to have concerns about Cuba\u2019s human rights record, including limits on political expression. And they conceded that exports to Cuba would have to be approved and distributed by a state-run ministry.Critics contended that Mr. Obama was skirting Congress and rewarding a dangerous regime. Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey and a son of Cuban immigrants, said the moves would \u201cdo nothing to empower the Cuban people\u201d and would instead provide \u201ctheir oppressors the resources they need to tighten their grip.\u201dAdministration officials said the revised rules would help open Cuba\u2019s economy and government by exposing the country to more American goods, people and ideas.Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said the changes \u201cbuild on successive actions over the last year and send a clear message to the world: The United States is committed to empowering and enabling economic advancements for the Cuban people.\u201dThe regulations were released jointly by the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, which imposes and enforces sanctions, and the Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security, which oversees export controls. The rules also loosen limits on travel between the United States and Cuba and make it simpler to re-establish direct flights under a civil aviation agreement reached late last year.Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker said the action would ease exports for such purposes as disaster preparedness, educational and artistic pursuits, agricultural production and public transportation.\u201cWe will continue to support greater economic independence and increased prosperity for the Cuban people as we take another step toward building a more open and mutually beneficial relationship,\u201d she said in a statement.The rules build on three rounds of regulatory changes that the Obama administration has enacted unilaterally since Mr. Obama and President Ra\u00fal Castro of Cuba announced in December 2014 that their countries would reverse over a half-century of official hostility. Since then, American and Cuban officials have struck agreements to reopen embassies \u2014 a step achieved last summer \u2014 and environmental and civil aviation pacts.Like those announced a year ago, the latest changes relax travel restrictions, although tourism is still prohibited by statute. Americans traveling to Cuba to make films or record music, to organize professional meetings, or to work on cruise ships or airliners will be authorized to make the trips and spend money.The export financing changes will allow American companies for the first time in decades to sell goods directly to Cuban state-run enterprises and to use credit to do so. When Ms. Pritzker led a delegation to Cuba in October, officials there explained that if they needed to buy tractors from a foreign supplier, they would rather purchase them on credit from Brazil, for instance, than pay cash to a United States company, a senior administration official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions.\u201cWe recognize that in allowing some exports that primarily benefit the Cuban people, there may also be some ancillary benefits to the government,\u201d the official said. \u201cBut we\u2019re really focused on those sorts of things that benefit the everyday Cuban.\u201dThe administration said the prohibitions would still apply to exports that would go directly to the Cuban military, the police, or intelligence or security services, or that would generate revenue primarily for the state, such as sugar production.Proponents of the opening with Cuba commended the White House and renewed calls for Congress to lift the embargo, which tightly restricts most trade and commerce and discourages American companies from pursuing even the limited activities that the Obama administration has authorized.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Venezuela Declares Emergency as Its Economy Falters", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byCARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 The Venezuelan government on Friday declared an emergency to address the country\u2019s deteriorating economy.The plan was short on specific policy changes but sought to give President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro the power to bypass the National Assembly on spending matters, among other measures. But any expansion of executive power would have to be approved by the National Assembly, which is controlled by Mr. Maduro\u2019s rivals who took control of the chamber in January with their own promises to address Venezuela\u2019s economic problems.Later in the day, Mr. Maduro delivered Venezuela\u2019s equivalent of the State of the Union address. It was the president\u2019s first time addressing his Assembly rivals in the chamber.Also on Friday, Venezuela\u2019s central bank announced some grim economic figures, noting that the economy contracted by 4.5 percent during the first nine months of 2015 and that inflation reached 142 percent during the 12-month period ending in September.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Maine, Local Control Is a Luxury Fewer Towns Can Afford", "Date": "2016-01-16", "News": "Supported byCARY PLANTATION, Me. \u2014 Up here, near the end of Interstate 95, a single main road ridged with stately conifers runs past the odd house that at night casts an orange glow over the snow. There is no school. No police department. Not even a stoplight.But there are property taxes. And some residents say the taxes\u2019 growth has pushed this community of about 200 to the brink. To save Cary Plantation, they say, they want to dismantle it.\u201cWhat do you do, what does the town do, when they can\u2019t pay their bills? Do we go bankrupt? Do we lose our homes?\u201d asked Diane Cassidy, a former nursing assistant. \u201cThere was no answer, other than deorganization.\u201dMs. Cassidy is leading an effort to dissolve the local government and join the Unorganized Territory, a vast swath of forest and townships in north, central and eastern Maine run by a partnership between the state and the counties. Last month, residents here voted, 64 to 0, to continue the process.At a time of rising municipal costs, local governments around the country are looking for ways to rein in tax bills, pursuing privatization, the consolidation of services, mergers and even bankruptcy.But in northern Maine, as operating costs have increased, the economy has stagnated and the population has aged and dwindled, a handful of struggling towns have pursued the unusual process of eliminating local government entirely.In the West, citizens are protesting to constrain government power. And over all, Americans tend to resist ceding their local authority. But these communities are handing their governing power over to the state and the county.\u201cKnowing how dependent towns are in Maine on the property tax, they may have just reached a point where they\u2019ve decided, \u2018We\u2019d be better off just not existing as a town,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Elizabeth K. Kellar, the chief executive of the Center for State and Local Government Excellence in Washington.Under state law, dismantling a local government takes 12 complex steps, often over at least two years, including legislative approval and a series of local votes. When a town deorganizes, state agencies and the county administer its services, like snow removal, policing and firefighting. Children are assigned to appropriate schools, often in a nearby district. Town-owned buildings and land are sold or held in trust by the state or the county. And every local government job is eliminated.Thus, there are no local officials\u2019 salaries to pay and no infrastructure to maintain locally. And the cost of servicing each township is spread across the Unorganized Territory either in each county or statewide.\u201cIt\u2019s basically like a company: There\u2019s so much less overhead,\u201d said Paul G. Bernier, the public works director for Aroostook County, who is responsible for overseeing services to the unorganized territories at the very top of Maine. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s half of what they were paying.\u201dIn Aroostook County, Bancroft, population 60, completed the process last summer and now exists in name only. Besides Cary Plantation, Oxbow, about an hour northwest, is well on its way, although both have legislative approval and a final vote yet to go. State officials said that an effort to deorganize Atkinson, which began in 2013, may soon take a step forward, and that more municipalities had told the state that they were interested.\u201cJust the price tag to keep their local governments up and running is more or less untenable,\u201d said Mark Brewer, a professor of political science at the University of Maine. \u201cIt\u2019s the final step in this long, drawn-out process, which really starts with population decline.\u201dThe last town to deorganize before Bancroft was Centerville, population two dozen, in 2004. There have also been deorganization attempts that failed at the local level, often because residents did not want to lose local control, or in some cases did not secure legislative approval.\u201cI attribute the recent increase in interest in deorganizing as a direct result of the economic Great Recession and in the loss of jobs in the logging industry,\u201d Ms. McInnis said.Steve Sherman, a lifelong resident of Oxbow, where roughly 50 people are spread across six miles, began working to disband the government after years of watching the local labor market for papermaking and farming shrink along with the population. In November, 21 residents voted unanimously to move forward with deorganization; a third vote will take place in the future.\u201cWe\u2019re not growing here. We\u2019re headed the other way, it would seem,\u201d said Mr. Sherman, a logger and Christmas tree farmer. \u201cThat\u2019s just life, in northern Maine especially.\u201dIn Oxbow and in Cary Plantation, local government is already all but gone. Local meetings in Cary are held in Ms. Cassidy\u2019s heated garage. With no public building, records are generally stored in officials\u2019 homes. And most services are already contracted out.\u201cI figure the state can do a better job,\u201d Ms. Cassidy said.Other states have unorganized or unincorporated areas, but in Maine about half of the land is Unorganized Territory. The area predates the state itself \u2014 it was laid out when Maine was still part of Massachusetts and new settlers were expected to flock there. But the harsh climes of Maine\u2019s wild lands, as they used to be known, never filled out with enough people to self-govern.\u201cMaine has this oddity of having all of this space in an area of the country that cherishes town meetings and town governments,\u201d said Kenneth Palmer, a professor emeritus at the University of Maine. \u201cThese tiny towns don\u2019t have enough people to generate the municipal staff to really run the town. It\u2019s this abandonment of a town structure.\u201dBut some in Cary say deorganizing is a way to give the community a new lease on life, not to abandon it.\u201cI think it\u2019s going to bring more people in,\u201d said Kai Libby, 55, a retired Border Patrol agent who became the town\u2019s first assessor last year to help shepherd the deorganization effort through the multistep process (and thus eliminate his own position).Mr. Libby and his wife, Tina, who led the withdrawal of Cary from its school district, live in the only house on their road, with a vast tract of land, enough space for four dogs and stacks of documents related to deorganization near their kitchen table.\u201cThere\u2019s privacy, and it\u2019s so quiet,\u201d said Ms. Libby, 51. \u201cWe want to stay here. And to do that, it needs to be affordable for us to stay here.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Internet Yields Uneven Dividends and May Widen Inequality, Report Says", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported byUNITED NATIONS \u2014 Can the Internet save the world?In some places, it has helped curb corruption, encouraged more girls to go to school and enabled citizens to monitor election violence. But according to a report issued Wednesday by the World Bank, the vast changes wrought by technology have not expanded economic opportunities or improved access to basic public services in ways that many had expected. Rather, the report warned darkly, Internet innovations stand to widen inequalities and even hasten the hollowing out of middle-class employment.\u201cDigital technologies are spreading rapidly, but digital dividends \u2014 growth, jobs and services \u2014 have lagged behind,\u201d the bank said in a news release announcing the report.Those who are already well-off and well-educated have been able to take advantage of the Internet economy, the report concluded pointedly, and despite the expansion of Internet access, 60 percent of humanity remains offline.China has the largest number of Internet users, followed by the United States and India, according to the report.\u201cCountries that are investing in both digital technology and its analog complements will reap significant dividends, while others are likely to fall behind\u201d the report added. \u201cTechnology without a strong foundation risks creating divergent economic fortunes, higher inequality and an intrusive state.\u201dHow a society takes advantage of information technology depends on what kind of a society it is, the report concluded.Women are discouraged from going online in some countries, the report found, and across the countries of South Asia, they were far less likely to own a mobile phone. Those who are illiterate \u2014 still 20 percent of the world\u2019s population \u2014 cannot take advantage of the Internet at all; and in the developing world, the technology industry employs barely 1 percent of the work force. In rich countries, technology employs 3 to 5 percent of the work force, still a small fraction of total employment.According to the bank\u2019s survey, more than half of all countries had privacy laws on the books, but only 51 of them were in the developing world.The bank, which says it has itself invested $12.6 billion in information technology projects, calls on countries to make the Internet \u201cuniversal, affordable, open and safe.\u201d Yet it also takes pains to say that expanding access will not be enough for citizens to take advantage of the benefits. It also recommends enabling companies to compete, strengthening the skills of workers so they can obtain the new jobs and making government institutions accountable.\u201cThe triple complements \u2014 a favorable business climate, strong human capital and good governance \u2014 will sound familiar \u2014 and they should because they are the foundation of economic development,\u201d the report concluded.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Time, Cheaper Oil Does Little for the U.S. Economy", "Date": "2016-01-21", "News": "Supported byAs oil prices have fallen to levels not seen since 2003 \u2014 sagging below $27 a barrel on Wednesday before rebounding to about $30 on Thursday \u2014 many experts now say they do not expect lower prices to bolster the domestic economy significantly in 2016.\u201cWe got this wrong,\u201d John C. Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, told an audience in Santa Barbara, Calif., this month.Lower oil prices historically were a cause for celebration in the developed world, including the United States. The effect was akin to a tax cut for consumers who could fill their gas tanks for less money. And since much of that oil was imported, the windfall was generally larger than the damage to domestic oil producers.Every dollar gained by consumers was a dollar lost by producers, but when the dollars were lost by foreign producers, the American economy should have benefited.But this time is different. The losses from lower prices are larger and quicker than expected as energy companies cut back on investment and lay off workers, while the gains are smaller and slower to materialize, as consumers save some of their windfalls.Economists at JPMorgan Chase, who predicted last January that lower oil prices would add about 0.7 of a percentage point to the economic growth rate in 2015, now estimate that lower prices might have shaved 0.3 of a percentage point off the growth rate.This year, JPMorgan predicts that lower prices will help expand economic activity by just 0.1 of a percentage point, while economists at Goldman Sachs said they expected an impact \u201caround zero.\u201d\u201cI think the Fed has to take seriously the possibility that we could enter into another economic downturn, and it urgently needs to make contingency plans for that scenario,\u201d said Andrew T. Levin, an economics professor at Dartmouth and a former adviser to the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen. \u201cThere\u2019s a feedback between financial markets and the economy. You might think markets are irrational, but even if they are, that spills over into the real economy.\u201dMany other economists doubt that the United States is on the verge of a recession, as job growth and consumer spending remain healthy. But most now concede that the vast expansion in domestic oil and gas drilling in recent years has changed the way energy prices affect the economy.The losses among energy producers reflect the unexpectedly sharp downslope after the recent boom in domestic oil and gas extraction. The industry\u2019s share of capital spending bounced around below 5 percent a year from 1985 to 2005. But new techniques, notably fracking, drove that share above 10 percent in 2012 and 2013, according to calculations by Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank Securities.Now the industry\u2019s share of capital spending has fallen back to 5 percent.\u201cThe world has changed and what we saw was different\u201d from the Fed\u2019s predictions, said Mr. Williams, the San Francisco Fed president. He said fracking operations were easier to set up and shut down than other kinds of extraction, so the industry\u2019s response to falling prices was quicker than analysts had expected.The International Energy Agency said this week that steady production and falling demand could send prices lower. \u201cUnless something changes, the oil market could drown in oversupply,\u201d the agency said.In the United States, increased production of oil and gas also has reduced reliance on imports, so a larger share of the dollars consumers saved at the pump came at the expense of domestic oil and gas producers, offsetting a larger share of benefits.Only 27 percent of the petroleum consumed in 2014 was imported, the lowest share since 1985, according to the United States\u2019 Energy Information Administration.Moreover, those benefits were smaller than many expected as Americans saved a slightly larger share of their incomes last year. Since mid-2014, personal savings rose by about $120 billion, an amount roughly equal to the savings at the pump, according to Capital Economics.The problem, in other words, may have been that people were slow to increase spending from other sources of income.Some analysts see evidence that consumers are saving because they are scared, or still struggling to pay down high levels of debt. Others, however, are more optimistic. They argue that consumers hesitated initially because they weren\u2019t sure lower prices would last, but that spending will increase as lower gas prices endure.\u201cLower oil has an immediate negative impact on the energy sector and the positive effects on the rest of the economy only appear with a lag,\u201d Mr. Slok, the Deutsche Bank economist, wrote in a recent analysis. \u201cThe conclusion is therefore that we have the worst behind us.\u201dConsumer spending has started to rise more quickly, James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, noted in a speech last week, describing it as \u201cmild evidence\u201d that falling prices are lifting domestic growth.But Mr. Bullard added that lower prices might be causing a different, longer-term economic problem by contributing to the erosion of inflation expectations.The Fed aims to keep prices rising about 2 percent a year. It also seeks to maintain public confidence that it will meet that goal, which it regards as critical because expectations play an important role in determining the pace of inflation.Michael Feroli, JPMorgan\u2019s chief economist, is among those no longer expecting the Fed to raise rates in March. \u201cThis change in our Fed call is more about inflation than growth,\u201d Mr. Feroli wrote this week.The Fed will provide its own update after its policy-making committee meets on Jan. 26 and 27.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ford\u2019s Annual Profit Surges to $7.4 Billion", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byThe company\u2019s chief executive, Mark Fields, said that he expected further growth this year in the United States, where a combination of low gas prices, cheap credit and pent-up demand spurred overall industry sales of 17.5 million vehicles last year.\u201cWe do not see the cycle being over,\u201d Mr. Fields said on Thursday in a conference call with analysts.Ford and other automakers are trying to balance the demand for larger vehicles like pickups with their need to improve fuel economy to meet tougher federal standards over the next several years.In Ford\u2019s case, the company has committed to spend $4.5 billion on electrified vehicles by 2020. But to make that possible, it needs to keep improving profits on conventional, gasoline-powered models.Mr. Fields said that Ford did not need to adjust its production plans to add more trucks for sale in the United States \u2014 or to reduce the number of slower-selling passenger cars.Instead, the company will work to reduce costs and tinker with its global strategy. For example, it recently announced plans to drop out of unproductive markets like Japan and Indonesia, while at the same time expanding its product lineup in China.\u201cWe\u2019re going leaner,\u201d Mr. Fields said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be focusing on profitability and making tough choices to restructure when necessary.\u201dIn the fourth quarter of last year, Ford said it earned about $1.9 billion in contrast to a loss of $2.5 billion in the same quarter in 2014, partly because of special charges.For all of 2015, the company said its revenue was $149.6 billion, which represented about a 4 percent increase from the previous year. Ford sold 6.64 million vehicles during the year, which was a slight improvement over its 2014 results.In North America, Ford had a record pretax profit for the year of $9.3 billion, which was a $1.9 billion improvement over 2014. The results translated into profit-sharing payments of $9,300 each for union workers in the company\u2019s plants in the United States.Its performance was mixed in other global regions. The company posted a pretax loss of $832 million in South America, and pretax income of $259 million in Europe, $31 million in the Middle East and Africa and $765 million in Asia Pacific.The biggest American carmaker, General Motors, will release its fourth-quarter and full-year financial results next week.It is expected to report better profits than 2014, despite spending more than $2 billion to settle a Justice Department investigation into defective small cars tied to 124 deaths, and to compensate victims killed or injured in those vehicles.The third major domestic carmaker, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, has struggled compared with its larger rivals.Its profits were hurt by restructuring charges to realign its product lineup and cover costs associated with recalls and fines for violating government safety rules.The company\u2019s chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, surprised investors by announcing that Fiat Chrysler was increasing its sales targets for Jeep sport utility vehicles, while phasing out unpopular car models like the Dodge Dart.\u201cWe have decided to defocus, from the manufacturing standpoint, on the passenger car market,\u201d Mr. Marchionne said in a call with analysts.The move to produce more high-profit Jeeps will make it tougher for the company to meet new corporate fuel-economy standards set by the government of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025.The automaker, however, is getting more aggressive on development of hybrid models powered by a combination of batteries and gas engines. This month it unveiled its first hybrid minivan and plans to introduce hybrid technology in the next generation of its compact Jeep Wrangler S.U.V.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Evangelicals See Donald Trump as Man of Conviction, if Not Faith", "Date": "2016-01-18", "News": "Supported by\u201cAm I a Bible toter that gets out and preaches on the side of the street and tries to convert everybody? No,\u201d said Mr. Arning, 62, who calls himself an evangelical voter. He said he believed that Mr. Trump was \u201ca Christian man,\u201d and that was good enough.\u201cHis personal life is saintlike compared to Bill Clinton\u2019s,\u201d he added.Brash, thrice-married, cosseted in a gilded tower high above Fifth Avenue and fond of swearing from the stage at his rallies, Mr. Trump, who has spent his career in pursuit, and praise, of wealth, would seem an odd fit for voters who place greater value on faith, hope and charity.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.In dozens of interviews with evangelical voters in 16 states, from every region of the country outside the Northeast, those supporting Mr. Trump sounded a familiar refrain: that his heart was in the right place, that his intentions for the country were pure, that he alone was capable of delivering to a troubled country salvation in the here and now.\u201cHe is the only one who can pull us back from the abyss,\u201d said John Juvenal, 67, a lifelong Republican and retired police officer from Oklahoma City.\u201cI try and do nothing that\u2019s bad,\u201d he said. \u201cI live a very different life than probably a lot of people would think.\u201dLarry Ryman, a 74-year-old street preacher who lives near Findlay, Ohio, said he did not know whether Mr. Trump was a man of God. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what,\u201d said Mr. Ryman, a staunch supporter of Mr. Trump. \u201cIf he isn\u2019t, he\u2019s talking like it.\u201dIn the interviews, many evangelicals said they saw Mr. Trump as a decent man who simply wanted to get things done.\u201cWe\u2019ve had an administration the last eight years of someone that never ever hired anybody and was responsible for a payroll, who filled 90 percent of his cabinet with academia, teachers and professors,\u201d Mr. Arning said. \u201cI want a guy that\u2019s run a business. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s a bulldozer and he\u2019s cleared lots for 20 years.\u201dHistory suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.For many others, Mr. Trump speaks the truth and mirrors what they are feeling: fevered anger at President Obama, distress about the economy and fear that terrorists could pose as Syrian refugees to infiltrate the American heartland. Rather than recoiling from his harsh language about immigrants and insults of people he dislikes, these voters said Mr. Trump was merely being honest.\u201cSpirituality is a big issue, but we need somebody who\u2019s strong,\u201d said Charles E. Henderson, 61, a disabled veteran from Lexington, Ky., who grew up attending a Nazarene church. He called Mr. Trump outspoken and decisive, adding, \u201cLots of times the preachers and everything, they have a tendency to be just a little bit weak.\u201dDespite their own strong beliefs, a number of voters interviewed shied away from judging Mr. Trump\u2019s faithfulness.Craig Wright, 69, from Goldthwaite, Tex., who said he wrote to Mr. Trump to urge him to run and who described himself as \u201csick and tired of politicians,\u201d said Mr. Trump cleared one important bar: He does not deny God\u2019s existence. \u201cNone of us know if there really is a God, you just hope there is,\u201d said Mr. Wright, a Methodist. \u201cIf he was an avowed atheist, then I would know he was crazy.\u201dAnd others said they did not believe it was necessary for candidates they support to trumpet their faith. \u201cAt my church, our pastor is saying, just be careful about who you\u2019re looking at as the election comes closer, because some of them are like wolves in sheep\u2019s clothing,\u201d said Cheryl Freeman, 57, from Thousand Oaks, Calif., who produces and distributes faith- and family-oriented films.Ms. Freeman said it was clear that Mr. Trump\u2019s family \u201cmeans everything to him,\u201d but she did not know how religious he was. \u201cIs he one that believes in the Lord and tries to do good and everything? I don\u2019t really know that, to be honest with you,\u201d she said. But she added, \u201cI also believe that you don\u2019t have to scream to the world that you\u2019re a Christian.\u201dEvangelical voters are hardly monolithic in their political views, and plenty said they were leery of Mr. Trump.Margaret Chapman, 83, a retired nurse from Sierra Vista, Ariz., who attends a nondenominational Christian church, said she supported Mr. Cruz, whom she deemed \u201ca man of faith\u201d and \u201ca total family man.\u201d She noted Mr. Trump\u2019s past, saying: \u201cJust from his past life, he didn\u2019t seem very godly. I can\u2019t see that he has really changed, but maybe he has.\u201dDeryck Mullady, 34, of Cincinnati, said Mr. Trump had said things that were \u201ctotally against what Jesus taught and what we read in the Bible.\u201d He said he disapproved of some of his Christian friends who, in past elections, emphasized the religious conviction of the candidates they voted for but \u201csay it doesn\u2019t matter now\u201d and are backing Mr. Trump.And Sherrie Haussecker, 55, who attends a nondenominational church every week in Indianapolis, said she found Mr. Trump\u2019s message deeply negative. \u201cNot all Christians that say they\u2019re Christians are Christians,\u201d she said.\u201cIf he\u2019s a Christian, then he\u2019s probably a baby Christian, because there\u2019s a lot of not having the self-control,\u201d she added, suggesting that he was immature in his faith.At Liberty University on Monday, several students questioned whether Mr. Trump was introspective enough for high office. \u201cI can\u2019t see him leading the nation,\u201d said Yanni Allen, 19, a freshman, who also suggested that Mr. Trump was not quite capable of impressing evangelicals with his grasp of theology: \u201cIt\u2019s definitely deep water for him to come into here.\u201dCaleb Grow, 24, a graduate student, said Mr. Trump was unnecessarily hard \u201con certain minorities and religious groups,\u201d adding, \u201cI think he needs to tone back his rhetoric a bit, because it\u2019s kind of hateful.\u201dBut for Mr. Juvenal, a Methodist with two grown children who had the opportunity to meet Mr. Trump at a rally in Oklahoma last year, his willingness to dispense with the usual political filters is part of the allure.\u201cHe is like I am,\u201d he said. \u201cHe speaks like I do. He doesn\u2019t hide what he\u2019s saying. And he comes across very, very truthful.\u201dNick Corasaniti and Marina Stefan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thoughts on a Poland in Flux: Readers Speak Out", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byThere is intense debate in Poland about the direction the country is taking under its new right-wing government, a debate that has spilled over into the European Union and that has raised questions about the direction of democracy in Eastern and Central Europe more than a quarter-century after the fall of the Berlin Wall.The push toward the right and a rise in nationalist fervor has left some Poles feeling disenfranchised and arguing that Poland would be better off cultivating Western alliances. Supporters of the new government, with links to rural Poland and the powerful Catholic church, say that news coverage of their country\u2019s new course has been unfair.More than 1,000 readers responded, bringing to life a conversation about Poland\u2019s direction. Here is a selection. The responses have been edited for length and clarity; those submitted in Polish include a translation.Jestem smutna i zadziwiona tym, jak szybko mo\u017cna podzieli\u0107 Polak\u00f3w na \u201cnas\u201d i \u201cwas,\u201d na \u201clepszych\u201d i \u201cgorszych,\u201d na \u201cpatriot\u00f3w\u201d i \u201czdrajc\u00f3w\u201d.

But it\u2019s beneficial for Law and Justice, so those in power carefully cultivate it and foment animosity on both sides of the conflict.I consider myself a liberal, and although I always vote, there isn\u2019t really a party in Poland that represents my views.The main change is the atmosphere. We are completely polarized as a society, and some of us are triumphant, some of us are worried. Still, a majority don\u2019t care much, as they are uninterested in politics and despise politicians.I am worried that the actions of the government will weaken our international position and hurt our relations with the E.U. This, in turn, will make it much easier for Russia to expand, once again, its influence over Central Europe.Wbrew pozorom ca\u0142kiem sporo si\u0119 zmieni\u0142o.

Pierwszy raz w \u017cyciu jestem autentycznie zm\u0119czony polityk\u0105 i uciekam od niej jak tylko mog\u0119.Contrary to appearances, a lot has changed. People have gone crazy and political subjects need to be avoided at all costs. Most political discussions end with fights, but somehow, people have recently acquired a taste for debates about Poland. For the first time in my life, I am tired of politics, and I try to escape it as much as I can.It makes me remember the Communist era. Government saying that everything is right, when thousands on the streets and experts say the opposite. For the first time since 26 years of freedom, I and my friends are worried about our democracy.I voted for PiS because I believe that Poland is still in the process of transforming from Communism and they are the ones who can finish this process. Eighty percent of our law is written in Brussels. We are being lectured on \u201cdemocracy\u201d by unelected commissars from the E.U. Polish people value liberty above all, and we want to decide on our own. PiS is far from perfect, but the best option yet. Foreign governments will not accept our democratic choices as they affect the interests of many foreign corporations who invest in Poland.As a translator working with E.U. documents and someone who has to care much about words, I feel oppressed by the sheer stupidity of the statements of our current government. Our minister of transport is deeply concerned about chemtrails. Our minister of foreign affairs considers riding a bike and being vegetarian as Marxist. And to add insult to injury, there is also the unbelievable insolence. A former Communist prosecutor is leading the efforts to dismantle the Constitutional Court. A guy involved in the financial schemes now presides the Finance Commission in the Senate. I have stopped listening to the radio and reading newspapers.I feel completely alone. I\u2019m a vegan, a cyclist and an atheist. There is no place for me here anymore. I can\u2019t watch my favorite TV station anymore, the budget in my city is lost due to World Youth Day. We want more bike paths and an Erasmus program! They steal our rights and a diversity rooted in Polish history.I am afraid that soon public media will be exclusively conservative and any other point of view will be treated as an action against the law. I was born in 1993 and have lived my whole life in a free, democratic country, and I want it to stay this way.I am not a fan of PiS, I have not voted for them, but I see major improvement in the quality of public debate in television. Topics that were silenced are now being mentioned even in major news programs (such as Middle Eastern immigration to Europe, anti-E.U. views, etc.).Nigdy nie przypuszcza\u0142em, \u017ce b\u0119d\u0119 bra\u0142 udzia\u0142 w demonstracjach w obronie demokracji.

So far, I have seen such things only on television \u2014 in Eastern Europe or in historical records from the time of the Polish People\u2019s Republic. I never expected that Poland, which used to be a European role model in the fight for democracy, at some point could start losing this democracy itself.Poland has changed a lot since the Law and Justice Party came to power, mostly for the worse. However, there is one positive thing \u2014 the rise of civic society, which is something we never truly had in the past. Our country has been through a lot in the past, and we as a nation have shown that we will fight for our freedom and values we believe in.I hope that the new government will work on restoring the Polish economy based on our own production. Now, most of the factories in Poland are similar to those in the Far East \u2014 places where people assemble products for big foreign companies, very cheaply.Many of my friends who have never shown an interest in politics are suddenly paying very close attention. The changes here are alarming, and the mounting xenophobia a source of concern to expats who have made their home here.Jako osoba w homoseksualnym zwi\u0105zku boj\u0119 si\u0119 o moje \u017cycie i wolno\u015b\u0107.

The Affordable Care Act looks the way it does because it has to.My sense is that even reformocons, who imagine themselves more open-minded than the party\u2019s base, still don\u2019t get that. But the logic has been clear from the beginning.Start with a goal almost everyone at least pretends to support: making coverage available to people with preexisting conditions. How can you do that? Well, unless you simply want to provide government insurance, you have to prohibit discrimination based on medical history by private insurers: guaranteed issue and community rating. But just doing that isn\u2019t enough, because community rating on its own means that people don\u2019t sign up until they get sick, and you have a very poor risk pool. So you have to include an individual mandate, requiring that everyone get coverage. Note, by the way, that the individual mandate is essential in a way the employer mandate isn\u2019t.Yet you can\u2019t have an individual mandate without some way of making insurance affordable for lower-income families. So the mandate has to be backed by means-tested subsidies.And there you are: community rating, individual mandate, subsidies \u2014 ObamaRomneycare! Everything else is details.True, single-payer would be an alternative, and I\u2019d be for it if I thought it had any chance of happening. But that\u2019s an alternative to the left; there is no alternative to the right.That\u2019s why Obamacare opponents really had to stop it before it happened. As long as it was just a plan, they could insist that it was unworkable \u2014 that it would not, in fact, cover the uninsured, that costs would soar, that it would cripple the economy. And the official GOP position is indeed that the law has failed; who you gonna believe, us or your lying eyes? But none of the bad things that were supposed to happen, did.

The big question, for China\u2019s Alibaba Group and the Chinese economy, is whether the country\u2019s appetite will last.Ms. Gu, a 37-year-old in Shanghai, worries that falling demand could hurt her business despite the current good times. \u201cI\u2019m not very confident\u201d on e-commerce, she said. \u201cThe economic situation is not good this year, and I don\u2019t expect it to be any better next year.\u201dGross merchandise volume, a closely followed measure of the total transactions on the company\u2019s websites, rose 23 percent from the same period a year earlier, to $149 billion.\u201cThe Chinese economy is going through a structural shift to more moderate, but more sustainable, growth,\u201d Joe Tsai, Alibaba\u2019s executive vice chairman, said in a conference call. He added, \u201cit\u2019s still one of the fastest-growing economies in the world and we have no reason to think anything different in the future.\u201dCiting the fact that retail sales in China grew more than 10 percent in 2015, and that Alibaba is taking business from traditional bricks-and-mortar shops, Mr. Tsai said he thought Alibaba was insulated from the deceleration of the Chinese economy.Nevertheless, shares of Alibaba fell in the United States on Thursday after opening higher.China\u2019s emerging buying class has grown in importance as the country\u2019s previous growth engines, like heavy manufacturing and exports slow, hurting global markets. Investors are using Alibaba\u2019s shares to make bets on the country\u2019s prospects.Beijing is hoping that consumer spending on sites like Alibaba\u2019s will counterbalance the slowdown in other parts of the economy. Many investors doubt that will happen. They argue that market volatility, along with China\u2019s slowing economy, will eventually leak into consumer sentiment and hit companies like Alibaba and another United States-traded rival, the search provider Baidu. Investors this year have punished Alibaba, pushing its shares down about 16 percent.\u201cIf you\u2019re sitting in Boston or New York and you want to trade China, the most liquid proxies are Alibaba and Baidu,\u201d said Chi Tsang, an analyst at HSBC.Alibaba on Thursday said it made continued progress in tapping the growing numbers of Chinese who use their smartphones to buy goods and services online. The company\u2019s sales on smartphones almost tripled from the same period last year, and its monthly active smartphone users rose to 393 million, a jump of 47 million from the previous quarter.In 2015, Alibaba captured about 35 percent of the $15.8 billion mobile ad market compared with just 29.2 percent in 2014, according to the research firm eMarketer.If the company wanted to, it could also do more to extract money from vendors like Ms. Gu. With the power to drive traffic, Alibaba is mostly in the business of selling ads and spots that get Internet traffic to vendors.Still, the company has been spending big to bolster growth in new sectors, including an expensive dive into online-to-offline services, which allow customers to use their smartphones to order a variety of goods and services, including meals and massages.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Underestimating Cruz and Trump: A Post-Mortem", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceThe two instead resemble the far-right or populist Republican candidates who have soared in early polls and sometimes even won a few primaries, but not the nomination. Think Pat Robertson in 1988, Pat Buchanan in 1996, Mike Huckabee in 2008 or Rick Santorum in 2012.I and the other Trump-Cruz doubters assumed the present would resemble the past because the present usually does end up resembling the past. Claims of \u201cthis time is different\u201d are wrong vastly more often than they\u2019re right. But they\u2019re not always wrong.Every recent nominee, in both parties, has done well in the invisible primary. Sometimes, the eventual nominee has won the invisible primary in a rout, as George W. Bush and Al Gore both did in 2000 and Mitt Romney did in 2012. Other times, the nominee has won it more narrowly or finished as a strong second (Barack Obama in 2008).By contrast, early poll leaders who flailed in the invisible primary, including Herman Cain and Newt Gingrich in 2012, faded. Capturing the public\u2019s attention for weeks or even months at a time wasn\u2019t enough to get them anywhere near the nomination.The invisible primary has mattered so much because it has been both a sign of strength and a source of strength. It\u2019s a sign of strength because party elites pay much closer attention to the presidential campaign in the early months than voters do. The elites make judgments about which candidates are strongest \u2014 with the best message and delivery \u2014 that many voters end up sharing.But it\u2019s also not entirely coincidental that voters tend to make the same choices as party leaders. Voters are influenced by the money, endorsements and good publicity that flow to the winners of the invisible primary. Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump never had a chance to fare well in the invisible primary, which made many of us believe the nomination was beyond their reach.Today\u2019s Republican Party, however, may be different from the party of the recent past.One factor is that some Republican elites have become radicalized in similar ways to the Republican base. Another is that elites who disagree with the party establishment can probably have a greater influence than in the past. The rise of inequality has created more deep-pocketed potential conservative donors, while the loosening of campaign-finance rules has made it easier for those donors to give large sums.There is still a good chance that the original Trump-Cruz skepticism will look good in hindsight. Perhaps Republican voters are simply spending more time this year flirting with unorthodox candidates, but will settle on a more typical candidate once the voting begins. And the party establishment still has levers \u2014 money, publicity, superdelegates \u2014 to influence the race. In a protracted contest, the establishment will pull many of those levers for Marco Rubio, Chris Christie or Jeb Bush.If one of them wins \u2014 an outcome that the prediction markets give a 44 percent chance of happening \u2014 it will be yet another sign of the importance of the invisible primary. It will mean people like me were right about a lot of things, and it will then be easy for us to claim that we were right all along.We weren\u2019t. The invisible primary is important, and it will remain important in future elections. But even if Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump ultimately lose, their success shows how politics occasionally changes. Large, unhappy portions of the Republican party have drifted from the establishment and grabbed some power from it. The past, as a result, is a less reliable guide to the future than it once was.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Touring Can\u2019t Save Musicians in the Age of Spotify", "Date": "2016-01-25", "News": "Supported byNotebookEvery couple of months, I see another post in my Facebook feed about a band that was cut off by an 18-wheeler or skidded on a patch of black ice and rolled their van into a ditch. Some members are injured, and they\u2019re launching a Kickstarter campaign to pay for medical bills and to get back on their feet.My heart (and often, money) goes out to them. But if you need to crowdfund your hospital costs, you were never on your feet to begin with. After many years as a touring artist myself, I\u2019m honestly surprised that the person in that ditch has never been me.Touring is, of course, the most ancient business model available to artists \u2014 and in many ways, it remains a vital part of their livelihood, even while the surrounding industry undergoes major upheaval to accommodate the new paradigm of streaming music. In response to the shift in revenue sources, standard recording contracts now intrude into the numerous nonrecording aspects of an artist\u2019s career. But the advice given to the creative generators of this multibillion dollar industry is still one that would be recognizable to a medieval troubadour: Go on tour.And yet from a business standpoint, it\u2019s hard to find a model more unsustainable than one that relies on a single human body. This is why we have vice presidents, relief pitchers and sixth men. When applied to music\u2019s seemingly limitless streaming future, the only scarce resource left is the artists themselves. You would think the industry would protect such an important piece of its business model, but in fact, the opposite is true.Record labels have followed the money and addressed these changes in the contracts they offer to recording artists. In the predigital era, labels profited only from the physical recordings they funded, but as that income began dwindling, a new logic was applied to the artist-label relationship. Labels argued that by promoting the recordings they owned, they were also promoting the artist\u2019s career as a whole, and were entitled to profit from the full spectrum of artist\u2019s revenue streams \u2014 the \u201c360 deal,\u201d named for the totality of its coverage.But labels do not take on the additional risks associated with their additional profits. Instead of protecting the health of their revenue-generating engine, they simply point to an artist\u2019s independent-contractor status, which releases them from any liability they would be on the hook for if artists were labeled employees. Rather than sparking a labor dispute, these 360 deals quickly became the new normal. As a result, administrators, support staff and office spaces are insured against the risks of doing business, while the company\u2019s income generators \u2014 the creators of their master recordings \u2014 are on their own.From royalty rates to basic safeguards against the standard hazards of doing business, recording artists begin the negotiating process with a deck that is stacked against them. This lopsided balance of power allows labels to treat all artists as replaceable until proven otherwise, and both sides know that there is always a long line of hopefuls outside auditions for \u201cThe Voice\u201d or \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent\u201d to undercut a young artist\u2019s bargaining power.The question of why recording artists have been unable to organize and collectively bargain the way other artists have \u2014 actors and screenwriters, for example \u2014 is one that has dogged them since the dawn of the record deal. Musicians do have a union, the American Federation of Musicians, but it\u2019s not a particularly strong one; it primarily represents members of symphonies, and it hasn\u2019t been on a national strike in 70 years. Recording artists are not really considered core members, because their tenures within the union tend to be shorter than those of lifelong pit musicians and orchestra members. Music is also a traditionally decentralized, live art form with an ingrained renegade spirit. Hollywood, by contrast, has a single dominant hub.Perhaps musicians\u2019 renegade spirit is what ultimately will save the next generation of recording artists, who are increasingly forgoing record deals altogether and going it alone. As true independents, they work the margin between the technology that makes recordings cheaper to create and a public that is steadily buying fewer of them. Without a label taking a bite out of multiple revenue sources, the numbers can actually work. Others are coming together in groups centered on advocacy and pressing for changes to the laws that dictate royalty payments in the new streaming economy \u2014 something that could mean all the difference when injury, accident or age brings a touring musician\u2019s career to a halt. But in the meantime, the vans and buses roll on.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "One Market Prediction Is Sure: Wall Street Will Be Wrong", "Date": "2016-01-09", "News": "Supported byStrategiesThe stock market ended 2015 with a whimper and began the new year with a shudder. Even before Wall Street showed up for business on Monday morning, stocks fell 7 percent in China, and the turmoil that started in Asian markets cascaded around the world.The stock market in the United States fell 1.5 percent that day, based on the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. In the face of troubles in the Chinese markets and a flare-up of geopolitical worries, including news of a North Korean nuclear test and heightened tensions in the Persian Gulf, the S.&P. 500 had the worst five-day start in its history, ending down almost 6 percent.That unsettling start could have a salutary effect. It provides yet another reminder that investing in stocks is inherently risky: Unless you are prepared to accept losses, you should not be in the market.In interpreting the week\u2019s news, it\u2019s also worth remembering that a few days or even a month of stock returns will not tell us much about where the market will be a year or more from now. In fact, although everyone would like to know where the current gyrations will take us, the unpleasant truth is that there is simply no reliable way to foretell the short-term path of the market.You might not know that from the forecasts of major Wall Street investment houses. The start of a new year is the season for prognostication, and many analysts have issued very specific predictions. The consensus on Wall Street is that the S.&P. 500 will rise 7 percent for all of 2016.Not everyone has come up with a year-end target for the index, however. Among the reports on the future path of the market, one was perhaps the most useful and certainly honest. Bespoke Investment Group published it. Its three authors, Paul Hickey, Justin Walters and George Pearkes, began their 2016 forecast with this disarming statement: \u201cWe have no idea.\u201dThis candid disclosure ensured that the authors will not have to eat their words. They acknowledged that their lack of specificity might be unsettling: \u201cThat\u2019s probably the last thing you wanted to hear from us regarding our views towards the next year in the stock market. In all honesty, though, to try and look out one year from now and tell people what the market will or will not do is a fool\u2019s errand.\u201dYet they had plenty of interesting and skeptical things to say in the 161-page report. They explained why it is possible that the market will soar and finish 2016 with a double-digit gain \u2014 and why it is also quite possible that the long bull market is coming to an end this year. There is no certainty about either outcome, of course.What is likely, if not absolutely certain, is that the Wall Street consensus will be wrong.The Bespoke report reviewed the recent history of Wall Street predictions and found them wanting. Since 2000, it found, the consensus has called for an average yearly increase in the S.&P. 500 of about 9.5 percent. The actual average annual change was less than 4 percent, however, and consensus predictions were inaccurate in every single year, sometimes by preposterous margins. In 2001, for example, the consensus called for a gain of 20.7 percent. But the index fell by 13 percent. In the horrible year of 2008, the consensus was that the market would rise 11.1 percent. As many investors may recall, it fell by 38.5 percent. Not once since 2000 has Wall Street predicted that the market would decline in a calendar year. Yet the market actually fell in five of those years.This doesn\u2019t mean market analysis is useless. There is evidence, for example, that factors like stock valuations affect overall market returns over periods of five years or more, and that the level of prevailing interest rates influences returns over shorter periods. At the moment, those two factors point in different directions, however.After years of gains, overall valuations are stretched, by most measures, which may augur poorly for future returns. The price-to-earnings ratio of the S.&P. 500, for example, ended the year above 18, compared with an average since 1926 of a little over 15. That implies that investors are paying more for stocks than they have in the past. Higher prices often lead to price declines, but there is no assurance that this will happen on a known timetable, or that it will happen at all.On the positive side, interest rates, both the short-term ones set by the Federal Reserve and the longer-term rates established in the bond market, are extremely low by historical measures. That\u2019s the case even though the Fed has begun raising short-term rates. At the moment, for example, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes is about 2.1 percent, compared with an average of more than 6 percent since 1962. With the rates on relatively riskless investments in Treasuries remaining so low, the stock market may seem attractive as long as the economy grows and companies generate profits \u2014 in other words, unless the economy falls into a recession.On that score, the bond market may offer helpful clues. No recession since 1962 has occurred without an advance signal from the bond market known as an \u201cinverted yield curve.\u201d This simply means that short-term rates become higher than longer-term rates, reversing the typical order of things. When that reversal happens, the Bespoke report said, it \u201crepresents a belief by the market that current inflation and real interest rates are too high, and that activity will eventually contract, reducing inflation and forcing the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.\u201dThe yield curve right now is rising sharply, indicating that the bond market does not see a recession on the horizon. While the market has often predicted recessions that have never occurred, no recession has occurred without such a prediction. In short, this is a portent of stability. But like other indicators, it is not infallible.That is worth remembering, too. If there were a single reliable indicator of the market\u2019s direction, smart managers would use it and profit handsomely. But systems and methods aimed at ensuring investment outperformance rarely prevail for very long.It tracked domestic mutual funds through September 2015, and there were no surprises. As in the past, the numbers showed that active mutual funds that performed well in one year were rarely able to sustain that performance in subsequent years. In fact, the statistics indicated that they performed no better as a group than you would have expected if their managers had merely flipped coins. The data suggested, once again, that most people would fail if they tried to predict the direction of the overall market or of particular stocks and bonds.\u201cI feel the game is rigged against the average investor,\u201d Ms. Soe said.People often pay high fees for investment management that produces scant measurable benefit. It\u2019s usually wiser, for longer-term investments, to hold them in broadly diversified, low-cost holdings, probably in index funds.As for where the market is heading this year, you might as well flip a coin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Safer World, Thanks to the Iran Deal ", "Date": "2016-01-17", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe International Atomic Energy Agency verified on Saturday that Iran has shipped over 8.5 tons of enriched uranium to Russia so Iran can\u2019t use that in bomb-making, disabled more than 12,000 centrifuges and poured concrete into the core of a reactor at Arak designed to produce plutonium.On Sunday, President Obama hailed these steps as having \u201ccut off every single path Iran could have used to build a bomb\u201d and noted that engagement with Iran has created a \u201cwindow to try to resolve important issues.\u201d Most important of all, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ve achieved this historic progress through diplomacy, without resorting to another war in the Middle East.\u201dStill, there are daunting challenges ahead, including ensuring the deal is strictly adhered to, an obligation for the United States, Russia, China and Europe. Cheating should be much harder, given that Iran will be subjected to continuous and intrusive monitoring by the I.A.E.A. of its nuclear enrichment facilities, centrifuge production and uranium mines. And even if the Iranians were to attempt to produce enough nuclear fuel for a bomb, it will now take them more than a year to do so. Before the agreement, that breakout time was two to three months.The deal is a testament to patient diplomacy and President Obama\u2019s visionary determination to pursue a negotiated solution to the nuclear threat, despite relentless attempts by his political opponents to sabotage the initiative. After more than 30 years of hostility between the two countries, President Hassan Rouhani of Iran and his foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, who took office in 2013, pursued the nuclear deal and its implementation with a pragmatic and constructive attitude.This is also a moment to celebrate the release of the Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian and three other Americans of Iranian descent who were detained by Iran, in some cases for years. Mr. Rezaian and the others should never have been held in the first place. Their freedom came in exchange for seven Iranians arrested by the United States on charges of violating sanctions on Iran. Separately, another American who was recently detained was also freed. Resolving disputes often requires compromise, and these developments make it more likely, although far from certain, that the United States and Iran could cooperate in the future.Of course, neither compliance with the nuclear agreement nor the release of the Americans means that Iran should not be subject to criticism or new sanctions for violation of other United Nations resolutions or American laws. Once the detained Americans left Iran, Mr. Obama moved quickly to impose new, limited sanctions on 11 Iranian companies and individuals for their involvement in two recent ballistic missile tests.Iran\u2019s critics are incensed that in return for complying with the nuclear deal, the country will get access to $100 billion of its money that has been frozen in overseas banks and that lifting sanctions will enable it to integrate into the international economy. The critics fear Iran will use the money to destabilize the region further, but Mr. Rouhani\u2019s greater imperative is to spend the funds on the many social and economic needs of Iranians. His promises to improve their lives will be tested during next month\u2019s parliamentary elections.Leaders don\u2019t give up their nuclear weapons for nothing. A bargain with Iran was necessary. It might even serve as an example for dealing with North Korea, which may have enough fuel for 16 weapons and is producing many more.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sanders Makes a Rare Pitch: More Taxes for More Government", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceSenator Bernie Sanders\u2019s health care plan is advancing a notion that has long been out of fashion in American politics: that the federal government should provide a new, expensive service to most Americans, and that it should levy significantly higher taxes on most Americans to provide that service.He is proposing a health care plan that would require over a trillion dollars a year in new, broad-based taxes applying to nearly all Americans who work. His main opponent, Hillary Clinton, has reiterated President Barack Obama\u2019s pledge not to raise taxes even on many affluent families, setting her cutoff for tax increases at $250,000.According to revenue estimates provided by the campaign, $238 billion of his new revenues would come from taxes focused specifically on people making more than $250,000 a year or inheriting estates larger than $3.5 million.Income tax rates would get progressively higher at the top, maxing out at 52 percent for people making over $10 million per year. (Currently, the maximum federal income tax rate is 39.6 percent.) Mr. Sanders would eliminate tax preferences for capital gains for people making over $250,000, and also limit the value of tax deductions they could take.Still, this wouldn\u2019t be the main source of financing for his plan. Most of the new revenue, about $1.15 trillion a year, would come from broad-based taxes: $630 billion from a 6.2 percent employer-paid tax on payrolls; $210 billion from a 2.2 percent income tax, applied to the existing taxable income base; and $310 billion from the elimination of existing tax preferences for health benefits.The third item is a somewhat complicated idea: Currently, health insurance benefits are exempt from both income and payroll taxes. If employers didn\u2019t need to pay for health insurance, economists generally believe that, in the long run, their spending on health insurance would shift into taxable wages and salaries. That is, eliminating employer-based health insurance would cause wages and salaries to go up.Under Mr. Sanders\u2019s plan, employers would need to use some of the money they were spending on health insurance to pay the new 6.2 percent payroll tax, but this would be less than what they\u2019re spending on health insurance now. If the difference went into higher wages, that would mean $310 billion a year in new income and payroll taxes, on average over the next 10 years.This is key to the Sanders argument. His plan isn\u2019t just a big new government program paid for by big new taxes. It would replace private spending on health care, which is currently a huge burden on employees and employers. Yes, employees would pay some new taxes, and employers would pay a new payroll tax that would eat into wages, but it wouldn\u2019t eat into wages as much as health insurance premiums do now. Employers would have extra cash to hand out raises, more than offsetting the new taxes employees would have to pay.Jared Bernstein, an economist at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, argued there were reasons to think a move to single payer would lift economic growth by making the health care sector more efficient, even if it required large tax increases.\u201cPeople have correctly raised the caveat that restructuring the health care industry would be incredibly disruptive and shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly, but I don\u2019t think anyone who has taken a good look at that industry and compared the numbers to other countries would disagree that we could create a lot of efficiencies,\u201d he said.If Mr. Sanders\u2019s plan failed to contain costs as much as he projected, it would be significantly more expensive and require significantly more in tax increases than he has already proposed. It would also do less to increase economic growth.Alan Viard, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, raised another concern. Mr. Sanders\u2019s tax increases might not raise as much revenue as the campaign anticipated because of how the tax changes would change taxpayers\u2019 behavior. That is, individual high-income taxpayers could delay sales of assets to avoid creating taxable capital gains, and higher taxes could reduce economic activity and taxable income over all.A spokesman for the Sanders campaign said they did not make dynamic assumptions in modeling their plan. That is, while they estimated there would be an increase in taxable wages, they did not assume that changes to the health care system would cause the economy to grow over all, nor did they assume that higher tax rates would shrink the economy.\u201cI might not think the effects are as big as they\u2019re going to say,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you have to think there would be some adverse effects.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Walmart to Close 269 Stores as Retailers Struggle", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byThe closures underscore the turmoil faced by brick-and-mortar retail across a variety of fronts. Web merchants are gobbling up a growing share of shopping dollars, their vast online catalogs rendering Walmart\u2019s sprawling superstores increasingly less relevant. And consumers are spending less on traditional retail items like apparel.\u201cClosing stores is never an easy decision, but it is necessary to keep the company strong and positioned for the future,\u201d Doug McMillon, Walmart\u2019s president and chief executive, said in a statement.\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that we\u2019ll open well more than 300 stores around the world next year,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we are committed to growing, but we are being disciplined about it.\u201dMr. McMillon had warned investors late last year that the company was considering shifts in its retail strategy. At the higher end of its new plan to add 142 to 165 new stores, Walmart\u2019s store base in the United States would still rise; at the lower end, Walmart would, for the first time, shrink its United States footprint.The closings account for less than 1 percent of global square footage and revenue, which totaled $485 billion last year. Walmart\u2019s exit from its smaller-format stores also highlights the difficulties it has faced in reaching more urban consumers. Introduced in 2011, its Express stores are slightly larger than a typical dollar store and were an effort to establish the retailer in bigger cities. But they have failed to make significant inroads or generate enough returns in the face of cutthroat competition from dollar stores and other discounters.Over all, Walmart has been slow to pull out of a flat sales period after the recession and was slow to react to the pace of growth in online shopping.Although sales have improved, the retailer has warned of lower profits going forward because of its investments in its work force and e-commerce. Over the last year, Walmart\u2019s stock has tumbled 30 percent to its lowest level in half a decade.Despite heavy spending on e-commerce initiatives, Walmart\u2019s online sales growth is slowing.\u201cPhysical retail, and large box in particular, is at a tipping point,\u201d Richard Church, a retail analyst at the data analytics firm Discern, wrote in an email.\u201cThere are too many stores in the U.S. across all retail sectors, low end to high end and everything in between,\u201d Mr. Church wrote. \u201cThis is never more evident than when consumer demand is sluggish and decelerating, as it is now.\u201dThere are bright spots in retail, like Lululemon Athletica, which raised its earnings outlook as it continued to ride a boom in athletics wear. L Brands, which owns Victoria\u2019s Secret, reported its \u201cbest December ever\u201d after the lingerie brand generated holiday buzz with a star-studded fashion show.Noam Paransky, a director in the retail practice at the consulting firm AlixPartners, said that retailers were reaching the limits of competing on price, especially with online merchants eager to beat prices.Brick-and-mortar retailers needed to come up with a better proposition, he said, to lure shoppers into their stores.\u201c\u00a0\u2018Stack it high and let it fly\u2019 doesn\u2019t work anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to figure out how to make shopping fun again.\u201dAbout 16,000 store employees will be affected worldwide by the closings, Walmart said. The stores are scheduled to shut down by the end of January.Walmart said it intended to transfer as many workers as it could to nearby stores and offer severance pay to those who do not find new positions. The company is the nation\u2019s largest private-sector employer.Workers\u2019 groups blasted Walmart\u2019s move.\u201cFor Walmart, its workers are disposable,\u201d said Jess Levin, communications director at Making Change at Walmart, a group backed by the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union and a longtime critic of working conditions at the retailer.\u201cThese latest store closings could very well be just the beginning,\u201d she said. \u201cThis sends a chilling message to the company\u2019s hard-working employees that they could be next.\u201dOf the 154 locations Walmart will close in the United States, 102 will be Walmart Express stores. The company said it would focus more on the slightly larger Neighborhood Market format, which has logged stronger sales (though it will also close 23 of those stores). Walmart is also closing 12 supercenters and four Sam\u2019s Club membership stores.The bulk of Walmart\u2019s 115 closings overseas are in Brazil, where the economy is slowing. The retailer will also close 55 primarily small, loss-making stores in other Latin American markets, it said. The closures are expected by the end of the month.Walmart said that costs associated with the closings would shave an estimated 20 to 22 cents from its earnings per share, and that the effect would be felt mostly in its fourth-quarter results, which it reports next month. That effect is not reflected in its quarter or full-year earnings guidance.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rural Oregon\u2019s Lost Prosperity Gives Standoff a Distressed Backdrop", "Date": "2016-01-18", "News": "Areas that were once economically important languish as jobs are clustered in urban centers, creating a feeling of powerlessness as their populations grow older, poorer and less educated.Supported byBURNS, Ore. \u2014 One of the largest wood mills in the West once belched its steam on the edge of town, sawing ponderosa pine. Out in the woods, tree fallers like Tex Ward were proud and prosperous.Mr. Ward, 54, a lifelong resident who has lost his job twice and has filed for bankruptcy once, said that was not the case anymore. He now works for the state as a prison guard, a job he said he hated.On a recent frosty morning, before heading off for his shift, he and his wife, Shelly, fed the 30 head of cattle that are the closest thing the Wards have to a retirement fund. \u201cYou do what you have to do to stay alive,\u201d Mr. Ward said. \u201cBut I\u2019m sour as hell.\u201dTimes were once very good out here on the high desert of east-central Oregon, and a place like Burns \u2014 remote and obscure until a group of armed protesters took over a nearby federal wildlife sanctuary this month \u2014 was full of civic pride and bustle. In their heyday, Harney County and its largest town, Burns, were economically important in a way that now seems unthinkable in the rural West.An armed protest at a remote federal wildlife refuge was the latest flare-up in a decades-long struggle over control of federal land.The pattern of poverty has shifted nationally as well. In the four decades since the late 1960s, poverty rates fell or remained stable across the Northeast, South and Midwest \u2014 but rose significantly across the West, a Pew Research Center study said in 2014.\u201cHigh incomes, great schools \u2014 it was a Norman Rockwell rural America,\u201d said Timothy A. Duy, an economist and senior director of the Oregon Economics Forum at the University of Oregon, describing the arc of places like Burns. \u201cIt\u2019s reasonable for people to say, \u2018We\u2019d like to turn back the clock,\u2019 because it was for many people an ideal time.\u201dWhat happened was a steep downturn, especially in the timber industry, which has all but disappeared. Oregon lost about three-fourths of its timber mills between 1980 and 2010; Harney County lost all seven, including the one near Burns where Mr. Ward worked, which closed in the mid-1990s.Changes in the wood industry were clearly also having an effect over those years, with more wood buyers shopping in Canada and more mills becoming automated, but many people here also said they thought the United States Forest Service did not fight back to save the mills and jobs.\u201cYou didn\u2019t stand up for us then; why should we stand up for you now?\u201d asked Ms. Ward, 51, referring to federal officials, as she sipped coffee in her kitchen on a recent morning.The Pew statistics also suggest a structural change in poverty in rural America. In the 1960s, when images of the poor in rural Appalachia and elsewhere in the South galvanized the nation, children and older people were largely the faces of economic struggle. Comparatively speaking, there are now much higher numbers of people in their prime working-age years whose incomes are below the federal poverty measure for a family.\u201cGovernment controls the land and resources,\u201d said the group\u2019s leader, Ammon Bundy, at a news conference last week. And that, he added, \u201chas put people in duress and put them in poverty.\u201dBut the role of government in what happened here is also more nuanced and complex than the black-hat-white-hat imagery presented by Mr. Bundy and his companions.Government paychecks, like the one Mr. Ward earns at his job at the prison, have helped keep Harney County afloat as private jobs have declined. With nearly 60 percent of the pay earned in the county now coming from the public sector \u2014 including schools and federal management jobs at the 188,000-acre wildlife refuge \u2014 this was the most government-dependent county in Oregon in 2013, according the most recent analysis by the state.People like the Wards said that when environmental groups filed lawsuits and applied pressure at the State Capitol in Salem or in Washington, D.C., to reduce logging, forest managers just surrendered. The residual anger of people caught in the economic undertow now affects how residents here think about the takeover at the refuge, and the arguments about what should happen next.Some residents and local officials say they believe the history and relationship between the people and the government is being distorted by the protesters, and that cooperation across lines has worked well, to the benefit of the community. For instance, an arrangement with private landowners to protect a threatened bird species, the sage grouse \u2014 and to prevent even more restrictive government protections \u2014 was a model of how cooperation can work, they said.\u201cThose are things that Mr. Bundy doesn\u2019t know about or care about it,\u201d said Steven E. Grasty, the county judge and chairman of the county commissioners. \u201cWe can keep building on those things if he would get out of the way.\u201dBut the sense that government \u2014 not just federal but state as well \u2014 no longer hears the voice of places like this echoes through the community, even among those who wish Mr. Bundy and his supporters would go home. Harney County has lost 4 percent of its population just since 2010, according to United States census figures, even as the state\u2019s population, especially in and around Portland, has surged.\u201cPeople feel powerless,\u201d said State Representative Cliff Bentz, a Republican whose district covers much of eastern Oregon, including Harney County. \u201cAs the rural areas grow more and more poor and urban areas grow more and more wealthy, there\u2019s a shift in power.\u201dMs. Ward\u2019s father, Al Albertson, 73, who also once worked at the lumber mill here, put it more bluntly. \u201cPeople in western Oregon don\u2019t even know where Burns is,\u201d he said.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the relationship between Harney County, Ore., and the State of Massachusetts. Though the two are similar in terms of square miles, Massachusetts is slightly larger, not smaller, than Harney County. The error was repeated in a picture caption. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Exile", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "FeatureDeportations and violence have driven tens of thousands of people of Haitian descent from their homes in the Dominican Republic \u2014 while the world is silent.Supported byThe property was delineated on the west by a partly paved road and on the east by the babbling Pedernales River, which marked the border with the Dominican Republic. In between was a grove of mesquite trees. Whenever money was tight, the farmer would cut down trees to sell as charcoal. But each tree he cut down made the farm less productive, which made money even tighter. Eventually there were almost no trees left, and the loose topsoil blew in dirt storms that kicked up with every gust of wind.Last summer, people began to show up at the farmer\u2019s mud-walled shack. They could speak Haitian Creole, but often with a Dominican accent. They said they had come from the Dominican Republic, where the government was planning to expel anyone of Haitian descent, by force if necessary. They told stories of vigilantes carrying machetes and axes. The threats reminded them of their grandparents\u2019 stories of 1937, when Dominican soldiers massacred anyone living along the border they thought looked or sounded like a Haitian. \u201cEvery time there is a deportation, there is a massacre,\u201d one refugee said.The farmer said they could set up camp on his land. He figured they would move on or go back home soon. But the people didn\u2019t move. More arrived every day. At bigger crossings farther north, many of the tens of thousands fleeing across the border went on to the Haitian interior. But in the far south, around Anse-\u00e0-Pitres, the chalky mountain roads are harder to cross, so the migrants set up camps just past the border.They were dropped off by caravans of brightly painted Daihatsu trucks or came on foot, carrying pots, pans and mattresses, balancing suitcases on their heads. They built shelters with frames made of branches and covered them with whatever material they could find. One family made a wall out of a pair of XXL Levi\u2019s jeans. Another stretched out a dirty Snuggie, its left sleeve hanging out like a limp windsock. Someone found a huge purple-and-yellow vinyl poster bearing the smiling face of a Dominican congressional candidate and used it as a waterproof roof.By fall, 2,000 people were living in the dirt in Parc Cadeau. The settlement had become large enough to split into two camps and permanent enough to produce community leaders, a wicker-walled church and a school. The farmer threw up his hands and went back to selling charcoal.One morning in November, Peres Yves Jean and Mirlene Lamour sat at the entrance to their shelter in Parc Cadeau. The structure was of the same cardboard-and-sticks construction as their neighbors\u2019. Lamour had found a comforter and sheets to make a roof; atop it, a doll\u2019s head gazed up at the sky. The couple spoke softly to each other, the way people learn to when they live in places where they don\u2019t want to be overheard.Jean was 35, but he had the parched, worn voice of a man twice his age. Lamour, 33, rested her head on her hands. She liked to keep up her appearance, but it was hard to do in Parc Cadeau. The leopard-print scarf around her braided hair had begun to fray in the sun. Her fingernails bore the chipped purple remnants of a manicure applied long ago.The subject of the conversation, as usual, was money. There was no work for Jean and Lamour in Anse-\u00e0-Pitres and certainly not in Parc Cadeau. Lamour had resorted to selling their possessions \u2014 the sheets, her plate, even her mirror \u2014 for food. The family had originally brought two mattresses for six people to sleep on. They had had to sell one. \u201cI can\u2019t hold on anymore,\u201d she said, exhausted.Dominican immigration officials showed off the new buses and \u201creception centers\u201d that would be used to process those who would be expelled. In a country with a history of sporadic violence against its Haitian minority \u2014 there are at least a few lynchings documented every year \u2014 these reports took on an ominous cast.The crisis stemmed from a court case filed in 2008 by Juliana Deguis Pierre, a Dominican of Haitian descent whose local civil registry in the central Dominican province Monte Plata refused to issue her a national ID card. Deguis claimed the bureaucrats discriminated against her because she had dark skin and a Francophone name \u2014 markers of Haitian identity. The case eventually arrived at the Constitutional Court, a high court created in 2010 to interpret constitutional law. In one of its first major rulings, the court decided in 2013 that Deguis should never have been a citizen in the first place because her parents did not have enough documentation to prove legal residency before Deguis was born.Hard-line nationalists wanted the ruling enforced strictly. But President Danilo Medina \u2014 a moderate in the ruling Dominican Liberation Party \u2014 was wary of international criticism, not to mention threats of boycotts against the $8.3 billion Dominican tourism industry, which provides nearly one-sixth of the country\u2019s G.D.P.As international attention turned away, however, people of Haitian descent quietly began crossing Hispaniola\u2019s divide. In some cases, they were removed by Dominican troops and immigration patrols, which have officially deported 14,000 people since the June deadline, according to the Dominican government. But far more have left on their own \u2014 some 70,000, according to the Dominican Republic\u2019s director general of immigration. They have become voluntary migrants of the least voluntary sort, fleeing an atmosphere of fear and confusion created by ever-shifting laws, vague threats, byzantine registration programs and spasms of racial violence.\u201cThere are a lot of people that think there is going to be war,\u201d Peres Yves Jean told me in November, as we sat on upturned plastic tubs outside his shelter in Parc Cadeau. \u201cI don\u2019t know how. But they say it in the news. They say all the words. So the people, they don\u2019t know what the government is going to do.\u201dAt the same time, Trujillo worked with Haitian elites and American businesses to bring thousands of Haitians to work as cheap labor in the Dominican sugar-cane industry. At first, most came on seasonal work permits, but many stayed, living in isolated communities in the cane fields.Los Patos is a hiccup of a town on the highway along the Barahona peninsula, far closer to the Haitian border than it is to Santo Domingo. Alongside a strip of shops and small hotels, a hill rises steeply to meet the low-flying clouds. On the hillside, farms are scattered throughout a dense forest, where the couple had a chance to establish a life of their own.Jean built a sturdy palmwood house with a palm-thatch roof, and the couple planted a little garden to grow their own food. He says the landowner, a Dominican named Gabriel Feliz, gave them the patch of land and a tacit promise that he wouldn\u2019t have them deported. In return, Jean planted pigeon peas, corn and squash on the farm. Lamour says she worked on the harvest and cleaned Feliz\u2019s house and the rental cabanas the farmer had built, in hopes of attracting the few tourists who came to Los Patos for the pretty beach at the bottom of the hill. Jean says neither was paid for their work \u2014 that they were, practically speaking, sharecroppers.Under the Dominican Republic\u2019s Constitution at the time, being born in the country should have been enough to make Jean and Lamour\u2019s first children Dominican citizens. But there were two exceptions to this rule: the children of diplomats and \u201cthose who are in transit.\u201d For decades, Dominican officials had toyed with exploiting this loophole by redefining anyone who did not have legal permanent status in the country as being \u201cin transit,\u201d no matter how long they had lived there \u2014 a designation they knew would apply almost exclusively to people of Haitian descent.By then, Jean and Lamour had five children: three boys and two girls. (They would later have two more girls.) The rapidly changing citizenship laws, which applied differently to nearly every child, would have been hard enough to navigate if the couple had been constitutional scholars instead of semiliterate farmworkers gleaning updates from rumor and the radio. When they learned of the registration programs announced in 2013 and 2014, they had no idea what to do. They feared that if they stepped forward as undocumented migrants, they could be deported. And what would happen to their children, all but one of whom \u2014 a newborn daughter \u2014 had no papers? Would they be left in the hands of government officials, overzealous border guards or vigilantes?In February, a Haitian man named Henry Claude Jean was found hanging from a tree across the street from the hospital in Santiago de los Caballeros, the country\u2019s second-largest city. A Dominican news channel aired footage showing his swollen body still dangling the following day, his hands and feet bound with black cord. The Santiago police blamed two undocumented Haitian immigrants who were supposed to have killed Jean over a lottery ticket. On the night of the killing, three miles from the park where Jean was hanged, a crowd burned a Haitian flag and chanted: \u201cHaitians, out!\u201dPeres Yves Jean told me that in March, a few weeks after the Santiago lynching, he was coming back from a day job when a khaki-colored truck stopped him on the road outside Los Patos. Deportations weren\u2019t supposed to happen until the registration program had run its course, in June. But the men in khaki uniforms \u2014 most likely agents of the Specialized Border Security Corps, or Cesfront \u2014 didn\u2019t seem to care. They asked him for ID. When he didn\u2019t have any, they drove him 50 miles west to the border at Anse-\u00e0-Pitres, snapped a couple of mug shots and left him on the other side.Jean says he waited until the truck disappeared from sight, then simply walked back into the Dominican Republic. He splashed across the shallow Pedernales River and trudged up into the green mountains, past cattle herds, fields of plantain trees and the rhythmically whooshing turbines of a wind farm, carefully avoiding the checkpoints manned by soldiers on the lookout for Haitians. After two days of walking, he reached the palmwood shack, where Lamour and the children were waiting, with no idea where he had gone. They rushed to embrace him. Then they gathered their things and left.As the June 17 deadline approached, rumors of impending violence grew louder. Dominican neighbors reminded Jean that it was almost time to go. One flashed a hatchet blade. Uncertain of what might happen to their children, Jean and Lamour finally gave up. Lamour\u2019s mother, who felt confident she could register and stay, came from her home in the eastern Dominican Republic and picked up their 2-year-old daughter, Miliana \u2014 the only one of their children with serviceable documentation \u2014 and took her back east. Then the rest of the family set out for Haiti.Jean and Lamour found a man with a truck. They asked him to take them and their few possessions through a clandestine border crossing north of Anse-\u00e0-Pitre, a shallow bend of the Pedernales River frequented by truckers and taxi drivers on both sides. They had only enough money to pay him to take them just past the river to the makeshift camp at Parc Cadeau.Thousands more people of Haitian descent remain in the Dominican Republic, in legal limbo. According to the Dominican government, 240,000 people have registered under the regularization program to stay for one or two years, but a quarter of those people haven\u2019t gotten their cards. The naturalization applications of other Dominican-born people are still being processed, which leaves thousands more who did not apply for citizenship at all and were accordingly stripped of it.Those who already fled to Parc Cadeau were trying their best to live normal lives despite the circumstances. Because of the dirt storms, nearly everyone cooked on open fires inside the shelters. I heard about at least one shelter catching fire on each of the four days I was in the camp \u2014 usually during the evening meal, which was often the only one the residents ate all day. The week I visited, the Haitian Ministry of Health confirmed the presence of cholera in the camp, where people drank untreated water from the river and used the surrounding hills as a toilet. At a cholera ward in Anse-\u00e0-Pitres, I met a couple from Parc Cadeau whose 12-year-old son had just died.The conditions were worse than anything I saw in the Port-au-Prince displacement camps after the 2010 earthquake, which attracted the attention \u2014 for better and for worse \u2014 of a flotilla of aid groups, nongovernmental organizations and foreign militaries, as well as the Haitian government. When it came to the people fleeing into Haiti, though, the same organizations did not seem to know what to do. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with a lot of ambiguity and doubt,\u201d Brian Hansford, a spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency (U.N.H.C.R.), later told me.On the most basic level, it was hard to figure out how to classify Parc Cadeau\u2019s residents. Some might legally be considered refugees. Others could be dual nationals, or Haitians who returned home. Were these people the responsibility of the Dominican government? The Haitian government? The international system? Or were they entirely on their own?Workers from some small aid groups, who were doing their best to bring food and hygiene kits to the camps, told me that the Haitian government was blocking efforts to bring further aid, claiming that doing so would encourage people to stay. Officials in Port-au-Prince, mired in a chaotic presidential election, have been content to trade accusations of blame with Santo Domingo. A July meeting of the Organization of American States, a regional organization, devolved into a shouting match. \u201cHaiti came here to ask the Americas, on behalf of its founding fathers and in the name of morality, to urge the Dominican Republic to come back to reason,\u201d Lener Renauld, Haiti\u2019s defense minister, said.Rodr\u00edguez, a practicing attorney and one of the architects of the naturalization law, wore a week-old beard and the wrinkled clothes of an academic (he teaches law at two Dominican universities). Fiallo was younger and suaver, clean-shaven in a tailored suit, an up-and-coming diplomat who studied at the London School of Economics and is active on Twitter, Flickr and Vine.\u201cIs it the ideal situation for everyone?\u201d Rodr\u00edguez said of the citizenship policy. \u201cNo.\u201d Still, Fiallo said, the government didn\u2019t deserve all the blame. Problems with the registration program were a result of the \u201ccultural practice among descendants of Haitians, in particular, to use nicknames,\u201d he said. I asked about the lynch mobs in Hatillo Palma that caused hundreds to flee the town and hastened the departure of many more from across the country. \u201cIt\u2019s a complicated place,\u201d he said.Rodr\u00edguez and Fiallo compared Medina\u2019s handling of the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision to the way in which American conservatives were forced to deal with the legalization of same-sex marriage, or how Democrats had to make peace with Bush v. Gore. \u201cIt was the solution possible at that moment,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez said.Yet when I asked Rodr\u00edguez and Fiallo to explain what problem the constitutional changes, rulings and deportations were originally supposed to solve, they had no answer. The Dominican economy depends on Haitian labor. Unemployment is relatively low. Rodr\u00edguez and Fiallo kept stressing the importance of eliminating legal confusion and sorting out the status of the country\u2019s undocumented people, but the programs seem to be creating more confusion than clarity.Gabriel Feliz, a short man in a short-sleeve button-down shirt, slacks and a red baseball cap that said MIAMI, greeted me with a handshake and an air of mild suspicion. He grew more suspicious when I asked if any of his workers had left recently. \u201cWho did you say you work for again?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe Haitians have never gone from here. There was a truck that came the other day and took two away, and they jumped out and came back \u2014 thank God.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019d never work anyway,\u201d Feliz said of the government\u2019s registration and deportation plans. \u201cIt was just for the politicians to make some paper. It didn\u2019t change anything.\u201d Then he excused himself to tend to his farm.After he left, I found myself standing by the little house of a Haitian-born woman who had worked for Feliz for five years. She told me that she was also a sharecropper, given no pay other than a small plot of land. (Feliz says he does pay his workers in cash.) She knew Jean and Lamour. \u201cThey\u2019re good people,\u201d she said softly in Creole. \u201cI can\u2019t contact them anymore. A lot of people have gone.\u201dThe woman\u2019s daughter led me down a gravel road and up a dirt path to the couple\u2019s house. The palmwood cabin\u2019s door was padlocked. A black sandal with a silver-colored clasp lay on the dirt path leading to the house. Other than the sandal and a torn-up box spring leaning off to the side, there was no sign of the family that fled the property eight months before. The padlock that now hung on their door, the woman said, belonged to a Dominican who had since moved in.Advertisement"}

Rounding out the cast is Sanjit De Silva, who plays the chief executive of a luggage company that Mr. Krasinski\u2019s character wants to invest in.\u00e2\u0080\u009cDry Powder\u00e2\u0080\u009d will begin performances at the Public Theater on March 1, and will run until April 24, two weeks longer than originally planned. Thomas Kail, the director of \u201cHamilton,\u201d will direct. Even before its first production, the play has been singled out. On Thursday Ms. Burgess won a Laurents/Hatcher Foundation Award, given to an unproduced, full-length play by an American playwright.Christopher Demos-Brown, whose previous works include \u00e2\u0080\u009cFear Up Harsh\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen the Sun Shone Brighter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the other recipient, for \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerican Son,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which explores the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s racial divide through the lens of an estranged, biracial couple. It will be the first production of Barrington Stage Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2016 season in June. Each playwright receives $25,000, and the producing theaters get $50,000 apiece.FollowAdvertisement"}

Canadian energy companies viewed the pipeline as the key to sustaining growth, since the United States buys the vast majority of petroleum produced by the oil sands. But many American environmentalists used the project as a proxy for the oil sands, a energy source that they considered particularly polluting. The pipeline plan got caught in a regulatory and legal struggle, as the State Department environmental review dragged on for years.In November, President Obama rejected the plan, saying the pipeline would undercut the country\u2019s leadership on climate change. Still, he added \u201cthis pipeline would neither be a silver bullet for the economy, as was promised by some, nor the express lane to climate disaster proclaimed by others.\u201dTransCanada said it would take a write-down of $1.8 billion to $2 billion for its fourth quarter. The Nafta challenge process does not allow Canadian or Mexican companies that believe they are being discriminated against by the United States government to overturn decisions. But the measure, which grew out of earlier trade provisions to compensate corporations after a foreign government expropriated their assets, does allow them to seek a range of damages, including unrealized profits.The case filed by TransCanada at the Houston division of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas does not seek compensation. Instead, the company is seeking to have Mr. Obama\u2019s decision reversed on the grounds that he exceeded his constitutional powers.After accounting for the consolidation of cases, the United States has faced 12 challenges under Nafta, all from Canadian companies, and won them all. All of them failed, several on procedural grounds. Canada, however, has lost cases brought by American companies.Trade experts were reluctant to speculate on TransCanada\u2019s case, which will be heard through an arbitration process outside the American judicial system.\u201cThe rules themselves are so vague by design that practically every case is a crap shoot,\u201d said Robert Stumberg, an international law professor at Georgetown University. Lori Wallach, the director of Public Citizen\u2019s Global Trade Watch and a longtime critic of provisions that allow corporations to seek damages through trade agreements, said that TransCanada was bringing its case at a time when panels that hear such disputes seem increasingly more willing to rule against governments.\u201cWe\u2019ve really dodged the bullet to date,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not because we have great laws.\u201dWhile Nafta\u2019s arbitration process was intended to be faster than litigation through courts, Scott Miller, a trade dispute expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said he anticipated that it would take up to six years for a decision and its outcome was uncertain.\u201cI don\u2019t think that the fact that the U.S. has a good record means a whole lot in this case,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything will depend on its facts.\u201dCoral Davenport contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Stocks Fall Sharply, Leading Asian Markets Lower", "Date": "2016-01-26", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s stock market sank on Tuesday amid accumulating evidence of the Chinese economy\u2019s deeply rooted troubles and as the central bank pushed huge sums of money into the banking system.The drop took Chinese stocks to their lowest level in 13 months. It followed a sell-off in the United States on Monday that was caused by a fall in the price of oil, an indicator of global economic health. But it also comes at a time of lingering market volatility in China stemming from growth concerns and questions about Beijing\u2019s ability to manage its markets.European shares were down slightly in midday trading, while futures trading suggested that Wall Street stocks could be set to fall on Tuesday. Oil also resumed its decline on Tuesday in Asian trading, dropping less than 1 percent after falling beneath the psychologically important $30 level earlier in the Asian trading day.China\u2019s economy grew last year at the slowest pace in 25 years. Among other problems, it has a glut of old-line factories that make products like steel, glass and cement. That industrial overcapacity stems from years of debt-financed investment in industries that now show little sign that they can repay those loans.Beijing, which is seeking to rebalance its economy to focus more on consumer spending and services, is slowly moving to address those concerns. The country\u2019s State Council, or cabinet, decided on Sunday that it would close 100 million to 150 million tons of steel-making capacity. That is enough capacity to potentially rival the total annual steel output of Japan, the world\u2019s No. 2 steel maker, which totaled 110.7 million tons in 2014.By contrast, China produced 804 million tons of steel last year, even as demand faltered. Over all, China\u2019s steel-making capacity was set to reach 1.17 billion tons last year, according to estimates from Fitch Ratings.Li Xinchuang, the head of the China Metallurgical Industry Planning and Research Institute, told the official Xinhua news agency that the planned steel mill closings could cost 400,000 jobs. \u201cLarge-scale redundancies in the steel sector could threaten social stability,\u201d he warned.The State Council decision, which was released on Monday, also called for large reductions in coal mining capacity, without providing a target figure.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.China\u2019s markets are falling even as policy makers are attempting to rein in soaring capital outflows prompted by investors\u2019 seeking to avoid China\u2019s slowing growth and wide expectations that its currency will weaken. Excluding foreign investment, capital outflows probably rose to as much as $900 billion in 2015, economists at Standard Chartered wrote Tuesday in a research note.In response to the outflows, China\u2019s central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, has been eating into its reserves at a record pace in recent months. The central bank is selling dollars in an effort to prop up the value of the Chinese currency, the renminbi, which is under pressure to depreciate as China\u2019s growth prospects weaken.China\u2019s stock markets have also suffered from worries about whether the government will eventually allow the sale of a flood of additional shares. Government-backed groups have been buying shares since last summer in an unsuccessful effort to stem the markets\u2019 decline. That has raised the government\u2019s overall holdings at a time when many economic reformers had hoped the government would privatize more companies to increase efficiency.China\u2019s large private-equity funds also have a large and growing backlog of companies for which they would like to conduct initial public offerings, so as to exit their investments and pay back investors. \u201cThe exit numbers are too low compared to what has been invested,\u201d said David Brown, a PricewaterhouseCoopers partner who leads the consulting firm\u2019s greater China private equity group.Shanghai\u2019s main share index plunged in late trading on Tuesday to close down 6.4 percent, at a new one-year low. Japan\u2019s main share index closed 2.4 percent lower, while stocks in Hong Kong closed down about 2.5 percent.Investors in Asia were reacting in part to the sell-off in the United States on Monday, where the Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.3 percent and the broader Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-share index closed 1.6 percent lower.The renewed volatility in China\u2019s markets comes after a senior Chinese leader sought to reassure investors that the government would curb volatility.The FTSE 100 index in Britain was down 0.7 percent at midday, and the Euro Stoxx 50 index had fallen 0.3 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the Post Office Makes America Great", "Date": "2016-01-01", "News": "Supported byI WAS transported recently to a place that is as enchanting to me as any winter wonderland: my local post office.In line, I thought fondly of the year I came to this country from Turkey as an adult and discovered the magic of reliable mail service. Dependable infrastructure is magical not simply because it works, but also because it allows innovation to thrive, including much of the Internet-based economy that has grown in the past decade. You can\u2019t have Amazon or eBay without a reliable way to get things to people\u2019s homes.Of course, infrastructure is also boring, so we get used to it and forget what a gift it truly is. I never do, maybe because I discovered it so late.My first year in the United States was full of surprises. I remember trying to figure out if the 24-ounce glass of ice water the waitress placed in front of me was a pitcher, to be shared by the whole table. But where was the spout? I had expected some of what I encountered \u2014 I had seen enough movies, and came to this country expecting big cars and big houses and wide open spaces. I got used to gigantic glasses.But I didn\u2019t expect the post office.The first time I needed to mail something, I trekked over to my campus\u2019s post office, looking for the line to get my envelope weighed. The staff was used to befuddled international students like me, I suppose, and one clerk took my envelope without fuss, said \u201cfirst class letter,\u201d and took my change.Then I discovered some vending machines outside the office. People came and bought stamps. \u201cSo many people must be into stamp collecting,\u201d I thought to myself. Was that another weird American quirk? Otherwise, why would people waste money buying stamps in advance, without having their letters weighed?Something I take for granted now just didn\u2019t occur to me: There were standardized rates, and you could just slap a stamp on your letter, drop it in a mailbox, and it would go to its destination.I then encountered a visa service that asked me to mail in my passport. My precious, precious passport. With a self-addressed, stamped envelope for its return. I laughed at the audacity of the request. Despite being a broke student, I booked a plane trip. I couldn\u2019t envision putting my passport in the mail. I\u2019ve since learned that this is a common practice, and I\u2019ve even done it once or twice myself. But it still does not come easy to me.I noticed that Americans were a particularly patriotic bunch: So many of them had red flags on their mailboxes. Sometimes they would put those flags up. I presumed it was to celebrate national holidays I did not yet know about. But why did some people have their flags up while others did not? And why weren\u2019t they American flags anyway? As in Istanbul, where I grew up, I assumed patriotism had different interpretations and expressions.Yes, I was told, in the United States, mail gets picked up from your house, six days a week, free of charge.I told my friends in Turkey about all this. They shook their heads in disbelief, wondering how easily I had been recruited as a C.I.A. agent, saying implausibly flattering things about my new country. The United States in the world\u2019s imagination is a place of risk taking and ruthless competition, not one of reliable public services.I bit my tongue and did not tell my already suspicious friends that the country was also dotted with libraries that provided books to all patrons free of charge. They wouldn\u2019t believe me anyway since I hadn\u2019t believed it myself. My first time in a library in the United States was very brief: I walked in, looked around, and ran right back out in a panic, certain that I had accidentally used the wrong entrance. Surely, these open stacks full of books were reserved for staff only. I was used to libraries being rare, and their few books inaccessible. To this day, my heart races a bit in a library.Over the years, I\u2019ve come to appreciate the link between infrastructure, innovation \u2014 and even ruthless competition. Much of our modern economy thrives here because you can order things online and expect them to be delivered. There are major private delivery services, too, but the United States Postal Service is often better equipped to make it to certain destinations. In fact, Internet sellers, and even private carriers, often use the U.S.P.S. as their delivery mechanism to addresses outside densely populated cities.Infrastructure is often the least-appreciated part of what makes a country strong, and what makes innovation take flight. From my spot in line at the post office, I see a country that does both well; not a country that emphasizes one at the expense of the other.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Independent Watch Brands Most at Risk in the Downturn", "Date": "2016-01-17", "News": "Supported byOn the heels of two years of meager growth, Swiss watchmakers are bracing for more bad news once the export figures for 2015 are finalized this month. The industry is on track to record its first decline in exports since 2009. And pessimism among executives at the brands that dominate the business already is at a four-year high, according to a watch industry study by Deloitte published in September.At the 26th annual Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie, known as SIHH, which opens in Geneva this week, the focus is on small, independent watchmakers and how they will weather the downturn. Home to such prestige brands as Cartier, Panerai and IWC, the trade fair is for the first time opening the exclusive venue to nine independently owned watchmakers, in a space called the Carr\u00e9 des Horlogers. Now that Ralph Lauren Watches is no longer exhibiting at SIHH, the event has room to accommodate a group of artisans pioneering \u201cthe nouvelle horology,\u201d said Fabienne Lupo, president and managing director of the fair\u2019s organizer, the Fondation de la Haute Horlogerie.But, given the industry\u2019s slump, the timing is precarious.\u201cThe situation seems quite more difficult for small brands and suppliers,\u201d Jean-Daniel Pasche, president of the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry, said in an email.Lacking deep financial reserves, independent watchmakers and suppliers are the most vulnerable in a challenging economy, and job cuts are already being made. In November, for example, Gilbert Petit-Jean aux Brenets, a watchmaking atelier in Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland, laid off 60 of its 207 employees.\u201cFor a small company, it\u2019s very intense,\u201d said Jean-Marie Schaller, chief executive of Louis Moinet, based in St.-Blaise, Switzerland. \u201cYou have to work very hard to bring three new products in a year. If we don\u2019t do that, people forget about us.\u201dTo drum up excitement for the brand, Mr. Schaller has teamed up with a friend and fellow watchmaker, David Gouten, chief executive of the independent brand Manufacture Royale, based in Vallorbe, Switzerland, to show their watches in a shared space at the Beau-Rivage hotel in Geneva this week.\u201cWe\u2019ve created a concept called Crownology Lab,\u201d Mr. Gouten said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying not only to sell watches, but to create a story behind them.\u201dThe watchmakers, convinced that there is strength in numbers, have reserved three rooms to show their watches, including a common press room, where they will display their most unusual pieces. The goal, Mr. Gouten said, is to share their ideas about fine watchmaking in a relaxed atmosphere. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have fun, we cannot transmit that fun to our clients,\u201d he said.The fact that the market is getting tougher \u201cis not good news for independent watchmakers,\u201d said David Sadigh, founder and chief executive of the Digital Luxury Group, a market research firm in Geneva. \u201cGlobally speaking, even wealthy customers are becoming more rational during turbulent times, and we can expect them to be more likely to choose established brands with strong reselling value over more contemporary haute horlogerie brands.\u201dRetailers around the globe, under pressure by big brands \u2014 known to dictate how much merchandise a retailer must stock, how it is displayed and which other brands may or may not be shown alongside \u2014 often have to make similar choices.\u201cSmaller brands fight every day for distribution channels,\u201d said Karine Szegedi, head of fashion luxury at Deloitte in Switzerland and a co-author of the firm\u2019s recent industry study. \u201cThey fight for every centimeter in a shop.\u201d\u201cSince the survey, we had the terrorist attacks and the environment is worsening,\u201d Mr. Boudrand said. \u201cMore factors that make 2016 quite a difficult year.\u201dUnlike the behemoths that rule the watch business \u2014 brands like Cartier and Rolex that spend millions on global advertising, maintain a worldwide network of points of sale and introduce new models with fanfare and frequency \u2014 independents do not have perennial best sellers to fall back on.\u201cEven in crisis time, you have to come up with something new and show you\u2019re being creative, because that\u2019s why people are looking at you,\u201d said Ralph Aljord, vice president of Hysek, an independent Swiss brand based in Lussy-sur-Morges.From the nine independent makers exhibiting at SIHH for the first time, expect to see a focus on the experimental timepieces that initially earned them acclaim.Laurent Ferrier, who spent four decades at Patek Philippe before founding his namesake brand in 2012, will show several pieces from his Galet collection, including the Galet Traveller Globe Night Blue, which features a globe beneath a night sky. \u201cFor this piece, the sapphire is even more convex than on previous versions in order to give even more volume to the globe,\u201d Mr. Ferrier said in an email.Beyond the strength of their horological innovation, independent watchmakers pride themselves on making relatively few models, a strategy that some expect to buoy them in the coming year.\u201cFortunately, we have our card to play in relation to the extreme exclusivity of our products \u2014 less than 120 pieces per year,\u201d said Christophe Claret, a first-time SIHH exhibitor.Independents may also try to capitalize on the disenchantment that some retailers are beginning to feel with the larger brands.\u201cThe fact that major luxury conglomerates like Swatch, Richemont, LVMH, etc., have been aggressively opening their own monobrand boutiques in the last few years marks a great opportunity for creative independent watchmakers to strengthen their partnership with major multibrand retailers, who often see them as more reliable business partners,\u201d Mr. Sadigh said.For Mr. Gouten of Manufacture Royale, the search for retail accounts has taken him to Kuwait \u2014 and soon, perhaps, to Nigeria. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of friendship and finding the right retailers, where the boss is still behind the counter,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople who are dedicated and can fight for any brand because they own the trust of their clients.\u201dIn the end, Mr. Gouten and his fellow independent watchmakers are bound by a fierce determination to succeed on their own terms, regardless of the economic environment.\u201cI don\u2019t have to report to greedy people who tell me to sell more and more,\u201d Mr. Schaller of Louis Moinet said. \u201cPeople asked me if I would sell my watches for 20 cents on the dollar because they think we are on the brink of destruction. I said no, because I prefer to sell less.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Grade Presidents on the Economy, Look at Policies, Not Results", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewWhen unemployment falls, inflation is low and the economy grows briskly, we often give the president high marks for handling the economy. But is that really how the economic record of presidents should be judged? As we pick the next president, this question is useful to ponder, for it is central to how we understand our history. Yet most people take the wrong approach to answering it.The most common way to evaluate presidents is simply to look at how well the economy did while they were in office. If the nation did well, the president must have done a good job. If it struggled with rising unemployment, high inflation or slow growth, he must have failed.Yet this approach has three related problems. First, a president\u2019s policy decisions influence the economy long after he is gone. Second, every president inherits an economy from his predecessors, whose decisions cast a long shadow.Third, and most important, presidents are not omnipotent. Not only do they face an often uncooperative Congress, but the economy is also buffeted by forces beyond the control of any policy maker.The battle against inflation was finally won because of the tough monetary policies of the Fed chairman, Paul Volcker, appointed by Mr. Carter in 1979. Mr. Volcker vanquished high inflation, but the cost of this long-run success was short-term pain in the form of high interest rates and rising unemployment. By appointing the right person to head the nation\u2019s central bank, Mr. Carter sowed the seeds of his own defeat in 1980 to Ronald Reagan (who in turn reappointed Mr. Volcker in 1983).While Mr. Carter was dealt a bad hand, the opposite is the case for Bill Clinton, who is often portrayed as an economic miracle worker. Without doubt, his eight years in office were good ones, with strong growth and declining unemployment. Yet the main driving force of this prosperity was not government policy but rather accelerating productivity from new information technologies together with the dot-com bubble.Of course, the dot-com bubble eventually gave way to the dot-com bust, but Mr. Clinton\u2019s timing was fortunate. The Nasdaq composite index reached a high of over 5,000 in March 2000 and lost almost half its value before Mr. Clinton left office. The resulting recession, however, did not officially begin until March 2001, two months into George W. Bush\u2019s term. (Full disclosure: I was an economic adviser to Mr. Bush from 2003 to 2005 and will avoid commenting here on his record.)So if looking at contemporaneous economic conditions is not a reliable way to judge presidents, how should they be graded?Consider how you would assess a physician whom you could observe treating only a single patient. A terrible way to judge the doctor is by whether the patient lives or dies. After all, even the best physicians have patients who die when their illnesses are severe. And given the natural restorative powers of the human body, even a quack can have a patient who returns to good health.The best way to evaluate a physician is to determine whether state-of-the-art medical practices are followed. A doctor who prescribes the right antibiotics gets high marks, while one who prescribes snake oil gets a failing grade.Similarly, a better way to judge presidents is by the policies they pursue, not the outcomes over which they preside. This task is harder than merely looking at unemployment, inflation and the growth of gross domestic product. It requires having a view about what policies are best at fostering prosperity and acknowledging that the experts are often divided on that question.I have no idea whether Mr. Gordon\u2019s pessimism is justified. In light of economists\u2019 abysmal track record of long-term forecasting, all such prognostications should be taken with a shaker of salt.But if Mr. Gordon turns out to be right, future presidents will operate in a more difficult economic environment than many of their predecessors. Because the pace of scientific and technological advance has a life of its own, slow productivity growth may be a problem without a solution.Particularly in this environment, judging presidents based on outcomes rather than policies is an egregious error. We would end up blaming them for results over which they have little control. We would find ourselves disappointed in our leaders, even if they are doing the best they can. Instead of supporting sound policies, we might cast our votes out of a frustration that is not fully rational.N. GREGORY MANKIW is a professor of economics at Harvard.

{"Headline": "Did North Korea Detonate a Hydrogen Bomb? Here\u2019s What We Know", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byQ. and A.Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States are known to possess thermonuclear weapons. Whether the four other countries known to have atomic bombs \u2014 India, Israel, North Korea and Pakistan \u2014 also have hydrogen bombs is not certain.\u201cThis test is a measure for self-defense the D.P.R.K. has taken to firmly protect the sovereignty of the country and the vital right of the nation from the ever-growing nuclear threat and blackmail by the U.S.-led hostile forces and to reliably safeguard the peace on the Korean Peninsula and regional security,\u201d it said, referring to the North\u2019s formal name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.Still others suggest that the North genuinely fears an attack by the United States or South Korea and views the warnings as deterrence. Highlighting a perceived threat from abroad is also a favorite tool the North Korean government uses to ensure internal cohesion in an impoverished country that has experienced enormous privation, including devastating famine and continuing pervasive hunger.In 1998, when the North launched a Taepodong that flew over Japan, Japan temporarily cut off its contribution toward a North Korean energy project. But in July 2006, when the North launched another long-range missile, various countries began imposing sanctions, while the Security Council began adding to economic sanctions.In April 2009, when the North\u2019s efforts to launch a three-stage Unha-2 rocket failed, the Security Council said it would strengthen punitive measures. It did so after the North conducted a nuclear test the next month.In April 2012, the United States canceled planned food aid when the North tried to launch a more advanced missile, the Unha-3. That launching failed, but another in December succeeded in lifting a small satellite into orbit. The Security Council tightened sanctions yet again. After the North\u2019s nuclear test in February 2013, China, the North\u2019s longtime protector, participated in writing painful new sanctions aimed at North Korean banking, trade and travel.The policy is a response to the American belief that the United States had unwisely offered aid, often in the wake of Pyongyang\u2019s provocations, or struck agreements with the North on which the North later reneged. Strategic patience, in the words of Robert M. Gates, the former defense secretary, grew out of a desire not \u201cto buy the same horse twice.\u201dCritics say that while the policy has allowed the United States to weather multiple rounds of belligerence by Kim Jong-il and his son, Kim Jong-un, without making concessions, it has done little to curb the development of North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program.The resolutions have also imposed embargoes on large-scale arms, weapons-related research and development materials, and luxury goods; banned many types of financial transactions including transfers of cash; placed new restrictions on diplomats; and created monitoring mechanisms for enforcement.Nothing in the American sanctions prohibits American travel to North Korea or the export of food and other types of humanitarian aid, although there are some restrictions.The sanctions leave room for considerable trade in many types of goods and services. China, which supplies much of North Korea\u2019s basic needs, is not in any violation of the United Nations resolutions.From 1998 to 2008, the South pursued a \u201csunshine policy\u201d of reconciliation and economic cooperation that sent billions of dollars in business investments, goods and humanitarian aid to the North. Ms. Park\u2019s immediate predecessor, Lee Myung-bak, said the North would need to give up its nuclear weapons to receive any more aid. But he was criticized for what many saw as a weak response after the North shelled a South Korean island in 2010, killing four people.China helped write and backed the most recent round of United Nations sanctions, but it has been loath to push the North too hard. Its patience with the North may be running out, but even China may have only limited information about the machinations within the Pyongyang government.By the 1980s, American intelligence satellites were watching the nuclear complex at Yongbyon come together. Relations between the United States and the North grew especially tense over the issue in 1994, and some in the White House feared a war could break out. A pact was eventually hammered out that year, the Agreed Framework, but it fell apart in 2002, during the George W. Bush administration, partly over allegations the North was cheating on its agreements and developing another path to a bomb. In 2006, the North conducted its first nuclear test, a partial fizzle. But the subsequent tests were more successful.Advertisement"}

The Shabab overran the base, held it for several hours and made off with sensitive communications equipment, artillery pieces that can fire 10 miles and several American-made armored Humvees.The attack could mark a turning point for the Shabab, one of Africa\u2019s most violent militant groups. In recent years, the Shabab have lost much of their territory, reduced to small bands of famished fighters creeping around Somalia\u2019s rural areas and attacking soft targets in Kenya, including a university and a mall.Now, it seems, they are training their sights on the hardest targets out there \u2014 military bases. In the past months, Shabab fighters have staged assaults against Ethiopian, Ugandan and Burundian troops, all members of a relatively loosely organized African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia. They have killed scores of soldiers and stolen their arsenals. Their propaganda videos show alarming amounts of guns, vehicles and overflowing buckets of bullets now in their hands.The Shabab may be hatching a renewed bid to take over Somalia, which remains in varying degrees of turmoil, depending on the area, with the national government widely reviled as corrupt and weak, and small, clan-based city-states popping up across the country.Or something else may be driving the Shabab\u2019s hunger for weapons, something the West is particularly worried about.In recent months, the Islamic State has planted its black flag in Somalia\u2019s soil. The group is drawing a small trickle of disgruntled Shabab defectors who believe that the Shabab should ditch its longstanding relationship with Al Qaeda and join the world\u2019s leading brand of militant Islam.Already, Shabab and Islamic State fighters have clashed in northern and central Somalia, raising fears that some areas of Somalia could slide into an intra-Islamist free-for-all, like in Syria.\u201cThe Shabab are now mimicking the Islamic State,\u201d said Rashid Abdi, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, which studies conflicts worldwide. \u201cThey are trying to regain public support by saying: \u2018We\u2019re not just chickens who go for soft targets. We\u2019re men who go after military bases.\u201d\u2019Kenya has fought skirmishes with Somali bandits along its borders for years, but it has never lost a hundred soldiers in one battle, officials and analysts say. In past months, opposition politicians urged the government to rethink its Somalia strategy. Now even members of the governing coalition, like Mr. Hassan, are beginning to call for an orderly withdrawal.\u201cWe should spend another year or two training as many Somalis as we can and then get out,\u201d he said.Boniface Mwangi, one of Kenya\u2019s leading artist-activists, said he was extremely frustrated that the government has refused to disclose any casualty figures. \u201cWhy is the government hiding the truth?\u201d he asked.Mr. Mwangi also criticized President Uhuru Kenyatta for attending political rallies in the Mombasa area this past week. \u201cIt\u2019s a national shame that our president is busy politicking while the dead bodies are coming home,\u201d he said.According to several analysts, the Kenyans at the El-Adde base, located about 50 miles from the Kenyan border, were extremely vulnerable. They were in hostile territory, surrounded by members of a clan deeply opposed to Kenya\u2019s military presence. Somali officials said the company of Kenyan soldiers, estimated to be about 150, had been there only two weeks, with few local sources of information.Several analysts said the Kenyans had ventured out of their comfort zone along the coast, where the bulk of Kenyan troops are based, pushing deeper into the Somali hinterland because Ethiopia was preparing its own offensive. Though the two nations are allies on paper, Kenya and Ethiopia often do not coordinate their military operations and they have backed different factions of Somalis in a covert contest for influence.There have been reports that small bands of Kenyan soldiers fled into the desert and survived the attack, but so far only four from the El-Adde base \u2014 all of them wounded \u2014 have made it back to Nairobi, Kenya\u2019s capital. The rest are dead, missing or captured.\u201cI have a wife and two children back home,\u201d said one Kenyan prisoner of war in a recording that the Shabab released. \u201cOn 15 January, 2016, the camp was raided by the Al Shabab, whereby they overpowered us.\u201dBefore the recording cut out, the soldier said: \u201cMost of our friends were killed.\u201dMohamed Ibrahim contributed reporting from Mogadishu, Somalia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Former Mexican Governor Is Arrested, but Not by His Own Country", "Date": "2016-01-21", "News": "Supported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 The anticorruption police swooped in on Humberto Moreira, a former Mexican governor notorious for multiplying his state\u2019s debt by 100 times in six years. The accusations were severe: among them, money laundering and misuse of public funds.Bail was denied.But there was an asterisk to the news that Mr. Moreira might be held accountable for how he spent the torrent of borrowed money that flowed into his state, Coahuila. He was arrested last Friday at the international airport in Madrid, not in Mexico, and it was the Spanish police who succeeded in building a case against him after Mexico\u2019s attorney general said there was no evidence to charge him.In Mexico, the news was greeted with a mixture of approval and shame. Although diminished by disgrace, Mr. Moreira had remained untouchable, a political ally of President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto who had helped build Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s 2012 candidacy.His arrest in Spain only served to underscore the weakness of Mexico\u2019s institutions when it comes to confronting corruption among the political class.\u201cMoreira is the prototype and synonym of corruption in Mexico,\u201d Juan E. Pardinas, director of the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness, said on Tuesday. \u201cHe is also the prototype of impunity. One of the big challenges is to build a rule of law and to transform the rule of impunity so the 13th- or 14th-largest economy in the world doesn\u2019t have to outsource to other countries the prosecution of these prototypes.\u201dMr. Moreira, 49, faces a hearing in Spain\u2019s National Court on Friday before the judge in charge of the investigation, Santiago Pedraz, who is expected to decide whether to release him from jail to await trial.Whether intentionally or not, the Spanish National Police\u2019s announcement of Mr. Moreira\u2019s arrest on Twitter seemed to taunt Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto. The announcement concluded, \u201c#missionaccomplished,\u201d the same phrase the Mexican president had proudly used to break the news of Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s arrest.The prospect of a long trial in Spain that opens up Mr. Moreira\u2019s finances to scrutiny could refocus public attention here on official corruption, an issue that has dogged the government since scandals in late 2014 over luxury homes that Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s wife and finance minister bought from a government contractor.Spanish prosecutors say that Mr. Moreira opened at least three bank accounts in Spain that received transfers of almost 200,000 euros, or $217,000, from two Mexican companies. Along with records of the transfers, the evidence against Mr. Moreira includes police wiretaps, according to court documents.At the first hearing after his arrest, Mr. Moreira said that the businesses were his and that the money had gone toward living expenses, court records show. Mr. Moreira rented an upscale property in 2013 in a suburb of Barcelona while studying for a master\u2019s degree there.Until then, Mr. Moreira had spent his career in government. In 2005, when he became governor of Coahuila, on the Texas border, he embarked on ambitious spending programs. They were unsustainable, said Javier Garza, a journalist in Torre\u00f3n, a city in Coahuila, but \u201cthey contributed to creating a network of political patronage.\u201dMr. Moreira left office to become the president of the Institutional Revolutionary Party early in 2011, uniting the party, known as the P.R.I., behind Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto as its presidential candidate.Coahuila borrowed most heavily in 2010, a year when more than a third of Mexico\u2019s states elected new governors. \u201cThe next year, he was elected president of the P.R.I.,\u201d Mr. Garza said. \u201cHe was the only candidate. He didn\u2019t get there without support.\u201d Although the state hid the debt until after Mr. Moreira left office and evidence emerged that documents had been falsified to show approval from the Coahuila State Congress for the loans, prosecutors cleared Mr. Moreira just before Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto took office.In June, the United States attorney\u2019s office in San Antonio unsealed a plea-bargain agreement with a Coahuila businessman, Rolando Gonz\u00e1lez Trevi\u00f1o. He said that he had sold a stake in a chain of local radio stations to Mr. Moreira for $1.84 million and that the money had been wired to accounts in Texas. The plea agreement alleged that a co-conspirator, referred to as CC1, who was the governor of Coahuila had stolen \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of dollars from the state.Kent A. Schaffer, Mr. Moreira\u2019s lawyer in Houston, said this week that those allegations were false. \u201cThese are people who in large part, to extricate themselves from their own legal problems, claim to be working at the behest of the governor,\u201d he said. The charges in Spain, he added, had come as a surprise.Elisabeth Malkin reported from Mexico City, and Raphael Minder from Madrid. Susan Beachy contributed research from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Taiwan Election Nears, Mainland Media Plays Down Politics", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported bySinosphereInstead, reports in the state-run news media and even in somewhat freer online discussion forums are riddled with euphemisms: \u201cThe big election.\u201d \u201cThe leader\u2019s election.\u201d \u201cThe Taiwan-area election.\u201dWhere the phrase \u201cpresidential election\u201d does appear, it is invariably encased in quotation marks, as if it were not quite legitimate.China and Taiwan have been estranged since Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s Nationalists retreated to the island after their defeat in the Chinese civil war in 1949 to Mao Zedong\u2019s Communists. Beijing continues to regard Taiwan as a province awaiting reunification with the mainland and has threatened force should the island move toward formal independence.Many people in Taiwan suffer from \u201celection syndrome,\u201d the article said, an obsession with politics that can result in \u201csleeplessness, headaches, faintness, loss of appetite, anger and violent tendencies.\u201dWhile deploring that syndrome, the article also paradoxically deplored what it perceived as its decline, saying that it was evidence that voters in Taiwan had grown bored with the process.Taiwan has held direct elections for its president for two decades now, and the system of choosing a leader has become both more pluralistic and more institutionalized.\u201cTaiwan hasn\u2019t had a cold winter,\u201d the People\u2019s Daily article said. \u201cBut from the start, the election has been three feet deep in snow. The incidence of \u2018election syndrome\u2019 has declined to dust, but the air is full of a feeling that \u2018I\u2019m so bored I can\u2019t even fall in love.\u2019 \u201dThe paper noted that the elections this year featured a wide variety of candidates but hinted that this was a formula for instability.\u201cThe era of \u2018taking turns occupying the homestead\u2019 is ending, and an era of \u2018warlords chasing the deer\u2019 is emerging,\u201d it said. \u201cWhat will Taiwan\u2019s future be like?\u201dIn the past, elections in Taiwan have mostly been a two-way race between the long-dominant Kuomintang, or Nationalist Party, with its roots in the Chinese mainland, and the Democratic Progressive Party, which is largely based in native Taiwanese, young or pro-independence voters.The presidential candidate of the Democratic Progressive Party, Tsai Ing-wen, is widely favored to win. If she does, she will make history as the first woman to be elected leader in the Chinese-speaking world.\u201cWe expect ever-improving development between the two sides after 2016 and that compatriots from both sides will join hands to work for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,\u201d the five state-sanctioned student groups from four major universities in Beijing and Nanjing declared in a joint statement.All candidates should \u201cmaintain stability\u201d in the China-Taiwan relationship, \u201csupport exchanges between the youth of both sides\u201d and \u201csupport the prosperity of the youth and intergenerational justice,\u201d they said.In \u201cMeet the Unknown Taiwan,\u201d a heavily promoted series of articles on Sina.com, China\u2019s biggest news portal, the focus was largely on lifestyle.The Chinese state news media regularly portrays Taiwan as \u201ccharmingly rustic, so it could be appreciated, but also condescended to,\u201d Mr. Harrison said.\u201cTaiwan is charming and holds onto Chinese values that we have lost in our thrusting upwards towards the commanding heights of global domination,\u201d the narrative runs, he said. This approach avoids difficult questions of identity, he added.Taiwan is a complicated society in which aboriginal peoples, the descendants of migrants from southern China, a prosperous history as a Japanese colony and the arrivals from mainland China after 1949 all serve as major influences. But the mainland news media rarely acknowledges that, Mr. Harrison said.\u201cIt\u2019s a complex ideological accommodation\u201d in which the state media is \u201cengaging closely,\u201d he said, \u201cespecially in an era of mass Chinese tourism to Taiwan, but finding a way of making Taiwan ideologically safe. So all the really hard questions about identity and democracy are simply avoided.\u201dVanessa Piao contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "North Korea Is Newest Frontier for a Daredevil Investor", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported byNow, he is betting on North Korea.James Passin, a hedge fund manager at Firebird Management, believes the nuclear-armed country sits on as much as a billion barrels of crude \u2014 enough to make it as big a producer as Oklahoma. If the oil exists, he wants to help unlock it.\u201cYou have a country with 25 million people \u2014 young, highly disciplined, literate \u2014 and a strong military-industrial complex,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that the early investors will be rewarded with potential for massive appreciation.\u201dThe risks of sinking cash \u2014 even just $7 million or so of Firebird\u2019s $700 million in assets \u2014 into a neo-Stalinist state with labor camps and virtually no private property are obvious. The geopolitical volatility was on full display last week, as North Korea claimed that it had tested a hydrogen bomb. And Mr. Passin is treading on murky investment territory, given the American sanctions against the country.His investors have experienced the wild rides that come with such frontier markets. Two of his funds are being liquidated after deep losses, including on banking in Iraq, gold in Armenia and oil and gas in Kenya.But Mr. Passin isn\u2019t deterred. \u201cI see opportunities when other people are afraid,\u201d he said.Mr. Passin, 44, studied philosophy at St. John\u2019s College in Maryland. He was inspired to enter finance, he said, in part by the story of Thales, a philosopher in ancient Greece who got rich by monopolizing olive presses before a bumper harvest he had foreseen in the stars.After graduating, Mr. Passin began his career as an editor at Taipan, a financial newsletter in Baltimore, recommending obscure foreign stocks.Peter Schiff, the chief of Euro Pacific Capital in Connecticut, met Mr. Passin in his newsletter days and later invested, on his advice, in Hurricane Hydrocarbons, an oil company in Kazakhstan, buying shares for as little as 25 cents apiece. Eventually, the company was sold at $55 a share, Mr. Schiff recalled.\u201cI\u2019ve bought some stocks from him that have gone to zero,\u201d Mr. Schiff said. \u201cBut this was such a big winner.\u201dIn 1999, Mr. Passin joined the New York-based Firebird, becoming one of several fund managers at the firm.\u201cHe took a very different path than your typical hedge fund manager,\u201d Mr. Schiff added. \u201cHe\u2019s not a Harvard M.B.A., he didn\u2019t work at Goldman Sachs, he didn\u2019t do a two-year internship \u2014 he\u2019s just a smart guy.\u201dContrarian instincts have led Mr. Passin to out-of-the-way markets like Chechnya, Congo and Somalia.Joseph Naemi, one of Mr. Passin\u2019s longtime business partners, recalled joining him in a brash attempt in 2002 to buy Uzbekistan\u2019s national oil company, Uzbekneftegaz. They had a meeting with a dozen Uzbek government officials, and Mr. Passin\u2019s pitch was simple: He was there to write a check for $600 million to $700 million to buy the entire company. But the country did not go for the proposal.\u201cThe skeptical look around the boardroom was actually hilarious,\u201d Mr. Naemi wrote in an email.In 2006, Mr. Passin toured Mongolia and zeroed in on its stock exchange. It was \u201cjust a room with some computers,\u201d Mr. Passin recalled.He said he snapped up shares in \u201canything that was listed.\u201d By 2011, the country\u2019s economy was clocking one of the fastest growth rates in the world \u2014 17 percent a year \u2014 as vast troves of minerals were discovered under the steppes.Since then, Mongolia\u2019s bull market has crashed, Mr. Passin said, and the economy has slowed. But he is redoubling his efforts there, aiming to construct a set of world-class Mongolian corporations \u2014 a project he has broadly likened to the empire-building of Genghis Khan.Mr. Passin is also wagering on distressed debt in the South Pacific. Firebird has been suing the tiny, destitute island nation of Nauru for repayment on about $24 million of defaulted government-backed bonds, equal to about one-sixth of the country\u2019s gross domestic product.Firebird, which bought the bonds from the original creditors at a fraction of their face value, stands to make money if it wins. The hedge fund has been fighting in Australian courts to garnish Nauru\u2019s state bank accounts \u2014 and briefly succeeded in freezing the accounts.The tactics are similar to those used by larger, more prominent firms like Elliott Management, run by the billionaire investor Paul E. Singer, who has sued Argentina over debt repayment.In December, Australia\u2019s highest court denied Firebird access to Nauru\u2019s state bank accounts. But Mr. Passin might still try to claim any wealth the eight-square-mile coral atoll holds outside Australia.\u201cWe will go to every corner of the world to find assets,\u201d he said.Mr. Passin\u2019s North Korean investments may be his most contentious.Firebird owns nearly half of a Mongolian company, HBOil, that entered a joint venture with the government of Kim Jong-un in 2013. The partnership gave the small company expansive rights to overhaul North Korea\u2019s primitive energy sector by opening 100 gas stations, restarting a derelict refinery and drilling for oil and gas.The projects have yet to materialize. Companies have been searching for oil and gas there since the 1980s, and it remains unclear whether the country has any significant quantities.Mr. Naemi, who is advising HBOil, believes there are deep reserves of oil \u2014 perhaps as much as a billion recoverable barrels on land. But the current low price of oil means that if it exists, and can be extracted, it still might not be profitable.Mr. Passin\u2019s investment also raises legal questions. Alexandra L\u00f3pez-Casero, a sanctions lawyer at the Boston-based law firm Nixon Peabody, said the investment might violate American sanctions against North Korea absent a license from the Treasury Department in Washington. Other experts disagree, noting that the United States has not issued a blanket prohibition on investing in the North.Mr. Passin said that Firebird had neither sought such a license nor needed one. He added that an expert had reviewed the venture for him and concluded that it was legal.Some analysts worry that any oil exploitation would fortify Mr. Kim and others in the country\u2019s ruling elite. \u201cThe security risk is not small, as the oil business in D.P.R.K. is exclusively handled by the Communist Party and the military,\u201d said Keun-Wook Paik, an expert on North Korean oil at the research institution Chatham House, using the abbreviation for the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, the country\u2019s official name. \u201cIt will be a kind of Pandora box opening.\u201dMr. Passin dismisses such concerns.He said business with North Korea would both benefit ordinary people and encourage the totalitarian state apparatus to become \u201cmore open and less harsh.\u201d Besides, he argued, if the West avoided commerce with unsavory nations, much of the world would be off limits.\u201cI believe there are companies that will emerge out of the D.P.R.K. that will be of lasting importance,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will survive for centuries.\u201dRick Gladstone contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Biden Jr. during President Obama\u2019s first term. \u201cBut when you consider the breadth of the tax avoidance industry, much of which is about sheltering income from exposure to any tax liability at all, it\u2019s just a drop in the bucket.\u201dEven with the higher tax rates in 2013, the top 400 highest-earning taxpayers, who took home an average of about $265 million that year, paid a significantly lower share of their reported income in taxes than those just below them. For example, the top 1 percent of earners \u2014 whose average income was $1.24 million \u2014 paid roughly 27 percent of their income in taxes.Moreover, when payroll taxes are taken into account, many people with much lower incomes, in the range of $150,000 to $200,000, pay effective tax rates that are similar to those imposed on the rich.Essentially, the rich have benefited from two crucial developments over the last few decades: The first was a declining tax rate on investment income, which fell in the late 1990s under pressure from a Republican Congress after President Bill Clinton raised income tax rates in 1993. It fell even further under President George W. Bush in the early 2000s, who cut both ordinary income rates and investment rates.(Both went back up with the 2013 tax increase, though the rate on investment income remains lower than in the early 1990s.)Supporters of keeping tax rates on capital gains and dividends lower than ordinary income tax rates say there are good reasons for doing this. They note that the policy helps limit double taxation of corporate income and argue that it fosters innovation by encouraging greater investment and risk-taking.But because the ultrawealthy derive an outsize portion of their income from investments, these tax cuts disproportionately benefited them.The tax cuts on investment income then had a second important effect: They brought back from an earlier era the incentive for the ultrawealthy, working in tandem with highly sophisticated tax advisers, to game the tax system by transforming ordinary income into investment income, which is now taxed at about half the top rate.In recent years, however, it has become common for private equity fund managers to \u201cwaive\u201d a substantial portion of their management-fee income and instead receive an even greater portion of their income as a share of profits from their funds, which are taxed at a lower rate. (The I.R.S. has recently proposed rules that would limit this practice.)Historical experience has shown that partly as a result of this gaming, the ultrawealthy tend to whittle down the rates they actually pay over time for any given level of official tax rates. By contrast, the average rates for most other taxpayers tend to remain relatively stable when tax laws do not change.Between 2004 and 2012, official income tax rates on regular income and investment income did not budge for affluent or wealthy taxpayers.But during that time, thanks in part to techniques like fee waivers, the top 400 income earners went from paying an average rate of 18.2 percent to an average rate of 16.7 percent. For the top 1 percent of earners, excluding the wealthiest top one-tenth of 1 percent, rates rose ever so slightly, to 24.1 percent from 23.9 percent.This historical evidence suggests that the ultrawealthy will soon find ways to limit the impact of the recent rate increases under President Obama. For example, many wealthy taxpayers already exploit tax strategies, like keeping income in offshore entities, that allow them to defer taxes on investment income for years, allowing the money to compound on a tax-free basis.\u201cThe goal of the tax avoidance industry is to shelter income from exposure to any tax liability at all,\u201d Mr. Bernstein said. \u201cI guarantee you they\u2019re figuring out a workaround to this higher gains rate as we speak.\u201dIndeed, many ultrawealthy taxpayers can be expected to explore additional strategies for deferring investment income in response to the higher tax rates, according to Victor Fleischer, an expert on tax law at the University of San Diego. (He noted that the tax avoidance caused by deferrals wouldn\u2019t show up in I.R.S. data because the income isn\u2019t recorded until it is taxed years after the fact.)The Republican leadership in Congress, which has influence over the I.R.S. budget, has given little indication that it is open to reversing this trend.In the end, the ultimate arbiter of the fate of the Obama tax increases is likely to be his successor. Every leading Republican presidential candidate has proposed reducing some or all of the rates Congress agreed to raise on the wealthy in 2012, which were part of a deal to avoid even more extensive tax increases. Under any of those proposals, taxes on the rich would probably fall below even their recent lows.By contrast, the leading Democratic candidates have called for preserving or increasing those rates. If they were to raise taxes further on investment income, it could have the dual effect of both raising rates on the wealthy and making certain tax avoidance strategies less lucrative.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Unemployed, Myanmar\u2019s Elephants Grow Antsy, and Heavier", "Date": "2016-01-30", "News": "Supported byWA KALU PU, Myanmar \u2014 Dragging giant tree trunks up and down the steep hillsides of sweltering jungles is a tough job. But there is something worse, say owners of Myanmar\u2019s logging elephants: having no job at all.Shrinking forests and a law enacted three years ago that prohibits the export of raw timber have saddled Myanmar with an elephant unemployment crisis. Hundreds of elephants have been thrown out of work, and many are not handling it well.\u201cThey become angry a lot more easily,\u201d U Chit Sein, 64, whose eight logging elephants now work only a few days a month. \u201cThere is no work, so they are getting fat. And all the males want to do is have sex all the time.\u201dElephants hold an almost mystical place in Myanmar, home to the world\u2019s largest captive elephant population. For hundreds of years, they helped extract precious teak and hardwoods from jungles that even modern machinery still cannot penetrate.8 PhotosNow the future of the 5,500 or so wrinkled pachyderms in captivity is a major preoccupation for the government officials who oversee them.\u201cUnemployment is really hard to handle,\u201d said U Saw Tha Pyae, whose six elephants have been jobless for the past two years. \u201cThere is no logging because there are no more trees.\u201dMyanmar\u2019s leading elephant expert, Daw Khyne U Mar, estimates that there are now 2,500 jobless elephants, many of them here in the jungles of eastern Myanmar, about two and a half hours from the Thai border. That number would put the elephant unemployment rate at around 40 percent, compared with about 4 percent for Myanmar\u2019s people.\u201cMost of these elephants don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Ms. Khyne U Mar said. \u201cThe owners have a great burden. It\u2019s expensive to keep them.\u201dAdult elephants, which each weigh about 10,000 pounds, eat 400 pounds of food a day and, other than circuses and logging, have limited job opportunities.Some logging elephants live much longer. \u201cYou see working elephants living into their 50s and 60s quite regularly,\u201d said Joshua Plotnik, an elephant behavior specialist based in Thailand. \u201cIt all comes down to nutrition and proper care.\u201dElephants have been known to display a sense of purpose in their work, experts say, and the loss of a job can be demoralizing.For most people in Myanmar, things are looking up. The economy is growing rapidly and citizens are enjoying newfound freedoms after years of brutal dictatorship. But the dawn of democracy here has meant a reversal of fortune for elephants. In decades past, when Myanmar\u2019s population suffered under dictatorship, life was arguably much less harsh for elephants.The military governments adhered to a strict labor code for elephants drawn up in British colonial times: eight-hour work days and five-day weeks, retirement at 55, mandatory maternity leave, summer vacations and good medical care. There are still elephant maternity camps and retirement communities run by the government. In a country where the most basic social protections were absent during the years of dictatorship, elephant labor laws were largely respected, partly because an overworked elephant is a very dangerous animal, say those who handle them.Georgia Mason, a co-author of the 2008 study, said that obesity seemed to be a major factor in the lower life expectancy of zoo elephants. A subsequent study showed that elephant babies born in zoos were 15 percent heavier than those born in logging camps, she said.With the number of jobless elephants likely to increase as forests shrink and the logging industry wanes, the government is exploring the possibility of releasing some of the elephants into the wild.Simon Hedges, the elephant coordinator at the Wildlife Conservation Society, an animal protection organization based in the United States, said this was an \u201cexciting opportunity.\u201d But he and others cautioned that concerns needed to be addressed about captive elephants spreading diseases to wild populations and raiding villages for food.\u201cSome of the more radical organizations believe that you can let all of the captive elephants go in the wild \u2014 that\u2019s easier said than done,\u201d said Mr. Hedges, who last year in Myanmar took part in a meeting, hosted by the Burmese government, on the future of elephants. \u201cElephants are big, dangerous, scary animals. It\u2019s hard to keep them away from crops.\u201dElephant owners regularly release their animals into the jungles to forage and are often forced to indemnify villagers when crops are devoured.\u201cThere is not much space left in the jungles for them,\u201d said Mr. Chit Sein, the elephant owner.Forest cover in Myanmar has decreased by 42 percent since 1990, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.As they await a solution, elephant owners are coping with joblessness in various ways.Some have sold their charges to businessmen in Thailand, where they will be deployed in the Thai tourism industry, including in elephant shows and jungle treks. Exporting elephants to Thailand is technically illegal without official permission but elephant owners say it appears to be happening with greater frequency.But other owners say they cannot bear the thought of selling their elephants.\u201cI don\u2019t know what I will do with my elephants,\u201d said Mr. Saw Tha Pyae, who like many elephant owners inherited the beasts from his parents. \u201cBut I will never sell them, never! I love them so much!\u201dSaw Nang contributed reporting from Taungoo and Myawaddy, Myanmar.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Video Review: The New XF, a Jaguar Light on Its Feet", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Supported byDrivenBEFORE 2008, Jaguars with more than two doors had distinct designs as British as Highclere Castle. Then the XF arrived. Crisp and contemporary, it quickly became Jaguar\u2019s best-selling car. Now, for its second generation, it has taken the approach that less is more.On average, it is 200 pounds lighter. The old Ford-sourced steel platform is out, replaced by a bonded and riveted aluminum platform under the body drawn up by the designer Ian Callum. The XF appears quietly urbane, less emotional by a whisker this time around. It\u2019s a touch lower and shorter, though the wheelbase is stretched by a couple of inches. The weight distribution is 50/50.Pushing the pulsating start button summons the cylindrical 8-speed transmission controller from the console, while air vents yawn open. It\u2019s a lot of drama, offering a hint to the fun ahead. The R model tested surges with deep rich torque from rest to 60 miles an hour in just over six seconds with its 340-horsepower, three-liter supercharged V6. If that disheartens, move up to the S model for 380 horses.I tested a rear-drive car, though all-wheel drive is available. Go with premapped performance settings or choose from a host of steering, throttle, transmission and suspension settings.The XF will put no one to sleep, but optional tech includes a driver drowsiness alert system. Also on the list are semiautonomous parking, auto braking and adaptive cruise control.Together with GPS and cameras that read speed limit signs, the Jaguar can adjust its speed automatically, making it speed-trap resistant. Low Friction Launch, a kind of launch control for icy surfaces, automatically applies the throttle at low speed, sending power only to drive wheels with traction. This allows the driver to concentrate on steering.Like the exterior, the cockpit design doesn\u2019t shout as it subtly wraps around the occupants. Bigger drivers will like the seat bolstering, though smaller ones might rattle around during hard shenanigans. A laser projection head-up display is noticeably crisp. My lightly optioned car had an eight-inch interface screen; an optional setup buys a larger touch screen and replaces the gauges with a configurable display similar to Audi\u2019s Virtual Cockpit. Passengers will appreciate the supportive rear seat that is much roomier than before.Not all is crumpets and clotted cream here. Even with 40/20/40 folding seat backs, the trunk is small for a car this size. I\u2019ll suggest that the engineers swap the hard-to-reach window switches with the seat memory buttons. And while performance enthusiasts will embrace the pedal setup, others might find it too easy to apply both brake and throttle together.Jaguar is pushing the value proposition. Starting at $52,895, my test car stickered for $63,935. Sensitive about reliability? A five-year, 60,000-mile warranty includes scheduled maintenance. But as always, it\u2019s the performance and emotion that will sell this Jaguar. The lighter, sharper XF is much more competitive with the heavyweights in this class.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Founders Fund Leads a Financing Round for Nubank, a Brazilian Start-Up", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The billionaire and prominent Silicon Valley financier Peter Thiel has returned to investing in Brazil, even as the country remains mired in recession and faces almost weekly political upheavals.A Nubank spokeswoman, Mariana Netto, responded to an email inquiry seeking information on the new financing and a request for an interview with a company executive by saying, \u201cAt the moment, we do not have any information.\u201dThe new investment values Nubank at approximately $500 million, according to two individuals, significant for a company less than three years old.The Founders Fund backing of Nubank appears to be its first investment in Brazil and South America, at least based on disclosed and known investments. The firm, just over 10 years old, raised its first fund back in 2005.On the surface, backing Nubank may seem to be a counterintuitive move as many institutional investors have fled Latin America\u2019s largest economy in recent years, and its gross domestic product has decreased for three straight quarters.Mr. Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook, has a reputation for going against the grain. But Founders Funds notes on its website that being contrarian \u201cdoes not mean simply doing the opposite of what the majority does.\u201d Rather, the company says, \u201cThe most contrarian thing to do is to think independently.\u201d Taking on Brazil\u2019s financial establishment is certainly that.They have been neither vulnerable to the moribund economy the rest of the country has grappled with over the last several years nor the policies enacted by leftist governments that have led the country since 2003. That is partly because Brazil has long had extremely high interest rates. Its current benchmark Selic rate stands at 14.25 percent.The current deepening recession and rising inflation are increasing pressure on the Central Bank to raise the rate even further. While the Central Bank kept the rate unchanged at its last meeting, economists expect an increase when it meets later this month and continued pressure for more increases throughout this year. That is in part because, \u201cInflation will remain a key macro issue in 2016,\u201d according to a research note published on Dec. 30 by Alberto Ramos, Head of Latin America Economic Research for Goldman Sachs.That also means higher credit card interest rates. Many Brazilians already pay annual rates as high as 415.3 percent as of the end of November, up from 327.8 percent one year earlier, according to Central Bank data. Average annual credit card interest rates in Brazil have risen in 10 of the last 11 months, reaching 99 percent in November, up significantly from 74.5 percent in the same month in 2014, according to that same Central Bank report.In contrast, Nubank has not changed its 7.75 monthly interest rate in over a year. It also hopes that being digital both reduces overhead and results in better customer service. Banks, after telecommunications companies, usually generate the most customer complaints in Brazil. That has helped its popularity here grow.More than one million Brazilians have applied for the card and approximately 300,000 are on a waiting list while their credit history is examined, Nubank said in the fourth quarter of last year.An earlier version of this article misstated the role of Peter Thiel at PayPal. He was a co-founder, not the founder.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Transcript of Republican Presidential Debate", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byFollowing is a transcript of the main Republican presidential debate, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.NEIL CAVUTO: It is 9:00 p.m. here at the North Charleston Coliseum and Performing Arts Center in South Carolina. Welcome to the sixth Republican presidential debate of the 2016 campaign, here on the Fox Business Network.I\u2019m Neil Cavuto, alongside my friend and co-moderator Maria Bartiromo.MARIA BARTIROMO: Tonight we are working with Facebook to ask the candidates the questions voters want answered. And according to Facebook, the U.S. election has dominated the global conversation, with 131 million people talking about the 2016 race. That makes it the number one issue talked about on Facebook last year worldwide.CAVUTO: Now, the seven candidates on the stage tonight were selected based on their standing in six national polls, as well as polls in the early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire, those standings determining the position on the stage of the candidates tonight. And here they are.Businessman Donald Trump.(APPLAUSE)Texas senator Ted Cruz.(APPLAUSE)Florida senator Marco Rubio.(APPLAUSE)Neurosurgeon Ben Carson.(APPLAUSE)New Jersey governor Chris Christie.(APPLAUSE)Former Florida governor Jeb Bush.And Ohio governor John Kasich.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Tonight\u2019s rules are simple: up to 90 seconds for each answer, one minute for each follow-up response. And if a candidate goes over the allotted time, you\u2019ll hear this.(BELL RINGS) So let\u2019s get started. Candidates, jobs and growth \u2014 two of the biggest issues facing the country right now. In his State of the Union address earlier this week, the president said, quote, \u201cwe have the strongest, most durable economy in the world.\u201dAnd according to our Facebook research, jobs is one of the biggest issues resonating across the country, including here in South Carolina. The president is touting 14 million new jobs and an unemployment rate cut in half.The president said that anyone who claims America\u2019s economy is in decline is peddling fiction. Senator Cruz, what do you see that he doesn\u2019t?CRUZ: Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.Let me start \u2014 I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something. Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.In that State of the Union, President Obama didn\u2019t so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran. President Obama\u2019s preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei. And I\u2019ll tell you, it was heartbreaking.But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage. (APPLAUSE)And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)Now, on to your substantive question. The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs. And you know, he\u2019s right. If you\u2019re a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great. The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama. But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977. Median wages have stagnated. And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Governor Kasich, we are not even two weeks into this stock trading year, but (inaudible) investors already lost $1.6 trillion in market value. That makes it the worst start to a new year ever. Many worry that things will get even worse, and that banks and financial stocks are particularly vulnerable.Now, if this escalates, like it did back when Barack Obama first assumed the presidency, what actions would you take if this same thing happens all over again just as, in this example, you are taking over the presidency?KASICH: Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs. And I\u2019ve done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt. And our economy was growing like crazy. It\u2019s the same thing that I did in Ohio. It\u2019s a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety. It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way. And if you tax cuts \u2014 if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you\u2019re going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the \u2014 in the world.But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline. We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget. And when you do that, when you\u2019re in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.Right now, you don\u2019t have the \u2014 you have taxes that are too high. You have regulations \u2014 I mean, come on, they\u2019re affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses. They are \u2014 they\u2019re in a position where they\u2019re smothering people. And I mean, are you kidding me? We\u2019re nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise. You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy. And how do I know it? Because I\u2019ve done it. I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici. And I\u2019ve done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.Our wages are growing faster than the national average. We\u2019re running surpluses. And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: We know that recent global events have many people worried \u2014 Iran detaining American sailors, forcing them to apologize; North Korea and its nuclear ambitions; an aggressive China; and a Middle East that continues to deteriorate, not to mention ISIS is getting stronger.Governor Christie, sometimes it seems the world is on fire. Where and when should a president use military action to restore order?CHRISTIE: Well, Maria, I\u2019m glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what\u2019s going on in the world. Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama. And I\u2019ve got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?(APPLAUSE)The fact is, there\u2019s a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess. The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world. And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they\u2019ve never said about me is that I\u2019m misunderstood. And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we\u2019re going to keep it.Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience. And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he\u2019s absolutely right. It\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what\u2019s going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.The president doesn\u2019t understand \u2014 and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton \u2014 and here\u2019s my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight. If you\u2019re worried about the world being on fire, you\u2019re worried about how we\u2019re going to use our military, you\u2019re worried about strengthening our military and you\u2019re worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama\u2019s leadership.I will not do that. If I\u2019m the nominee, she won\u2019t get within 10 miles of the White House.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Just to be clear Governor, where and when would you use military action?CHRISTIE: MIlitary action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world. We are not the world\u2019s policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either. We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships. It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Governor Bush, the president just told the nation two nights ago that America is back and that the idea that our enemies are getting stronger or that this country is getting weaker, well, it\u2019s just rhetoric and hot air. Now other Democrats go even further, sir, saying Republicans even suggesting such comments actually embolden our enemies. I guess they would include you. What do you say?BUSH: Well first of all, the idea that somehow we\u2019re better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe. The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.Think about it. With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists. He\u2019s missing the whole point, that America\u2019s leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who\u2019s the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.(APPLAUSE)I\u2019ve learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military. In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can\u2019t even project force. Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we\u2019re in a much difficult \u2014 we\u2019re in a much different position than we should be.And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well. Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military. We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world\u2019s policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: So I take it from that you do not agree with the president.BUSH: No. And worse \u2014 worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.Think about it. She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have \u2014 that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess. And that is wrong.And you know what? Here\u2019s the problem. If she gets elected, she\u2019s under investigation with the FBI right now. If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse. We need to stop that. (LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Senator Rubio, the president says that ISIS doesn\u2019t threaten our national existence like a Germany or a Japan back in World War II, that the terror group is nothing more than twisted souls plotting attacks in their garages.But House Homeland Security Committee recently said that over 1,000 ongoing investigations of homegrown extremism in 50 states. So how do you define the threat? Germany then or dangerous nut cases now?RUBIO: Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton. She wouldn\u2019t just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.(APPLAUSE)Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States. Ever.(APPLAUSE)On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power. Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size. And that\u2019s how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.He doesn\u2019t understand the threat in ISIS. He consistently underestimates it but I do not. There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.When I\u2019m president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS. The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them. And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Thank you, Senator.BARTIROMO: Dr. Carson, the president says he does not want to treat ISIS as a foreign army, but ISIS is neither a country nor a government. How do you attack a network that does not respect national borders?CARSON: Well, I\u2019m very happy to get a question this early on. I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.(LAUGHTER)You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president\u2019s proclamations. The fact of the matter is he doesn\u2019t realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before. Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid. And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously. And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.I mean, just think about a scenario like that. They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse. They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs. Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point? He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.But here\u2019s the real key. We have the world\u2019s best military, even though he\u2019s done everything he can to diminish it. And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don\u2019t tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Mr. Trump, at the State of the Union, the president pointed to a guest who was a Syrian refugee you might recall whose wife and daughter and other family members were killed in an air attack. Now he fled that country seeking asylum here, ultimately ended up in Detroit where he\u2019s now trying to start a new life.The president says that that doctor is the real face of these refugees and not the one that you and some of your colleagues on this stage are painting; that you prefer the face of fear and terror and that you would refuse to let in anyone into this country seeking legitimate asylum. How do you answer that?TRUMP: It\u2019s not fear and terror, it\u2019s reality. You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.(APPLAUSE)You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there\u2019s a \u2014 the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow. They\u2019re very, very badly wounded. They will \u2014 some will follow. And you look around, and you see what\u2019s happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor \u2014 very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.That could be the great Trojan Horse. It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction. When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women? It looked like very few women. Very few children. Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they\u2019re saying what\u2019s going on?You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized \u2014 they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 \u2014 going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look \u2014 a good strong look and that\u2019s what we have. We are nineteen trillion dollars \u2014 our country\u2019s a mess and we can\u2019t let all these people come into our country and break our borders. We can\u2019t do it.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Senator Cruz, the New York Times is reporting that you failed to properly disclose a million dollars in loans from Goldman Sachs and CitiBank. During your senate race, your campaign said, \u201cit was inadvertent.\u201d A million dollars is inadvertent?CRUZ: Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times. You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don\u2019t hide their views. The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, \u201cAnybody But Cruz.\u201d Had that actually \u2014 that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, \u201cIt Follows\u201d that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.So you know the New York Times and I don\u2019t have exactly have the warmest of relationships. Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate \u2014 unlike Hillary Clinton, I don\u2019t have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars. When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars. He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks. And the entire New York times attack \u2014 is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing. But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other. But if that\u2019s the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well. BARTIROMO: Thank you.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO: All right. Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate, right here in North Charleston, South Carolina. Let\u2019s get right back to the questions. And I\u2019ll start with you, Senator Cruz.Now you are, of course, a strict constitutionalist \u2014 no one would doubt that. And as you know, the U.S. Constitution says only natural-born citizens are eligible for the office of president of the United States. Stop me if you\u2019ve heard this before. Now, you were born...(LAUGHTER)... you were born in Canada to an American mother. So you were and are considered an American citizen. But that fellow next to you, Donald Trump \u2014 and others \u2014 have said that being born in Canada means you are not natural-born, and that has raised questions about your eligibility.Do you want to try to close this topic once and for all tonight?CRUZ: Well, Neil, I\u2019m glad we\u2019re focusing on the important topics of the evening.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there. There was nothing to this birther issue.(LAUGHTER)Now, since September, the Constitution hasn\u2019t changed.(LAUGHTER)But the poll numbers have.(APPLAUSE)And I recognize \u2014 I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa. But the facts and the law here are really quite clear. Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen. That\u2019s why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen. That\u2019s why George Romney, Mitt\u2019s dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on \u2014 some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.(APPLAUSE)(UNKNOWN): Not me.CRUZ: Because \u2014 because Donald\u2019s mother was born in Scotland. She was naturalized. Now, Donald...TRUMP: But I was born here.CRUZ: ... on the issue \u2014 on the issue of citizenship, Donald...TRUMP: (inaudible). Big difference.CRUZ: ... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I\u2019m not going to use your mother\u2019s birth against you.TRUMP: OK, good. Because it wouldn\u2019t work.CRUZ: You\u2019re an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who\u2019s best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that\u2019s the most important question facing the country.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Mr. Trump...(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: ... that you raised it because of his rising poll numbers.TRUMP: ... first of all, let me just tell you something \u2014 and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself \u2014 NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll \u2014 headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down. I mean, so don\u2019t \u2014 so you can\u2019t \u2014 you can\u2019t...(BOOING)... they don\u2019t like the Wall Street Journal. They don\u2019t like NBC, but I like the poll.(LAUGHTER)And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I\u2019m beating you. So \u2014 you know, you shouldn\u2019t misrepresent how well you\u2019re doing with the polls.(APPLAUSE)You don\u2019t have to say that. In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that\u2019s a misrepresentation, number one.Number two, this isn\u2019t me saying it. I don\u2019t care. I think I\u2019m going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way. Thank you.Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard \u2014 of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this. OK? There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.Here\u2019s the problem. We\u2019re running. We\u2019re running. He does great. I win. I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can\u2019t take him along for the ride. I don\u2019t like that. OK?(LAUGHTER)The fact is \u2014 and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible). See, they don\u2019t like that. They don\u2019t like that.(AUDIENCE BOOING)No, they don\u2019t like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.(LAUGHTER)But \u2014 if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit. You have a big lawsuit over your head while you\u2019re running. And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office? So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide. And you shouldn\u2019t have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: Why are you saying this now \u2014 right now? Why are you raising this issue now?TRUMP: Because now he\u2019s going a little bit better. No, I didn\u2019t care (inaudible). It\u2019s true. No, it\u2019s true. Hey look, he never had a chance. Now, he\u2019s doing better. He\u2019s got probably a four or five percent chance.(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: Neil...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: The fact is, there is a big overhang. There\u2019s a big question mark on your head. And you can\u2019t do that to the party. You really can\u2019t. You can\u2019t do that to the party. You have to have certainty. Even if it was a one percent chance, and it\u2019s far greater than one percent because (inaudible).I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can\u2019t run. If there was a \u2014 and you know I\u2019m not bringing a suit. I promise. But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty. You can\u2019t have a question. I can agree with you or not, but you can\u2019t have a question over your head.CAVUTO: Senator, do you want to respond?CRUZ: Well, listen, I\u2019ve spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court. And I\u2019ll tell you, I\u2019m not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.TRUMP: You don\u2019t have to. Take it from Lawrence Tribe.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Take it from your professors...(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero. And Mr. Trump is very focused...TRUMP: He\u2019s wrong. He\u2019s wrong.CRUZ: ... on Larry Tribe. Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is. He\u2019s a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore\u2019s lawyer in Bush versus Gore. He\u2019s a major Hillary Clinton supporter. And there\u2019s a reason why Hillary\u2019s supporters are echoing Donald\u2019s attacks on me, because Hillary...TRUMP: He is not the only one.CRUZ: ... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.TRUMP: There are many lawyers.CRUZ: And I\u2019ll tell you what, Donald, you \u2014 you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P. slot.(LAUGHTER) I\u2019ll tell you what. If this all works out, I\u2019m happy to consider naming you as V.P. So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.TRUMP: No \u2014 no...(LAUGHTER)... I think if it doesn\u2019t...(APPLAUSE)I like that. I like it. I\u2019d consider it. But I think I\u2019ll go back to building buildings if it doesn\u2019t work out.CRUZ: Actually, I\u2019d love to get you to build a wall.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: I have a feeling it\u2019s going to work out, actually.(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: Let me (inaudible). I was invoked in that question, so let me just say \u2014 in that answer \u2014 let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.(LAUGHTER)But the real \u2014 but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about. OK? Listen, we \u2014 this is the greatest country in the history of mankind. But in 2008, we elected a president that didn\u2019t want to fix America. He wants to change America. We elected a president that doesn\u2019t believe in the Constitution. He undermines it. We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage. We elected a president that doesn\u2019t believe in the free enterprise system.This election has to be about reversing all of that damage. That\u2019s why I\u2019m running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders. When I\u2019m president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military. And when I\u2019m president, we\u2019re not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world. When I\u2019m president, we\u2019re going to have a president that acts like it.BARTIROMO: Thank you, senator.BARTIROMO: Mr. Trump, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley in her response to the State of the Union address(APPLAUSE)BARITROMO: appeared to choose sides within the party, saying Republicans should resist, quote, \u201cthe siren call of the angriest voices\u201d. She confirmed, she was referring to you among others. Was she out of line? And, how would a President Trump unite the party?TRUMP: Okay. First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I\u2019m a friend of hers. Actually a close friend. And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I\u2019m a friend. We\u2019re friends. That\u2019s good.(LAUGHTER)But she did say there was anger. And I could say, oh, I\u2019m not angry. I\u2019m very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger. Our military is a disaster.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Our healthcare is a horror show. Obamacare, we\u2019re going to repeal it and replace it. We have no borders. Our vets are being treated horribly. Illegal immigration is beyond belief. Our country is being run by incompetent people. And yes, I am angry.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: And I won\u2019t be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I\u2019m very, very angry. And I say that to Nikki. So when Nikki said that, I wasn\u2019t offended. She said the truth.One of your colleagues interviewed me. And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she\u2019s right. I\u2019m not fighting that. I didn\u2019t find it offensive at all. I\u2019m angry because our country is a mess.(APPLAUSE)BARITROMO: But what are you going to do about it?CAVUTO: Marco Rubio. I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s the time constraints. You and Governor Christie have been exchanging some fairly nasty words of late, and I will allow the governor to respond as well.The governor went so far to say, you won\u2019t be able to slime your way to the White House. He\u2019s referring to a series of ads done by a PAC, speaking on your behalf, that say quote,\u201dOne high tax, Common Core, liberal, energy-loving, Obamacare, Medicaid-expanding president is enough. You think you went too far on that and do you want to apologize to the governor?RUBIO: You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country\u2019s security and expanding the role of...CAVUTO: That is not my question.RUBIO: Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil. He is \u2014 this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government. This president is undermining our military. He is undermining our standing in the world. I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control. This president, this president is more interested in funding \u2014 less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned \u2014 he\u2019s more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood. All I\u2019m saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country. It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary. Let me tell you, if we don\u2019t get this election right, there may be no turning back for America. We\u2019re on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage. No one is a socialist. No one here is under FBI investigation. So we have a good group of people.CAVUTO: Is he a liberal?RUBIO: Our next president...CAVUTO: Is he a liberal?RUBIO: Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood. Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.CAVUTO: Governor?(APPLAUSE)CHRISTIE: I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we\u2019re running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco\u2019s ear too.(LAUGHTER)So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then. So let\u2019s set the facts straight. First of all, I didn\u2019t support Sonia Sotomayor. Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban. I have vetoed a reduction this clip size. I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey. So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator. See when you\u2019re a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk. And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you\u2019re saying is accurate or not.When you\u2019re a governor, you\u2019re held accountable for everything you do. And the people of New Jersey, I\u2019ve seen it.(APPLAUSE)And the last piece is this. I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed. That was before he was running against me. Now that he is, he\u2019s changed his tune.I\u2019m never going to change my tune. I like Marco Rubio. He\u2019s a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: Neil, my name was mentioned here. Neil, my name was mentioned as well.Here\u2019s the deal, Chris is totally right. He\u2019s been a good governor, and he\u2019s a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton. And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it\u2019s going to be \u2014 this is not being bad.These attack ads are going to be part of life. Everybody just needs to get used to it. Everybody\u2019s record\u2019s going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.(APPLAUSE)Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn\u2019t disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you\u2019re going to hear in these ads, and discount the \u2014 the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.CARSON: Neil, I was mentioned too.CAVUTO: You were?CARSON: Yeah, he said everybody. (LAUGHTER)And \u2014 and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we \u2014 and when I say we, Republicans \u2014 tore themselves apart.You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it. And we got to look at the big picture here.BARTIROMO: Governor Kasich...(APPLAUSE)... Governor Kasich, Hillary Clinton is getting some serious competition from Senator Bernie Sanders. He\u2019s now at 41 percent in the latest CBS/New York Times poll. Vice President Biden sang his praises, saying Bernie is speaking to a yearning that is deep and real, and he has credibility on it.So what does it say about our country that a candidate who is a self-avowed socialist and who doesn\u2019t think a 90 percent tax rate is too high could be the Democratic nominee?KASICH: Well, if that\u2019s the case, we\u2019re going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee. That\u2019s not even an issue. But look...(APPLAUSE)... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he\u2019s not going to be president of the United States. So here\u2019s this \u2014 the situation, I think, Maria.And this is what we have to \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2019ve got to tell you, when wages don\u2019t rise \u2014 and they haven\u2019t for a lot of families for a number of years \u2014 it\u2019s very, very difficult for them.Part of the reason why it hasn\u2019t risen because sometimes we\u2019re not giving people the skills they need. Sometimes it\u2019s because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in \u2014 in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.People are upset about it. I\u2019ll tell you what else they\u2019re upset about: you\u2019re 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you\u2019re out of work, and you don\u2019t know where to go and where to turn. Do we have answer for that? We do. There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they\u2019ve got great value.I\u2019ll tell you what else people are concerned about. Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can\u2019t get a good job. We got to do a lot about the high cost of high \u2014 higher education, but we\u2019ve got to make sure we\u2019re training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.(APPLAUSE)Let me tell you that, in this country \u2014 in this country, people are concerned about their economic future. They\u2019re very concerned about it. And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to \u2014 keeping them from getting it.That\u2019s not the America that I\u2019ve ever known. My father used to say, \u201cJohnny, we never \u2014 we don\u2019t hate the rich. We just want to be the rich.\u201d And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America \u2014 and I mean everybody in America \u2014 having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.I\u2019m president \u2014 look, I\u2019ve done it once. I\u2019ve done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes. The economy was really booming.And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the \u2014 than the national average. A growth of 385,000 jobs.(BELL RINGS)It\u2019s not that hard. Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts. Get it done, because our \u2014 our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done. And, folks, we will. You count on it.BARTIROMO: Dr. Carson, one of the other candidates on this stage has brought Bill Clinton\u2019s past indiscretions. Is that a legitimate topic in this election? And what do you think of the notion that Hillary Clinton is an enabler of sexual misconduct?CARSON: Well, there\u2019s not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they\u2019re married to somebody who\u2019s running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means. But you know, here\u2019s the real issue, is this America anymore? Do we still have standards? Do we still have values and principles?You know, you look at what\u2019s going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society. You know, we have a war on virtual everything \u2014 race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars. Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other\u2019s throat and our strength is actually in our unity.You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section \u2014 you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names. Where did that spirit come from in America? It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that. And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong. And let\u2019s not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great. They\u2019ve been beaten into submission. It\u2019s time for us to stand up for what we believe in.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Well, we are not done. Coming up, one of the top things people are talking about on Facebook, guns. And you can join us live us on this stage in the conversation during this commercial break right from home. You can go to Facebook.com/(inaudible). We will be streaming live and talking about how we think the debate is going so far.We\u2019re back in a moment in Charleston, South Carolina.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debates, right here in North Charleston. Let\u2019s get right back to the questions.Governor Bush, gun rights, one of the top issues seen on Facebook with close to 3 million people talking about it in the past month. Right here in Charleston, Dylann Roof, who has been accused of killing nine people in a nearby church, reportedly had not passed his background check when he got his gun. What is the harm in tightening standards for not only who buys guns, but those who sell them?BUSH: First of all, I\u2019d like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the \u2014(APPLAUSE)BUSH: The Emanuel AME church killings. And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: I don\u2019t know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place. Look, here\u2019s the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake. The law itself requires a background check, but that didn\u2019t fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.We don\u2019t need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job. Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not \u2014 would not have passed a background check. The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.That\u2019s what they do, whether it\u2019s the San Bernardino attack or if it\u2019s these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is. It isn\u2019t law-abiding gun owners.Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you\u2019re going away. You\u2019re going away for a long, long while.And that\u2019s what we should focus on is the violence in our communities. Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you\u2019re going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there\u2019s a big divide.The other issue is mental health. That\u2019s a serious issue that we could work on. Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: The president\u2019s first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn\u2019t have. Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don\u2019t have access to guns.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.Mr. Trump, are there any circumstances that you think we should be limiting gun sales of any kind in America?TRUMP: No. I am a 2nd amendment person. If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn\u2019t have 14 or 15 people dead right now.If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn\u2019t have 130 people plus dead. So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.We have a huge mental health problem in this country. We\u2019re closing hospitals, we\u2019re closing wards, we\u2019re closing so many because the states want to save money. We have to get back into looking at what\u2019s causing it. The guns don\u2019t pull the trigger. It\u2019s the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order. He doesn\u2019t want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress. You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation. He just writes out an executive order. Not supposed to happen that way.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you sir.XXX where you get Congress.TRUMP: You get the Congress. You get the Senate. You get together. You do legislation. He just writes out an order, executive order. It\u2019s not supposed to happen that way.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Senator Rubio, you said that President Obama wants to take people\u2019s guns away. Yet under his presidency, gun sales have more than doubled. That doesn\u2019t sound like a White House unfriendly to gun owners.RUBIO: That sounds like people are afraid the president\u2019s going to take their guns away.(APPLAUSE)Look, the Second Amendment is not an option. It is not a suggestion. It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families. I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would. I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would. I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.Here\u2019s my second problem. None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he\u2019s doing these things would have been preventive. You know why? Because criminals don\u2019t buy their guns from a gun show. They don\u2019t buy their guns from a collector. And they don\u2019t buy their guns from a gun store. They get \u2014 they steal them. They get them on the black market.And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show. These...(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)... his answer \u2014 you name it. If there\u2019s an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control. Here\u2019s a fact. We are in a war against ISIS. They are trying to attack us here in America. They attacked us in Philadelphia last week. They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago. And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.When I\u2019m president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: But what fact can you point to, Senator \u2014 what fact can you point to that the president would take away everyone\u2019s gun? You don\u2019t think that\u2019s (inaudible)?RUBIO: About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can\u2019t wait to restrict people\u2019s access to guns. He has never defended...(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: I\u2019ll give you a fact. Well, let me tell you this. Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, \u201cThese Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion.\u201d That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.(APPLAUSE)He doesn\u2019t meet \u2014 here\u2019s the difference. When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it\u2019s not \u201chow can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans.\u201d It\u2019s \u201cgive me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns.\u201d That will never happen when I am president of the United States.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Governor Christie, you, too, have criticized the president\u2019s recent executive action on gun control, saying it\u2019s unconstitutional, another step to bypass Congress. But hasn\u2019t your own position on guns evolved, sir? The New Jersey Star-Ledger reports that you signed several laws to regulate the possession of firearms, and that you argued back in August 2013, and I quote, \u201cThese common sense measures will strengthen New Jersey\u2019s already tough gun laws.\u201dSo isn\u2019t that kind of what the president wants to do now?CHRISTIE: No, absolutely not. The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people. And the fact is that that\u2019s not a democracy. That\u2019s a dictatorship. And we need to very, very concerned about that.See, here\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident. I don\u2019t think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat. I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit. We have made it easier to do that, not harder. And the way we\u2019ve done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders. This guy is a petulant child. That\u2019s what he is. I mean, you know...(APPLAUSE)... the fact is, Neil, let\u2019s think about \u2014 let\u2019s think about \u2014 and I want to maybe \u2014 I hope the president is watching tonight, because here\u2019s what I\u2019d like to tell him.Mr. President, we\u2019re not against you. We\u2019re against your policies. When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate. You had only 21 Republican governors in this country. And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we\u2019ve had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.The American people have rejected your agenda and now you\u2019re trying to go around it. That\u2019s not right. It\u2019s not constitutional. And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: So what is the answer, Senator Cruz, to stop mass shootings and violent crime, up in 30 cities across the country?CRUZ: The answer is simple. Your prosecute criminals. You target the bad guys. You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do \u2014 done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general. Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns. He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials. And I\u2019ll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters \u2014 the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president\u2019s going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.And I\u2019ll note that California senator \u2014 Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, \u201cgive me your guns, I\u2019m rounding them up,\u201d she would.And let me make a final point on this. Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment. Unless you are clinically insane...(LAUGHTER)... that\u2019s what you say in a primary. But the voters are savvier than that. They recognize that people\u2019s actions don\u2019t always match their words. I\u2019ve got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.There\u2019s a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race. There\u2019s a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...(BELL RINGS) ... and there\u2019s a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans \u2014 we defeated that gun control legislation.And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.BARTIROMO: Senator...(APPLAUSE)... let me follow up and switch gears.Senator Cruz, you suggested Mr. Trump, quote, \u201cembodies New York values.\u201d Could you explain what you mean by that?CRUZ: You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: I am from New York. I don\u2019t.CRUZ: What \u2014 what \u2014 you\u2019re from New York? So you might not.(LAUGHTER)But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.(APPLAUSE)And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York. But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.And \u2014 and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked \u2014 my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen\u2019s \u201cBorn in the USA\u201d, and I was asked what I thought of that.And I said, \u201cwell, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, \u2018New York, New York\u2019?\u201d And \u2014 and \u2014 you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.The New York Times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign.Not too many years ago, Donald did a long interview with Tim Russert. And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he\u2019s describing now.And his explanation \u2014 he said, \u201clook, I\u2019m from New York, that\u2019s what we believe in New York. Those aren\u2019t Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York.\u201d And so that was his explanation.And \u2014 and I guess I can \u2014 can frame it another way. Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan. I\u2019m just saying.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: Are you sure about that?CAVUTO: Maria...TRUMP: So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.(APPLAUSE)And just so \u2014 if I could, because he insulted a lot of people. I\u2019ve had more calls on that statement that Ted made \u2014 New York is a great place. It\u2019s got great people, it\u2019s got loving people, wonderful people.When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York. You had two one hundred...(APPLAUSE)... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down. I saw them come down. Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction. I was down there, and I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death \u2014 nobody understood it. And it was with us for months, the smell, the air. And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers. And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Governor bush, for the third time in as many months, the Iranians have provoked us, detaining us, as we\u2019ve been discussing, with these 10 Navy sailors Tehran had said strayed into their waters. The sailors were released, but only after shown on video apologizing for the incident. This occurring only weeks after Iran fired multiple rockets within 1,500 yards of a U.S. aircraft carrier and then continued to test medium range missiles.Now you\u2019ve claimed that such actions indicate Tehran has little to fear from a President Obama. I wonder, sir, what would change if they continued doing this sort of thing under a President Jeb Bush?BUSH: Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military. Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy\u2019s going to be cut again. It\u2019s now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.The deployments are too high for the military personnel. We don\u2019t have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment. The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman. The planes are older than the pilots. We\u2019re gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we\u2019re back in the game.Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board. We should reimpose sanctions, they\u2019ve already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we\u2019re back in the game with Israel \u2014(APPLAUSE)... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations. The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak. This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran. We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Thank you, Governor. Governor Kasich, while everyone has been focusing on Iran\u2019s provocations, I\u2019m wondering what you make of what Saudi Arabia has been doing and its recent moves in the region, including its execution of a well-known Shi\u2019ite cleric and its move to dramatically increase oil production, some say in an effort to drive down oil prices and force a lot of U.S. oil producers out of business.Sure enough, oil prices have tumbled. One brokerage house is predicting a third or more of American oil producers and those heavily invested in fracking will go bankrupt, and soon Saudi Arabia and OPEC will be back in the driver\u2019s seat.U.S. energy player Harold Hamrie similarly told me with friends like these, who needs enemies? Do you agree?KASICH: Well, let me \u2014 let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience. I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina. Let em also tell you...(APPLAUSE)... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense. And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems. So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it\u2019s so critical for us to be energy independent, and we\u2019re getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.We\u2019re seeing it in my state and we\u2019ll see it in this country. And that\u2019s why we must make sure we continue to frack.In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they\u2019re funding radical clerics through their madrasses. That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way. And I was going to tell you, whether I\u2019m president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we\u2019re going to support you, we\u2019re in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you\u2019ve got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.(APPLAUSE)So look, in foreign policy \u2014 in foreign policy, it\u2019s strength, but you\u2019ve got to be cool. You\u2019ve got to have a clear vision of where you want to go. And I\u2019m going to tell you, that it \u2014 I\u2019m going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can\u2019t do on the job training.I\u2019ve seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War. You see what the Saudi\u2019s \u2014 deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they\u2019re going right with us. And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.Thank you.CAVUTO: Thank you John.BARTIROMO: There\u2019s much more ahead including the fight against ISIS. More from Charleston, South Carolina when we come right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: We welcome back to the Republican Presidential Debate, right back to the questions.Candidates, the man who made fighting ISIS the cornerstone of his campaign, South Carolina Senator, Lindsey Graham is out the race but he joins us tonight in the audience.(APPLAUSE)He says, \u201cthe air-strike now in their 16th month have been ineffective.\u201d Dr. Carson ...CARSON: Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?BARTIROMO: The air-strikes.CARSON: OK.BARTIROMO: Now in their 16th month are ineffective. Dr. Carson, do you think Senator Graham is right in wanting to send 20,000 troops \u2014 ground troops to Iraq and Syria to take out ISIS?CARSON: Well, there\u2019s no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don\u2019t believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.I think we need to do a lot more than we\u2019re doing. Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, \u201cwhat do you need in order to accomplish this goal?\u201dOur decision is, then, do we give them what we need. I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don\u2019t tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.In addition to that...(APPLAUSE)... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue. You know, some of these \u2014 these engagement rules that the administration has \u2014 \u201cwe\u2019re not going to bomb a tanker that\u2019s coming out of there because there might be a person in it\u201d \u2014 give me a break.Just tell them that, you put people in there, we\u2019re going to bomb them. So don\u2019t put people in there if you don\u2019t want them bombed. You know, that\u2019s so simple.(APPLAUSE)And then we need to shut down \u2014 we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers. Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go. They should be running all the time, then they won\u2019t have time to plan attacks against us.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir. Senator Graham has also said that the U.S. will find Arab support for its coalition if it removes Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. And I quote, \u201cThe now king of Saudi Arabia told us, \u2018you can have our army, you just got to deal with Assad.\u2019\u201cThe emir of Qatar said, \u2018I\u2019ll pay for the operation, but they are not going to fight ISIS and let Damascus fall into the hands of the Iranians. Assad has to go.\u2019\u201dGovernor Christie, how important is it to remove Assad from power and how would you do it?CHRISTIE: Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot. You think about it \u2014 this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state \u2014 drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we\u2019re going to attack.He used chemical weapons, he\u2019s killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing. In fact, he\u2019s done worse than nothing.This president \u2014 and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer \u2014 she called Assad a reformer. Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad. The fact of the matter is we\u2019re not going to have peace \u2014 we are not going to have peace in Syria. We\u2019re not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don\u2019t have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.The Syrians should stay in Syria. They shouldn\u2019t be going to Europe. And here\u2019s the last piece...(APPLAUSE)... you\u2019re not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge. You\u2019re simply not. And so Senator Graham is right about this.And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.And believe me, Assad is not worth it. And if you\u2019re going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you\u2019re going to give her another four years, that\u2019s why I\u2019m speaking out as strongly as I am about that.Hillary Clinton cannot be president. It will lead to even greater war in this world. And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.That makes the world less peaceful, less safe. In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.(APPLAUSE)Mr. Trump \u2014 Mr. Trump, your comments about banning Muslims from entering the country created a firestorm. According to Facebook, it was the most-talked-about moment online of your entire campaign, with more than 10 million people talking about the issue.Is there anything you\u2019ve heard that makes you want to rethink this position?TRUMP: No.(LAUGHTER)No.(APPLAUSE)Look, we have to stop with political correctness. We have to get down to creating a country that\u2019s not going to have the kind of problems that we\u2019ve had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the \u2014 with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world. I just left Indonesia \u2014 bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.We have to find out what\u2019s going on. I said temporarily. I didn\u2019t say permanently. I said temporarily. And I have many great Muslim friends. And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, \u201cDonald, thank you very much; you\u2019re exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it.\u201dAnd unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what\u2019s going on, he can\u2019t use the term for whatever reason. And if you can\u2019t use the term, you\u2019re never going to solve the problem. My Muslim friends, some, said, \u201cthank you very much; we\u2019ll get to the bottom of it.\u201dBut we have a serious problem. And we can\u2019t be the stupid country any more. We\u2019re laughed at all over the world.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: Donald, Donald \u2014 can I \u2014 I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS. The Kurds are our strongest allies. They\u2019re Muslim. You\u2019re not going to even allow them to come to our country?The other Arab countries have a role to play in this. We cannot be the world\u2019s policeman. We can\u2019t do this unilaterally. We have to do this in unison with the Arab world. And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.(APPLAUSE)So I hope you\u2019ll reconsider. I hope you\u2019ll reconsider. The better way of dealing with this \u2014 the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the \u2014 Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it\u2019s harder if they\u2019ve been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder \u2014 make the screening take place.We don\u2019t have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously? What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?CAVUTO: But you said \u2014 you said that he made those comments and they represented him being unhinged after he made them.BUSH: Yeah, they are unhinged.CAVUTO: Well \u2014 well, after he made them...(APPLAUSE)... his poll numbers went up eight points in South Carolina. Now \u2014 now, wait...TRUMP: Eleven points, to be exact.CAVUTO: Are you \u2014 are you saying \u2014 are you saying that all those people who agree with Mr. Trump are unhinged?BUSH: No, not at all, absolutely not. I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically. I totally get that. But we\u2019re running for the presidency of the United States here. This isn\u2019t \u2014 this isn\u2019t, you know, a different kind of job. You have to lead. You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it\u2019s just politics.Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength. And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I\u2019m asking him to consider changing his views.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: I want security for this country. OK?(APPLAUSE)I want security. I\u2019m tired of seeing what\u2019s going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot. I want security for this country. We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam. We have a tremendous problem. It\u2019s not only a problem here. It\u2019s a problem all over the world.I want to find out why those two young people \u2014 those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them \u2014 people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them. I want to find out \u2014 many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment. Why weren\u2019t they vigilant? Why didn\u2019t they call? Why didn\u2019t they call the police?According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.And by the way, the police are the most mistreated people in this country. I will tell you that.(APPLAUSE)The most mistreated people. In fact, we need to \u2014 wait a minute \u2014 we need vigilance. We have to find out \u2014 many people knew about what was going on. Why didn\u2019t they turn those two people in so that you wouldn\u2019t have had all the death?There\u2019s something going on and it\u2019s bad. And I\u2019m saying we have to get to the bottom of it. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying. We need security.BARTIROMO: We \u2014 we want to hear from all of you on this. According to Pew Research, the U.S. admits more than 100,000 Muslim immigrants every single year on a permanent lifetime basis. I want to ask the rest of you to comment on this. Do you agree that we should pause Muslim immigration until we get a better handle on our homeland security situation, as Mr. Trump has said?Beginning with you, Governor Kasich.KASICH: I \u2014 I\u2019ve been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees. And the reasons why I\u2019ve done is I don\u2019t believe we have a good process of being able to vet them. But you know, we don\u2019t want to put everybody in the same category. And I\u2019ll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago. If we\u2019re going to have a coalition, we\u2019re going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states. We need Jordan.We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.(BELL RINGS)It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we\u2019re going to need it again. And if we try to put everybody in the same \u2014 call everybody the same thing, we can\u2019t do it. And that\u2019s just not acceptable.But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir, we want to hear from the rest of you,Governor Christie, your take.CHRISTIE: Now Maria, listen. I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind. And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe. That\u2019s the end of the conversation.I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue. Here\u2019s the way you need to deal with it. You can\u2019t just ban all Muslims. You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists. You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.(BELL RINGS)And this summer, we didn\u2019t do that. We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president. Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I\u2019m president, we\u2019ll make our intelligence community strong, and won\u2019t have to keep everybody out, we\u2019re just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don\u2019t harm us.BARTIROMO: Senator Rubio, where do you stand?RUBIO: Well, first of all, let\u2019s understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that\u2019s out there about this whole issue. Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck. They are much more than that. This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region. This is not some small scale group.They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world. So you know what needs to happen, it\u2019s a very simple equation, and it\u2019s going to happen when I\u2019m president. If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Senator Cruz, where do you stand? Senator Cruz?CRUZ: You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism. What should we do? First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I\u2019ve introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I\u2019ve introduced...(BELL RINGS)... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory. Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.If I\u2019m elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida. When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS(APPLAUSE).BARTIROMO: Dr. Carson, where do you stand? Do you agree with Mr. Trump?CARSON: Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem. But like all of our problems, there isn\u2019t a single one that can\u2019t be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics. And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that. And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place. They have infrastructure. All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November. Let\u2019s listen to them and let\u2019s not listen to our politicians.BARTIROMO: So, to be clear, the both of you do not agree with Mr. Trump?BUSH: So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies \u2014 that we need to build better relationships with? Of course not. What we need to do is destroy ISIS.I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a \u201cNo Fly Zone\u201d and \u201cSafe Zones\u201d to make sure refugees are there. We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria. We need to embed with \u2014 with the Iraqi military. We need to arm the Kurds the directly. We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters. That\u2019s how you solve the problem. You don\u2019t solve it by big talk where you\u2019re banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.BARTIROMO: Thank you governor.CAVUTO: Mr. Trump, sometimes maybe in the heat of the campaign, you say things and you have to dial them back. Last week, the New York Times editorial board quoted as saying that you would oppose, \u201cup to 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods.\u201dTRUMP: That\u2019s wrong. They were wrong. It\u2019s the New York Times, they are always wrong.CAVUTO: Well...TRUMP: They were wrong.CAVUTO: You never said because they provided that...TRUMP: No, I said, \u201c I would use \u2014 \u201c they were asking me what to do about North Korea. China, they don\u2019t like to tell us but they have total control \u2014 just about, of North Korea. They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.They say, \u201c well, we don\u2019t really have control.\u201d Without China, North Korea doesn\u2019t even eat. China is ripping us on trade. They\u2019re devaluing their currency and they\u2019re killing our companies. Thousands of thousands \u2014 you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we\u2019ve lost \u2014 50,000 because of China.(CROSSTALK) CAVUTO: So they\u2019ve never said to put a tariff on their...TRUMP: We\u2019ve lost anywhere between four and seven million jobs because of China. What I said then was, \u201cwe have very unfair trade with China. We\u2019re going to have a trade deficit of 505 billion dollars this year with China.\u201d A lot of that is because they devalue their currency.What I said to the New York Times, is that, \u201cwe have great power, economic power over China and if we wanted to use that and the amount \u2014 where the 45 percent comes in, that would be the amount they saw their devaluations that we should get.\u201d That we should get.What I\u2019m saying is this, I\u2019m saying that we do it but if they don\u2019t start treating us fairly and stop devaluing and let their currency rise so that our companies can compete and we don\u2019t lose all of these millions of jobs that we\u2019re losing, I would certainly start taxing goods that come in from China. Who the hell has to lose 505 billion dollars a year?CAVUTO: I\u2019m sorry, you lost me.TRUMP: It\u2019s not that complicated actually.CAVUTO: Then I apologize. Then I want to understand, if you don\u2019t want a 45 percent tariff, say that wasn\u2019t the figure, would you be open \u2014 are you open to slapping a higher tariff on Chinese goods of any sort to go back at them?TRUMP: OK, just so you understand \u2014 I know so much about trading about with China. Carl Icahn today as you know endorsed. Many businessmen want to endorse me.CAVUTO: I know...TRUMP: Carl said, \u201cno, no \u2014 \u201c but he\u2019s somebody \u2014 these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing and we have problems like this. If these are the kinds of people \u2014 we should use our best and our finest.Now, on that tariff \u2014 here\u2019s what I\u2019m saying, China \u2014 they send their goods and we don\u2019t tax it \u2014 they do whatever they want to do. They do whatever what they do, OK. When we do business with China, they tax us. You don\u2019t know it, they tax us.I have many friends that deal with China. They can\u2019t \u2014 when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed. If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal \u2014 so we don\u2019t have an equal playing field. I\u2019m saying, absolutely, we don\u2019t have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.I\u2019m a free trader. I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate. I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine. I sell tens\u2019 of millions of (inaudible).I love China. I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can\u2019t believe how stupid the American leadership is.CAVUTO: So you\u2019re open to a tariff?TRUMP: I\u2019m totally open to a tariff. If they don\u2019t treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed. You can\u2019t deal in China without tariffs. They do it to us, we don\u2019t it. It\u2019s not fair trade.KASICH: Neil, Neil \u2014 can I say one thing about this. I\u2019m a free trader. I support NAFTA. I believe in the PTT because it\u2019s important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China. And we do need China \u2014 Donald\u2019s right about North Korea.I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don\u2019t proliferate all these dangerous materials. But what he\u2019s touching \u2014 talking about, I think has got merit. And I\u2019ll allow putting that tariff or whatever he\u2019s saying here...TRUMP: I\u2019m happy to have him tonight...(LAUGHTER)KASICH: For too long \u2014 no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people\u2019s jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us. And guess what? The worker\u2019s out of a job.So when they \u2014 be found against that country that\u2019s selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker? Oh, well, you know, it just didn\u2019t work out for you.I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade. And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need \u2014 we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.And I want to just suggest to you. How do I know this? Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn\u2019t work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar. And the fact is those jobs are critical, they\u2019re hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they\u2019re Americans and they carry the load. So let\u2019s demand open trade but fair trade in this country. That\u2019s what I think we need to do.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: All right.RUBIO: But on this point, if I may add something on this point. We are all frustrated with what China is doing. I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here\u2019s why.China doesn\u2019t pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff. If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there\u2019s a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.It begins with tax reform. Let\u2019s not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world. Let\u2019s allow companies to immediately expense.(APPLAUSE)It continues with regulatory reform. Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.How about Obamacare, a certified job killer? It needs to be repealed and replaced. And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger. That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.TRUMP: Neil, the problem \u2014BARTIROMO: We\u2019re getting \u2014TRUMP: \u2014 with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they\u2019re sucking us dry and it takes too long. It would just \u2014 you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money. We just can\u2019t do it any longer.CAVUTO: He is right. If you put a tariff on a good, it\u2019s Americans who pay.BUSH: Absolutely.TRUMP: You looking at me?BUSH: Yeah.BARTIROMO: Prices go higher for \u2014TRUMP: Can I tell you what? It will never happen because they\u2019ll let their currency go up. They\u2019re never going to let it happen.Japan, the same thing. They are devaluing \u2014 it\u2019s so impossible for \u2014 you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what\u2019s happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph). Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan. Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they\u2019ve de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can\u2019t buy a Caterpillar tractor. And we\u2019re letting them get away with it and we can\u2019t let them get away with it.And that\u2019s why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: Here\u2019s \u2014 apart from the \u2014 apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.BARTIROMO: Yeah.BUSH: So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes \u2014 the equivalent of it goes to China. Or how about Boeing right here within a mile? Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn\u2019t retaliate and start buying Airbus? Of course, they would. This would be devastating for the economy. We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.BARTIROMO: Real quick, Senator \u2014 go ahead, Senator Cruz.(APPLAUSE)And then we have to get to tax reform.TRUMP: And we don\u2019t need a weak person being president of the United State, OK? Because that\u2019s what we\u2019d get if it were Jeb \u2014 I tell you what, we don\u2019t need that.AUDIENCE: Boo.TRUMP: We don\u2019t need that. That\u2019s essentially what we have now, and we don\u2019t need that. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re in the trouble that we\u2019re in now. And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look. They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China. They don\u2019t want them made here. They want those planes made in China.BUSH: They\u2019re a mile away from here.TRUMP: That\u2019s not the way the game is supposed to be played.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Governor Bush. Thank you, Mr. Trump. Very briefly.BUSH: My name was mentioned. My name was mentioned here. The simple fact is that the plane that\u2019s being build here is being sold to China. You can \u2014 if you \u2014 you flew in with your 767, didn\u2019t you? Right there, right next to the plant.TRUMP: No, the new planes. I\u2019m not talking about now, I\u2019m talking about in the future they\u2019re building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Mr. Trump.BUSH: When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the \u2014BARTIROMO: Thank you, Mr. Trmup. Thank you, Governor.TRUMP: I\u2019ll check for you.BUSH: Check it out.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: Senator briefly.CRUZ: Thanks for coming back to me, Maria. Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground. Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere. They discussed how \u2014 how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers. They\u2019re protectionist.History suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they\u2019ll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I\u2019ve introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...(APPLAUSE)... and here\u2019s the critical point, Maria \u2014 the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they\u2019re border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.It\u2019s tax-free \u2014 a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers \u2014 and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax. It\u2019s like a tariff, but here\u2019s the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there\u2019s no reciprocal...(BELL RINGS)... tariffs that come against us. It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...(UNKNOWN): Maria...CRUZ: ... and as president, I\u2019m going to fight for the working men and women.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: We\u2019ve got to get to tax reform, gentlemen. We\u2019ve got to get to tax reform, and we\u2019ve got to get to the...(UNKNOWN): Yeah, but I want to talk about taxes.BARTIROMO: ... we\u2019ve got to get to the national debt as well. Coming up next, the growing national debt, the war on crime, tax reform. More from North Charleston, South Carolina, when we come right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate here in North Charleston. Right back to the questions.(APPLAUSE)Governor Christie, we have spoken much about cutting spending, given the $19 trillion debt. But according to one report, America needs $3.6 trillion in infrastructure spending by 2020.Here in South Carolina, 11 percent of bridges are considered structurally deficient, costing drivers a billion dollars a year in auto repairs. What is your plan to fix the ailing roads and bridges without breaking the bank?CHRISTIE: Well, I\u2019m glad you asked that, Maria. Here\u2019s \u2014 here\u2019s our plan. We\u2019ve all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world \u2014 and we double tax, as you know.And what that\u2019s led to over $2 trillion of American companies\u2019 monies that are being kept offshore, because they don\u2019t want to pay the second tax. And who can blame them? They pay tax once overseas. They don\u2019t want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given \u2014 bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.Bring the money \u2014 the $2 trillion \u2014 back to the United States. We\u2019ll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money. And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.It would not necessitate us raising any taxes. It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about. And \u2014 and \u2014 and the last piece of this, Maria, is this. You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America. He\u2019s penalized \u2014 and doesn\u2019t understand. In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.You\u2019ve seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration. That\u2019s wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country. We\u2019d rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we\u2019d work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.And remember this \u2014 I\u2019m credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I\u2019ve vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history. We don\u2019t need to raise taxes to get this done.We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir. Dr. Carson...(APPLAUSE)... it is true U.S. companies have $2 trillion in cash sitting overseas right now. That could be used for investment and jobs in America.Also, several companies right now are pursuing mergers to move their corporate headquarters abroad, and take advantage of much lower taxes. What will you do to stop the flow of companies building cash away from America, and those leaving America altogether?CARSON: Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that\u2019s what we have proposed. A flat tax for everybody \u2014 no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money. You know, I \u2014 my \u2014 my mother taught me this. You know, she only had a third-grade education, but \u2014 you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn\u2019t make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car. In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation. But...(LAUGHTER)... you know, the \u2014 the \u2014 the fact of the matter is \u2014 you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations \u2014 because every regulation is a tax, it\u2019s a \u2014 on goods and services. And it\u2019s the most regressive tax there is.You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up \u2014 you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that. A rich person does not. Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our \u2014 our \u2014 our people like this. And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it\u2019s those evil rich people.It\u2019s not the evil rich people. It\u2019s the evil government that is \u2014 that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can\u2019t survive.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.Senator Rubio...TRUMP: Maria \u2014 Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion. It\u2019s one of the biggest problems our country has. Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs \u2014 leave them behind. They\u2019re leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can\u2019t get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in. But they can\u2019t get along. They can\u2019t even make a deal.Here is the case, they both agree, they can\u2019t make a deal. We have to do something. Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have. So many companies are going to leave our country.BARTIROMO: Which is why we raised it.Senator Rubio?Thank you, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: Thank you.BARTIROMO: One of the biggest fiscal challenges is our entitlement programs, particularly Social Security and Medicare. What policies will you put forward to make sure these programs are more financially secure?RUBIO: Well, first let me address the tax issue because it\u2019s related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: Here is the one thing I\u2019m not going to do. I\u2019m not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan. It\u2019s called the value added tax. And it\u2019s a tax you find in many companies in Europe.Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.And that\u2019s why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that\u2019s what Ronald Reagan said. Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.Now, you can support one now that\u2019s very low. But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors. Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job. And therefore, they don\u2019t get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.When I am president of the United States, I\u2019m going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you senator.CRUZ: Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.BARTIROMO: Senator Cruz, yes. You were meant to. Yes, of course.CRUZ: Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat. A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.This is a business flat tax. It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax. It goes away. It enables us to eliminate the death tax.If you\u2019re a farmer, if you\u2019re a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone. We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes. And listen, there is a real difference between Marco\u2019s tax plan and mine.Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent. Marco\u2019s top tax rate is 35 percent. My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS. Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity. We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...(BELL RINGS)... the mandates and have a simple flat tax. The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan. I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan\u2019s chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.BARTIROMO: Thank you senator.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: But that\u2019s not an accurate description of the plan. Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that\u2019s going to collect your vat tax. Someone\u2019s going to be collecting this tax.In fact, Ronald Reagan\u2019s treasury, when Ronald Reagan\u2019s treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found? That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax. Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make. They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.So there are people watching tonight in business. If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from? You\u2019re going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don\u2019t see it on the bill.And that\u2019s why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold. You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government. Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at. But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...(BELL RINGS)and they decide, we\u2019re going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we\u2019re going to raise the income tax to 30 percent. Now, you\u2019ve got Europe.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Thank you senator. I have to get to a question for Mr. Trump.CRUZ: Maria...BARTIROMO: Yes.CRUZ: Maria, I\u2019d just like to say...(CROSSTALK)CHRISTIE: Maria, I\u2019d like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements. Do you remember that, everybody? This was a question on entitlements.And the reason \u2014 and the reason...(CROSSTALK)CHRISTIE: ... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it. Here\u2019s the thing.(CROSSTALK)CHRISTIE: The fact is, the reason why...RUBIO: If you\u2019ll answer the (inaudible) core question.CHRISTIE: ... the fact is \u2014 the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s a hard problem. And I\u2019m the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this \u2014 avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes. Bernie Sanders has already said it. And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she\u2019s moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress \u2014 this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund. A Republican Congress did that.And the fact is it was wrong. And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security. We need to reform Social Security. Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that\u2019s why I\u2019m answering your question.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Governor. Thank you, Governor.(APPLAUSE) CARSON: Can I just add one very quick thing? And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan. And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best. Just want to get that out there, just saying.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Dr. Carson.Coming up, how would the candidates protect America, and another terror attack, if we were to see it. But first, you can join us live on stage during the commercial break right from home. Go to facebook.com/foxbusiness. We\u2019ll be streaming live and answering your questions during this break next.More from South Carolina coming up. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Mr. Trump, your net worth is in the multi-billions of dollars and have an ongoing thriving hotel and real estate business. Are you planning on putting your assets in a blind trust should you become president? With such vast wealth, how difficult will it be for you to disentangle yourself from your business and your money and prioritize America\u2019s interest first?TRUMP: Well, it\u2019s an interesting question because I\u2019m very proud of my company. As you too know, I know I built a very great company. But if I become president, I couldn\u2019t care less about my company. It\u2019s peanuts.I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again. I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there. Run the company kids, have a good time. I\u2019m going to do it for America.So I would \u2014 I would be willing to do that.BARTIROMO: So you\u2019ll put your assets in a blind trust?TRUMP: I would put it in a blind trust. Well, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it. If that\u2019s a blind trust, I don\u2019t know. But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn\u2019t ever be involved because I wouldn\u2019t care about anything but our country, anything.BARTIROMO: Thank you sir.TRUMP: Thank you.CAVUTO: Governor Christie, going back to your U.S. Attorney days, you had been praised by both parties as certainly a tough law and order guy. So I wonder what you make of recent statistics that showed violent crimes that have been spiking sometimes by double digit ratings in 30 cities across the country. Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn said, \u201cmost local law enforcement officials feel abandoned by Washington.\u201d Former NYC Police Chief Ray Kelly, says that, \u201cpolice are being less proactive because they\u2019re being overly scrutinized and second guessed and they\u2019re afraid of being sued or thrown in jail.\u201dWhat would you do as president to address this?CHRISTIE: Well, first off, let\u2019s face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey. He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan. He said, \u201cthere\u2019s a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country.\u201d Here\u2019s why, the president of the United States and both his attorney\u2019s general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.That\u2019s the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president. Every time he\u2019s got a chance, going all the way back to \u2014 remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time. This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey. I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here\u2019s the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country. That\u2019s where crime is happening in these cities where they don\u2019t enforce the immigration laws. And this president turns his back \u2014 this president doesn\u2019t enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn\u2019t agree with them.And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that\u2019s illegal. This president allows lawlessness throughout this country. Here\u2019s what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General. I\u2019d say, \u201cGeneral, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively. Make our streets safe again. Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them.\u201dWe do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well. I\u2019m the only person on this stage who\u2019s done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.CAVUTO: Thank you governor.Governor Kasich, as someone has to deal with controversial police shootings in your own state, what do you make of Chicago\u2019s move recently to sort of retrain police? Maybe make them not so quick to use their guns?KASICH: Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat. She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety. KASICH: And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.KASICH: And they came back with 23 recommendations. One of them is a statewide use of deadly force. And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio. Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for \u2014 for training.But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police. Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not \u2014 not to lose their life. Their family is waiting for them.At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn\u2019t work for them, but works against them.See, in Ohio, we\u2019ve had some controversial decisions. But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong. And it has been a remarkable situation in our state. And as president of the United States, it\u2019s all about communication, folks. It\u2019s all about getting people to listen to one another\u2019s problems.And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have. Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed. I\u2019ve heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I\u2019ve got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can\u2019t do it alone. You\u2019ve got to bring people together. You\u2019ve got to give people hope.And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America. And that is what\u2019s so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Thank you, Governor.BARTIROMO: Senator Rubio?(APPLAUSE)Under current law, the U.S. is on track to issue more new permanent immigrants on green cards over the next five years than the entire population of South Carolina. The CBO says your 2013 immigration bill would have increased green cardholders by another 10 million over 10 years.Why are you so interested in opening up borders to foreigners when American workers have a hard enough time finding work?RUBIO: Well, first of all, this is an issue that\u2019s been debated now for 30 years. And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who\u2019s in this country, maybe they\u2019re here illegally, but they\u2019re looking for a job. This issue is not about that anymore.First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe. And here\u2019s why. There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system. And not just green cards. They\u2019re looking \u2014 they\u2019re recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances. They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.They\u2019re looking \u2014 they\u2019re looking to manipulate our \u2014 the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States. So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States. So whether it\u2019s green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I\u2019m president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.BARTIROMO: So your thinking has changed?RUBIO: The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago. Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally. They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS. Because they\u2019re recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees. We know this for a fact. They\u2019ve contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border. And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I\u2019m president we will.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Senator.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida. We had Boko Haram. We had Hamas. We had Hezbollah. We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America. It\u2019s the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it\u2019s clear now, that border security is national security.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you, Senator.CRUZ: It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama\u2019s power to let in Syrian refugees. It enabled him \u2014 the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.I think that\u2019s a mistake. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been leading the fight to stop it. And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries. I voted yes to suspend that. Marco voted on the other side. So you don\u2019t get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.RUBIO: Maria, let me clear something up here. This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration. RUBIO: Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you\u2019re against it. You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you\u2019re against it. You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you\u2019re against it. You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.And by the way, it\u2019s not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you\u2019re against it. I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.(APPLAUSE)That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation. When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant. Edward Snowden is a traitor. And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.(APPLAUSE)And one more point, one more point. Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it. Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz. In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.Here\u2019s the bottom line, and I\u2019ll close with this. If I\u2019m president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: There\u2019s \u2014 look, there\u2019s \u2014CAVUTO: Gentlemen, gentlemen \u2014CRUZ: I\u2019m going to get a response to that, Neil. There\u2019s no way he launches 11 attack \u2014CAVUTO: Very quick, very quick. CRUZ: I\u2019m going to \u2014 he had no fewer than 11 attacks there. I appreciate your dumping your (inaudible) research folder on the debate stage.RUBIO: No, it\u2019s your record.CRUZL But I will say \u2014CAVUTO: Do you think they like each other?CRUZ: \u2014 at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false. They\u2019re absolutely false.AUDIENCE: Boo.CRUZ: So let\u2019s start \u2014 let\u2019s start with immigration. Let\u2019s start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity. Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty. I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King. Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals. I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion. What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it\u2019s simply not true. And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.CAVUTO: All right, gentlemen, we\u2019ve got to stop. I know you are very passionate about that.(APPLAUSE)Governor Bush, fears have gripped this country obviously, and you touched on it earlier since the San Bernardino attacks. Since our last debate, the national conversation has changed, according to Facebook data as well.Now this first graphic shows the issues that were most talked about right before those attacks and now after: the issues of Islam, homeland security and ISIS now loom very large. The FBI says Islamic radicals are using social media to communicate and that it needs better access to communication. Now the CEO of Apple, Governor, Tim Cook said unless served with a warrant private communication is private, period. Do you agree, or would you try to convince him otherwise?BUSH: I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators \u2014 back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country. We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff \u2014CAVUTO: Would you answer this question?BUSH: Oh, I\u2019ll talk about that, too. But you haven\u2019t asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I\u2019d get that off my chest if you don\u2019t mind.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO: Fair enough. So Tim Cook \u2014 so Tim Cook says he\u2019s going to keep it private.BUSH: I got that. And the problem today is there\u2019s no confidence in Washington, D.C. There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies. They understand that there\u2019s a national security risk. We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they\u2019re not fearful of a lawsuit.We need to make sure that we keep the country safe. This is the first priority. The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely. Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is \u2014 that is just shameful. 23 million files in the hands of the Chinese? So it\u2019s not just the government \u2014 the private sector companies, it\u2019s also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well. That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.CAVUTO: But if Tim cook is telling you no, Mr. President.BUSH: You\u2019ve got to keep asking. You\u2019ve got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue. If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship \u2014CAVUTO: Do you ask or do you order? BUSH: Well, if the law would change, yeah. But I think there has to be recognition that if we \u2014 if we are too punitive, then you\u2019ll go to other \u2014 other technology companies outside the United States. And what we want to do is to control this.We also want to dominate this from a commercial side. So there\u2019s a lot of balanced interests. But the president leads in this regard. That\u2019s what we need. We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you\u2019re talking about amendments that don\u2019t even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.CAVUTO: Governor, thank you.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: When we come right back, closing statements. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Candidates, it is time for your closing statements. You get 60 seconds each.Governor John Kasich, we begin with you.KASICH: You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don\u2019t have the power. You know, they feel like if they don\u2019t have a lobbyist, if they\u2019re not wealthy, that somehow they don\u2019t get to play.But all of my career, you know, having been raised in \u2014 by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English. You see, all of my career, I\u2019ve fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.Whether it\u2019s welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it\u2019s engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it\u2019s taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.Look, that\u2019s who I stand up for. That\u2019s who\u2019s in my mind(BELL RINGS)And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you\u2019re the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Governor Bush?BUSH: Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer? Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I\u2019ve laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.Credibility counts. There\u2019ll be people here that will talk about what they\u2019re going to do. I\u2019ve done it. I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Governor Chris Christie?CHRISTIE: Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week \u2014 the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they\u2019re feeling.They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore. They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn\u2019t understand their pain, and doesn\u2019t have any plan for getting away from it.I love this country. It\u2019s the most exceptional country the world has ever known. We need someone to fight for the people. We need a fighter for this country again.I\u2019ve lived my whole life fighting \u2014 fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.But here\u2019s the best way that we\u2019re going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Dr. Ben Carson?CARSON: You know, in recent travels around this country, I\u2019ve encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.We\u2019re not going to solve this problem with traditional politics. The only way we\u2019re going to solve this problem is with we, the people. And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity. Bencarson.com \u2014 we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Senator Marco Rubio?RUBIO: You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don\u2019t come from government. Our rights come from God.That\u2019s why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world. That\u2019s why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel. This country is changing. It feels different. We feel like we\u2019re being left behind and left out.And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn\u2019t interested in fixing America. We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military. And that\u2019s why 2016 is a turning point in our history. If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.But if we elect the right person \u2014 if you elect me \u2014 we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Senator Ted Cruz?CRUZ: \u201c13 Hours\u201d \u2014 tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them. I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who\u2019s responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter. This will end. It will end on January 2017.And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Mr. Donald Trump?TRUMP: I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers. They\u2019re tough, they\u2019re strong, they\u2019re great people. Half of them had tears pouring down their face. They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads. It was a terrible sight. A terrible sight. And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion. If I\u2019m president, there won\u2019t be stupid deals anymore.We will make America great again. We will win on everything we do. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Candidates, thank you.CAVUTO: Gentlemen, thank you all. All of you. That wraps up our debate. We went a little bit over here.

{"Headline": "Review: In \u2018When Breath Becomes Air,\u2019 Dr. Paul Kalanithi Confronts an Early Death", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byBooks of The TimesWhen Dr. Paul Kalanithi sent his best friend an email in May 2013 revealing that he had terminal cancer, he wrote: \u201cThe good news is that I\u2019ve already outlived two Bront\u00ebs, Keats and Stephen Crane. The bad news is that I haven\u2019t written anything.\u201d It was a jokey way of dealing with the unthinkable but also an indication of Dr. Kalanithi\u2019s tremendous ambition. He had led a fascinating life and was not about to leave it unchronicled.He wrote his own book with great determination but also great difficulty, to the point of wearing silver-lined gloves to use the trackpad when his fingertips began to crack during chemotherapy. (In the epilogue and afterword, by his wife, Lucy Kalanithi, also a doctor, she says that the manuscript had to be completed posthumously.) But the difficulty doesn\u2019t show: Dr. Kalanithi knows how to make a paragraph fly. And the book opens with a beauty, quoted here to show its swift economy and precision:\u201cI flipped through the CT scan images, the diagnosis obvious: the lungs were matted with innumerable tumors, the spine deformed, a full lobe of the liver obliterated. Cancer, widely disseminated. I was a neurosurgical resident entering my final year of training. Over the last six years, I\u2019d examined scores of such scans, on the off chance that some procedure might benefit the patient. But this scan was different: it was my own.\u201dWith those facts established, he is free to flash back through the lifetime of experiences that got him to this point: an unusual love-hate relationship with medicine as the thing that kept his father, a cardiologist, away from home at night but also struck him as a calling rather than a profession. Once his family moved from Westchester, N.Y., to Arizona, he and his brothers became essentially home-schooled by a strict mother who had no idea what truly excited Paul, the neurosurgeon in waiting. She worried about her sons and drugs, \u201cnever suspecting that the most intoxicating thing I\u2019d experienced, by far, was the volume of romantic poetry she\u2019d handed me the previous week.\u201dWith the seeker\u2019s restlessness that seems not to have left him until his last breath, he went on to accrue two B.A.s and an M.A. in literature at Stanford, then a Master of Philosophy at Cambridge, before graduating cum laude from the Yale School of Medicine. He returned to Stanford for a residency in neurological surgery and a postdoctoral fellowship in neuroscience. His training was almost complete when the bad diagnosis hit.In the first half of the book, Dr. Kalanithi provides a good set of anecdotes about how he goes from medical resident to seasoned doctor: first cadaver (formaldehyde stimulated his appetite), first births and deaths on the same day (which made him mindful of \u201cWaiting for Godot,\u201d with its line about \u201cbirth astride of a grave\u201d). From the start, workaholic though he is, he understands patients\u2019 needs better than most young doctors do.And then everything changes. In a single moment of recognition, everything Dr. Kalanithi has imagined for himself and his wife evaporates, and a new future has to be imagined. Should they have a child, or would that make it harder for him to die? (They do. The book is dedicated to their daughter, Cady.) A job at Stanford for which he was the prime candidate? Not happening. Another good job that would require the Kalanithis to move to Wisconsin? Too far from his oncologist. Long-term plans of any kind? Well, what does long-term mean now? Does he have a day, a month, a year, six years, what? He\u2019s heard the advice about living one day at a time, but what\u2019s he supposed to do with that day when he doesn\u2019t know how many others remain?\u201cWhen Breath Becomes Air\u201d is gripping from the start. But it becomes even more so as Dr. Kalanithi tries to reinvent himself in various ways with no idea what will happen. He can\u2019t gauge how much strength his body still has until he tests it, and sometimes the consequences are horrific. He no longer knows who he is or what he wants. His whole sense of identity is shaken. And for a terrible period when his oncologist is away, he is treated as a problem and not a patient by an inept medical resident who nearly hastens his death by denying him one of the drugs he desperately needs.Part of this book\u2019s tremendous impact comes from the obvious fact that its author was such a brilliant polymath. And part comes from the way he conveys what happened to him \u2014 passionately working and striving, deferring gratification, waiting to live, learning to die \u2014 so well. None of it is maudlin. Nothing is exaggerated. As he wrote to a friend: \u201cIt\u2019s just tragic enough and just imaginable enough.\u201d And just important enough to be unmissable.The Books of The Times review last Thursday, about \u201cWhen Breath Becomes Air\u201d by Paul Kalanithi, who died of lung cancer last year, misstated a word in a passage in the book. Dr. Kalanithi said he was a neurosurgical resident at the time of his diagnosis, not a neurological resident.When Breath Becomes AirBy Paul Kalanithi228 pages. Random House. $25.Advertisement"}

But those inside the presidential office can\u2019t hear the voice of the people.\u201dMs. Tsai, who consistently held a wide lead in polls, will be only the second president not to belong to the Kuomintang, the party that ruled Taiwan as an authoritarian state until democratic reforms began in the late 1980s.Her Democratic Progressive Party, known as the D.P.P., traditionally supports Taiwan\u2019s formal independence. The tenure of the previous D.P.P. president, Chen Shui-bian, who led Taiwan from 2000 to 2008, was marked by increased tension with China and concern that it would use military force against the island.Ms. Tsai, who during a failed bid for president in 2012 was criticized by the Kuomintang as being unable to manage the relationship with China, pledged during this campaign to maintain the cross-strait status quo.\u201cFollowing the will of the Taiwanese people, we will work toward maintaining the status quo for peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait in order to bring the greatest benefits and well-being to the Taiwanese people,\u201d she said.\u201cI also want to emphasize that both sides of the strait have a responsibility to find mutually acceptable means of interaction that are based on dignity and reciprocity,\u201d Ms. Tsai added. \u201cWe must ensure that no provocations or accidents take place.\u201dThe head of China\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office, Zhang Zhijun, said last month that \u201ccomplicated changes are arising in the Taiwan situation\u201d and warned \u201ccompatriots on both sides to be on alert for and oppose Taiwan independence.\u201d\u201cThey have learned from past experience that shouting against the Taiwanese will backfire,\u201d he said.Mr. Lin said he did not expect China\u2019s leader, President Xi Jinping, to try to pressure a D.P.P. government too quickly.\u201cXi Jinping is pretty much constrained by what he can do toward Taiwan,\u201d he said. \u201cXi is facing serious domestic challenges and people are waiting for him to make mistakes, so he has to be very careful.\u201dAnalysts expect Ms. Tsai to take a more cautious approach to China than did President Ma, who pushed through more than 20 agreements between the two sides. But she also wants to keep the cross-strait relationship stable, said Shelley Rigger, a professor of East Asian politics at Davidson College in North Carolina.\u201cTsai Ing-wen doesn\u2019t want this to blow up,\u201d she said. \u201cWashington doesn\u2019t want this to blow up; Beijing doesn\u2019t want this to blow up. So why should it blow up?\u201dMr. Chu, the Kuomintang candidate, argued that Taiwan needed to focus on trade and investment ties with China to revive its economy. That approach met with skepticism among voters worried about the possibility that China would use economic leverage to pursue its goal of bringing the island under its control.All three presidential candidates, including a third-party candidate, James Soong, said Ms. Chou should not have had to apologize. But many online critics derided Kuomintang politicians\u2019 expressions of support as hypocritical, given the party\u2019s push for closer China ties.The party\u2019s campaign struggled in other ways, too. No prominent politician stepped forward to run against Ms. Tsai, and as the Kuomintang\u2019s initial nominee, Hung Hsiu-chu, trailed badly in the polls, she was replaced in October by Mr. Chu, the party secretary.But Mr. Chu fared little better. His chances were further weakened by the candidacy of Mr. Soong, of the People First Party, a former Kuomintang member who has run for president twice before.Analysts expected the D.P.P. to make strong gains in Taiwan\u2019s legislature and perhaps win control of it for the first time. If it gains power, the party is expected to pursue an investigation into abuses during the Kuomintang\u2019s years of rule, as well as the Kuomintang\u2019s acquisition of state and private property while it was in power.\u201cWe will definitely investigate,\u201d said Fred Hung, an adviser to Ms. Tsai. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do anything on transitional justice, the voters will be very unhappy.\u201dWhile gender did not play a major role in the campaign, there was clearly excitement among voters at the prospect of electing Taiwan\u2019s first female president, one whose path to power, unlike other female leaders in Asia, was not paved by a powerful father or other male relative.\u201cTaiwan has traditionally been a patriarchal society,\u201d said Rebecca Chang, 45, who stood with a friend by the side of the road with LED signs reading \u201cElect\u201d and \u201cTaiwan\u2019s First Woman President\u201d as Ms. Tsai\u2019s campaign motorcade drove through Taipei on Friday. \u201cShe can help change people\u2019s thinking, no matter if they are male or female.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trying to Understand China\u2019s Market Upheaval", "Date": "2016-01-07", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsThe Chinese currency is down 1.5 percent against the United States dollar in fewer than four full days. That is only slightly less than the supposedly one-time depreciation that surprised global investors last summer. The latest slide prompted a sell-off in Chinese stocks, twice activating circuit breakers, which suspend trading when the benchmark CSI 300 index moves more than 7 percent. On Thursday morning, the market closed within half an hour of the opening bell.Broadly, there are two theories for what is going on. The first is that the Chinese authorities have concluded a hefty devaluation is the least bad solution to the country\u2019s economic predicament. Renewed fears of a currency war have prompted investors to flee major trading partners like Australia and South Korea, while also putting pressure on commodity prices. A barrel of Brent crude oil now sells for little more than $33.Chinese authorities counter that the renminbi is weak only when compared with the dollar. Measured against a broader basket of currencies, the renminbi was more or less flat last year. Besides, China is still running a healthy trade surplus, which lessens its incentive to seek a competitive advantage by devaluation.Yet if China really has no grand plan, that gives weight to the second theory: that planners are losing their grip on the world\u2019s second-largest economy.Last year\u2019s bungled stock market intervention and mini-devaluation punctured the myth of Chinese bureaucratic infallibility. The latest ructions reinforce the belief that officials are struggling to reconcile contradictory demands: promoting market forces while preserving stability; and rebalancing the economy while continuing to meet increasingly unrealistic growth targets.Whether China\u2019s latest market upheaval is by design or default, it\u2019s little surprise that investors are assuming the worst.Advertisement"}

Argumentan que pol\u00edticas que primen el cobro de impuestos a los m\u00e1s ricos perjudicar\u00e1n a la sociedad en su conjunto al reducir los incentivos para crear riqueza.Las \u00faltimas experiencias no favorecen la defensa de la postura conservadora. El Presidente Obama impuls\u00f3 una subida de impuestos importante para los que m\u00e1s ganan y su reforma del sistema de salud ha supuesto la expansi\u00f3n m\u00e1s grande del Estado de bienestar desde el mandato de Lyndon B. Johnson. Los conservadores, por su parte, no dudaron en pronosticar el desastre econ\u00f3mico del mismo modo que ya lo hab\u00edan hecho cuando Bill Clinton aument\u00f3 los impuestos al 1 por ciento m\u00e1s rico del pa\u00eds. Y lo que ha sucedido, en cambio, es que Obama ha encabezado el per\u00edodo con mayor crecimiento del empleo desde la d\u00e9cada de 1990.\u00bfExiste, entonces, un debate a largo plazo que defienda la existencia de niveles altos de desigualdad?No les sorprender\u00eda escuchar que muchos miembros de la \u00e9lite econ\u00f3mica creen que s\u00ed. Tampoco les sorprender\u00eda saber que estoy en desacuerdo y que creo que la econom\u00eda puede crecer si se da una concentraci\u00f3n mucho menor de la riqueza en las clases altas. \u00bfPero por qu\u00e9 lo creo?Me parece \u00fatil pensar en los tres modelos que explican de d\u00f3nde podr\u00eda provenir la desigualdad extrema teniendo en cuenta que la econom\u00eda real incluye elementos de los tres.Y en el tercero, el poder ser\u00eda la fuerza que se encuentra tras niveles de desigualdad tan grandes: como los ejecutivos de las grandes corporaciones que se marcan sus propios salarios y los operadores financieros que se hacen ricos con el uso de informaci\u00f3n privilegiada o por cobrar honorarios inmerecidos de inversionistas ingenuos.Pero, sea cual sea el caso, la verdadera pregunta es si podemos redistribuir una parte del ingreso que actualmente se queda en manos de la \u00e9lite sin paralizar el crecimiento.No diremos que la redistribuci\u00f3n est\u00e1 mal por naturaleza. Incluso si los ingresos elevados fueran un reflejo perfecto de la productividad, los resultados del mercado no sirven como justificaci\u00f3n moral. Y dado que en realidad la riqueza es, a menudo, un reflejo de la suerte o el poder, existen argumentos s\u00f3lidos para recuperar una parte de esa riqueza a trav\u00e9s de los impuestos y usarla para contribuir a la fortaleza de la sociedad en general, siempre y cuando esto no termine con los incentivos para continuar creando riqueza.Y no hay raz\u00f3n para creer que as\u00ed ser\u00eda.En la historia, el per\u00edodo de mayor crecimiento y avance tecnol\u00f3gico m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido en los Estados Unidos se dio durante los cincuenta y los sesenta, a pesar de que los impuestos eran mucho m\u00e1s elevados para quienes dispon\u00edan de mayores ingresos y la desigualdad era mucho menor en comparaci\u00f3n con la \u00e9poca actual.As\u00ed que, regresando a mi pregunta original: no, los ricos no tienen que ser tan ricos como lo son ahora.

{"Headline": "Downfall of Andr\u00e9 Esteves Stands Out in Brazil Scandal", "Date": "2016-01-05", "News": "Supported byS\u00c3O PAULO, Brazil \u2014 Andr\u00e9 Esteves is not the only rich and powerful Brazilian to be swept up in a corruption investigation that has rocked the country.But what sets the case of Mr. Esteves \u2014 who built and led the investment bank BTG Pactual \u2014 apart from those of the other accused men and women is its apparent senselessness.\u201cThe deals BTG Pactual had with Petrobras and the government were relatively small and had nothing to do with the bank\u2019s core business, which was very profitable,\u201d said Luis Miguel Santacreu, a financial sector analyst with the Brazilian credit ratings agency Austin Rating. \u201cThey didn\u2019t need any of these deals to keep on growing.\u201dIndeed, BTG Pactual\u2019s collaborations with the government and Petrobras were mostly producing losses. The bank\u2019s trading, sales, and asset and wealth management divisions \u2014 none of which have much to gain from government connections \u2014 had been making more and more money. These areas were responsible for 84 percent of revenue in the third quarter of 2015.Still, the deals in question have led to a stunning fall for Mr. Esteves, a 47-year-old who in less than two decades built an investment banking powerhouse that in Latin America rivals Wall Street and European banks.Mr. Esteves was released in December from a communal cell in one of Brazil\u2019s most notorious prisons, the giant Bangu complex in Rio de Janeiro, but the Supreme Court of Brazil has imposed house arrest on him and prohibited him from taking any management role in the bank he personified.The downfall of Mr. Esteves has rattled the financial community here. More than any other financier, he was the face of Brazil\u2019s global ambitions during the country\u2019s recent, short-lived boom \u2014 in a hurry to grow and unafraid to compete against anyone, anywhere.He entered the financial world by chance. In 1989, while studying computer science in college, he took a job as a computer technician in a Rio de Janeiro investment bank, Pactual. Once there, he decided that he liked the business.\u201cHe taught himself, in his spare time, how bond trading worked,\u201d the bank\u2019s founder, Luiz Cezar Fernandes, said. \u201cIn a year, he knew more than the traders did. So I made him one.\u201dMr. Esteves earned big bonuses, which he did not spend. Instead, once he became a partner, he used the money he earned to increase his stake in the bank a little more each year until, in 1999, he led a group of other young partners in pushing out Mr. Fernandes and taking control of Pactual.Mr. Fernandes, now a partner in the S\u00e3o Paulo merchant bank Invixx, was bitter for a time, but he has since made peace with his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\u201cHis skill is strategy,\u201d Mr. Fernandes said. \u201cHe has vision. He also inspires incredible loyalty in people. He\u2019s driven, but it\u2019s not money or power he\u2019s after. It\u2019s success.\u201dHe soon had all three. With its harsh work ethic and big bonuses for big earners, Pactual grew. In 2006, Mr. Esteves and his partners sold the firm to the Swiss banking giant UBS for $3.1 billion. As part of the deal, he went to work for UBS.Two years later, as UBS staggered in the global financial crisis, reports circulated in Zurich and S\u00e3o Paulo that Mr. Esteves, with the help of Brazil\u2019s richest man, Jorge Paulo Lemann, was trying to buy the Swiss banking company.Nothing ever came of the reports. Mr. Esteves subsequently said he had merely considered buying a minority stake in UBS.Mr. Esteves left UBS and returned to Brazil, where he founded a new bank, BTG, which then bought Pactual back from UBS for $2.5 billion.Mr. Esteves became a double and perhaps triple billionaire along the way, but he never indulged in ostentation. At BTG Pactual, he had no office but worked at a table in the bank\u2019s wide-open operations room, along with the bank\u2019s other partners and associates.And as so many others did this decade when Brazil was growing rapidly, he started to bet that this growth would continue indefinitely.Unlike most Brazilian banks, which shy away from risk, BTG started to use its own money to buy stakes in a range of businesses, including pharmacies, parking lots, power plants and fitness centers.Some of these investments put the bank in business with the federal government.\u201cFor years, the public sector here was growing, giving out more and more contracts,\u201d said S\u00e9rgio Lazzarini, a professor at the Insper business school in S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cIf a business wanted to grow quickly, it looked to the government. Corruption was just part of the rules of the game.\u201dBut the game changed. Brazil\u2019s economy first stagnated, then fell into a deep recession; the government slashed spending; and prosecutors\u2019 investigations started to punish corruption in several companies in which BTG had teamed up with the government.A police search found a note indicating that in 2013, BTG may have paid a congressman, who is now the speaker of the lower house of Congress, about $12 million for legislative favors. Investigators are looking at several deals Mr. Esteves\u2019s bank made with Petrobras and other companies under investigation.Brazil\u2019s prosecutor general has asked the Supreme Court to charge Mr. Esteves with obstruction of justice, a crime that, if he is found guilty, could lead to eight years in prison. And the prosecutor general is reportedly preparing further charges.Mr. Esteves, BTG Pactual and the speaker deny all the accusations, and the court has yet to rule on the prosecutor general\u2019s request.Mr. Esteves\u2019s lawyer, Antonio Carlos de Almeida Castro, said that his client would not appeal his house arrest, but that the defense \u201cwill prove him innocent.\u201dInvestors in BTG Pactual appear less certain.Since Mr. Esteves\u2019s arrest, BTG\u2019s shares have fallen almost 50 percent, its bonds have been downgraded to junk, and it has been selling assets to ensure it has the cash to survive.An irony of Mr. Esteves\u2019s downfall in Brazil\u2019s national corruption scandal is that his bank had been becoming un-Brazilian. BTG\u2019s third-quarter earnings release said that more than 60 percent of its revenue would come from overseas in 2016.\u201cIf Andr\u00e9 Esteves did engage in illicit activity, then he took an enormous risk for what, in the end, would have been a modest benefit,\u201d said Jo\u00e3o Augusto Salles, a financial sector analyst at the Rio de Janeiro investment consultancy Lopes Filho. \u201cBut he ran the bank very aggressively and his ambition seemed to have no limits.\u201dVinod Sreeharsha contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders Battle for Party\u2019s Future", "Date": "2016-01-24", "News": "Supported byDES MOINES \u2014 The race between Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders, which voters will begin deciding a week from Monday, is not just about the White House anymore. It has intensified into an epochal battle over their vastly different visions for the Democratic Party.Mr. Sanders, a New Deal-style liberal from Vermont, last week became the party\u2019s first top-tier candidate since the 1980s to propose broad-based tax increases. He argues that only muscular government action \u2014 Wall Street regulations, public works jobs, Medicare for all \u2014 will topple America\u2019s \u201crigged\u201d economy.\u201cSomething is grotesquely wrong in America,\u201d he said Thursday in New Hampshire, urging voters to deliver a landslide in November that would cow Congress into enacting his agenda.Mrs. Clinton, a mainstream Democrat, has started contrasting herself with Mr. Sanders by championing a \u201csensible, achievable agenda\u201d and promising to build on President Obama\u2019s legacy in health care, the economy and national security. She is the classic continuity candidate: seeking support from blacks, Hispanics, women, union members and suburban voters, and proposing policies that are friendly to families and businesses \u2014 strategies that have defined the party since President Bill Clinton\u2019s election in 1992.\u201cThe middle class needs income, not tax increases,\u201d she said Thursday in Iowa.The question of whether Mr. Sanders can turn the liberal wing of the party into a true force again in presidential politics will have its first test in the Iowa caucuses next Monday. He has driven Mrs. Clinton into a tight race here, according to polls, and he has a lead among likely voters in the Feb. 9 New Hampshire primary.While Mrs. Clinton has many institutional advantages, in those states and the rest, Mr. Sanders has electrified huge numbers of young people \u2014 the party\u2019s future \u2014 with his critique of Democratic support for free-market capitalism and interventionist foreign policy. He appears determined to steer the party to the left, even though he is not a registered Democrat but rather an independent and a self-described democratic socialist.But many Democrats are torn about whether his liberalism, or Mrs. Clinton\u2019s pragmatism, will be enough to win a general election.\u201cThe early enthusiasm for Sanders reminds me of the McGovern and Mondale races, where two good men were only able to win one state each in their presidential campaigns,\u201d said John Breaux, a former Democratic senator from Louisiana, referring to liberalism\u2019s wipeouts behind George McGovern in 1972 and Walter F. Mondale in 1984. \u201cDemocratic voters don\u2019t want that to happen again.\u201dBut Democrats have also harbored reservations about the party\u2019s incremental approach to government since the 1990s. Mr. Clinton may have led the party away from liberalism, but many voters never lost a taste for it, said Bob Kerrey, a former Democratic senator and governor of Nebraska.\u201cProsperity made it easier to do,\u201d Mr. Kerrey said about the party\u2019s acceptance of Mr. Clinton\u2019s economic and deregulatory policies. However, he added: \u201cThe free-market approach to solving problems was discredited by the Great Recession. Liberalism is now seen as a remedy to excessive reliance on the market.\u201dAccording to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.The two futures for the Democratic Party are not only about ideology. The candidates have political strategy in mind, too, against the 2016 Republican nominee.Mr. Sanders\u2019s ideas and intensity could energize the party\u2019s base and, he believes, inspire a tidal wave of support from young people, ensuring a level of voter turnout that would favor the Democratic nominee. (Low turnout in 2014 helped many Republican candidates in House and Senate races, he notes regularly.)Yet Mr. Sanders risks easy caricature from Republicans as a tax-and-spend liberal who would turn the United States into a Scandinavian-style welfare state. And that could also hurt him with moderate Democrats.\u201cSanders\u2019s ideas are deeply felt, but at the same time he has really overreached,\u201d said Drew Westen, a professor of psychology at Emory University and a message consultant for congressional Democrats. \u201cThe average American is not going to buy into a vision of the federal government running one big health care program. Many people are actually afraid of that idea.\u201dMrs. Clinton, by embracing many of the policies of Mr. Obama and her husband, is aiming to rebuild the same coalitions that elected them, and hoping that the prospect of the first female president will draw even more women to the Democratic side this time. While Mr. Sanders would have to defend his far-left plans, Mrs. Clinton believes the Republican nominee, whoever that may be, will face the challenge of defending radically conservative ideas.But Mrs. Clinton\u2019s vision for the Democratic Party also comes with vulnerabilities: Many young people and liberals, and some women, believe her views are too moderate, and they do not trust her to fight for typical Americans. And Republicans will easily rally their voters if Mrs. Clinton, whom they have long demonized, becomes the Democratic standard-bearer.\u201cThere are so many Democrats who just don\u2019t believe the Clintons are true believers in the grass-roots progressive movement, and her ideas for the party aren\u2019t really changing that,\u201d said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University. \u201cShe\u2019ll need huge passion and turnout among Democrats to fight the Republicans\u2019 desire to finally beat her.\u201dIt is Mr. Sanders\u2019s message, not Mrs. Clinton\u2019s, that has had a more rousing effect on the voters who have heard those candidates the most over the last nine months: Democrats in Iowa and New Hampshire.Part of Mr. Sanders\u2019s magnetism is that he has been raging against income inequality and Wall Street capitalism for years, and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. recently observed that Mrs. Clinton was \u201crelatively new\u201d to talking so much about these issues. Even some liberal supporters of Mrs. Clinton say the stagnant wages and other financial burdens weighing down many Americans have created a prime opening for Mr. Sanders to restart a debate over the Democratic Party\u2019s priorities.\u201cWhen you have a tax system that is so horribly skewed and loaded with loopholes as ours has become, and big companies don\u2019t have significant taxes to pay, you\u2019re seeing a lot of Democrats asking what their party is going to do about it,\u201d said Michael S. Dukakis, the former Massachusetts governor, who was the Democratic presidential nominee in 1988.\u201cThe vast majority of people should be doing better in this economic recovery,\u201d said Mr. Dukakis, who is backing Mrs. Clinton. \u201c\u2018Why aren\u2019t we?\u2019 they ask. Bernie is talking right to them.\u201dYet both Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton have serious political vulnerabilities that have prevented either of them from convincingly selling a vision to clear majorities of voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, despite months of trying.Many Democrats question Mr. Sanders\u2019s ability to win the election. Though he does well in poll matchups against possible Republican nominees, the effects of his tax plans have barely started to sink in with voters. He also has little experience on foreign policy and has indicated he would resist intervening in overseas conflicts, raising concerns among some Democrats that he would focus on the economy at the expense of a strong American role in the world.For his supporters, though, his vision for the party is inspiring. Erin Bilbray, a Nevada Democrat who ran for Congress in 2014, said she was willing to pay more in taxes to guarantee health insurance for her two children as they grew older. And she said Mr. Sanders was better suited to upending an economic system that had sent many of her neighbors in Las Vegas into foreclosure, harming their community and driving down the value of her home.\u201cBeing a Bernie Sanders Democrat means loving my country so much that I am willing to sacrifice to pay for its education and health care,\u201d Ms. Bilbray said. \u201cThe middle class is tired of being the doormat of corporate America.\u201dBut Kay Kubik, a retired farmer who went to hear Mrs. Clinton speak on Thursday in Vinton, Iowa, said she thought Mrs. Clinton was \u201csincere and experienced about supporting policies that help out Democrats and all Americans.\u201d\u201cShe isn\u2019t in it only for herself, and she doesn\u2019t get angry about all the nasty things that people say about her,\u201d Ms. Kubik said. \u201cShe stays focused on the issues and what\u2019s doable, and that\u2019s what the party needs in a president.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: In \u2018City of Thorns,\u2019 Ben Rawlence Tells a Refugee Camp\u2019s Story", "Date": "2016-01-11", "News": "Supported byBooks of The TimesIn English, Dadaab means \u201cthe rocky hard place,\u201d a translation of such freakish metaphorical precision that Ben Rawlence, the author of \u201cCity of Thorns: Nine Lives in the World\u2019s Largest Refugee Camp,\u201d has the sense to use it with great restraint. Stamped on a dusty desert plain in Kenya, Dadaab \u2014 the camp of the book\u2019s title \u2014 is home to a half million inhabitants. Most are Somalis who have fled famine or terror in their home country (sometimes both), but others come from Sudan, Rwanda, Uganda, Ethiopia. What unites them all is that they live in a state of suspension seemingly interminable and intolerable.\u201cOn one side was the Kenyan state that harassed and ransomed the refugees with impunity,\u201d Mr. Rawlence writes, when he finally indulges the metaphor in full. \u201cOn the other was al-Shabaab\u201d \u2014 the militant Islamist group that\u2019s made a thorough ruin of Somalia \u2014 \u201cfrom which many had already fled at least once. The refugees were, literally, between the rock and the hard place that the name, Dadaab, embodied.\u201d\u201cNo one wants to admit that the temporary camp of Dadaab has become permanent,\u201d Mr. Rawlence writes. The camp was originally founded in 1992 to serve the 90,000 refugees fleeing Somalia\u2019s civil war. No one imagined that an entire generation of children would be raised there, or that so many more refugees would rush in, as the political chaos in Somalia moved from the third circle of hell to the ninth. \u201cNeither the past, nor the present, nor the future is a safe place for a mind to linger for long,\u201d he continues. \u201cTo live in this city of thorns is to be trapped mentally, as well as physically.\u201dAnd yet, from this harsh and unforgiving place, an unlikely metropolis has bloomed and today pounds with life. (Mr. Rawlence calls it \u201ccity of thorns\u201d because of the brittle thorn trees freckling the landscape, which make up the stuff of the refugees\u2019 daily lives \u2014 fences, huts, mosques.) Dadaab has its own radio station. It has its own markets, which sell everything from cellphones to books to camel intestines. It has its own hospitals and schools, its own makeshift cinemas and soccer leagues. It even has an unofficial red-light district.I do not, however, want to minimize the scope of Mr. Rawlence\u2019s efforts or achievements. Dadaab pops in three dimensions in \u201cCity of Thorns.\u201d Readers will get a sharp sense of its folkways; its unwritten rules and adhocracies; its hardy but mostly parasitical economy, based on smuggled goods and the resale of United Nations rations. They\u2019ll start to grasp the limits of relief agencies and the United Nations, and what kinds of unsavory compromises are required to care for the world\u2019s neediest.Mr. Rawlence\u2019s passages about Kenyan corruption fill the nostrils with a smell so rank that you can hardly breathe. The police rape for sport and bribe Somalis for all they\u2019re worth; after Kenya seized control of the Somali port city of Kismayo, Kenya\u2019s army and political class formed an unofficial alliance with Al Shabaab instead of destroying it, sharing profits from its illegal sugar and charcoal trafficking.And while I may have pined for richer portraits of some characters, there are others I won\u2019t soon forget, especially Tawane, the camp\u2019s valiant youth leader, who organizes a volunteer army to provide services \u2014 garbage collection, security, food distribution \u2014 after international agencies flee the camp, spooked by kidnappings and a spate of well-placed bombs. Essential to the community and educated in the camp\u2019s schools, Tawane has \u201creached Dadaab\u2019s glass ceiling\u201d and is now \u201ceager for a bigger life elsewhere.\u201d Yet the resettlement lottery has not been kind to him. He looks daily at Facebook posts of friends in the United States and elsewhere who\u2019ve had better luck.Once I finished \u201cCity of Thorns,\u201d I returned to its prologue, set in the White House, where Mr. Rawlence manages to convince the National Security Council that the refugees of Dadaab are not easily seduced by terror; on the contrary, they are fleeing it, and it has followed them there. \u201cI had fallen into the liberal lobbyist\u2019s trap,\u201d he writes. \u201cIf the youth were not at risk of being radicalized, then perhaps the N.S.C. didn\u2019t need to worry about Dadaab after all; the refugees could be safely forgotten.\u201dYet the refugees are still there, waiting and half-starving, their rations now at record lows. There\u2019s Isha, who still believes that her children\u2019s education in the camp will be worth something one day. There\u2019s Kheyro, an educated single woman who fears she will be slaughtered if she walks out of Dadaab, unaccompanied by a man. There\u2019s Guled, terrified he\u2019ll be kidnapped once again by Al Shabaab, just as he was in his youth.Is there really nothing to be done?City of ThornsNine Lives in the World\u2019s Largest Refugee CampBy Ben Rawlence384 pages.

{"Headline": "After a Tumultuous Year for Investors, the Experts Look Ahead", "Date": "2015-12-31", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseBut low gas prices and a strong dollar were good for United States consumers, who had more money to spend, lifting the American economy. Even though broad market averages were flat, United States stocks reached lofty valuations by historical measures.These are some of the big questions preoccupying investors as the new year gets underway. For answers, I turned to some of 2015\u2019s most successful investors and analysts for my annual look at the year ahead.\u25a0So much went wrong for investors in energy and other commodities this year that it\u2019s hard to imagine that 2016 could be any worse. This week, a barrel of Brent crude approached $36, the lowest since 2004, continuing what appears to be a record decline from over $100 a barrel in June 2014.The strong dollar added downward pressure on oil and commodities, which are priced in dollars, as the Federal Reserve pursued a tighter monetary policy. Global demand for oil grew in 2015, but not nearly fast enough to keep pace with supply. And China\u2019s economy, where rapid growth was supposed to drive demand for years, cooled noticeably.With oil prices so low, it\u2019s tempting to say the worst is over, as many hedge fund managers did earlier in 2015, only to get burned. But Damien Courvalin, senior strategist in the Global Investment Research Commodities team at Goldman Sachs, told me this week that it was too soon for the all-clear signal. While Goldman expects oil prices to recover eventually, even by late 2016, over the near term the same forces that drove prices to new lows in the last year, starting with oversupply, shadow the market. Goldman\u2019s three-month forecast for oil prices is $38, about where they are now, but they could go as low as $20, Mr. Courvalin suggested.\u201cWe\u2019re more concerned about the downside risks than the upside potential at this point,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople keep asking if it\u2019s time to get excited about energy, but we believe that conversation is premature.\u201dIn theory, slumping prices, and the resulting financial stress for marginal producers, should lead to cutbacks in production. There have been some, \u201cbut supply has proven surprisingly resilient,\u201d Mr. Courvalin said. After a long period of capital investment driven by high prices for oil and other commodities, many production facilities are only now coming on line, \u201cand they\u2019re going to produce, no matter what the price,\u201d Mr. Courvalin said.He compared recent oil price moves to the period from 1976 to 1989. After peaking in 1980, oil prices fell through much of the \u201880s, finally bottoming in 1988. So far, the current period, beginning in 2005, looks similar. If the pattern continues \u2014 a big if \u2014 a recovery should begin by 2018, which is still two years away. \u201cIt could even be another decade,\u201d Mr. Courvalin said, \u201cbefore prices sustainably return to the levels of the past few years.\u201d\u25a0Mr. Heugh, who is based in Hong Kong, manages the Morgan Stanley Institutional Fund Global Opportunity Portfolio, which gained over 20 percent in 2015. Mr. Nadel is senior portfolio manager in New York for Royce\u2019s International Premier Investment Fund, which gained over 17 percent in 2015, and the Royce European Small-Cap Fund, up nearly 14 percent. Both managers invest in relatively concentrated portfolios, by fund standards, that don\u2019t closely track broad indexes, which helped them outperform their respective indexes in the last year by a large margin. And both avoided the energy sector. Mr. Heugh\u2019s largest holdings as of November were Facebook, the software concern Epam Systems and Amazon. Mr. Nadel\u2019s were VZ Holding, a Swiss financial services company; Clarkson P.L.C., a shipping firm based in London, and Bajaj Finance in India.Several money managers are predicting another flat-to-down year for United States equities for the same reasons stocks were flat in 2015 \u2014 high valuations, expectations of rising interest rates, a strong dollar and continued weak oil and commodity prices.But both Mr. Heugh and Mr. Nadel see future opportunities in international stocks. \u201cThe U.S. has outperformed the rest of the world for quite a few years now, and the strong dollar has been exacerbating this trend,\u201d Mr. Heugh said. \u201cThese cycles tend to reverse themselves over time, sometimes violently.\u201dHe sees many opportunities in Asia, including China, which he notes is still growing, even if at a slower pace. \u201cAsia is trading at a discount to its historical multiples of free cash flow and earnings, while the U.S. and Europe are trading at premiums,\u201d he said.But Mr. Heugh focuses more on fundamental stock analysis and less on broad geographic or macroeconomic forces. He said he looked for high-quality companies with competitive advantages that deter potential competitors. Then, \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter which region outperforms in a given year or three- or five-year period, you will become partners in great businesses and have the potential to benefit as partners over time.\u201dMr. Nadel said he also looked for stocks of international companies that benefit from high barriers to entry. \u201cI\u2019m not big on predictions, but the stage is set nicely for investing internationally,\u201d he said. While the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has risen 75 percent over the last five years, international small-cap indexes have contracted slightly. \u201cDividend yields are over twice as generous outside the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cI think in 2016 we could see some catch-up.\u201dHe especially likes some companies based in India, a country with \u201csome of the best 10-year prospects in the world,\u201d and Brazil, whose market \u201chas to have hit rock bottom \u2014 at least, I hope so.\u201d He said he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about the prospects for emerging markets. He praised structural reforms in Japan and said a wave of immigration should eventually benefit developed European economies.\u25a0The long bull market in bonds sputtered in 2015, as the Fed finally raised its target federal funds rate by a quarter point for the first time since 2006. United States Treasuries and most investment-grade corporate bonds barely eked out positive returns, and junk bonds plunged in a panicky sell-off late in the year.Travis King, head of investment-grade credit at Voya Investment Management in New York, managed a 1.3 percent return for the Voya Investment Grade Credit Fund. While modest, that was better than most fixed-income funds, and Morningstar has ranked his fund the No. 1 corporate bond fund over the most recent three-year period. Mr. King said that even with the Fed expected to continue a slow but steady rise in interest rates, he anticipated modest positive returns again in 2016.\u201cOur market view is for a slow and gradual rise in the Fed funds rate, with Japanese and European rates staying very low,\u201d Mr. King said. \u201cIn that environment, we think corporate bonds will be a winning trade, but you have to be selective.\u201d In 2015, his fund rotated toward bonds from money center banks and other financial concerns, which helped it outperform its benchmark. He said he expected to continue that emphasis in 2016. \u201cWe think financials are still a good place to be overweight,\u201d Mr. King said.As for junk bonds, he said he thought that the worst of the sell-off might have run its course. \u201cYields are starting to push 9 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are still avoiding high-yield debt from the energy sector, but elsewhere you\u2019re seeing some stability. In a world where the 10-year Treasury is yielding 2.25 percent, 8 percent or 9 percent starts to look pretty interesting.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "President Obama\u2019s Call to America\u2019s Better Nature", "Date": "2016-01-12", "News": "Supported byEditorialIn his final State of the Union speech, President Obama endeavored on Tuesday to lift Americans above the miasma of a brutally negative presidential campaign to reflect on what the nation has endured and achieved since he took office in the midst of a dire recession.The speech was, of course, a summary of his accomplishments, but more important, a reminder that the optimism that made him the first African-American president and then the resilience that helped the nation weather economic and global crises over the past seven years are what position it best for the future.\u201cOur unique strengths as a nation \u2014 our optimism and work ethic, our spirit of discovery, our diversity, our commitment to the rule of law \u2014 these things give us everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generations to come,\u201d he said.In his speech, the president said much depends on Americans\u2019 ability to address several key challenges: ensuring that opportunity is equally shared; harnessing technology for the greater good; keeping the nation safe without becoming the world\u2019s police force; and having political leadership that reflects the country\u2019s best values.But so much remains to be done, obstructed by a Republican leadership implacable in its hostility to Mr. Obama, determined to oppose just about everything he proposed from the day he entered office.On the chaos of the Middle East, Mr. Obama pointed to Congress\u2019s failure to authorize war against the Islamic State, or ISIL, saying: \u201cIf this Congress is serious about winning this war, and wants to send a message to our troops and the world, authorize the use of military force against ISIL. Take a vote.\u201dHe reflected on the administration\u2019s success achieving global agreements, foremost being the nuclear deal with Iran. \u201cAs we speak,\u201d he said, \u201cIran has rolled back its nuclear program, shipped out its uranium stockpile, and the world has avoided another war.\u201d\u201cNow we\u2019ve got to accelerate the transition away from old, dirtier energy sources,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.\u201dOn jobs and the economy, the president pointed to a 5 percent unemployment rate and sustained growth. But Congress has blocked many job-creation initiatives, including more spending on energy and infrastructure. Still, the administration\u2019s failure to provide meaningful mortgage relief in the financial crisis meant that many homeowners never got the help they needed.The president closed his speech with an exhortation to improve the deplorable quality of the political debate now.\u201cMy fellow Americans, whatever you may believe, whether you prefer one party or no party, whether you supported my agenda or fought as hard as you could against it, our collective future depends on your willingness to uphold your duties as a citizen. To vote. To speak out. To stand up for others, especially the weak, especially the vulnerable, knowing that each of us is only here because somebody, somewhere, stood up for us. We need every American to stay active in our public life and not just during election time, so that our public life reflects the goodness and the decency that I see in the American people every single day.\u201dThose are inspiring words for Americans who are yearning for more civility from those in political life.Advertisement"}

Ryan said during a brief news conference Friday afternoon after numerous policy sessions, some of them with Senate Republicans. Calling 2016 a \u201cgenerational defining moment,\u201d Mr. Ryan said congressional Republicans would set the policy template for the campaign. \u201cThe country is crying out to be unified,\u201d he said.Privately, however, congressional Republicans repeatedly acknowledged their panic over the increasingly nasty primary race, and particularly the bombastic rhetoric of Donald J. Trump, who they fear could pose a risk of splintering the party and alienating voters. Some were equally worried about the rise of Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas. \u201cI think Marco Rubio is the right face and the right voice for the Republicans,\u201d said Representative Bill Huizenga, Republican of Michigan. \u201cCruz is just a little more edgy. I find Marco more optimistic.\u201dHouse Republicans seemed eager to get behind Mr. Ryan\u2019s agenda and to try to reset the tone of the campaign. \u201cThe presidential candidates are speaking in one-minute sound bites and really not saying anything,\u201d said Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.Republican leaders in the House and Senate demurred on whether they would write and vote on a bill this year. But members were concerned by a presentation of polling data, some Republicans said, that found that while the health care law remained unpopular with many people, Democrats had a double-digit lead over their party on the issue of health care.Mr. Ryan\u2019s determination to have a strong platform in place by the time a Republican candidate is chosen might also reflect his own personal assessment of the 2012 presidential contest, after he was on the losing ticket as Mitt Romney\u2019s vice-presidential nominee. Mr. Ryan on several occasions has said that Republicans came up short in providing voters with a sufficient enough contrast between their priorities and the policy goals of President Obama.Acknowledging the reality of the polls and the discipline that has historically been the spine of their party in an election year, Republican leaders made it clear they would support whoever ends up at the top of the ticket.Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, and Mr. Ryan said that any of the Republicans on stage, including Mr. Trump, would be a better choice for the country than either of the leading Democrats, Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\u201cI\u2019m excited about our field,\u201d said Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 3 House Republican. \u201cWhoever comes out of our field is going to be able to unite our party and is going to be able to win in November, because the contrast is going to be somebody who is fighting over who\u2019s more socialist, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. And our country\u2019s not a socialist nation.\u201dMr. Ryan also seems to be having a long honeymoon with the more restive conservatives in his conference. His presentation to members Wednesday night on their agenda received a \u201chuge standing ovation,\u201d Mr. Nunes said. \u201cIt was by far the best political speech by any member of the House or Senate I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Saudi Arabia Keeps Pumping Oil, Despite Financial and Political Risks", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Supported byCall it the Saudi calculus.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to panic,\u201d Abdalla el-Badri, secretary general of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, told reporters at the group\u2019s November 2014 meeting in Vienna. \u201cWe want to see how the market behaves.\u201dAnd yet the Saudis keep pumping oil at virtually full capacity. And they have persuaded their Persian Gulf OPEC allies \u2014 Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar \u2014 to do the same, despite mounting pressure from other big OPEC members to curtail production.Oil provides more than 70 percent of Saudi government revenue. And though the Saudis still have about $630 billion in financial reserves, they are spending them at a rate of $5 billion to $6 billion a month, according to Rachel Ziemba, an analyst at Roubini Global Economics in New York.But so far, Saudi Arabia is essentially betting that it can win an oil-price war of attrition \u2014 not only against its OPEC rivals like Iran, Iraq and Venezuela, but also against non-OPEC rivals like Russia and the many shale-oil producers in the United States that have contributed to the global glut.The Saudis argue that throttling back oil production for a short-term pop in the price would be throwing a lifeline to the shale producers in the United States, some of which have already shown signs of wilting in the current environment.Already, oil producers have dropped their rig count in the United States as bankruptcies spread in the oil patch. But daily production has remained resilient as the wells that remain become more efficient and as major oil projects in the Gulf of Mexico, conceived in an era of $100-a-barrel oil, come online.On top of this, Iran can increase exports now that Western sanctions have been partly lifted, potentially raising its daily production well above the current level of 2.9 million barrels a day.With the world awash in oil, the Saudis fear that cutting back might achieve nothing but erosion of their own share of the market \u2014 which is one of every nine barrels produced worldwide.All of this adds up to oil prices that are not likely to rise significantly higher any time soon, unless the Saudi kingdom suddenly changes course.\u201cIf prices continue to be low, we will be able to withstand it for a long, long time,\u201d Khalid al-Falih, the chairman of Saudi Aramco, the kingdom\u2019s national oil company, said last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.On Wednesday, Brent crude, an international benchmark, was trading around $31.80 a barrel. That is above the 12-year low of about $27 that oil hit last week. But it is still down more than 70 percent from the level of about $114 in mid-2014, before the price began collapsing.As daring, or even self-defeating, as the Saudi approach might seem, it is a policy born of pragmatism. Whatever Saudi Arabia does with oil production, its two big OPEC neighbors \u2014 Iraq and Iran, the Saudis\u2019 biggest regional rival \u2014 might have their own economic and geopolitical reasons to keep pumping or even raising output. And Russia, a big non-OPEC producer, is embroiled in a financial crisis from plunging oil prices and Western sanctions that might give it little choice but to maintain production and take whatever revenue it can.The Saudis also need a high level of production to support their export network and their domestic refineries and petrochemical industry.\u201cIn order to maintain an efficient economy in terms of investment you can\u2019t be pushing your production up and down a half a million barrels every time the market requires it to prop up prices,\u201d said Sadad al-Husseini, a former executive vice president of Saudi Aramco, who now runs Husseini Energy, a consulting firm with offices in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.Still, the Saudis know that they are in for tough times and that their dependence on oil has left them vulnerable.At a time of great political ferment in the Middle East, the plunging oil prices have gutted the export revenue that drove economic growth in Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf countries in recent years. The Saudi kingdom is staring at a growing budget deficit and facing the specter of an economic recession.The Saudi government has already had to curtail some of its generous social subsidies, recently increasing consumer gasoline prices. And in hopes of finding a new way to monetize its oil assets and begin diversifying its oil-dependent economy, the kingdom has even floated the idea of a public stock offering for Saudi Aramco.\u201cAs far as I am concerned, the strategy is not working,\u201d Nordine Ait-Laoussine, a former energy minister of Algeria, an OPEC member, said of the Saudi commitment to high oil production.Mr. el-Badri, the OPEC secretary general, who is Libyan, has evidently watched the market\u2019s behavior for long enough. This week, he called for a collective effort to reduce the global oil glut.Venezuela has been pressing for an emergency meeting of cartel members.But the Saudis are standing firm. \u201cOur investments in capacity of oil and gas have not slowed down,\u201d Mr. al-Falih, the Saudi Aramco chairman, said on Monday.The Saudis still speak darkly of the 1980s when as OPEC\u2019s \u201cswing producer\u201d they curtailed production to prop up prices but ended up badly burned when other producers did not go along. Seeing its oil revenue and market share shrink, Saudi Arabia fought back with its own price war.With OPEC having about one-third of the world market, for the Saudis to agree to a cut would mean persuading producers outside the organization, potentially including Russia, to make comparable trims. Analysts say that such a deal would be difficult to arrange, though it could eventually become necessary.\u201cI can imagine a set of circumstances that could develop this year, including a fall in U.S. output, where the economic pain would force countries to act to stabilize the price,\u201d said Jason Bordoff, a former energy adviser in the Obama administration who is now the director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University.But Mr. Bordoff and other analysts say that from a Saudi perspective this is not an opportune time to consider cuts. Not only is Iran\u2019s re-entry on the global market expected to increase supplies, but Iraq has also been increasing production rapidly.Still, though the Saudis are burning through their financial reserves, there is no danger of depleting them soon.Because of that, Bhushan Bahree, an OPEC analyst at the energy consulting firm IHS Energy in Washington, expects the Saudis to stay the course.If Saudi Arabia cuts production on its own, Mr. Bahree said, \u201cWhat is next? Iran produces more; Iraq produces more. So what have they done? Pushed the price up temporarily but lost market share, which they may have difficulty recovering.\u201dClifford Krauss contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.Cornel West, a prominent scholar; Killer Mike, an Atlanta rapper; and the former Ohio state senator, Nina Turner, praised Mr. Sanders during a 50-minute conversation with him on Sunday that was streamed live and filmed at a Marriott Hotel here. They spoke about King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last days organizing with union workers and planning a venture he called the Poor People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Campaign. The four went on to say that Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed ideas to protect the working class, break up large commercial banks, raise the minimum wage to $15 and reform police departments illustrated an extension of King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vision.Mr. West said that Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bid for the presidency illustrated a focus on the well being of working class people that had not been seen since the Rev. Jesse Jackson ran for president in the 1980s. He added that Mr. Sanders comes from what he called the \u00e2\u0080\u009cvanilla side of the country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d is sensitive to what he called \u00e2\u0080\u009cchocolate folk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and is willing to confront Wall Street in a way other longtime politicians will not.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a very unique moment and there is a real sense in which it could very well be America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last chance for the legacy of King to be addressed in a serious way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. West said of Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible ascendancy to the White House. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd it is a fascinating thing: It could be a brother from Brooklyn\u00e2\u0080\u009d who is leading the effort.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is not just a figure in a museum. He is part of a very rich tradition, a tradition of a people who have been terrorized, traumatized, and stigmatized for 400 years but still keep dishing out unbelievable courage and vision and most importantly, love and justice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. West said of King. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe were sitting at the church today in Mother Emmanuel Church and they were reading the words of Martin Luther King Jr. and it just made you shake and quiver. And I said to myself, this is what the Sanders campaign is about.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Sanders spoke briefly at Emanuel A.M.E. Church, where he sat in the first row, nodding and clapping.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think that while it is enormously important that we honor the life and work of Dr. King, it is even more important that we fulfill his vision and keep that struggle and that fight going until we have a nation in which we have broken down racism and a nation in which all of our people \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not just a few, but all of our people \u00e2\u0080\u0094 can enjoy dignity and a decent standard of living,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said to the packed church. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I would hope our mission together is about.\u00e2\u0080\u009dOn Sunday afternoon, Mr. Sanders also reminded those watching online that King was assassinated after he had started to talk about the Vietnam War and was in Tennessee to help workers at the time of his death. He also said that people too often forget that King was working on a march for poor people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rights that included organizing blacks, whites, Latinos and Native Americans.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe made this point all the time: Of course you want to break down segregation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said of King. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have the right to go to any school you want to go to. But then he asked, what does that matter if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the money to go to that school? And that takes him then to the whole issue of income and wealth inequality.

{"Headline": "Russians\u2019 Anxiety Swells as Oil Prices Collapse", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "Supported byKRASNODAR, Russia \u2014 Last year was bad enough financially for Sergei and Victoria Titov, both music teachers getting along in years. Her government salary was slashed by one third, and rampant inflation put some basic groceries like eggplant and cucumbers out of reach.Indignant and fearing worse amid Russia\u2019s accelerating economic problems, Sergei joined an unauthorized demonstration last week by hundreds of older Russians who gathered under the bronze statue of a Cossack horseman on the main square here and chanted, \u201cReturn our benefits!\u201dThe last time oil prices dropped so low and stayed there, in the 1980s, the Soviet Union disintegrated. Steadily rising prices since 2000 have lifted Russia out of poverty and economic chaos, buoying the prosperity of many Russians with it. Mr. Putin was lucky enough to be president for much of that period, but he now faces an extended decline, with real incomes shrinking.In Krasnodar, Mr. Titov, 64, braced for harder times. \u201cI do not know what they will cut, but I know it will affect us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are watching all this with alarm. It is clear that the government lacks the necessary resources to give us a normal life.\u201dSergei Galustian, 65, a retired police officer, lives on a downtown street with just 27 houses, their proximity making it easy to assess change.\u201cNobody is starving yet, but incomes are definitely down,\u201d he said, noting that homes are colder, that neighbors turn on just two lamps after dark where they once used five and that people have stopped buying new clothes. Retail sales across Russia were down by 13.1 percent for the year ending in November, according to official statistics, with car sales off nearly 40 percent.The 100 or so workers at the giant Seydin Machine Tool Factory, once the pride of the city during the Soviet era, have not seen a paycheck for a year and recently received layoff notices. They, too, have on occasion gathered in the main square to demand their back pay. The workers \u201chave to take to the streets!\u201d they wrote in an open letter to Mr. Putin.In a tradition dating from Soviet times, most firms, and especially state-run companies, tend to cut hours or stop paying salaries rather than fire people to diminish the chances for social unrest.In Moscow on Wednesday, about 15 employees of Sbarro, the pizza chain based in Ohio, stood in the brutal cold outside one franchise holding signs saying, \u201cGive us our money.\u201d Several said they had not been paid for at least three months.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.\u201cThey just tell us they have problems,\u201d said Sergei Yudichev, 50, a driver for the chain for more than two years.Albeit poorer, Russia remains a petro state, so there are pockets of plenty. Rolls-Royce reported a 5 percent jump in sales last year, the rich splurging as the value of their assets nose-dived.Others just seemed oblivious. Moscow\u2019s City Hall advertised for tenders for its banquets, noting that menu items should include foie gras and Parma ham (which is banned elsewhere in Russia because of sanctions).Social media erupted in mocking resentment. One Russian quoted a famous line by the Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovski from the 1917 revolution, \u201cEat pineapples, munch your grouse!\u201d and left unstated the second line, \u201cYour last day is coming, bourgeois!\u201dRussia pumped record amounts of oil last year, nearly 11 million barrels per day, but that pace will not save it in the current global glut. The main government strategy so far seems to be to cut spending and to rely on its reserves until oil prices improve.Russia has around $360 billion in foreign currency reserves and some $120 billion in two rainy day funds, down from just under $160 billion a year ago. At current spending rates, however, the two funds are expected to last only 18 months. It might also sell significant stakes in state-run companies like the oil giant Rosneft or Sberbank, and it will not increase military spending.Mr. Titov, a veteran organizer for the Communist Party, said he felt the economic problems were contributing to a corrosive sense of drift. \u201cRussia always lived with some manner of national idea, a goal: We were building socialism and communism,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is no national idea. Now, we just go with the flow and it is not clear in what direction.\u201dRussian involvement in wars in Ukraine and Syria has swelled the general whirlpool of anxiety, with the possibility of a global war discussed on state-run television. Some analysts accuse the Kremlin of deliberately seeking overseas adventures to distract people from domestic economic woes.\u201cPeople are more alarmed and more tense, because now we are speaking not only about their well-being, but their lives in general,\u201d said Valery Fedorov, director general of the government-owned Russia Public Opinion Research Center, known by its Russian initials, Vciom.Many analysts expect people to do what Russians always do in hard times \u2014 hunker down, tend to their vegetable plots and wait it out. Others say that Russians have gotten used to a higher standard of living and that they will protest losing it.The government allows street protests over issues like lost wages, but its distinctly authoritarian edge emerges in the face of political action.So far, local governments have reacted lightly to the protests. The governor of the Krasnodar Region restored transportation passes for the older Russians receiving the lowest pensions.Some residents, like Mr. Titov, groused that the wealth was being wasted on prestige projects rather than helping ordinary people. Still, he does not expect Russians to sour on Mr. Putin any time soon. In nearby Sochi, Russia spent around $50 billion to host the 2014 Winter Olympics, and a similar construction juggernaut is building stadiums nationwide for the 2018 World Cup.\u201cThe Russian people got what they wanted, a czar ruling the country,\u201d he said of Mr. Putin. \u201cWhat we need is an effective manager, but what we got is the Olympics, soccer and war.\u201dAlexandra Odynova contributed reporting from Krasnodar, and Ivan Nechepurenko from Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Investment Strategy to Save the Planet", "Date": "2016-01-05", "News": "If one of your New Year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resolutions was to do your part against climate change, keep reading. Now you can \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with your investments.You\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be following New York State\u00e2\u0080\u0099s example. At the Paris climate change talks last month, the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comptroller, Thomas DiNapoli, announced that the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Common Retirement Fund, for public employee pensions, will put $2 billion into a new investment fund created by Goldman Sachs that prioritizes companies with smaller carbon footprints. If that goes well, the retirement fund will put in more.The Common Retirement Fund is the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s third-largest pension fund, so it often makes news in the world of institutional investing. But this announcement is also big news for climate change.That trade-off is vanishing. In the last year, investors have been able to put money into funds that mimic the risk and return on benchmark indexes, while slashing the amount of carbon emitted by the included companies. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe expect returns equal to \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or we think could be superior to \u00e2\u0080\u0094 what we get in the Russell 1000,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said DiNapoli, referring to an index of large American companies. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be assessing the returns, and make sure it keeps to the Russell 1000. Our goal is to put even more of our public equities into the fund.\u00e2\u0080\u009dGoldman created the investment fund only for New York State. But similar funds introduced in 2014 or 2015 are open to other investors, although they have not yet attracted the capital to match New York State\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investment. And more are likely to come \u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially after New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vote of confidence in a form of green investing that may become mainstream.\u00e2\u0080\u009cGreen investing\u00e2\u0080\u009d to most people still means divestment \u00e2\u0080\u0094 selling stock in companies that produce fossil fuels, especially coal, the worst for climate change.But even McKibben acknowledges that divestment doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t affect the stock prices of fossil-fuel companies \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and it might not matter even if it did. The companies are so big that divestment has next to no financial impact on them.A second form of green investment is putting money into companies making products or services that reduce climate change: for example, solar- or wind-power producers, manufacturers of emission-cutting devices and systems, and companies that do carbon trading or energy-efficiency management. DiNapoli also announced that New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fund would invest some $1.5 billion more in its Green Strategic Investment Program, which already has $500 million in such companies.New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investment in Goldman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fund is an example of a third way. The fund starts with the Russell 1000, excluding coal producers. Then it groups companies by sector, such as health care or information technology, and within each sector increases the shares of companies with the lowest emissions, and reduces those of companies with higher emissions. Goldman will periodically re-weight the fund to try to mimic the returns of the benchmark, but to do so in the lowest-carbon way possible. Goldman says the historical performance of the basket of stocks matches the performance of the Russell 1000 while reducing carbon emissions by 70 percent.This is called index or passive investing because there is no active money manager trying to beat the market by picking stocks. Passive funds seek only to match the market, but they outperform active funds for investors 75 percent of the time, largely because the passive funds\u00e2\u0080\u0099 fees are much lower.Why do these funds matter? First, because they could become very, very big.\u00c2\u00a0Second, all companies, not just energy producers, emit carbon, and burning carbon releases far more greenhouse gas than extraction of it does. So these funds use the market to encourage all companies to reduce their emissions. By putting money into the most environmentally responsible companies in each sector, they help those companies grow at the expense of less responsible ones, while creating an incentive for all to bring down emissions.Investors have long been able to choose indexes made of companies that are mid-sized, or companies located in Eastern Europe, or pharmaceutical manufacturers, or companies that are consistent with Islamic law. Now they can also choose low-carbon companies.Can these funds be sure they will match the benchmark index? Nope. As every prospectus says, past performance is not a guarantee of future returns. But matching is easier to do with a low-carbon fund than with many other types. The portfolio is still broadly diversified, with carbon-efficient companies in each category. (Some funds exclude fossil fuel companies, and some don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.)Read previous contributions to this series.There are other reasons for the current interest in low-carbon index funds.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Institutional investors are increasingly moving money into passive funds to reduce fees, and universities are under pressure from students to do more than divest.DiPerna worked with the oceanographer Jacques Cousteau in the 1970s. In 1979 she documented coral bleaching due to warming oceans; she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been working on climate change, then, for nearly 40 years. She helped to establish carbon trading markets in Chicago and in China. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I have never seen anything more important than the mainstreaming of environmental issues in the economy as we know it today,\u00e2\u0080\u009c she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not enough for the vanguard to act. And the mainstream has caught up to the vanguard. The financial services sector is ahead of the discussions in Paris.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe also said that New York State\u00e2\u0080\u0099s DiNapoli \u00e2\u0080\u009chasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t said he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s divested from coal. He still has a billion invested in ExxonMobil. He says he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doing shareholder engagement, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s O.K. We say: you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had two decades.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe green index funds, Henn said, are only a start. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking at which oil companies are better because they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t flare as much methane.

{"Headline": "A Smarter\u00a0Plan to Make Retirement Savings Last", "Date": "2016-01-01", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsLAST month, President Obama inaugurated yet another way to encourage Americans to save for retirement. In the new myRA accounts, workers can save up to $15,000 in a low-fee investment plan that, like a government savings bond, guarantees the principal. The accounts are a small step toward helping households save, but they are not an effective solution to the coming retirement crisis.Starting in 2020, the numbers of very low-income elderly will rise sharply as the retired population soars to almost 56 million. More middle-class working Americans will be poor or near poor after they reach the age of 65. Most currently have inadequate 401(k)-type accounts or no retirement account at all. For good reason, voters tell pollsters that their top economic concern is retirement security.We need a bolder plan, which we are calling the guaranteed retirement account (G.R.A.). Under our proposal, all workers and employers will have to make regular payments into a G.R.A., which builds until retirement age, then pays out a supplemental stream of income until that person and his or her beneficiary die.The current system \u2014 a mix of 401(k)s and individual retirement accounts (I.R.A.s) \u2014 is broken. These plans are individually directed, voluntary and leaky. Just over half of workers don\u2019t have access to a workplace retirement plan. According to the National Institute on Retirement Security, Americans between the ages of 40 and 55 have retirement savings of $14,500, when they will need between 20 and 30 times that amount. Many people take money out before they retire. And the wealthy tend to pay lower fees and get higher subsidies for their savings.A bigger flaw is the way these plans hinder wise investing. Individualized retirement accounts are effectively restricted to short-term liquid stocks and bonds because they are designed to allow people to withdraw their money before retirement. So employees are paying for liquidity they don\u2019t need and achieving subpar results. Traditional pension plans consistently perform better because they are diversified in long- and short-term investments.In our plan, the more than 95 million workers without a pension plan would each have his or her own G.R.A. managed by an independent federal agency. Workers and employers would each contribute a mandatory minimum of 1.5 percent of the salary or contract. The current tax deduction for retirement savings would be converted to a $600 refundable tax credit to pay for the contributions of households below median income.Workers could not withdraw money early, even for emergencies \u2014 and they won\u2019t like that. But allowing exceptions creates a slippery slope. Just as Social Security is protected from early withdrawal, retirement accounts should be used for old-age income. Employers won\u2019t like paying more. But in return, they are free from administrating and worrying about providing retirement plans if they don\u2019t offer a 401(k) or pension. In the long run, employers would benefit because a nation of financially secure retirees would pre-empt higher corporate taxes.Individuals would not make investment decisions directly. Instead, low-fee diversified retirement portfolios would be created by a board of professionals who would be fiduciaries appointed by the president and Congress and held accountable to investors. The fees and investments would be much less prone to corruption because the managers\u2019 income would not depend on the investments, the fees would be disclosed, and the accounts separated from government funds and owned by the individuals.Since contributions would be pooled and fees kept low, a guarantee of a return of around 3 percent \u2014 about half the expected return on stocks over the long term \u2014 would be essentially costless even as the underlying rate fluctuated with the market and inflation. For someone making an average salary of about $48,000, a 3 percent contribution would yield about $170,000 over a lifetime. Three percent is not an adequate saving rate, it is a starting base. Our plan would provide a lifelong annuity, like a defined benefit plan, so no one would face the risk of outliving his or her money.This proposal would require federal legislation. Many states, like California, are now implementing a version of what we are proposing, but the plans aren\u2019t mature enough for us to know if they work. People in their 50s and 60s won\u2019t be helped as much as younger people, but some savings can help delay collecting Social Security. Most nations support retirees through universal two-tier systems consisting of a Social Security-type plan and funded workplace pensions. Our plan would guarantee millions of Americans safe and secure retirements that would benefit them, their families and the nation\u2019s economy.Advertisement"}

Rizai, chief executive of Workiva, a cloud-based software firm. The hunt for workers is unrelenting, he said. \u201cWe always have openings.\u201dAt 3.4 percent, Iowa\u2019s unemployment rate is among the lowest in the country. With major metropolitan areas \u2014 crowded with hard-hat construction sites \u2014 painting an alluring picture of steady economic progress, business leaders here retain a sunny optimism that is rarely heard from the presidential candidates.But now that Iowa has achieved a tightening labor market that is the envy of most other states, many companies are confronted with a different set of challenges pushing them to rethink everything from recruiting to economic development.Some immigrants, particularly those without sought-after credentials in technology or science, say they have had trouble finding a job. Salih Salih, 34, who came to the United States as a refugee from Eritrea 10 years ago, said he believed his accent had been a handicap for him and many other people. \u201cThey\u2019re measuring their ability by how they speak English,\u201d said Mr. Salih, who has experience in maintenance and as an electrician.Mr. Salih has found temporary work through People360, an employment agency in Des Moines, but has struggled to find a permanent position despite a college degree and stellar evaluations.Immigrants can encounter difficulties, said Mr. Nelson, the Kemin chief executive, but he added that the acute labor shortage was nudging some skeptics in the business community to be more welcoming. \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s going to relieve us is getting immigrants into the state,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving babies is still a 20-year process.\u201dWith a growing number of retirees and stiff competition for young workers from surrounding Midwestern cities, getting people to resettle in Iowa is necessary for growth, said David A. Swenson, an economist at Iowa State. The state\u2019s important meatpacking, animal feed and dairy industries \u201chave been able to maintain profitability because of immigrant labor.\u201dBut even a relatively modest change in Iowa\u2019s demographics has helped foster a political backlash.Indeed, the state has a hard time attracting outsiders. For some employers, the recruitment strategy includes luring home people with an Iowa connection.\u201cAs a local business, we want people who are tied into the area,\u201d said David Kenworthy, chief executive of Storey Kenworthy, an office supply and furniture company. \u201cWe like to have people returning to Iowa, raise their family and put in roots.\u201dMark Core, an executive vice president at Vermeer, said that his customers say \u201cthe No. 1 thing holding back growth is labor \u2014 every time.\u201dSmall-town Iowans have a huge role in picking the next president. Their deep commitment to the process paints a distinct portrait of democracy.The shortage has a ripple effect. \u201cIt hurts a lot thinking we could add even more people if our end users could find more people to operate our machinery,\u201d Mr. Core said.How the lives of six residents intersected with the campaigns in the last week.Potential newcomers are given a detailed assessment of a particular area\u2019s labor market: how many people are unemployed or willing to switch jobs; how far they would commute; and a sampling of wages.When a company\u2019s representatives (Ms. Durham would prefer not to name names) recently came looking to pay below the $10 median wage that many Iowans now consider the minimum acceptable, Ms. Durham told them, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to find people at that wage.\u201dMany employers say they have raised wages to attract workers, particularly skilled ones, but the insistent complaints about labor shortages have put less pressure on wages in Iowa than expected, economists say.\u201cWage and salary earnings are very much less than the overall national average,\u201d said Mr. Swenson, of Iowa State, citing sectors that include finance, insurance and professional services. \u201cIf the labor supply is tight and you\u2019re not bidding up prices, you\u2019re just making noise.\u201dSome employers have an eye on the rearview mirror, where the last recession still looms large. Though Storey Kenworthy had a record year in 2015, Mr. Kenworthy, its chief, remembers seeing revenue drop more than a third in 2008 and being forced to cut staff. Since then, \u201cwe tried to look at things a little differently,\u201d he said, citing fixed costs like labor. A result is a trend around the country: more emphasis on nonwage benefits and bonuses that can be trimmed back if business dips. Since 2011, wages at the firm have risen to 2.5 from 2 percent annually, Mr. Kenworthy said, with employees now bringing home $48,000 on average. Yearly bonuses and profit sharing add 10 percent more.David Leto, executive vice president of the Palmer Group, an employment agency in Des Moines, said wages had steadily increased but \u201cemployees know not to ask for the moon here.\u201dEmployers are also conscious of keeping parity among existing workers and new hires, he said.He echoed a theme voiced by many Iowa employers: Here, someone can \u201clive big\u201d \u2014 find good schools for children and live in a comfortable house at a fraction of the cost on the coasts.\u201cNot everyone,\u201d Mr. Rizai said, \u201cwants to go to Silicon Valley.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Over 50, Female and Jobless Even as Others Return to Work", "Date": "2016-01-01", "News": "Supported byLaid off at the start of the recession from the diagnostic testing firm in Seattle where she spent more than three decades, Ms. McAfee, 58, has not worked since 2007. \u201cI\u2019ve been applying and applying and applying,\u201d said Ms. McAfee, who has relied on her savings and family to get by as she fights off attempts to foreclose on her home. At interviews, she said, \u201cThey ask, \u2018Why has it been so long?\u2019\u201dAt 5 percent, the jobless rate may be close to what economists consider full employment, but that headline figure doesn\u2019t capture the challenges still facing millions of Americans who have yet to regain their footing in the workplace.Ms. McAfee is part of a group that has found the postrecession landscape particularly difficult to navigate: women over 50.That is especially striking because many recent economic and social trends \u2014 the decline of manufacturing and the rise of health care, the advance of educated women into professions and jobs once mostly occupied by men \u2014 were seen as harmful to working-age men and advantageous for the growing ranks of working women.But many of these older women now earn far less and use many fewer skills than they did before. Others have been left stranded without any job for months or even years. Some have given up the search altogether.The employment picture has definitely improved since then, economists point out, and more older women have managed to return to work. Still, the waves from the recession, which ended six and a half years ago, continue to upend many people who were cast aside during and immediately after the storm.\u201cHow long people take to find a new job has been much longer than in previous recessions,\u201d said Alexander Monge-Naranjo, a co-author of the St. Louis Fed study. \u201cThe natural question is, Why?\u201dThere are no simple answers.When it comes to women over 50, one theory that makes sense to Mr. Monge-Naranjo is that those who dropped out of the labor force to take care of children when they were younger can\u2019t easily get back in. \u201cThey did not see that the labor market was going to be so tough and it\u2019s taking quite some time to go back to normal,\u201d he said.That has been Lynn Colafrancesco\u2019s experience. Once a vice president at a reinsurance company, Ms. Colafrancesco, now 59 and divorced, started determinedly looking for a full-time job three years ago. As soon as she mentioned that she had taken off time to care for two children, she could see in the interviewer\u2019s face that she had been summarily dismissed.\u201cNow I don\u2019t even mention about my kids,\u201d Ms. Colafrancesco said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to hear that.\u201d To make ends meet, she works as a substitute teacher a couple of days a week and rents out rooms in her house in Fairfield, Conn.Certainly older workers \u2014 male and female \u2014 must contend with age discrimination.\u201cI have been told in interviews that they want somebody younger,\u201d said Karen Lamkin, a lawyer with 25 years of experience who lives outside Boston and has been out of work for three years. \u201cIt does not matter that I would be satisfied with the salary for a junior position.\u201dThe question is whether these factors operate even more powerfully for women than for men, Ms. Wanberg said. Women, who are much more likely to be burdened with caregiving responsibilities, even as they age, may require more flexibility in their schedules, for example.Some simply do not want to settle.With her house and car paid off, and some investment income coming in, Susan McNeill Spuhler, 52, an engineer who was laid off in April 2013, said she was waiting for the right fit. She has seen friends in more desperate financial straits \u201ctake any job and then spiral down\u201d because the job or the company was subpar.Ms. Spuhler and others now in their 50s, 60s and 70s were among the waves of women who entered the paid labor force in record numbers, changing the face of the American economy. Even as men\u2019s participation rate in the labor force plunged, women \u2014 especially those 55 and older \u2014 have for the most part continued to join.But while older workers generally have lower unemployment rates than younger ones, those who find themselves jobless, for whatever reason, tend to find themselves stuck there for longer. And women 55 and older who lose a job have more trouble than men getting another one, according to Sara E. Rix, an analyst and former senior researcher for AARP, the lobbying organization for older Americans.\u201cOlder displaced women are less likely than displaced men of the same ages to be re-employed and more likely to have left the labor force,\u201d she noted in a recent analysis.The type of occupations dominated by women may play a role as well. For example, \u201cpublic teacher employment is still below what it was in 2007,\u201d said Elise Gould, senior economist at the liberal Economic Policy Institute. \u201cAnd that definitely disproportionately affects women.\u201dWhile unskilled workers are at the greatest disadvantage when it comes to finding work, many older women with impressive educational credentials and r\u00e9sum\u00e9s tell discouraging tales of being turned down for job after job.Julie Woodbury, a 57-year-old Army veteran who lives in a suburb of Minneapolis, went back to earn a doctorate in communications after leaving the military. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely frustrating,\u201d Dr. Woodbury said. \u201cI just can\u2019t find something permanent.\u201d She is not counted among the long-term unemployed, but finds herself cycling on and off the jobless rolls, as one short-term contract ends and she waits for another to begin.Meryl Manthey, 63, pointed out that she was not counted among the jobless either. \u201cI\u2019m making zero income, but I\u2019m considered self-employed,\u201d said Ms. Manthey, who got her real estate license when she moved back to her mother\u2019s homestead in Wantagh, N.Y., from California three years ago after a divorce. The cross-country resettlement followed years of frustrated job searching after she was laid off from her job doing web-based training.As for Ms. McAfee, she now recognizes that it is all too easy for almost anybody to fall over the edge. \u201cI did everything you\u2019re supposed to do,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I\u2019m on the other side of the rainbow, and it\u2019s not pretty over here.\u201dTwitter: @PatcohenNYT Advertisement"}

A significant amount of land, it turns out. There are roughly 1,000 factories in the chain of Israeli-administered \u201cindustrial zones\u201d strung across the West Bank. The geographic footprint of these commercial enterprises, together with shopping centers and agricultural projects, exceeds the built-up areas of settler housing.As the H.R.W. report makes clear, these steps are consistent with international law. Since all companies that do business in or with settlements inevitably contribute to human rights violations, they should stop. And since no country recognizes Israeli sovereignty over the occupied territories, all of Israel\u2019s trading partners should insist that the label \u201cMade in Israel\u201d be removed from products from the settlements.The Obama administration has made it clear that it does not accept the conflation of the settlements and Israel. When the Customs Bill reaches his desk, Mr. Obama may take the rare step of issuing a signing statement objecting to its pro-settlement language. But if this provision becomes law, it will be a major victory for the Israeli right, albeit one that it may come to regret. The more the line between Israel and the occupied territories is blurred, the more likely the rest of the world will be to question the legitimacy of not just the settlements but Israel itself.

{"Headline": "Seeking Ranchland in Texas, Where Wealth Is Measured in Acres", "Date": "2016-01-18", "News": "Supported byJay Ellis, an investment fund founder, may be the only person in Texas who is giddy about collapsing oil prices.\u201cOil is $33. Markets are in turmoil. The timing couldn\u2019t be more perfect,\u201d he wrote in a recent email. (Oil has continued its slide since, settling below $29 on Monday.) Although many in his state fret about the implications of cheap oil, Mr. Ellis sees it as an opportunity to buy another crucial asset: ranchland.\u201cRight now, you\u2019re seeing the first signs of panic,\u201d said Mr. Ellis, who started Sporting Ranch Capital, based in Dallas. In 2012, the group, which is backed by the Texas billionaire T. Boone Pickens, opened its first private equity fund to buy and restore ranch property throughout the West, including Colorado, Idaho, Utah and New Mexico.Now, Mr. Ellis is raising a $100 million, Texas-only ranch fund. The first fund focused on restoring and enhancing ranch property to improve hunting and fishing habitats, but the new fund is aimed at scooping up $15 million to $25 million \u201ctrophy ranches\u201d from owners who want to sell quickly and quietly. \u201cWhen you make your giant hit down here, you buy a ranch and a jet,\u201d Mr. Ellis said. \u201cThe ranch goes first because your jet goes with your obituary.\u201dIn Texas, where wealth is measured not in dollars but in acres, land prices have for decades followed the price of oil. \u201cThere is this ongoing love for the land among Texans, to the point that if you are a Texan who gets wealthy, one of the first things you start to look at is a ranch,\u201d said Charles Gilliland, a research economist with the Real Estate Center at Texas A&M University.Oil money helped drive statewide rural land prices to a record high of $2,354 an acre in 2014 \u2014 more than double the price per acre in 2004.Now, after the collapse of oil prices from more than $100 a barrel 18 months ago, Mr. Ellis is wagering that this link between land and oil will create opportunities to buy premium ranches at 2008 and 2009 prices, or about a 25 percent discount.\u201cTexas pride is going to be a big part of this,\u201d said Mr. Ellis, who said he had identified two ranches that fit his criteria but declined to offer details. The fund will offer sellers a quick close \u2014 30 to 60 days \u2014 and spare them the indignity of listing their ranch at a reduced price. Investors will have access to hunting and fishing on fund-owned ranch properties during the holding period. The minimum investment is $1 million.Historically, rural land prices have closely tracked oil prices, typically with a one- to three-year lag, according to Texas A&M data going back to 1966. The starkest example of this link is the late 1980s oil shocks, when land prices plunged 30 percent in two years.Oil prices dropped 67 percent from November 1985 to March 1986. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just oil,\u201d Mr. Gilliland said. \u201cTax laws changed to make real estate less attractive as an investment, and we had the savings and loans crashing and burning.\u201dOver the last couple of decades, the Texas economy has benefited from the discovery of oil from shale. This has been a boon for land prices. Although mineral rights are part of the equation, the bigger component is recreation. \u201cIn Texas, everybody wants to own some dirt,\u201d said D\u2019Ann Harper, a broker and owner of Coldwell Banker D\u2019Ann Harper Realtors, based in San Antonio.Land is also the preferred asset. \u201cA lot of old Texas ranchers don\u2019t trust the stock market, and they aren\u2019t crazy about bonds, either, but they do understand land,\u201d Mr. Gilliland said.Statewide land prices increased 79 percent from 2004 to 2008. After a 6 percent decline in 2009 \u2014 oil dipped below $40 a barrel during the financial crisis \u2014 land prices kept rising, increasing 31 percent from 2010 to 2014.\u201cThere were a lot of people after 2008 betting it would be like the 1980s. That never happened,\u201d said David Burgher, a broker associate with the Ranch & Land Division of Briggs Freeman Sotheby\u2019s International Realty. \u201cI think people have gotten smarter and not knee-jerking.\u201dThe Texas economy also appears to be more diversified. A 2015 report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas estimates that, as of 2013, oil and gas accounted for roughly 13 percent of the income generated in the state but only 2.5 percent of the jobs. Although a drop in oil prices has affected job growth \u2014 Texas will lag the nation for the first time this century \u2014 more than a million jobs have been created across all sectors since 2012.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.\u201cStrong oil prices didn\u2019t hurt, but it\u2019s not the only thing driving prices,\u201d said Mr. Burgher, who said he had not seen a significant decline in land prices.\u201cClearly, the fact that oil prices are going down isn\u2019t going to help ranch prices,\u201d said Brian Sharpe, a U.S. Trust market investment executive in Houston. Whether land prices will fall along with crude, however, remains to be seen. Not only is the economy more diversified, he said, but there are areas within oil and gas, namely refiners, that have not been hit as hard. \u201cI\u2019m not sensing any panic or abnormal stress,\u201d he added.Statistics from Texas A&M support this observation. Prices per acre increased in each of the first three quarters in 2015, and preliminary numbers for the fourth quarter show the median price per acre hitting new highs. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way we will be unscathed, but there are things that make it different than in the past,\u201d Mr. Gilliland said. He said the large quarterly increase corresponded with a drop in typical acreage, which may suggest that it is the smaller ranches that are selling.\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of inquiries because of the price of oil going down,\u201d Ms. Harper said. \u201cPeople are wondering if it\u2019s a good time to buy.\u201dIt is the trophy ranches that, according to Mr. Ellis, are most dependent on crude. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s not going to look like the 1980s, but we think we can get premium ranches at 2008 prices,\u201d Mr. Ellis said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need 20 examples. We just need four or five of these big pieces.\u201d Investors in the fund, he noted, will pay fees only on invested capital; if the fund cannot find suitable ranch land to buy, it will return investors\u2019 money.It is too early to declare victory on the first ranch fund. Four of the five ranches it bought and restored are now on the market. \u201cWe are very confident returns are going to be in the high teens net of fees on our returns,\u201d said Mr. Ellis, who, before starting Sporting Ranch Capital, ran Morgan Stanley\u2019s institutional sales office in Dallas.It was there that he met Mr. Pickens, who was a client, and eventually pitched to him the idea of a ranch fund. The original fund attracted 14 investors, including tech millionaires, and oil and gas billionaires, most of whom are from Texas. Mr. Ellis believes that a Texas-only ranch fund will draw interest from investors around the country, including institutions, assuming they can move quickly.At Republic Ranches, one of the largest ranch brokers in the state, a partner and broker, Bryan Pickens (no relation to T. Boone Pickens), is starting to see the effect of one year of $40 to $50 oil prices in some parts of Texas. \u201cWe thought prices would drop 3 percent to 5 percent, but it\u2019s closer to 8 percent to 10 percent,\u201d he said. And transaction volume \u201chas definitely taken a breather.\u201d Most buyers of premium ranches are Texans and have ties to oil and gas, whether directly or indirectly. \u201cI think we will see some distressed sellers,\u201d he said.And that is all it may take to make a Texas ranch fund viable, Mr. Ellis said.Nobody could have predicted in June 2014 that oil was going to drop to $30 from $100, Mr. Ellis said. \u201cIt caught everybody by surprise.\u201d And few people thought prices would stay so low for so long. \u201cAt a round table at Boone\u2019s ranch last February, I stood up and started talking about the Texas fund idea, and it was a golf clap reception at best,\u201d he said. \u201cAs more time goes on, cheap oil affects the entire state of Texas.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In a parallel poll of Democrats, 35 percent said that jobs and the economy were paramount. Those issues ranked second among Republicans, 27 percent of whom named jobs and the economy as the most important.In addition to the economy and foreign policy, Democrats in Iowa tend to focus on health care and climate change. Fifteen percent and 11 percent, respectively, call those the most important factors in their vote, according to Quinnipiac. Republicans worry more about the budget deficit, with 10 percent calling it the most important issue.New Hampshire shares Iowa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main concerns, and its partisan divide. About a third of likely Republican primary voters say national security and terrorism are their top issues, according to a Monmouth University poll conducted this month. Another 20 percent say jobs and the economy are most important.Among New Hampshire Democrats, roughly three in 10 pointed to jobs and the economy as the main factors when choosing a candidate to support. About half that number said national security and terrorism.These partisan differences correspond to the campaign speech on each side. Donald J. Trump, the leading candidate in most Republican primary polls, has emphasized a bellicose foreign policy and has pledged a no-holds-barred approach to fighting terrorism, while offering only vague prescriptions on economic policy.On the Democratic side, Senator Bernie Sanders has risen steadily in the polls on the strength of his redistributive economic proposals, while voters consistently say they trust Hillary Clinton more to handle foreign policy.When asked without reference to the presidential race, residents in New Hampshire were most likely to call drug abuse the greatest problem facing their state; a quarter now say so, according to an October WMUR Granite State Poll. This represents a drastic change from a year before, when the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heroin epidemic was not as pronounced, and only 3 percent worried most about drug abuse, according to WMUR.But only a tiny slice of New Hampshire voters say that drug policy is their top consideration when choosing a presidential nominee, according to the Monmouth polls. Still, hopefuls on both sides of the aisle are confronting the issue.Some Republicans have spoken in personal terms about their families\u00e2\u0080\u0099 struggles with drug addiction, and candidates in both parties have said they will emphasize medical treatment for nonviolent drug offenders over jail sentences.

The company announced his death.Mr. Koc (pronounced kotch), who was chairman of Koc Holding, Turkey\u2019s largest conglomerate, died at the American Hospital, which his family owns, after having a heart attack while exercising at his home. He was resuscitated by his fitness coach and taken to Beykoz State Hospital in Istanbul before being transferred to his family\u2019s hospital. He had a history of heart disease and had undergone weight-loss surgery.Educated in Switzerland and the United States, Mr. Koc had been chairman since 2003, when he took over from his father, Rahmi Koc. His company, based in Istanbul and founded by Vehbi Koc, Mustafa Koc\u2019s grandfather, comprises more than 100 companies and has 90,000 employees. It is the only Turkish company listed in the Fortune 500.Among other companies, Koc Holding owns Turkey\u2019s largest industrial enterprise, the Tupras oil refining group, as well as Arcelik, a household goods maker, and the Yapi Kredi Bank. It has joint ventures with Fiat and Ford, accounting for about 45 percent of Turkey\u2019s automobile production.Mr. Koc was born in Istanbul on Oct. 29, 1960. He was educated at the Lyceum Alpinum Zuoz, an international boarding school in the Alps near St. Moritz, Switzerland, and attended George Washington University, graduating in 1984.In 2013, at the height of antigovernment protests in Taksim Square in central Istanbul, Divan Istanbul Hotel, a Koc property, opened its doors to protesters escaping tear gas fired by the police at the adjacent Gezi Park.The government accused the company of aiding the protesters, and several audit teams raided nine of its provincial offices, including those of Tupras.Mr. Koc denied having acted against the government, though he urged that it institute reforms to ensure a peaceful society without harming Turkey\u2019s economy.Survivors include his wife, Caroline; two daughters, Esra and Aylin; and two brothers, Ali and Omer.An earlier version of a capsule summary with this obituary misspelled the name of Mr. Koc\u2019s conglomerate. It is Koc Holding, not Koh Holding.Advertisement"}

Speaking at the start of the regular weekly cabinet meeting, Mr. Netanyahu said, \u201cIsrael\u2019s policy has been and will remain exactly what it has been: not to allow Iran to acquire nuclear weapons.\u201dHe also said that the recent accord would strengthen and embolden Iran\u2019s leaders, since the lifting of most sanctions would free up money for Tehran to arm and support the government of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria, Shiite militias and Israel\u2019s enemies in the region, including Hezbollah, Hamas and Islamic Jihad.\u201cWhat is clear is that Iran will now have more resources to dedicate to their terrorism and aggression in the region and in the world, and Israel is prepared to deal with any threat,\u201d he said.Mr. Netanyahu believes, as he said in a statement issued late Saturday, when it became clear that the United Nations would accept Iran\u2019s partial dismantling of its nuclear infrastructure in what has been called \u201cimplementation day,\u201d that \u201cIran has not relinquished its ambition to obtain nuclear weapons.\u201d\u201cWithout an appropriate response to every violation, Iran will surmise that it can continue to develop nuclear weapons, to destabilize the region and to spread terrorism,\u201d he said.The United States is maintaining and even increasing other sanctions on Iran for non-nuclear actions, like support of terrorism and violation of United Nations resolutions on testing of ballistic missiles.A guide to help you navigate the deal between global powers and Tehran.Yaakov Amidror, a former national security adviser and major general, pointed out that Israel was hardly alone in disliking the Iran nuclear deal, which has also been sharply criticized by Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the gulf states. \u201cI think in the Middle East most of the countries, most of the leadership do not like this agreement,\u201d he told Israel Radio on Sunday.For Israel, he said, \u201cthe agreement is an additional factor in the behavior of the State of Israel like any other given that exists in the Middle East.\u201dHe said he was not surprised that Iran would live up to the agreement it struck with the United States and other world powers \u2014 because it favors Iran. \u201cIt is an excellent agreement for Iran and therefore Iran will fulfill it down to the last detail,\u201d Mr. Amidror said.\u201cIt has to rebuild its economy and enter the circle of international legitimacy because it can make, within this agreement, very great strides forward in the area of missiles and in the areas of nuclear capability,\u201d he said. \u201cOne would have to be a complete idiot not to fulfill this agreement at least in the first five to 10 years.\u201dFor the moment, he said, he had confidence in Israel\u2019s developing system of antimissile defenses, especially the Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 systems, which are the country\u2019s main defense against any potential Iranian missile strike.Names were not immediately released, and the army was searching nearby Palestinian villages for the attacker.The attack is believed to be the first such stabbing inside a settlement home in the last three months.Earlier on Sunday, a Palestinian who attacked a soldier near Nablus was fatally shot. The soldier suffered minor injuries. And a Palestinian woman was arrested near the settlement of Kiryat Arba carrying a knife, according to the Israeli authorities.Since Oct. 1, 2015, 24 Israelis and 155 Palestinians have been killed, most of the latter after they attacked or attempted to attack Jews, others during protests and clashes.Israel Radio named the dead Israeli woman as Dafna Meir, age 38 or 39, a hospital nurse and mother of six, including two foster children. Other news reports said that her three youngest children were at home during the attack but were unharmed. Mr. Netanyahu issued a statement, saying: \u201cIn the name of all Israelis, I want to embrace and support the family. All of us are hurting and share in your painful grief. We will find the terrorist, and he will pay the full price for this heinous murder.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Zika Warning Spotlights Latin America\u2019s Fight Against Mosquito-Borne Diseases", "Date": "2016-01-17", "News": "Supported byAsked in a telephone interview if Brazil was a safe destination for pregnant women, Mr. Alves responded, \u201cI think so, without a doubt,\u201d emphasizing that his government\u2019s decision to refrain from travel alerts regarding Zika coincided with World Health Organization policies.Mr. Alves added that he expected the Zika outbreak to ease to the point that the Olympics here in August would not be affected.Yet others in Brazil applauded the C.D.C.\u2019s alert, pointing to the country\u2019s struggle not just with Zika, a virus with origins in Uganda that is thought to have made the leap to Brazil in 2014, but also with two other mosquito-borne viruses, dengue and chikungunya. Last year, Brazil registered more than 1.6 million cases of dengue, a virus causing fever and joint pain, with 863 people dying from the disease.Why scientists are worried about the growing epidemic and its effects on pregnant women, and how to avoid the infection.\u201cThe announcement by the C.D.C. is entirely appropriate, given the risks in Brazil,\u201d said Dr. Artur Timerman, 62, an infectious disease specialist in S\u00e3o Paulo.He said that he had advised his own daughter, who is 32, to avoid getting pregnant now in Brazil. \u201cIf she wants to do so, her best course of action is to leave the country and go to a place where Zika is not a problem,\u201d he said.Those infected with Zika usually experience mild or no symptoms. It is not known whether the virus alone causes microcephaly or if it occurs only if the mother has had a previous infection, like dengue.Zika has emerged as a health threat elsewhere in Latin America. In El Salvador, cases of Zika have escalated since it was first reported at the end of November. As of last week, 3,836 cases had been reported, and the government raised the alert level in 47 municipalities where the illness had been detected. The government is planning intensive fumigation campaigns in those areas.Dr. Pablo Kuri Morales, Mexico\u2019s undersecretary for Prevention and Health Promotion, said in a telephone interview on Saturday that Mexico had diagnosed 15 cases of Zika, 10 of them in the state of Chiapas, on the border of Guatemala. He added that the authorities were preparing a television and radio campaign to warn everybody, especially women of reproductive age.Dr. Kuri said the C.D.C. was \u201cwithin its rights\u201d to issue the travel warning, but he argued that the blanket admonition did not make sense when the virus has appeared in only three Mexican states. The mosquitoes that carry the virus, he said, could not survive in the high altitudes of the central plateau, including Mexico City.\u201cI think it\u2019s good to have these warnings,\u201d he said, \u201cbut these things should be explained to people.\u201dIn Washington, administration officials said the decision to issue a travel alert on Friday developed quickly at the end of the week and set off a flurry of diplomatic efforts to inform officials in the countries named in the alert.Officials said the notification process forced the C.D.C. to postpone a news conference that had been planned for Friday afternoon, ultimately delaying an announcement until that evening.Aside from anecdotal accounts, it seems too early to tell how the alert will affect travel. In Brazil, Olympic officials emphasized that the Games will take place in August, during the Southern Hemisphere\u2019s winter. The dryer, cooler weather around that time is thought to reduce the presence of mosquitoes, though virologists warn that the insects can transmit viruses year-round in Brazil.\u201cRio 2016 will continue to monitor the issue closely and follow guidance from the Brazilian Ministry of Health,\u201d said Philip Wilkinson, a spokesman for the committee organizing the Games.\u201cThere will be people traveling to Brazil from all over the world,\u201d Dr. Bogoch said in an email.\u201cThe concern is that infected individuals will travel back to their home country and introduce the virus to new regions.\u201dDr. Bogoch and other researchers determined that Zika had the potential to rapidly spread to other parts of the world, according to findings published last week in the British medical journal The Lancet.Their model for Zika\u2019s possible spread, using worldwide temperature profiles and air travel routes, also determined that more than 60 percent of the population in the United States lives in areas conducive to seasonal Zika transmission. And about 23 million people in the United States live in places with climates like Florida and parts of Texas where Zika can be transmitted by mosquitoes year-round, the researchers said.The authorities in Brazil insist that they are taking steps to fight Zika, including vaccine research.Michael Shear contributed reporting from Washington, and Elisabeth Malkin from Mexico City.Advertisement"}

Most bidoon descend from families who resided there long before the creation of the U.A.E.; many were from nomadic tribes and simply failed to register as nationals at the time. Yet they have been denied citizenship. That status would give them access to the myriad benefits accorded full members of this wealthy oil state \u2014 from free health care and education, to a guaranteed income, subsidized utilities, a marriage bonus, land and an interest-free house loan. Instead, they are categorized as illegal immigrants. To regularize their situation, the authorities hit on the innovative scheme of buying citizenship from an impoverished African state, the Comoro Islands, and bestowing it on the bidoon. By purchasing passports from a country of which the bidoon had neither knowledge nor connection, let alone any desire to join or even visit, the Emiratis sought to divest themselves of any obligations. The bidoon would now be somebody else\u2019s problem. In 2014 Kuwait adopted a similar policy, though the bidoon constitute an \u00adestimated 25 percent of the army. If the bidoon form one strand of Atossa Araxia Abrahamian\u2019s account of the global trade in citizenship in \u201cThe Cosmopolites,\u201d another strand is that of the ultra-high-net-worth individuals (U.H.N.W.I.) who buy multiple citizenships from often impoverished countries for themselves. They may never set eyes on their newly adopted lands. What they purchase are passports that offer access to other nations and to foreign markets, as well as an ability to seek out the most advantageous jurisdictions to safeguard their accumulated wealth. Writing with pace and passion, Abrahamian, an opinion editor at Al Jazeera America, weaves together her narratives with considerable journalistic flair. She intertwines these two threads with a third, that of the ancient idea of cosmopolitan citizenship and its idealistic modern advocates. She sees the growing market in citizenship as the corruption and commercialization of this idea by a global business elite. And she suggests the obvious reform: making the ancient idea a reality by abolishing borders and transforming all human beings into citizens of the world. The Canadian philosopher Joseph Carens has characterized national citizenship as \u201cthe modern equivalent of feudal class privilege.\u2019\u2019 That seems all too accurate a description of the citizenship of the absolute monarchies of the U.A.E., where only 15 percent of the population enjoy the privileges of citizens. These benefits are paid for largely by the unearned windfall of oil and gas revenues and they involve almost no civic duties or political rights. The multiple citizenships of the U.H.N.W.I. are similarly free of responsibility and lacking in political commitment \u2014 that is their point. They are commercial transactions conducted for profit. Neither of these types of citizenship corresponds to the hard-won forms of citizenship found within democratic states. Herein lies the weakness of Abrahamian\u2019s analysis. The political and social rights of genuine, state-based citizenship derive from the contribution members make to sustaining the public life of the community, be it through participation in the economy as workers and consumers, caring for children and the elderly or simply recognizing and abiding by its laws. All who contribute in these ways should be entitled to citizenship. By contrast, global citizens belong nowhere and anywhere. Yet both the injustice of denying citizenship to the bidoon and those like them and the unfairness of granting it as a commercial transaction to the super-rich stem from the same cause \u2014 a failure to link the rights of citizens to those civic duties that arise from active membership in a political community.

{"Headline": "European Central Bank Says It\u2019s Ready for New Stimulus \u2014 but Not Yet", "Date": "2016-01-21", "News": "Supported by\u201cConditions have worsened\u201d since the central bank\u2019s Governing Council met in December, Mr. Draghi said at a news conference after the central bank announced that it would leave key interest rates unchanged. He indicated that the Governing Council had been surprised by the extent of recent market turmoil as well as by plummeting oil prices, which are a factor in the eurozone\u2019s dangerously low inflation. Mr. Draghi and the council would meet again on March 10.Mr. Draghi emphasized on Thursday that the European Central Bank was poised to take further actions in the future if necessary. \u201cThere are no limits to how far we are willing to deploy our instruments,\u201d he said.Buoyed by the hope of more monetary policy intervention sooner than most analysts had expected, investors drove up eurozone stocks even as Mr. Draghi was still speaking. And the euro headed lower against the dollar \u2014 a potential positive sign for the eurozone, whose exports could become cheaper on the global market as a result.The central bank left its benchmark rate at 0.05 percent on Thursday, already a record low. The rate on deposits held at the central bank remained at negative 0.3 percent, a penalty rate intended to encourage banks to lend rather than hoard cash.For the eurozone, sustaining meaningful economic growth has been hard to achieve in recent years. And inflation has remained so low that at times the bigger concern has been that the economy might slip into a downward, deflationary spiral.More recently, the eurozone has been buffeted by the worldwide stock sell-off prompted by uncertainty in China, worries about global growth and plunging oil prices. The main stock indexes in France, Germany, Italy and Spain have all fallen 10 percent or more over the past month.Mr. Draghi expressed concern about data indicating that investors are pulling money out of China in response to market turbulence there. But he added: \u201cThe Chinese authorities have a reputation for acting responsibly. What they have done in the last few weeks shows that they are gaining control over their policy making.\u201dBut he said that conditions had changed significantly since then. \u201cThe Governing Council is open to using all the necessary instruments to cope with a situation that is materially different than the beginning of December,\u201d he said.Inflation in the eurozone has been hovering near zero since late 2014, and it was 0.2 percent in December. Such low inflation makes central bankers and economists nervous because it is dangerously close to deflation, a self-reinforcing downward price spiral that is poisonous to growth and job creation.Slumping oil prices, which the European Central Bank cannot control, are a big reason for the low inflation. Slow economic growth and 10.5 percent unemployment in the eurozone are also factors, because they make it hard for companies to raise prices.Mr. Draghi noted at the news conference that plunging oil prices alone would not necessarily be something the central bank would worry about, as they could also be a stimulus for the economy in helping businesses and households that consume energy. The problem, he said, is when low oil prices feed into a bigger downward price spiral.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to be very vigilant about that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have many reasons to be optimistic about that.\u201dIn addition, in December the central bank increased the interest penalty it charges banks to hold money in its vaults to 0.3 percent from 0.2 percent. In normal times, banks earn interest on their deposits at the central bank. But the current so-called negative deposit rate, which the central bank first put into effect in June 2014, is intended to prod banks to lend money.The measures the central bank announced in December were seen by many analysts as too timid and led to a sell-off of eurozone shares as investors had expected more aggressive action.Mr. Draghi said the expression of resolve on Thursday had the unanimous support of the 25 members of the Governing Council.\u201cOne should not have any doubt that the Governing Council not only has the power and the willingness and the determination but also the cohesion that\u2019s necessary to take the actions that are needed,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

But it has faced opposition from residents along the route, and it is estimated to cost at least $1 billion.In announcing his effort to move the plan forward, the governor said several million dollars would be spent to start the process, but he did not explain how he intended to finance the cost of constructing an additional track.But as the list of expensive projects grows, many of the details about how they will be financed have not been disclosed, or in some cases even decided.The governor announced the plan as part of a series of events leading up to his State of the State speech next week. A range of groups representing commuters, the construction industry and transportation planners praised the proposal, saying it would reduce bottlenecks on the railroad while allowing more trains to travel from New York City to Long Island for people making the reverse commute.The authority\u2019s current capital plan is still awaiting the approval of state leaders, but officials at the authority said the project could be added to the plan in the future. Republican leaders in the State Senate have recently pushed for more money for upstate roads and bridges in order to approve the capital plan.Asked by a reporter whether the tunnel was a pipe dream, Mr. Cuomo responded by asking if plans like the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and the George Washington Bridge were pipe dreams.Mr. Cuomo said the new plan envisions a somewhat shorter track, which would help reduce the number of properties that would need to be acquired, at least in part, for the project.In 2008, an earlier version of the plan was delayed because the authority did not have the money to pay for it.Leaders on Long Island had varied reactions on Tuesday. The Suffolk County executive, Steve Bellone, a Democrat, said he supported the third-track proposal, arguing that it would improve the region\u2019s economy.But Edward P. Mangano, the Nassau County executive, a Republican who represents the area where the track would be added, took a more cautious tone.\u201cThe M.T.A.\u2019s prior proposal displaced too many homeowners, and we look forward to learning how this plan differs from that of the past,\u201d Mr. Mangano said in a statement.Thomas Tweedy, the mayor of Floral Park, said he had not seen the specific proposal yet, but he did not like the sound of it. He raised concerns about the authority\u2019s ability to complete big projects in a timely manner and the problems construction could cause in his community.\u201cWe thought this was dead and buried,\u201d Mr. Tweedy said.Separately, Mr. Cuomo on Tuesday pledged $300 million for the state\u2019s environmental protection fund for the next fiscal year. The allotment for the fund, which pays for environmental projects, would be an increase from recent years.Arielle Dollinger contributed reporting. Jack Begg contributed research.Advertisement"}

After a visit when my mother-in-law spent little time with my children, praising her other grandchildren instead, I sent a letter telling her what I had noticed. It was badly received. We have settled into an icy standoff. My children have not noticed their nana\u2019s absence, but I hate to think of them not knowing her. What should I do?S.P., NORTH CAROLINAApologize to your husband, for starters. This woman is his mother, the original Big Cheese. And you seem to have fired off a letter of complaint without asking how he felt about it. I get that Mama Lion instincts run fierce, and watching your cubs treated as second best is hurtful.

Imagine if someone had wedged her way into your relationship with your mother (or child) like this.Her \u201cplaying favorites\u201d has probably been going on for 30 or 40 years. It\u2019s not so unusual. Line up any brood, and most of us can tell you who Mommy\u2019s favorite is. Some parents hide it better than others, and some favoritism reaches into the next generation. Still, if affinities become hurtful, a son going to his mother, in person, will almost always yield better results than a letter from a disgruntled daughter-in-law. (The letter was another misstep. Complaints reduced to writing tend to read more rigid and angry than we actually feel.)Now that you\u2019re in the soup, consult your husband. He has the most experience with the old bird. Personally, I think you should both go to her. Fall on your sword (as sincerely as possible) and kill her with kindness for the foreseeable future. Her behavior may improve. As for your children, take it from someone who has sat on both sides of this fence (as son of the favorite and also of the distant runner-up): It won\u2019t make a huge difference to them.

{"Headline": "Trial of Ivory Coast\u2019s Laurent Gbagbo Will Test International Criminal Court", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Supported byThe case is a reminder of the huge gulf that still exists between supporters of the current president, Alassane Ouattara, who won re-election by a huge majority in a largely peaceful election last year, and those who remain loyal to Mr. Gbagbo (pronounced BAHG-bo).These days, Ivory Coast is bustling. Abidjan, the principal city, swirls with traffic, construction sites are everywhere, and swarms of children in checkered school uniforms crisscross the streets. Mr. Ouattara\u2019s government has invested in new roads and bridges, and the economy has been growing briskly.But the city still bears the scars of the violence from 2010 and 2011. In the Abobo neighborhood, where pro-Gbagbo militias are said to have tortured, raped and killed people because of their origins or political affiliations, Souleymane Grambout\u00e9 pointed out bullet holes in pockmarked walls, and dark markings on the road pavement.\u201cThat\u2019s where they burned people alive,\u201d Mr. Grambout\u00e9 said.He said that his two brothers had been killed in the upheaval and that his neighbor from Mali had been shot in his bed, memories that are still vivid. \u201cThat\u2019s why we need this trial,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need justice; it\u2019s a form of closure.\u201dWhen Mr. Gbagbo clung to the presidency after the 2010 election, the country was torn into warring factions, and both sides were accused of atrocities. Mr. Gbagbo\u2019s supporters believe their leader has been unjustly singled out for blame, and that the proceedings in The Hague will vindicate and free him.\u201cIt\u2019s the trial of all hopes,\u201d said Kon\u00e9 Boubakar, the secretary general of one of the current divisions of the Ivorian Popular Front, the political party Mr. Gbagbo founded. \u201cThis kind of trial can last for years, so we have many chances for the truth to come out. The real question is, \u2018When will the other bad guys be judged?\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u201cThe perception among opposition supporters that commanders of pro-Ouattara forces will not face justice for the egregious abuses they committed is undoubtedly an obstacle to reconciliation,\u201d said Param-Preet Singh, senior international justice counsel at Human Rights Watch. \u201cSupporting the investigation and prosecution of commanders from pro-Ouattara forces is essential if President Ouattara is to keep his promise to govern for all Ivorians.\u201dThe International Criminal Court is investigating the Ouattara side, but according to a Human Rights Watch report, the work has been slowed by budget constraints and a lack of cooperation from the Ouattara government.The tribunal is currently pursuing cases involving 10 countries, eight of them in Africa. In most cases, national governments asked the court to intervene. Even so, critics often call the court a tool of imperialism because it pursues cases in developing countries while major powers like the United States, Russia and China refuse to join the court and submit to its jurisdiction.A number of former leaders have faced justice at special-purpose international tribunals, including Charles Taylor of Liberia (a 50-year sentence for war crimes) and Jean Kambanda of Rwanda (a life sentence for genocide). Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia was tried by the United Nations tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, but he died before a verdict was reached; that tribunal is still trying Radovan Karadzic, the former leader of the Serbian part of Bosnia, for crimes including genocide.The International Criminal Court has had some highly visible misses. Judges issued an arrest warrant for Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya in 2011, but he was killed soon afterward. The court pursued President Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya on charges related to postelection violence in his country, but prosecutors withdrew the case before trial, saying the Kenyan government had obstructed its investigation and had intimidated and bribed witnesses. The court is going ahead with the trial of William Ruto, the deputy president of Kenya, on similar charges.\u201cThe court is still at its early stage,\u201d said Paolina Massidda, a lawyer at the Gbagbo trial who represents 726 victims of the 2011 violence. \u201cThis trial should help it find its way, and show the world \u2014 and not only Africa \u2014 that it can conduct justice in a fair way. On a broader level, such a trial is important to send a message to ruling leaders, putting an end to potential impunity.\u201d\u201cIf you ask victims why they want to testify,\u201d she added, \u201cthey say, \u2018I want the truth to come out, and this never to happen again.\u2019\u00a0\u201dOutside Camp Commando, a former headquarters for Mr. Gbagbo\u2019s militia, a woman said in an interview that she still lived in the house where three militiamen stormed in and raped her in front of her children in 2011. \u201cThey came in with big guns and balaclavas,\u201d said the woman, who is one of the 726 victims and who spoke on the condition that her name not be published for safety reasons. She had campaigned for Mr. Ouattara, she said, and \u201cthey must have known.\u201dThe woman said she planned to gather with her four children, her nieces and her neighbors to watch the opening of the trial on television. It is not being broadcast by local stations, so she subscribed to an international news channel to see it, she said, and invited other victims to her house for the occasion.\u201cIf we could, we would fly straight to The Hague,\u201d said a woman at the house, another of the 726 victims, who said she too had been raped. \u201cThese people, they acted under his power,\u201d the woman said, \u201cso he should be made responsible; he has to pay.\u201dMarlise Simons contributed reporting from The Hague.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cuomo Announces $1 Billion Expansion for Javits Center", "Date": "2016-01-07", "News": "Supported byAlmost from the day that the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center opened in 1986, exhibitors and hotel operators complained that the black glass complex along 11th Avenue in Manhattan was too small, too hard to navigate and perpetually damp from a leaky roof.Successive New York governors, in turn, have announced their plans for a lavish expansion only to see them founder.Under the plan, Javits North, a semipermanent structure currently anchoring the center\u2019s 40th Street end, would eventually be demolished and replaced with a four-level garage for tractor-trailers bringing in displays and other equipment.Some analysts contend that the convention business contributes little to the economy, as cities across the country discount fees to lure the same shows. But Mr. Cuomo promised that the Javits Center\u2019s expansion to 3.3 million square feet \u2014 a more than 50 percent increase \u2014 would bring more trade shows, jobs and tax revenue to New York.\u201cThe Javits Center has long been an economic generator for this state,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said at a news conference at the center on Thursday. \u201cBut we want to build and expand it to ensure it remains a premier venue for the next generation.\u201dState officials said the center was exploring using \u201cexisting resources\u201d and other public and private financing options to pay for the project. Real estate executives expect the center to sell two nearby parcels of land for about $1 billion, although state officials would not say whether that was part of the plan.Some elected officials, the hotel workers\u2019 union and the hotel association lauded the governor\u2019s plan, which comes less than two years after the state completed a $463 million makeover of the convention center, which included the addition of Javits North.Although Javits is not the nation\u2019s largest convention center \u2014 that is McCormick Place, in Chicago \u2014 it is widely regarded as the busiest, with very little down time.Most convention centers are publicly owned and do not make money. Instead, officials hope to attract out-of-town visitors who book hotel rooms, shop and eat in restaurants, generating jobs and tax revenue.But Heywood T. Sanders, a professor of public administration at the University of Texas, San Antonio, says public investments in convention centers rarely live up to their promise.\u201cYou\u2019re competing in an incredibly overbuilt environment where cities are giving away their space for free,\u201d said Professor Sanders, author of \u201cConvention Center Follies: Politics, Power and Public Investment in American Cities.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to get ahead.\u201dMr. Sanders said convention and trade show attendance at the four major centers in the country \u2014 in Atlanta, Chicago, Las Vegas and Orlando \u2014 fell to 3.8 million in 2014, down by almost one million people since 2006.The same thing is true, he said, at the Javits Center, where trade show and convention attendance in 2014 was 629,500, well below the 966,730 attendees in 2006.In measuring performance, Professor Sanders does not count attendance at public shows, like the auto or boat shows, which generally attract attendees from the local area who do not book hotel rooms or go out to dinner at fancy restaurants.State officials say the small amount of meeting-room space at the Javits Center has hampered its capability to attract larger, more profitable shows. The expansion, they say, will quintuple the amount of meeting-room and ballroom space. In addition, the center for the first time would have 500,000 square feet of contiguous exhibition space.Events at the center in 2014 attracted more than two million visitors, counting both public shows and conventions and trade shows, state officials said.The state canceled plans to nearly double the size of the Javits Center in 2008, after the projected cost swelled to $3 billion from $1.8 billion.The proposal collapsed within six months.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Iowa Caucuses Approach, Political Ads Swamp TV Channels", "Date": "2016-01-25", "News": "Supported byAnd that was just during the 6 o\u2019clock news.As their state\u2019s Feb. 1 caucuses for the presidential nominations approach, Iowans are being inundated with political ads on every channel, at every hour. The $6 million-a-week spending pace is only likely to intensify in the final days \u2014 but the torrent of commercials from candidates and their allies may be turning off as many voters as it persuades.\u201cI see them all the time, everywhere I go,\u201d said Mike O\u2019Keefe, 27, an insurance company employee in Des Moines. \u201cIt\u2019s just one after another, and nothing really sticks.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an old habit, and old habits die hard,\u201d said Elizabeth Wilner, a senior vice president at Kantar Media/CMAG, which tracks political advertising. \u201cThe noise just gets deafening, and you wonder about people tuning you out.\u201dAll told, candidates have spent more than $40 million to date in Iowa on broadcast advertising \u2014 $6 million last week alone \u2014 airing more than 167 different political commercials, according to data provided by Kantar Media/CMAG. An additional $13 million has been spent on local cable channels in the state.The homestretch in Iowa always leads to a barrage of television appeals, and this year\u2019s volume is roughly on par with 2008\u2019s. But after months in which media consultants trumpeted their ability to pinpoint narrow categories of voters using sophisticated analysis, the ad glut is making a hash of those efforts.And what might make sense while targeting on a national scale or in bigger media markets, or over time, does not prove so effective when the effort concentrates on a small subset of voters in a small state over a few days, experts said.\u201cIn Iowa, you\u2019re talking about a fairly small universe of caucusgoers, compared to the general population or general voting public,\u201d said Carl Forti, a Republican strategist. \u201cYou\u2019re spending a lot of money to talk to very few.\u201dSo Saturday night\u2019s \u201cWheel of Fortune,\u201d for example, was blanketed by 11 political ads from nine candidates in its half-hour broadcast. The show\u2019s older audience, including many holdovers who watch the nightly news, was a high-value target for candidates in both parties.The weekend\u2019s major sports events allowed some ads to avoid being lost in a blizzard of others. Viewers of the United States Figure Skating Championships on NBC saw a 60-second advertisement from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign twice in 20 minutes.And during the A.F.C. championship game between the New England Patriots and the Denver Broncos, viewers saw Mr. Rubio make trick football catches in one ad and Mr. Cruz go duck hunting with Phil Robertson of the TV show \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d in another.\u201cCertainly with things like sporting events, and things like that, you have a better chance of it cutting through when it\u2019s a nontraditional messenger,\u201d said Jason Miller, a senior strategist on the Cruz campaign.Creativity can also help.The Ben Carson campaign, one of the biggest spenders in Iowa with more than $2.6 million on television, ran an ad without a single spoken word (except the required \u201cI approve\u201d statement). Accompanied by slow music, it showed Carson supporters with outstretched hands, as the written words \u201cOur Hands\u201d gave way to \u201cHeal,\u201d \u201cLearn,\u201d \u201cUnite\u201d and more.\u201cIt\u2019s essentially not only that you highlight different qualities, but that you take a different approach to creative,\u201d said Ed Brookover, Mr. Carson\u2019s campaign manager.Mr. Sanders team has also bought nine straight days of geo-filter advertising on Snapchat, the longest political ad campaign ever launched on the platform, as part of the campaign\u2019s effort to turn out young caucusgoers, according to Kenneth Pennington, the digital director for the Sanders campaign.Advertisement"}
