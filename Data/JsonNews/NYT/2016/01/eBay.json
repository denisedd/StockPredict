She was 67.In its mix of the commonplace and the fantastic \u2014 and its dreamlike, fragmentary unpredictability \u2014 Ms. Wright\u2019s poetry seemed to encapsulate the workings of human memory itself.

If anything can be said to unite her diverse output, it is a pervasive undercurrent of humanism and an abiding concern with themes of liberation.\u201cMy poems are about desire, conflict, the dearth of justice for all,\u201d she wrote in \u201chills,\u201d the prose introduction to her 1986 collection, \u201cFurther Adventures With You.\u201d \u201cAbout persons of small means.

{"Headline": "Amazon Sales Soared 22% in Holiday Quarter, but Profit Fell Short", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byAmazon prompts strong emotions, and they were on full display Thursday \u2014 first a faith that the company will indeed measure up to outsize expectations to be the store that sells everything to everyone everywhere, then the sneaking fear that that might be a dream.Analysts said the fourth-quarter numbers, momentarily disappointing as they might have been, did not dent the optimistic case.\u201cThis was more of an expectations correction than a fundamentals correction,\u201d said Mark Mahaney, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the numbers that would mark a dramatic change in Amazon\u2019s growth or profit profile.\u201dInstead, the mood swings just reflected an enthusiasm that got out of hand.\u201cThe last three quarters the company generated bottom-line results that were materially above Street expectations,\u201d Mr. Mahaney said. \u201cThat set up expectations we would see more of the same. We didn\u2019t.\u201dRevenue for the fourth quarter jumped to $35.7 billion, up 22 percent from $29.3 billion. Impressive as that was, analysts had predicted a little bit more: $35.93 billion.Profit is something Amazon has trained Wall Street not to expect. But part of the optimistic assumptions is that the moment is drawing nigh when the dollars will start to pile up. Analysts estimated the retailer would earn $1.56 a share in the quarter, up from 45 cents in 2014. But the company said its fourth-quarter profit was only $1 a share.Investors, who had pushed Amazon shares up 100 percent last year, partly in anticipation of those profits, sent the stock up another $52 to $635 in regular trading Thursday. When the results came in, they did not shrug them off. After-hours, the stock fell more than $84.Against such travails, a 22 percent rise in revenue that was expected to be 23 percent is inconsequential. When Walmart reports its holiday sales quarter, revenue is forecast to actually be down for the quarter from 2014.Amazon\u2019s computing platform subsidiary, Amazon Web Services, contributed heavily to the bottom line. Operating income from that unit rose to $687 million in the quarter from $240 million in 2014. AWS will soon be a $10 billion business, company executives noted in a conference call with analysts.Getting all the work done has required many new employees. Amazon\u2019s head count grew 50 percent in the last year, to 230,000 full-time workers.Amazon might be the powerhouse of e-commerce, yet paradoxically has only a small share of the global market \u2014 which is one of the things feeding enthusiasm for it. For Amazon bulls, there are so many more worlds to conquer.In data assembled before the fourth-quarter results were in, the research firm eMarketer said Amazon had $71.8 billion in e-commerce sales over the last 12 months, an increase of 5.6 percent from the previous 12 months. Walmart, by contrast, had revenue of $13.5 billion online during the period.But Amazon\u2019s revenue pales against the worldwide e-commerce market, which eMarketer estimated as $1.672 trillion. \u201cAmazon is gaining share as evidenced by 26 percent unit growth, compared to our best estimate of 18 percent for global e-commerce growth,\u201d Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray, wrote in a note to clients after the quarterly numbers. The note was headlined \u201cInvestors Overreacting.\u201dIn the current quarter, Amazon has estimated that sales will grow 17 to 28 percent. Operating income might be as little as $100 million, which would be less than last year, or as much as $700 million, which would be considerably more. It was a forecast that allowed plenty of room for enthusiasm, as it also left open the possibility of disappointment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Grace Coddington, Accidental Celebrity of \u2018The September Issue,\u2019 Steps Down at Vogue", "Date": "2016-01-20", "News": "Supported byOn the RunwayThe tectonic plates of fashion are shifting.First, because it signals a potential change in direction at the most famous fashion magazine in the world, one that has not had real movement at the top for decades. (Ms. Wintour has been editor in chief since 1988, the same year Ms. Coddington took her role; Phyllis Posnick, the executive fashion editor, has been with the magazine since 1987; Tonne Goodman, the fashion director, joined in 1999.)Second, because Cond\u00e9 Nast has been in a relatively turbulent state for the past few months, as it wrestles with the relationship between the print and online worlds, with longtime editors such as Linda Wells of Allure being replaced and with the closing of magazines such as Details. As the company\u2019s artistic director, Ms. Wintour is involved in all such decisions, and her moves when it comes to the company\u2019s flagship (and her own magazine) will clearly be seen as indicative of wider future editorial strategy.And third, because Ms. Coddington was a great celebrator of the fantasy of fashion: its power to transport and transform.23 PhotosShe was less interested in the commercial side of the business and had almost no interest in the digital side of things, eschewing computers and email. She favored models over celebrities (though she did style the Kim Kardashian and Kanye West Vogue cover), and she was clear about designers she revered and those she did not \u2014 all reasons she and Ms. Wintour were such good sparring partners.It was the tension between her love of fashion as an art, and Ms. Wintour\u2019s practicality and interest in its functionality, both as a business and in her readers\u2019 lives, that was a large part of making Vogue, and the movie about it, so compelling.On a more abstract level, however, Ms. Coddington\u2019s move, along with Ms. Karan\u2019s, seems like the beginning of what could be a long chain reaction of a generational shift in fashion. It has been, for an industry that celebrates youth, a strikingly mature sector, with the greatest power concentrated in the hands of the same people for a very long time. Change, when it comes, will have a cascade effect.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Catch a Scammer in Madrid", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byLivesSome years ago, while house-sitting outside Rome, I was supposed to be working on a school paper. Instead I spent a lot of time surfing the Internet. One day I found an eBay auction for the kind of semiprofessional camera I coveted. The starting-bid amount was one-fifth the retail price. A few days later, just shortly before the end of the auction, no one had placed a bid. It was my first auction, and my heart started pounding as I prepared to bid my savings on this camera. I typed in the amount, took a deep breath, hit \u2018\u2018bid now\u2019\u2019 and closed my eyes. When I opened them again, nothing had happened.I\u2019d lost my Internet connection! So I rushed to an Internet cafe down the street. I logged in at a computer, but the auction was over. There hadn\u2019t been any bids.I couldn\u2019t forget about \u2018\u2018my camera.\u2019\u2019 I decided to write the auctioneer. He promptly wrote back. He said that he owned an electronics store in Madrid but that he was going out of business and was now auctioning off all his stuff. It sounded very reassuring. I wrote back that I was still willing to buy the camera. O.K., he wrote, he was happy to sell. How about wiring him the money? My inner red lights came on. Wiring money? No good, not safe. Not to worry, the salesman wrote back, I could wire the money but protect it with a password. In the meantime, he would send the camera. After I received it, I would reveal the password to him.I was excited! I almost ran to the closest Western Union, cash in hand. I filled out the form, made up a code word (there was a space for it) and went to the clerk \u2014 who told me that that office didn\u2019t actually provide that pass-code service. I know I heard her words, but there was no rationality left inside me, only the desire for the camera. I gave the cashier my O.K. to send the money.The camera never arrived. The businessman went mute. I knew I had been taken. And I grew furious. I didn\u2019t care about the camera anymore. I wanted justice. I went to the airport, directly to the airport, to buy a ticket. I wanted to make it all as \u2018\u2018concrete\u2019\u2019 as possible. No more \u2018\u2018virtual\u2019\u2019 stuff.When I got to Madrid, I found the street and building. I had his full address, of course. It was a big building, and his name wasn\u2019t on any of the bells. So I just hung out and waited. I had this vision that I would just \u2018\u2018know\u2019\u2019 him once I saw him. I scrutinized the people coming in and going out. To some I gave a provocative stare, to see if they would lower their eyes, reveal themselves as guilty. Finally, after a while, I left.Next, I went to the closest money-wiring place and hung out. I talked to the clerks; they wanted to help me but couldn\u2019t. I showed them his name. Did they know him? (Did he do this often?) No such luck.I went to the police. I was so utterly determined. They didn\u2019t want to laugh at me openly, but I knew they kind of felt like it. They smiled and shrugged and said they could do nothing. But I wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer. Something needed to be done! Who could do something, if not them? I was going to find this guy, and they better be with me. I don\u2019t know how, but I won them over. They said to come the next day. We were on this!So there I was: out with an agent of the law in the name of justice. But as the hours passed and the city warmed up under the sun, it dawned on me that there really wasn\u2019t much chance the guy would actually come. Past midday, the officer called for siesta, and I gladly followed.We went to a cafe, cool and dark, where we had tortillas and cerveza. After a while she asked how I was doing. By that point, little by little, my initial \u2018\u2018mission\u2019\u2019 \u2014 finding the scammer, facing him and possibly even getting my money back \u2014 had become something else: an adventure in which I\u2019d fought for myself, seen a new country, gone undercover, learned a lesson, all of it unplanned and unexpected. \u2018\u2018It was good we came here, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll find him,\u2019\u2019 I admitted in my Italian-Spanish. She smiled and agreed.Back in Italy, a technology-savvy friend analyzed the emails I\u2019d received from the scammer. They weren\u2019t from Madrid at all, but from Romania.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Xerox Planning Spinoff, Under Pressure From Carl Icahn", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byAnother American corporate icon has decided that breaking up is the thing to do.A large part of the spinoff will incorporate Affiliated Computer Services, the business outsourcing company that Xerox bought for $6.4 billion in 2010, said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity before the plan was announced.The remaining company would be focused on office supply products like copiers, scanners and fax machines, the person said.The plan is expected to be announced when Xerox reports fourth-quarter financial results on Friday.Xerox, which was founded in Rochester in 1906, will be joining other big American corporations that have split apart or pared back in recent years, some driven by activist hedge funds seeking to increase returns on their shares.Alcoa announced in September it would split in two, separating its commodities and metal products businesses. Hewlett-Packard decided to split in 2014. More recently, the chemical giants Dow Chemical and DuPont agreed to merge with the intent to split into three companies soon afterward.Through his various investment funds, Mr. Icahn amassed an 8.13 percent stake in Xerox in November and December, saying the shares were undervalued. In a securities filing, he said at the time that his firm intended to have discussions with Xerox management and board \u201crelating to improving operational performance and pursuing strategic alternatives, as well as the possibility of board representation.\u201dAs part of an agreement with Mr. Icahn, three of his representatives will serve on the board of the services company after it has been spun off, the person briefed on the decision said.Mr. Icahn did not return a phone call on Thursday.A representative from Xerox, which is based in Norwalk, Conn., declined to comment on plans to spin off the services business and on any discussions with Mr. Icahn.Shares of Xerox are down 28 percent from a year ago and down 13.5 percent since Nov. 23, when Mr. Icahn first announced he had taken a stake. The company now has a market value of more than $9.3 billion.Xerox has been grappling with declining annual revenue for four consecutive years.In a conference call with analysts last year, Ms. Burns was asked whether she saw strategic value in having the services business together with the hardware businesses.\u201cAs we go through the review, that\u2019s one of the things that we\u2019ll validate,\u201d Ms. Burns said.For his part, Mr. Icahn has been waging multiple battles in the last few months. In December, he prevailed over the Bridgestone Corporation in a seesaw battle to acquire the auto parts retailer Pep Boys for $18.50 a share, or about $1 billion.But in his public battle to break the American International Group into three parts, he has been less successful. On Tuesday, A.I.G. outlined plans to streamline its businesses, but stopped far short of Mr. Icahn\u2019s more radical demands for change.Mr. Icahn, who says he owns 42 million shares of A.I.G., has not yet publicly responded to the company\u2019s new strategy, and he could still start a proxy battle. In November, Mr. Icahn said he might propose that A.I.G. add a director to its board who could take over for the insurer\u2019s chief executive.While Mr. Icahn has been an active proponent of divestitures and breakups, he is less keen on another hot area of Wall Street deal-making. He has been critical of inversions, where a United States company merges with a foreign company and moves its headquarters overseas to take advantage of lower corporate tax rates.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Are Corporations Hoarding Trillions?", "Date": "2016-01-20", "News": "Supported byOn MoneyThere is an economic mystery I\u2019ve been struggling to understand for quite some time, and I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s confused: Among financial experts, it is often referred to as a conundrum, a paradox, a puzzle. The mystery is as follows: Collectively, American businesses currently have $1.9 trillion in cash, just sitting around. Not only is this state of affairs unparalleled in economic history, but we don\u2019t even have much data to compare it with, because corporations have traditionally been borrowers, not savers. The notion that a corporation would hold on to so much of its profit seems economically absurd, especially now, when it is probably earning only about 2 percent interest by parking that money in United States Treasury bonds. These companies would be better off investing in anything \u2014 a product, a service, a corporate acquisition \u2014 that would make them more than 2 cents of profit on the dollar, a razor-thin margin by corporate standards. And yet they choose to keep the cash.Take, for example, Google. Its new parent company, Alphabet, is worth roughly $500 billion. But it has around $80 billion sitting in Google\u2019s bank accounts or other short-term investments. So if you buy a share in Alphabet, which has sold for roughly $700 lately, you are effectively buying ownership of more than $100 in cash. With $80 billion, Google could buy Uber and its Indian rival Ola and still have enough left over to buy Palantir, a data-mining start-up. Or it could buy Goldman Sachs outright or American Express or most of MasterCard; it could buy Costco or eBay or a quarter of Amazon. Surely it could use those acquisitions to earn more than 2 cents on the dollar.This strange vogue for corporate hoarding seems to have begun around the turn of the millennium. General Motors is perhaps the most extreme: It now holds nearly half its value in cash. Apple holds more than a third. These numbers are maddening on their face. If the companies spent their savings, rather than hoarding them, the economy would instantly grow, and we would most likely see more jobs with better pay. In the 1990s, when companies saved far less of their profits, they built new factories, bought new buildings. In part because of all that corporate spending, the 1990s were a period of low unemployment and high growth. Remarkably, the United States government was able to tax all that productive corporate behavior so much that it came close to paying off all its debts for the first time in 160 years.So what is going on now? There are countless economic journal articles laying out theories about why corporations have shifted from borrowing to saving. Some of the reasons are prosaic. Just like people, companies might want to have money for emergencies or for lousy economic times, and the past decade has been a period of increasing risk. Also, corporations have become far more focused on something they call \u2018\u2018tax efficiency,\u2019\u2019 which the rest of us call \u2018\u2018tax avoidance\u2019\u2019: For various reasons, holding on to cash and carefully shifting it among subsidiaries, especially foreign ones, is a great tool to shrink your tax bill.Another reason to hold on to cash is a byproduct of the increasingly intense competition for talent and acquisitions, especially in technology and pharmaceuticals. When Apple or Google enter negotiations to buy a smaller company, any other firm considering a competing offer may be scared off by their nearly infinite resources. Oddly enough, then, holding on to all that cash might be saving these companies even more money, by allowing them to pay less for the firms they acquire. (Google buys about one company a week, on average; Apple\u2019s acquisitions are more sporadic, but not far behind.)But even if you accept all these reasons, we are still left with an enormous puzzle. Companies like Google and GM are holding on to far more cash \u2014 many times more \u2014 than could possibly be explained by emergency funds and tax efficiencies and M.&A. intimidation put together. Lee Pinkowitz, a professor at Georgetown, told me that finance economists agree that there is a puzzle here but break into two distinct camps over the cause. One camp believes that a large cash hoard is a sign of an unhealthy company. Maybe its whole industry is doing so poorly that there is nothing worth investing in; maybe it\u2019s because executives are up to something shady, stockpiling cash as a personal war chest to mask poor decision-making and protect their jobs (cash in the bank, suddenly deployed, can make a firm seem more profitable than it actually is). The other camp doubts that the free market could be allowing executives to hold all that cash if it were purely for their own benefit.Along with his colleague Rohan Williamson, Pinkowitz built a valuation model that analyzed how investors react to different levels of cash holding. He ran 50 years of data (originally from 1965 to 2004, but then he kindly updated his findings for me, through 2014) for 12,888 different publicly traded companies. The model shows how investors value a dollar of savings when it\u2019s held by different sorts of companies, divided into 43 industry types.His findings show that both theories have some truth to them. For several industries, hoarding cash is clearly correlated with negative results. When publishing and entertainment companies or aircraft manufacturers hold on to extra cash, investors perceive that money to be worth less than it should, somewhere in the neighborhood of 40 cents on the dollar (the authors make a specific estimate for each industry but also provide a range to account for error). The defense and coal industries are considerably worse, with a dollar in savings valued negatively. This might suggest protective behavior by chief executives in those industries, because the market is clearly not valuing their decision to save.For other industries, though, a dollar of savings is worth a lot more than itself. For pharmaceutical companies, a dollar in savings is worth $1.50. For software firms, it\u2019s even higher: more than $2. This means that investors are behaving as if they trust the executives in these industries, like Larry Page of Alphabet, to be smarter about using that money than the investors themselves could be. And a cursory scan of the industries in this second group \u2014 which also includes automakers, medical-equipment makers and others \u2014 correlates well with the ones hoarding the most cash. Corporations, it seems, may have amassed at least a good chunk of that $1.9 trillion in mysterious savings because the stock market is rewarding them for it.Which leaves one last question: Why? The answer, perhaps, is that both the executives and the investors in these industries believe that something big is coming, but \u2014 this is crucial \u2014 they\u2019re not sure what it will be. Through the 20th century, as we shifted from a horse-and-sun-powered agrarian economy to an electricity-and-motor-powered industrial economy to a silicon-based information economy, it was clear that every company had to invest in the new thing that was coming. These were big, expensive investments in buildings and machinery and computer technology. Today, though, value is created far more through new ideas and new ways of interaction. Ideas appear and spread much more quickly, and their worth is much harder to estimate. (Indeed, the impossibility of valuing the Internet is essentially what created the 2000 stock bubble.)Surely the most important economic question of our time is a fairly simple one: Are the good times over? Will wages continue to fall for many, while rising high for a few? In the cash conundrum, we might find a modest reason for optimism. If corporate leaders and their investors truly believed that the future were bleak, that innovation and economic growth were irreparably slowing, there would be little reason to hold on to all that cash. Their hoarding of it hints that they think the next transformative innovation could be just around the corner. If in fact they do \u2014 and if they\u2019re right \u2014 it\u2019s good news for all of us.Adam Davidson is a founder of NPR\u2019s \u2018\u2018Planet Money\u2019\u2019 and a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Under No Certain Search Terms ", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "Supported byAuthor\u2019s NoteWhen you\u2019re writing a book based on archival research and you have two children who come home from school at 3, no matter how much you love libraries, you become grateful for Google. For three years, I sat down most mornings at my dining room table in my slippers and read newspapers printed in the 1870s. No need to travel to distant archives, or spend fruitless hours turning the wrong pages. I could open a browser, punch in a range of dates and a few search terms, and within seconds have a presorted queue of articles, every one of which was relevant. I could feel confident that when it came to coverage of, let\u2019s say, an embassy of Japanese statesmen arriving in San Francisco in 1872, I hadn\u2019t missed a single mention. I blessed the librarians who had digitized their holdings, and got to work.But there\u2019s a problem with doing research this way: You find exactly what you\u2019re looking for, and nothing you\u2019re not.The whole reason I was writing this book was serendipity. Fresh from a degree in Japanese history, I had been poking happily and aimlessly through the venerable stacks of the New York Society \u00adLibrary when I found treasure. Two floors below street level were the Japanese travel books: shelf after dusty shelf of gloriously ornate and forgotten Victorian volumes, written by intrepid travelers who had spent a month or a season in a Japan that remained, in the later decades of the 19th century, deliciously mysterious to foreign eyes.One of these books, more understated than the others, caught my attention. Titled simply \u201cA Japanese Interior\u201d (1893), it was a lively memoir by a New Haven-born schoolteacher, Alice Mabel Bacon, who had taught for a year in a Tokyo school in the late 1880s. She had, she explained, lived not with the expatriate community in Tokyo, but among Japanese friends \u201cknown long and intimately in America.\u201d This was strange. A Connecticut Yankee of her era simply wouldn\u2019t have intimate Japanese friends, certainly not ones encountered outside Japan. Following where Alice led, I discovered the extraordinary story of three samurai girls \u2014 ages 7, 10 and 11 \u2014 who came to America for a decade in the 1870s to learn Western ways, and then returned to help modernize Japan.

I had to be efficient in my research; that\u2019s where Google came in. But whenever possible, I tried to create space for aimless wandering, and every time, the story became more vivid.People call it \u201cresearch rapture\u201d \u2014 the rare and ecstatic moment when you slip the bonds of the present and follow a twinkling detail into the past. I spent most of a week reading about Chiarini\u2019s Royal Italian Circus and Menagerie, which during the summer and fall of 1886 delighted the citizens of Tokyo with \u201cNubian lions,\u201d Bengal tigers, \u201cBrazilian cobras\u201d and feats of \u201cretro-equitation\u201d by a young lady who styled herself La Petite Roland. The empress herself attended, appearing publicly in Western dress \u2014 black silk and a white ostrich feather in her hat \u2014 for the first time. Widespread reports that one \u00adperformer had been gravely injured when, having \u201cinserted his head into the mouth of one of the tigers, the animal suddenly closed its jaws\u201d turned out to be false.Chiarini\u2019s circus received barely two lines in my final draft, but the time was not wasted. I felt the heat of that cholera-ridden summer, saw the surge in ticket sales as the cool of autumn brought an end to the epidemic. I read one editorial criticizing the clowns for condescending to their audiences with \u201cpidgin Japanese, and tiresome tomfoolery,\u201d and another expressing discomfort with the gladiatorial bloodthirstiness of the lion show. I sat alongside the other punters on a ringside bench, craning for a glimpse of the befeathered empress in the imperial box. When at last I wrenched myself away from the spectacle, it was with a deeper sense of the place and time I was trying to evoke.It\u2019s not enough to find every mention of a specific event, even though algorithms make it easy. Sometimes the telling detail \u2014 the yeast that makes the whole lump rise \u2014 isn\u2019t in the headline you\u2019re reading.

He said he heard them talking through the walls about him.\u201dMr. Feliz-Volquez was arraigned in Brooklyn Criminal Court on Monday night and ordered held without bail.An assistant district attorney, Jaclyn Wood, said he \u201cappears to have planned the attack for weeks.\u201d He stored the machete in his bedroom and waited until he knew Ms. Torres-Gonzalez was in the hallway before striking her \u201cover and over,\u201d Ms. Wood said, severing her hand and leaving several other deep lacerations.While the prosecution said Mr. Feliz-Volquez had given a detailed confession, the defendant\u2019s lawyer, Matthew McParttland, said his client denied all the charges.The death brought sorrow to those who knew Ms. Torres-Gonzalez.Born in Utuado, Puerto Rico, she was one of three daughters in a family of coffee farmers, said her cousin, Carmen Rodriguez, who lives in Puerto Rico but was visiting her son in Lakewood, N.J., at the time of her cousin\u2019s death.Ms. Torres-Gonzalez moved to New York in the 1980s, shortly after marrying Carmelo Torres, who died 20 years ago of cancer, relatives said. The couple had two daughters.For many years Ms. Torres-Gonzalez taught Spanish to preschool-age children in the Bronx. She was like a missionary, said another cousin, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she was afraid of the killer and his family. The cousin said Ms. Torres-Gonzalez was always making visits to nearby nursing homes and hospitals, some where she was registered to offer comfort to families of the deceased or the terminally ill.\u201cShe was a very truthful Christian woman her whole life,\u201d Ms. Rodriguez, 64, said by phone from her son\u2019s home in New Jersey. \u201cEverybody is going to tell you the same thing.\u201dBut her regular visits to her 77-year-old mother, Ana Elba Rodriguez-Gonzalez, had put her in contact with Mr. Feliz-Volquez, whose erratic behavior had drawn at least four visits by the authorities since June, the official said. Twice, the police came and Mr. Feliz-Volquez was taken for observation to Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center; the two other 911 calls were handled by ambulance crews.Mr. Feliz-Volquez\u2019s mother told investigators her son had a mental illness, was prescribed medication for schizophrenia and had been \u201cin and out\u201d of institutions, the law enforcement official said. On Aug. 24, Mr. Feliz-Volquez pleaded guilty to third-degree assault, according to court papers, after he hit a co-worker at a restaurant in Manhattan, the official said.One night two months ago, Ms. Torres-Gonzalez and her mother heard someone banging against the metal door of her mother\u2019s apartment around 11 p.m., said the cousin who spoke on the condition of anonymity. They looked out the peephole, but could not see anyone, and called the police.Officers took a criminal mischief complaint, but the case was closed because no one could figure out who did it, the official said. The door still bears damage from the attack \u2014 a series of two-inch marks in the thin blue paint, and some tearing in the metal.At the building on Sunday, police officers and medics found a hallway awash in blood. They recovered the machete and took Mr. Feliz-Volquez into custody.According to the account of the home health aide, the armed man approached the two women fast, did not say a word, and began swinging. Ms. Torres-Gonzalez raised her arms to block the man from entering the apartment where her mother was, the cousin said.Ms. Torres-Gonzalez fell to the ground. The health worker ran, screaming and knocking on doors, the official said. At one point, she looked back and \u201csaw the guy standing over the woman, on the ground, with the machete in hand,\u201d the official said.The death will leave a void, Ms. Rodriguez said, especially for Ms. Torres-Gonzalez\u2019s two sisters. One of them, Nilda, is still a neighbor of Ms. Rodriguez in Puerto Rico and the other, Gloria, lives in Connecticut.Though some found comfort in the quick arrest of a suspect, Jacqueline Ramirez, 36, another relative of Ms. Torres-Gonzalez\u2019s, said the killing\u2019s grisly circumstances were haunting.\u201cIt\u2019s just so sad, the way she died, how tragic it was,\u201d said Ms. Ramirez, who lives in Lakewood, N.J. \u201cIt hurts more. It\u2019s crazy,\u201d she added. \u201cI thought she was going to come down next weekend, so we could cook for her,\u201d she said.Noah Remnick contributed reporting, and Susan C.

{"Headline": "The Timeshare Hard Sell Comes Roaring Back", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "Supported byFor more than 25 years, Mary Ann Gutierrez, 77, has spent several weeks a year at on the southern shore of Lake Tahoe, Calif., often playing host to her children and grandchildren at one of two timeshare units she owns.When she checked into one of the properties last year, she was stopped at the front desk. A $100 gift card would be hers if she attended a presentation by Diamond Resorts International, the company that owns the resort. But first she had to fill out some papers and supply her credit card information.The gift card came with a cost, as Ms. Gutierrez soon learned. For five hours, she said, Diamond representatives pushed her to give up both of her timeshare deeds, including one at the nearby Tahoe Beach & Ski Club, a resort that Diamond does not own. With the upgrade and membership in Diamond\u2019s ownership points system, they said, she would keep her maintenance costs low and could use her points at other resorts in the company\u2019s network. It would cost just $30,000 upfront, they said.Even when representatives suggested her maintenance fees would rise if she didn\u2019t switch, Ms. Gutierrez kept declining, saying that the cost was too high. Undeterred, the Diamond representatives suggested that she ask her children to pay for the upgrade. She continued to say no and, at last, they let her go.\u201cThey weren\u2019t going to let me out that door,\u201d Ms. Gutierrez said. \u201cI was shaking, I was so nervous.\u201dThe feeling turned to shock, however, when a Diamond representative handed her a record of a voided charge in the amount of $4,840 on her credit card. The representatives had been so certain that she would agree to the offer that they had charged her card for the down payment \u2014 even though she had not given approval.After crashing in the financial collapse, timeshare sales are rising again, and with them high-pressure sales practices such as those Ms. Gutierrez described. Perhaps acknowledging these problems, some in the industry have cautioned in recent months that regulators from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau could increase their oversight. New rules would affect all operators, including big players like Diamond, Interval Leisure Group, Marriott Vacations Worldwide and Wyndham Worldwide. But tighter regulation might have an especially big impact on Diamond, because its business is devoted solely to timeshare sales and management.Interviews with timeshare owners, lawyers and other specialists in the arena, moreover, suggest that Diamond\u2019s sales practices can be especially forceful.\u201cIn my experience, Diamond is much more ambitious, aggressive and downright nasty in their sales presentations compared to Marriott and Westin,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cDiamond just has an amazing reputation of being tough on people.\u201dDavid F. Palmer, Diamond\u2019s chief executive, sees its sales methods in a very different light. In an interview, Mr. Palmer described how Diamond tries to bring fun to its customer interactions, both before an initial sale and once a member buys in. \u201cThe industry didn\u2019t quite realize that you have to engage and create intimacy and pervasiveness with somebody that you don\u2019t really know,\u201d he said. \u201cOur lifetime subscription model creates a series of systems where you can track that engagement and make sure you are constantly providing a series of experiences that exceed their expectations over many, many years.\u201dNeither Mr. Palmer nor the company\u2019s spokeswoman would discuss Ms. Gutierrez\u2019s experience. But on the topic of high-pressure sales tactics, Mr. Palmer said, \u201cI have belligerently zero tolerance for anyone who goes off script.\u201dDiamond has had great success in the industry. In less than 10 years, the company\u2019s revenue reached $845 million last year, more than double the 2010 figure. Its average timeshare transaction price was $21,700 last year, up from $12,510 in 2012.But while Diamond\u2019s growth has benefited its executives \u2014 Mr. Palmer received a total of $19 million in compensation in the most recent two years for which figures are available \u2014 the company\u2019s business practices seem to have alienated some customers.In lawsuits and in interviews, customers complain not only of high-pressure sales, but also of sky-high maintenance fees and frustration at procedures that block club members from taking vacations where and when they want. Perhaps most distressing to owners is the fact that once you buy into a timeshare it is almost impossible to get out.Larry Vicks, a retired engineer in upstate New York, is a disgruntled Diamond resort member who read the transcript of a Diamond conference call with Wall Street analysts and investors. \u201cIt made me laugh how they are making boatloads of money,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe reason I\u2019m laughing is that it\u2019s all at my expense.\u201dIn the early years of timeshares, owners received deeds specifying their ownership. Now, the industry has moved to a system where buyers receive a certain number of points they can use for time and amenities, rather than a deed.Many timeshare buyers say they like being assured time at a resort they enjoy without the hassle of owning a second home. Using their points for a vacation at a different location managed by their timeshare company is another potential benefit.Diamond, which was created in 2007 by Stephen J. Cloobeck, a veteran of the vacation ownership industry, has its headquarters in Las Vegas. The company operates 99 resorts worldwide and has associations with an additional 255 resorts and four cruise itineraries that it says its members can use. The company\u2019s tagline: \u201cWe Love to Say Yes.\u201dBut two lawsuits filed against Diamond suggest a less solicitous attitude, one that reflects the experience of Ms. Gutierrez in Lake Tahoe. One case was filed in October 2014 in California. In it, 11 timeshare owners said they had agreed to pay to upgrade their membership in the Diamond resorts. After the upgrade, the lawsuit says, the members were unable to use the resorts they had hoped to and their maintenance fees rose even though Diamond\u2019s representatives had told them they would fall.A Florida lawsuit filed in March 2015 said that Diamond tried to pressure the plaintiffs to upgrade to what amounted to \u201cprograms to fleece more and more money out of the plaintiffs.\u201dThe two suits seek cancellation of the contracts, money back and unspecified damages.Diamond declined to comment on the California case; it said that the litigants in the Florida suit \u201cnever made a purchase from Diamond\u201d but were owners in a resort company it had purchased without assuming such liabilities.Not all of Diamond\u2019s customers are unhappy, of course. Six members whose names were supplied by Diamond were all complimentary.Walter Hunter, a retired chemist who lives in Fort Collins, Colo., is one. A member of the homeowners\u2019 association board at Daytona Beach Regency, a Diamond resort in Florida, Mr. Hunter, 94, said in an interview that he was happy with the company\u2019s management. With Diamond, \u201cwe\u2019ve been more pleased, the resort is better managed,\u201d he said. Although he acknowledged that maintenance costs rose significantly after Diamond came in, he said, \u201cWe are convinced that they are doing a good job.\u201dOwners of timeshares in desirable resorts with unusual attributes, like a private beach, can often sell their ownership interests on the secondary market. But in areas glutted with condos for sale or rent, selling a timeshare can be almost impossible. In these cases, timeshare ownership can become an almost perpetual liability.Rub\u00e9n Pe\u00f1a\u2019s experience is a case in point. An engineering consultant with Pro Data Inc. in Jersey City, Mr. Pe\u00f1a has never been inside the Las Vegas timeshare he bought 15 years ago. After spending roughly $42,000 to buy and maintain the property over those years, Mr. Pe\u00f1a stopped paying his loan, which had an original interest rate approaching 17 percent, and maintenance fees. He bought the timeshare from a company called Pacific Monarch Resorts, which went bankrupt. Diamond now owns and manages the resort.\u201cI wanted to deed back the property to Diamond and get my equity of about $27,000 out,\u201d Mr. Pe\u00f1a said in an interview. \u201cBut I got no response whatsoever.\u201dBefore he stopped paying his loan in 2014, Mr. Pe\u00f1a was being charged $3,262 a year in interest, taxes and maintenance fees for his ownership interest in the timeshare. Expedia.com offers a week at the propertyfor, at most, a little over $2,000.Diamond declined to comment on Mr. Pe\u00f1a. But the company said that one reason it doesn\u2019t buy back members\u2019 stakes is that it would create accounting problems related to how Diamond had booked the revenue.Don Nelms is a Diamond member and longtime owner of an insurance agency in Sedona, Ariz. In an interview at the company\u2019s suggestion, he said that he was pleased with Diamond\u2019s resort management. But he added that he was troubled by the company\u2019s refusal to buy back timeshare holdings from customers who can no longer afford them or just want out. Acknowledging that this practice is industrywide, he said changing it would be an \u201cowner-friendly\u201d move by Diamond.\u201cIf it\u2019s paid-up on the principal, they could purchase that from an owner at maybe a reduced market value that helps the person who wants to say goodbye,\u201d he said. Not making that effort, he added, \u201ccould be something that blows up in their face.\u201dCompanies like Diamond benefit from the lack of an organized buyers\u2019 market for timeshares. The company\u2019s most recent annual financial filing noted that if such a market \u201cwere to become more organized and liquid,\u201d the resulting availability of vacation units \u201ccould adversely affect our sales and our sales prices.\u201dAnd even if an owner defaults and walks away from maintenance fees, Diamond can prosper. It simply repossesses the unit at little cost and tries to resell.An official at the bureau declined to comment on the industry.Aggressive sales tactics are among the most common complaints. Typically, potential timeshare buyers are invited to a free or low-cost mini-vacation at a resort if they agree to attend a sales presentation during their stay. Participants say fast-talking, commission-paid sales representatives often run these events, emphasizing the merits of timeshares as investments and downplaying their shortcomings.Customers are told the meetings will last less than two hours, but they often go on far longer, and participants find it difficult to leave.Speaking about the industry generally, Mr. Finn said that buyers are often led to believe they are making a real estate deal and that their holding will have a value that they can recoup in a resale or pass on to their children.\u201cNothing can be further from the truth,\u201d Mr. Finn said.In November, Diamond said that over the last 12 months it had conducted about 221,000 tours at its 53 sales offices around the world. The company says that 15.1 percent of tours result in sales.Diamond says its innovative programs \u201cinfuse hospitality into our sales and marketing efforts.\u201d Its \u201cEvents of a Lifetime\u201d include golf outings with a professional, spring training with Reggie Jackson, the baseball Hall of Famer, or tickets to a show near a Diamond-owned resort.In the interview, Mr. Palmer said he was proud that roughly 60 percent of the company\u2019s sales came from existing customers. \u201cI wear it like a badge of honor,\u201d he said. \u201cThese people bought from us, and they want to own more.\u201dIn addition, he noted, sales are regulated by state authorities. \u201cNo one stumbles into a purchase here,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have five to 10 days to think about it.\u201dBut even fans of Diamond recognize that accusations of high-pressure sales tactics in the industry can be problematic for property managers. \u201cThere\u2019s some natural tension between management who wants to create the best experience possible, and the sales organization \u2014 they are motivated to want different things,\u201d said Terry Timm, a Diamond timeshare owner who is chief administrative officer of Thrivent, a financial services company. \u201cThe way timeshare sales are structured have really really incentivized the wrong things.\u201dDiamond often buys resorts that have fallen into bankruptcy, acquiring timeshare owners as part of the deals. After Diamond takes over a resort, it usually becomes the management company and often raises maintenance fees.Some of these increases reflect the costs of necessary improvements at resorts that have fallen on hard times. But Diamond members who are critical of the company say that it typically gains control of the resort\u2019s governing board, known as the homeowners\u2019 association, giving timeshare owners little say in how money is spent.Owners at some resorts are wary about ceding any board control to Diamond. Jacob Bercu, is a retired Silicon Valley software engineer and longtime resort owner at Tahoe Beach & Ski. A few years ago, some of the resort\u2019s roughly 7,000 owners noticed that Diamond was buying up defaulted timeshare segments at county tax auctions. Last September he won a board seat sought by a Diamond representative. \u201cWe took aggressive action to keep them away from the ownership, to convince our owners not to sell out and, instead, to vote for us so we keep control,\u201d Mr. Bercu said.Timeshare owners of the Grand Beach Resort, a 192-unit property in Orlando, Fla., on the other hand, learned in a letter in September that their annual maintenance fee would rise 14.9 percent this year. Management fees paid by the resort members, the letter said, are expected to jump to a total of $1.15 million from about $366,000 in 2015.Diamond said the increases at Grand Beach resulted from a new management contract, consistent with the company\u2019s deals elsewhere, and higher operating costs and reserves for renovations.The chief beneficiary of these cost increases is Diamond, which levies management fees at the properties it owns and operates. Diamond tells investors that it typically reaps a fee equal to as much as 15 percent more than the costs of running a resort: labor, utilities, taxes and other overhead, including the reserve funds kept for emergencies.\u201cAnything that is put in the budget that gets expended on an annual basis, we get our 15 percent fee,\u201d Mr. Palmer explained to investors at a September 2014 conference, according to a transcript. \u201cThat is basically a 100 percent profit business.\u201dIn the interview, Mr. Palmer added that the company was completely transparent with owners about its charges. \u201cAll the costs are disclosed on a private website,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are no hidden fees.\u201dDiamond\u2019s founder, Mr. Cloobeck, is something of a celebrity.This compensation disturbs owners faced with rising maintenance costs extracted by Diamond. Among them is Eleanor Varkel, a caterer from South Africa who has two of the company\u2019s timeshares, one in Las Vegas and another in Hawaii. Both were taken over by Diamond after the companies operating the resorts collapsed.\u201cEvery year the maintenance fees go up, up, up,\u201d Ms. Varkel said in an interview. \u201cWe were paying $300 a year in maintenance 15 years ago, and now it\u2019s gone up to $2,000 a year.\u201d Ms. Varkel said she had tried, unsuccessfully, to sell her ownership stake either to Diamond or elsewhere. \u201cYou can\u2019t give it away, not even to charity.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the number of resorts operated by Diamond. It is 99 resorts, not 93.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Report Exposes Widespread Abuses in Ticketing Industry in New York", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Supported byFree tickets to an appearance by Pope Francis were resold for thousands of dollars, in ways that most likely violated New York State law. As many as half the seats for many popular concerts are not offered to the general public. And for one U2 show at Madison Square Garden, a single high-tech scalper bought more than 1,000 tickets in less than a minute.Those are some of the findings in a detailed report to be released on Thursday by the New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, about the opaque world of ticket scalping for concerts, sports and other entertainment events. The report, titled \u201cWhy Can\u2019t New Yorkers Get Tickets?\u201d is the result of a three-year investigation of the online ticketing market, and portrays a complex business in which technologically adept ticket brokers are able to profit at the expense of ordinary fans.\u201cTicketing is a fixed game,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman said in a statement. \u201cMy office will continue to crack down on those who break our laws, prey on ordinary consumers and deny New Yorkers affordable access to the concerts and sporting events they love. This investigation is just the beginning of our efforts to create a level playing field in the ticket industry.\u201dLongstanding restrictions on ticket scalping in New York State were mostly lifted in 2007 as online sales became increasingly popular with consumers. But the attorney general\u2019s report says that the online ticketing market has developed in ways that are often illegal.Resale brokers are required to have a license from the state, but the report found that many do not. Along with the report, the attorney general announced that it had reached settlements with two professional brokers that have operated without licenses. One broker, M.S.M.S.S. of Manhattan agreed to pay $80,000 in penalties, and Extra Base Tickets, of Garden City, N.Y., will pay $65,000.The report also notes common practices in the music industry that are not illegal but make it difficult for ordinary fans to get tickets. Among those are so-called holds, in which large blocks of tickets are withheld for performers or sponsors; and special presales, in which tickets are offered to credit card holders or members of fan clubs.The report, which mostly addresses the New York City area but also looked at some venues upstate like the Saratoga Performing Arts Center, says that as many as 54 percent of the tickets to most concerts are tied up in holds and presales. For one Kanye West show, at Barclays Center in 2013, 29 percent of the tickets were held for insiders. For 10 shows by top acts including Coldplay and Fleetwood Mac, the report says that as many as 70 percent of the tickets were reserved for presales.The report makes a number of recommendations, including asking concert promoters to be more transparent about how tickets are released to the public, and encouraging secondary ticket markets to police their systems more thoroughly.The attorney general also recommended that the state\u2019s Legislature remove its restrictions on so-called paperless ticketing, a technology that was introduced to thwart scalpers but, according to the report, is subject to a \u201cde facto ban\u201d because any show using nontransferable paperless tickets is also required to offer them in transferable form, undercutting their purpose.In a statement, Ticketmaster, which is owned by Live Nation Entertainment, said that it cooperated with the investigation and that the company supported the attorney general\u2019s efforts to manage bots and the elimination of the paperless ticketing ban. A spokesman for StubHub said he had not seen the report and could not comment.Advertisement"}

Instead, the company will offer part of its mortgage insurance unit in an initial public offering, sell its financial advisory business and create nine distinct operations in its commercial and consumer divisions that could pave the way for future sales or spinoffs.The company plans to spend $25 billion on stock buybacks and dividends over two years, and to cut $1.6 billion from operating costs. It shored up its loss reserves by another $3.6 billion.\u201cNow is not the time to be shortsighted and simply react to the demands of those who challenge us,\u201d Mr. Hancock said in a memo to employees on Tuesday. He later told analysts during a presentation that the SIFI designation \u201cmay be issue number 15\u201d on a long list of strategic issues that A.I.G. faces.Whether Tuesday\u2019s strategic announcements will win over the activist shareholders remains to be seen. And Mr. Hancock did not entirely slam the door shut on further divestments.\u201cThere are no sacred cows,\u201d he said.Still, the executive is taking a different approach than others like MetLife, which earlier this month announced plans to separate its United States retail operations to get them out from under the SIFI label. MetLife, which is also suing regulators over the designation, has said that the split will allow the businesses to compete more effectively with smaller companies that are not subject to the extra regulation and capital requirements that being a SIFI brings. General Electric is selling off its GE Capital unit piecemeal to escape the designation as well.Shares of A.I.G. closed up 1 percent on Tuesday.A former JPMorgan executive, Mr. Hancock joined A.I.G. in 2010, as the company was trying to recover from the financial crisis and its $185 billion government bailout. He took over as chief executive in September 2014, replacing Robert Benmosche, who died last year.To repay the government, A.I.G. sold dozens of businesses and other assets, halving its size and narrowing its focus, though activist investors said it still was not focused enough.But in that process, A.I.G. evolved into a company that had lower risk, fewer assets and less short-term borrowing compared with other SIFI companies like Prudential and MetLife, Mr. Hancock told analysts on Tuesday.That suggests he thinks that A.I.G. already holds enough capital to comply with whatever levels regulators will ultimately set. The regulations have yet to be written.\u201cWe had to deal up front with these issues,\u201d Mr. Hancock said. \u201cSo we managed to get a jump on the whole process.\u201dMr. Icahn, who said in November that he owned 42 million shares of A.I.G., did not respond to requests for comment. Still, he has made his impatience known. He could start a proxy fight to secure a board seat and make additional management changes.Mr. Icahn has increased the pressure since then.\u201cWe believe the current situation is too time-sensitive to even wait until the company\u2019s next annual meeting next spring,\u201d he wrote in November. \u201cManagement has been either purposefully misleading in their public disclosures or is negligently uninformed regarding the feasibility\u201d of a breakup plan, he said in another letter last week.For Mr. Icahn, the financial stakes of a successful outcome at A.I.G. are high. Despite successes such as Time Warner and eBay, his more recent investments, especially in energy, have faltered.He has argued that A.I.G. could extract more value for shareholders by splitting its life insurance operations entirely from its property and casualty business, which contributed 41 percent of operating revenue through the third quarter of last year. Companies focused on a single line of business, he says, generate better returns and have higher market values.The company says its annual cost of being a SIFI is $130 million versus the $1.3 billion tax benefit it gets from holding life insurance and property insurance together in the same company, making diversification, at least for now, more attractive.\u201cWe\u2019re absolutely open to additional divestitures beyond what we\u2019ve talked about even of our largest units,\u201d Mr. Hancock told analysts on Tuesday. \u201cBut you don\u2019t make a decision of that scale without thinking very hard about the impact on tax and on our financial strength.\u201dAs for the details of the plan announced on Tuesday, A.I.G. will have an I.P.O. for 19.9 percent of United Guaranty by midyear, with the eventual goal of full separation. It is selling A.I.G. Advisory Group, with 5,200 independent advisers and 800 employees, for an undisclosed amount to Lightyear Capital and the Canadian pension investment manager PSP Investments. It is also moving underperforming older assets into a new \u201clegacy\u201d business to be run by Charlie Shamieh, who has led the life, health and disability insurance business. The legacy business will have $22 billion of equity and will aim to sell or wind down the businesses in the portfolio over time.Breaking down the remaining operations into clear divisions, or \u201cmodules\u201d \u2014 Mr. Hancock referred to a similar action by Google Inc. \u2014 is supposed to make it easier for investors to analyze whether the individual businesses are performing up to snuff.\u201cManagement should be prepared for and willing to listen to investor comments about selling more of those modules,\u201d two Citigroup analysts, Todd Bault and Erik Bass, wrote in a note on Tuesday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the Post Office Makes America Great", "Date": "2016-01-01", "News": "Supported byI WAS transported recently to a place that is as enchanting to me as any winter wonderland: my local post office.In line, I thought fondly of the year I came to this country from Turkey as an adult and discovered the magic of reliable mail service. Dependable infrastructure is magical not simply because it works, but also because it allows innovation to thrive, including much of the Internet-based economy that has grown in the past decade. You can\u2019t have Amazon or eBay without a reliable way to get things to people\u2019s homes.Of course, infrastructure is also boring, so we get used to it and forget what a gift it truly is. I never do, maybe because I discovered it so late.My first year in the United States was full of surprises. I remember trying to figure out if the 24-ounce glass of ice water the waitress placed in front of me was a pitcher, to be shared by the whole table. But where was the spout? I had expected some of what I encountered \u2014 I had seen enough movies, and came to this country expecting big cars and big houses and wide open spaces. I got used to gigantic glasses.But I didn\u2019t expect the post office.The first time I needed to mail something, I trekked over to my campus\u2019s post office, looking for the line to get my envelope weighed. The staff was used to befuddled international students like me, I suppose, and one clerk took my envelope without fuss, said \u201cfirst class letter,\u201d and took my change.Then I discovered some vending machines outside the office. People came and bought stamps. \u201cSo many people must be into stamp collecting,\u201d I thought to myself. Was that another weird American quirk? Otherwise, why would people waste money buying stamps in advance, without having their letters weighed?Something I take for granted now just didn\u2019t occur to me: There were standardized rates, and you could just slap a stamp on your letter, drop it in a mailbox, and it would go to its destination.I then encountered a visa service that asked me to mail in my passport. My precious, precious passport. With a self-addressed, stamped envelope for its return. I laughed at the audacity of the request. Despite being a broke student, I booked a plane trip. I couldn\u2019t envision putting my passport in the mail. I\u2019ve since learned that this is a common practice, and I\u2019ve even done it once or twice myself. But it still does not come easy to me.I noticed that Americans were a particularly patriotic bunch: So many of them had red flags on their mailboxes. Sometimes they would put those flags up. I presumed it was to celebrate national holidays I did not yet know about. But why did some people have their flags up while others did not? And why weren\u2019t they American flags anyway? As in Istanbul, where I grew up, I assumed patriotism had different interpretations and expressions.Yes, I was told, in the United States, mail gets picked up from your house, six days a week, free of charge.I told my friends in Turkey about all this. They shook their heads in disbelief, wondering how easily I had been recruited as a C.I.A. agent, saying implausibly flattering things about my new country. The United States in the world\u2019s imagination is a place of risk taking and ruthless competition, not one of reliable public services.I bit my tongue and did not tell my already suspicious friends that the country was also dotted with libraries that provided books to all patrons free of charge. They wouldn\u2019t believe me anyway since I hadn\u2019t believed it myself. My first time in a library in the United States was very brief: I walked in, looked around, and ran right back out in a panic, certain that I had accidentally used the wrong entrance. Surely, these open stacks full of books were reserved for staff only. I was used to libraries being rare, and their few books inaccessible. To this day, my heart races a bit in a library.Over the years, I\u2019ve come to appreciate the link between infrastructure, innovation \u2014 and even ruthless competition. Much of our modern economy thrives here because you can order things online and expect them to be delivered. There are major private delivery services, too, but the United States Postal Service is often better equipped to make it to certain destinations. In fact, Internet sellers, and even private carriers, often use the U.S.P.S. as their delivery mechanism to addresses outside densely populated cities.Infrastructure is often the least-appreciated part of what makes a country strong, and what makes innovation take flight. From my spot in line at the post office, I see a country that does both well; not a country that emphasizes one at the expense of the other.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Xerox, in Deal With Carl Icahn, to Split Company in Two", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Supported byA onetime Xerox intern who climbed the ranks all the way to the top to become the first black female chief executive in corporate America \u2014 Ms. Burns had been the biggest champion of buying Affiliated Computer Services. The deal, which was announced in 2009, was instrumental in her effort to push the 110-year-old Xerox into significant new business lines.On Friday, Xerox\u2019s fate was sealed, as the company announced plans to spin off its services business, largely consisting of A.C.S., as its own publicly traded company by the end of the year. The remainder of Xerox will include the technology that made the company synonymous with photocopying.The names and leadership teams of the two companies have yet to be determined. Based in Norwalk, Conn., Xerox plans to cut about $2.4 billion in costs across both companies over the next three years. The company, which employs more than 140,000 globally, did not detail whether there would be job cuts.The A.C.S. deal was born of what one person close to the company described as a bold push to recognize the changing landscape. Unlike another corporate icon also born in Rochester, Eastman Kodak, Xerox realized that it needed to quickly push into digital businesses. Buying A.C.S. was intended to provide much-needed diversity.Yet the deal was not enough to transform Xerox.\u201cXerox started to lose speed in the technology race,\u201d said Abraham Seidmann, Xerox professor of computers and information systems and operations management at the University of Rochester\u2019s Simon Business School. \u201cThe hope was that they would find synergy between printing and the A.C.S. sales force. The split tells us that this synergy did not work the way they wanted it to work.\u201dXerox had a market value of more than $16 billion in 2010 after the acquisition of A.C.S. closed. It plummeted to about $9 billion as of Thursday, as shareholders grappled with four consecutive years of declining annual sales. On Friday, investors welcomed the split, sending Xerox shares up 5.6 percent.In November, as Ms. Burns and the Xerox board deliberated what to do, both came to recognize that drastic action was needed.The billionaire investor publicly reported his stake in late November \u2014 soon after, as it turns out, the board had essentially decided to proceed with the split.Still, Mr. Icahn, a veteran of untold noisy corporate battles, represented a big potential headache for management. Yet from the first meeting in early December between the billionaire and Ms. Burns, one without advisers present, the two sides found common ground.Both were the product of New York City upbringings \u2014 Ms. Burns, 57, was a child of a Lower East Side housing project, and Mr. Icahn, who is 79, a denizen of Far Rockaway in Queens. They found that, essentially, they agreed on strategy. He suggested that Ms. Burns divide the company, but it was a path she had already been seriously considering.By late January, the sides amicably and quickly negotiated the terms of a settlement. Mr. Icahn is taking seats only on what will be the former A.C.S. business, without claiming seats on the Xerox documents company.\u201cWe applaud Ursula Burns and Xerox\u2019s board of directors for recognizing the importance of separating Xerox into two publicly traded companies,\u201d Mr. Icahn said in a statement.The plan announced on Friday, however, mentioned no role for Ms. Burns. Such a decision is unusual for companies breaking themselves apart, with the existing chief executive usually choosing to keep that role at one of the newly separated businesses or staying on as chairman.For instance, Meg Whitman claimed the role of C.E.O. of Hewlett-Packard\u2019s enterprise company. John Donahoe became the chairman of PayPal after its Icahn-instigated separation from eBay.\u201cWhat I wanted our board and our management team and me to do was to think about what the best path for the company is going forward, not what the best role is for me,\u201d Ms. Burns said in an interview on CNBC on Friday.Ms. Burns is a prominent figure in corporate America, serving on the boards of Exxon Mobil and American Express, among those of other companies and organizations.As part of the settlement, Mr. Icahn will choose a person to advise on the C.E.O. search process for the services business. Those who know them say Mr. Icahn respects Ms. Burns and would like her to stay.For now, it is unclear whether she will remain with Xerox\u2019s documents business or choose to serve as an executive or director at some other company.\u201cI don\u2019t think she herself knows if she will stay or not,\u201d said Dr. Seidmann, of the University of Rochester. \u201cShe did not deliver the excitement for shareholders. She\u2019s organized, has an eye on the bottom line, but there\u2019s no vision. Companies these days need a vision.\u201dThe transaction is expected to be tax-free to Xerox shareholders for federal income tax purposes.Lazard and Goldman Sachs provided financial advice to Xerox, while Centerview Partners advised the board. Cravath, Swaine & Moore served as the legal adviser to Xerox; and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison advised the board.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Xerox Chief Removed Ego From Decision to Split Company", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsChief executives usually have big egos. Ursula Burns, though, is handing bragging rights to the billionaire investor Carl C. Icahn.Mr. Icahn agitated for the split and revealed a stake in Xerox last November. Ms. Burns told investors the previous month that the board was seriously considering strategic options for the company. Xerox suffers from shrinking sales in its photocopying and printing business, known as document technology, and from a steady decline in its stock price since late 2014.Ms. Burns does have one problem relating to the new plan. Her defining bet in 2009, the same year she took the helm at Xerox, was to buy Affiliated Computer Services for $6.4 billion. This so-called business-process outsourcing operation \u2013 managing often paper-based administrative tasks for companies in health care, finance and other sectors \u2013 is now being separated again.She may be right that seven years in business are like seven dog years: Things change quickly. But the reversal somewhat undermines her earlier judgment, and if nothing else may mean that it is time for leaders with new ideas at the two planned Xerox offshoots.That said, corner-office occupants more often than not fit themselves into any significant corporate rejig. At Hewlett-Packard, whose split is something of a model for Xerox, the 2014 decision to separate into two companies came with news that Meg Whitman would continue as chief executive of one and chairwoman of the other. When eBay, another Icahn target, announced its divorce from PayPal the same year, it named two new chief executives but said its boss, John Donahoe, would remain on the board of one or both the companies.Advertisement"}
