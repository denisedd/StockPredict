She became an American citizen, advertised her new tequila and appeared tirelessly to promote her new film \u201cThe 33,\u201d a retelling of the story of the trapped Chilean miners in 2010, in which she stars alongside Antonio Banderas as his valiant wife.After she addressed him on Twitter the following year and urged him to use his wealth for good, he sent her flowers. The contact flourished after his 2014 capture. He wanted his story on film, and he chose her to produce it.Here is what you need to know about the secret mountaintop meeting between Sean Penn and the drug lord Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Loera, also known as \u201cEl Chapo.\u201dIn the middle of her musing, Ms. del Castillo suddenly referred to Mr. Guzm\u00e1n by his nickname, \u201cEl Chapo,\u201d or \u201cShorty\u201d: \u201cToday I believe more in Chapo Guzm\u00e1n than in the governments that hide the truth although it may be painful, who hide the cure for cancers, AIDS, etc, for their own benefit and wealth.\u201dThen she addressed Mr. Guzm\u00e1n in capital letters. \u201cMr. Chapo, wouldn\u2019t it be cool if you began to traffic in what is good,\u201d she wrote, continuing, \u201cIn cures for diseases, in food for street children, in alcohol for the elderly in old peoples\u2019 homes that don\u2019t let them spend their last years doing whatever\u201d they feel like. Her language, in places, was rather stronger. She called on him to burn down brothels where women \u201care worth no more than a pack of cigarettes\u201d and concluded the section by writing, \u201cCome on, Don,\u201d using a Spanish term of respect. \u201cYou would be the hero of heroes. Let\u2019s traffic in love, you know how.\u201dThe letter created a stir on social media and drew criticism, but she stood by it. She was asked about it again after Mr. Guzm\u00e1n escaped from prison last July through a tunnel, a feat she called \u201ccrazy funny\u201d from the red carpet at a film festival in Spain.See the route that Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Loera, a drug kingpin known as El Chapo, used to escape from Mexico\u2019s most secure prison.Before her star turn in \u201cLa Reina del Sur,\u201d a production by the Spanish-language television network Telemundo, a division of NBCUniversal and the Spanish network Antena 3, Ms. del Castillo rose through the stable of actresses nurtured by the giant Mexican network Televisa, appearing in their weepy soap operas. She then appeared in several films set on the United States border with Mexico and played a Mexican crime boss in the Showtime series \u201cWeeds\u201d in 2009.The daughter of a Mexican film star, Ms. del Castillo was to married Luis Garc\u00eda, one of the country\u2019s soccer stars in the 1990s, and was linked to Televisa\u2019s owner Emilio Azc\u00e1rraga Jean before he inherited the company.Ms. del Castillo is no longer welcome at Televisa. Last November, after news broke that Mexico\u2019s first lady, Ang\u00e9lica Rivera, another former Televisa star, had bought a luxury home from a contractor linked to her husband, President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, Ms. del Castillo publicly shared her disbelief. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have enough to buy myself a house of that size, maybe Mrs. Ang\u00e9lica does, I don\u2019t know,\u201d she told the reporter who broke the story of the house. \u201cWhen I was at Televisa, I was one of the leading actresses, important in the company,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe would never have earned that kind of money.\u201dMs. del Castillo may have more to say on the case. She is set to star in a Spanish-language Netflix drama this year \u2014 \u201cIngobernable\u201d or \u201cUngovernable\u201d \u2014 as a fictional first lady of Mexico.Her character, Netflix said when it announced the series, is capable of \u201ccreating a president, leaving a president and killing a president.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Netflix Faces a U.S. Slowdown, Despite Global Growth", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported byThe Netflix fourth-quarter results paint two different pictures of the company: one achieving record global growth, the other facing a slowdown in the United States, where its already high penetration is making it increasingly difficult to add new subscribers.In the United States, however, Netflix missed growth forecasts, adding just 1.56 million subscribers, a decline from the 1.9 million it added during the same period the previous year.The company said that increasing its subscriber base in the United States was becoming harder. Netflix said growth challenges in the United States include the transition to new chip-based credit and debit cards that made it more difficult for members to renew their subscriptions and forthcoming price increases for the service.\u201cThe next 50 million is a little bit harder than the first 50 million in terms of growth,\u201d David Wells, the Netflix chief financial officer, said during an earnings call.Total profit slid to $43.2 million, a 48 percent drop for the quarter from the same period a year earlier. Netflix has warned investors that it would run at break-even profitability through the end of 2016 as it pushed to make its service available across the globe. The company has said that it would deliver material global profits starting in 2017.Total revenue was $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter, up 22.8 percent from the same period during the previous year.Shares of Netflix rose more than 7 percent in after-hours trading on Tuesday. In the last year, Netflix shares have climbed about 125 percent as investors bet on the company\u2019s continued rapid growth both in the United States and throughout the world.Netflix must tread carefully. Some on Wall Street have raised questions about whether the company will be able to keep up its growth trajectory. Analysts have raised concerns about subscriber growth in the United States, content costs, international expansion and competition from Amazon, Hulu and YouTube.This year is shaping up to be an important one for Netflix. This month, the company announced that it had introduced its service to more than 130 countries, making it available in nearly every country across the world, except China.In a letter to shareholders, Reed Hastings, chief executive of Netflix, said the company was primarily aiming at \u201coutward-looking, affluent consumers with international credit cards and smartphones,\u201d with its global expansion.\u201cYou can think of them in shorthand as iPhone owners,\u201d he added during the call.The company plans to introduce more than 600 hours of original series, films and other content \u2014 up from 450 hours in 2015.Mr. Hastings shot back on Tuesday, stating that Netflix didn\u2019t need to release program-level ratings because it does not sell advertising. \u201cWe release \u2018ratings\u2019 for Netflix as a whole every quarter with our membership growth report (75 million and counting!),\u201d he said in the letter. \u201cIt is member viewing and satisfaction that propels our growth.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Below the photo was a message for the prosecutor, Karl Miller: \u201cSalute Mr. Miller this is a good rum,\u201d the note read, followed by an emoji of clinking beer mugs.The fugitive, Ronald Plaza, 25, had been sitting in a Bronx courtroom only days earlier, on Dec. 3, listening to closing arguments in the case, in which he was accused of brutally beating and knifing a man outside a Bronx nightclub. But Mr. Plaza never showed up when jury deliberations began the next day.By the time the jury delivered a guilty verdict on assault charges on Dec. 7, Mr. Plaza was hidden away somewhere, apparently enjoying the celebrated chestnut flavor and sugary aroma of the $40 bottles of Venezuelan rum.\u201c\u2018Bizarre\u2019 is an understatement,\u201d his lawyer, Alain Massena, said of the case.On Wednesday, a judge sentenced Mr. Plaza in absentia to 10 years in prison, a development that offered no resolution to the people caught in his wake.Mr. Plaza\u2019s mother had offered her house in St. Petersburg, Fla., as collateral for a $250,000 bond in a separate case in Westchester County, in which he was charged with robbery and attempted murder. He has now missed court appearances in that case, too, putting the house at risk of being turned over to creditors and its current occupants, a renter and her teenage daughter, at risk of being kicked out.The slashing victim and his wife also say Mr. Plaza\u2019s friends or relatives have been trying to intimidate them into recanting their testimony, threatening them over the phone and even visiting the homes and businesses of their relatives in the Dominican Republic.\u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m living in a movie,\u201d said Jacqueline Narvaez, 34, whose husband, Anllel Segura, was scarred across his forehead and eyebrows in the attack. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a horror.\u201dInvestigators from the office of the Bronx district attorney, Darcel Clark, have been interviewing witnesses as they search for Mr. Plaza. A spokeswoman for the office, Terry Raskyn, said the threats against Mr. Segura\u2019s family had not been substantiated. But, she said, \u201cWe\u2019re aware of it, and that\u2019s another reason we want to apprehend him.\u201dMuch of the speculation about Mr. Plaza\u2019s whereabouts has centered on the Dominican Republic, where he was born to a Dominican mother and an American father who made trips there as an instructor for the Oakland Athletics.Mr. Plaza, who eventually moved to the New York area, was known to have upscale tastes. On the night of the assault in the Bronx, in June 2014, Ms. Narvaez said, he was wearing a ring and carrying an expensive bag. She was waiting with her husband for their car as her husband tried to break up an argument among women nearby when, she said, Mr. Plaza \u201ccame out of nowhere and just punched him in the face.\u201dCourt papers say two people held Mr. Segura down as Mr. Plaza slashed him several times across the head and temple, leaving Mr. Segura with wounds that required staples and nearly two dozen stitches. He now wears his hair longer to disguise the scars.Soon after Mr. Plaza disappeared, Ms. Narvaez said, she got a call from two men who said they were in the Dominican Republic telling her to go to Mr. Plaza\u2019s lawyer\u2019s office to sign papers saying that she and her husband lied in their court testimony.The men, she recalled, said that a retraction would be mutually beneficial and that neither she nor they wanted any \u201cproblems.\u201dShe said the callers also acknowledged knowing about visits to Mr. Segura\u2019s mother\u2019s home in the Dominican Republic, where, she said, men had come looking for Mr. Segura\u2019s brother.Ms. Narvaez said the Dominican authorities were dismissive of their reports. She worried that corruption in the country\u2019s law enforcement agencies would let Mr. Plaza and his friends wreak havoc there for years.Even in New York City, she said, \u201cI feel like I have to watch my kids when they go out.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t let them walk the dog any more at night,\u201d she continued. \u201cI look out the window two, three times before I take them to school if I see a vehicle standing there.\u201dMr. Massena, the lawyer, said that he knew nothing about the threats and that he was surprised a defendant who had been engaged in court jumped bail after sitting through most of the trial.About a week after Mr. Plaza stopped showing up to the Bronx courtroom, he was due in a Westchester court on the attempted murder charge.In that case, in August 2014, he was accused of forcing a man out of a 2011 Porsche Cayenne at gunpoint in New Rochelle. As the man ran away, Mr. Plaza or someone with him fired at the man several times with a pistol before stealing the car, a spokesman for the prosecutor\u2019s office said.Mr. Plaza set his Instagram page to private soon after the prosecutor noticed the taunt, leaving only a profile photo of a biohazard sign and his user name, RonyMontana31 \u2014 possibly a nod to the villain Tony Montana in the film \u201cScarface.\u201dBut his Twitter account suggests Mr. Plaza has been enjoying a popular Netflix series along with his rum, perhaps taking pity on a real-life convict caught behind bars. On Jan. 11 at 1:40 a.m., his account posted a Twitter message for Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, asking him to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and free the prisoner featured in the series \u201cMaking a Murderer.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}

But many companies, especially those that broadcast sports, like ESPN, have resisted the trend toward streaming. Insisting that people who want to watch sports must have a cable subscription might help retain die-hard sports fans, but more casual fans like me will continue to drift away.For me, cutting the cord is as much about saving money as it is about controlling my entertainment diet. With cable\u2019s hundreds of channels, I would get sucked into a show or movie I happened to land on. Canceling cable has meant becoming more intentional and picking out things I really enjoy.

{"Headline": "Sundance Roars for a Black Film, and Fox Searchlight Bids $17 Million", "Date": "2016-01-26", "News": "Supported byPARK CITY, Utah \u2014 With the outcry over an all-white field of acting nominees for the coming Academy Awards, and the shutout of several films focused on black characters from the best picture race, Hollywood has come under extreme pressure in recent weeks to find more prestige-minded movies with diverse casts.The specialty studio, owned by 21st Century Fox, has a long history as an Academy Awards powerhouse. In 2014, it maneuvered the similarly themed \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d to nine Academy Award nominations and three wins, including best picture. Fox Searchlight also distributed \u201cBirdman,\u201d the reigning best picture winner.Nancy Utley and Stephen Gilula, the presidents of Fox Searchlight, said in a statement that Mr. Parker\u2019s \u201cdedication and artistry in revitalizing Nat Turner\u2019s legacy and place in history has resulted in an extraordinarily compelling and moving film that delivers on every level.\u201d Aja Naomi King co-stars as Mr. Turner\u2019s wife, Cherry, the victim of a horrific gang rape. Armie Hammer plays a sometimes kind, sometimes brutal plantation owner. The film is Mr. Parker\u2019s feature directorial debut.The film, based on a true story, borrows its title from the 1915 D.W. Griffith movie that is considered both a classic for its innovative filmmaking technique and racist for its stereotypical depiction of blacks and its sympathetic portrayal of the Ku Klux Klan. \u201cGriffith\u2019s film relied heavily on racist propaganda to evoke fear and desperation as a tool to solidify white supremacy as the lifeblood of American sustenance,\u201d Mr. Parker, 36, said in a recent interview with Filmmaker Magazine.A look at select films screening at the Sundance Film Festival.He pointedly added, \u201cNot only did this film motivate the massive resurgence of the terror group the Ku Klux Klan and the carnage exacted against people of African descent, it served as the foundation of the film industry we know today.\u201dMr. Parker\u2019s \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d is poised to join a subgenre of films touching on slavery that Oscar voters have supported over the years, even as they have been slow to rally around films about contemporary African-American life. In addition to \u201c12 Years a Slave,\u201d Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cAmistad,\u201d about the events after a mutiny on a slave ship, was nominated for four Academy Awards in 1998; Quentin Tarantino\u2019s \u201cDjango Unchained\u201d drew five nominations in 2013, including one for best picture, and won two Oscars.While there are no official record keepers for Sundance prices, \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d sale far surpassed previous high-water marks, including that of \u201cLittle Miss Sunshine,\u201d which Searchlight bought in 2006 for roughly $12 million, after adjusting for inflation. (A high price, of course, does not necessarily mean a box-office hit. Focus Features in 2008 paid about $11 million for the comedy \u201cHamlet 2,\u201d which took in only half that amount in ticket sales.)Searchlight was the first traditional distributor to make a splash at Sundance this year. During the first half of the 11-day festival, the most active bidders were Amazon, which bought five movies, including the prestige drama \u201cManchester by the Sea,\u201d and Netflix, which made four significant purchases, including spending about $7 million for \u201cThe Fundamentals of Caring,\u201d a comedic drama.Losing bidders for \u201cThe Birth of a Nation,\u201d whose sale was handled by William Morris Endeavor, included Paramount, Universal, Sony and the Weinstein Company.The independently financed \u201cBirth of a Nation\u201d cost an estimated $10 million to make. Mr. Parker, known for his acting in films like \u201cThe Great Debaters\u201d and \u201cRed Tails,\u201d spent seven years working on the film, although the actual shoot, which took place in Georgia, lasted less than a month.In an unusual show of support, at least by Sundance standards, \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d received a standing ovation before it even played. The moment, which had a cathartic feeling after days of #OscarsSoWhite tension, coincided with Mr. Parker\u2019s introduction of the film at the 1,270-seat Eccles Theater. Mr. Parker brought what seemed to be his entire cast and crew, many of whom rose to their feet when he appeared.After the credits rolled \u2014 again, to whoops and cheers \u2014 Mr. Parker spoke of how deeply the racial injustices and atrocities covered in the film continued to reverberate today. \u201cAre you passive, or are you corrupt and complicit?\u201d he asked the audience. \u201cThere is no middle ground.\u201dHe added: \u201cI made this film for one reason: with the hope of creating change agents. That people can watch this film and be affected. That you can watch this film and see that there were systems that were in place that were corrupt and corrupted people, and the legacy of that still lives with us.\u201dCara Buckley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Let\u2019s call it, Who\u2019s Losing?But don\u2019t expect it to shift much. Asking \u201cwho\u2019s losing?\u201d misses a larger truth about how thoroughly Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft now lord over all that happens in tech.Who\u2019s really losing? In the larger picture, none of them \u2014 not in comparison with the rest of the tech industry, the rest of the economy and certainly not in the influence each of them holds over our lives.But for much of the last half-decade, most of these five giants have enjoyed a remarkable reprieve from the bogeymen in the garage. And you can bet on them continuing to win. So I\u2019m coining the name the Frightful Five.Though competition between the five remains fierce \u2014 and each year, a few of them seem up and a few down \u2014 it\u2019s becoming harder to picture how any one of them, let alone two or three, may cede their growing clout in every aspect of American business and society.Indeed, the Frightful Five are so well protected against start-ups that in most situations, the rise of new companies only solidifies their lead.This gets to the core of the Frightful Five\u2019s indomitability. They have each built several enormous technologies that are central to just about everything we do with computers. In tech jargon, they own many of the world\u2019s most valuable \u201cplatforms\u201d \u2014 the basic building blocks on which every other business, even would-be competitors, depend.These platforms are inescapable; you may opt out of one or two of them, but together, they form a gilded mesh blanketing the entire economy.The Big Five\u2019s platforms span so-called old tech \u2014 Windows is still the king of desktops, Google rules web search \u2014 and new tech, with Google and Apple controlling mobile phone operating systems and the apps that run on them; Facebook and Google controlling the Internet advertising business; and Amazon, Microsoft and Google controlling the cloud infrastructure on which many start-ups run.Many of these platforms generate what economists call \u201cnetwork effects\u201d \u2014 as more people use them, they keep getting more indispensable. Why do you chat using Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp, also owned by Facebook? Because that\u2019s where everyone else is.Then there\u2019s the data buried in the platforms, also a rich source for new business. This can happen directly \u2014 for instance, Google can tap everything it learns about how we use our phones to create an artificial intelligence engine that improves our phones \u2014 and in more circuitous ways. By watching what\u2019s popular in its app store, Apple can get insight into what features to add to the iPhone.\u201cIn a way, a lot of the research and development costs are being borne by companies out of their four walls, which allows them to do better product development,\u201d Mr. Parker said.This explains why these companies\u2019 visions are so expansive. In various small and large ways, the Frightful Five are pushing into the news and entertainment industries; they\u2019re making waves in health care and finance; they\u2019re building cars, drones, robots and immersive virtual-reality worlds. Why do all this? Because their platforms \u2014 the users, the data and all the money they generate \u2014 make these far-flung realms seem within their grasp.Which isn\u2019t to say these companies can\u2019t die. Not long ago people thought IBM, Cisco Systems, Intel and Oracle were unbeatable in tech; they\u2019re all still large companies, but they\u2019re far less influential than they once were.Even with these difficulties, it\u2019s unclear if the larger dynamic may change much. Let\u2019s say that Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce company, eclipses Amazon\u2019s retail business in India \u2014 well, O.K., so then it satisfies itself with the rest of the world.So get used to these five. Based on their stock prices this month, the giants are among the top 10 most valuable American companies of any kind. Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft are the top three; Facebook is No. 7, and Amazon is No. 9. Wall Street gives each high marks for management; and three of them \u2014 Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook \u2014 are controlled by founders who don\u2019t have to bow to the whims of potential activist investors.So who\u2019s losing? Not one of them, not anytime soon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Questioning the Evidence in the \u2018Making a Murderer\u2019 Case", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Supported byThe documentary offers a defense theory that law enforcement officials planted evidence against Mr. Avery. His blood was found inside Ms. Halbach\u2019s vehicle, but a sealed sample of his blood held by the authorities showed signs of tampering.An investigation into Ms. Halbach\u2019s death was turned over to the sheriff in neighboring Calumet County, Wis., to avoid suggestions of a conflict of interest, because Manitowoc County officials had helped convict Mr. Avery in an earlier attack that sent him to prison for 18 years. DNA evidence in that case later pointed to a different person. Nonetheless, Manitowoc County remained involved. A Manitowoc County sheriff\u2019s official who had a connection to the earlier case found a key to Ms. Halbach\u2019s car inside Mr. Avery\u2019s home after repeated searches had come up empty.Prosecutors suggest that the key was shaken loose during a vigorous search. And Sheriff Robert C. Hermann of Manitowoc County says he sees an irony in the implication that his office could have set Mr. Avery up. \u201cThe filmmakers suggest that law enforcement rushed in and was too quick to center on Steven Avery, and yet after just 10 hours of video, they\u2019re passing judgment on law enforcement,\u201d Sheriff Hermann said.The documentary shows Mr. Dassey, then in his teens and with limited intellectual capacity, being questioned by the authorities without his lawyer or a parent present. Without seeming to understand the gravity of what he is saying, he confesses to taking part in a brutal rape and killing, and also asks when he can get back to his classes. An appointed defense lawyer appears intent on cutting a deal, the documentary suggests, even as Mr. Dassey says he made up the confession. \u201cThe first lesson that should be taken from \u2018Making a Murderer,\u2019 \u201d said Laura Nirider, a lawyer appealing his case, \u201cis that false confessions happen. People do falsely confess to crimes that they didn\u2019t commit.\u201dBut Mr. Kratz says Mr. Dassey\u2019s confession contained details that only a killer could have known. Sheriff Hermann described the questioning by investigators as \u201cexcellent,\u201d adding, \u201cLaw enforcement doesn\u2019t say, \u2018What\u2019s your IQ?\u2019 before saying, \u2018Can we interview you?\u2019 \u201dIn the view of some, the authorities were too quick to focus on Mr. Avery and might not have gone far enough to pursue evidence that could have pointed to someone else. Testimony suggested that voice mail messages on Ms. Halbach\u2019s cellphone might have been deleted after her disappearance; if true, should investigators have pursued that lead more rigorously?What about other people who had access to the large Avery auto salvage property, where some burned remains were found? And if the gory attack to which Mr. Dassey confessed took place as he described, should there not have been an array of blood and other physical evidence all over Mr. Avery\u2019s trailer and garage?But law enforcement officials say the documentary failed to give viewers a full sense of what led investigators to Mr. Avery. Mr. Kratz said Mr. Avery had called Ms. Halbach\u2019s auto trading magazine the morning of her death and requested that she take photos at the salvage yard. He said phone records showed that he had called Ms. Halbach twice before she arrived at the salvage yard, using a phone feature so that his number would not be visible to her.Dean Strang, who was previously a defense lawyer for Mr. Avery, said he \u201cdoesn\u2019t have enough hubris\u201d to say with certainty that Mr. Avery is innocent. \u201cI\u2019m still left with the same really uncomfortable doubts about whether the criminal justice system got this one right,\u201d Mr. Strang said. \u201cWhen I went into the trial, I had really strong doubts. When I came out, those doubts had not been removed.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "My Virtual Life at Tech\u2019s Big Consumer Electronics Show", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "LAS VEGAS \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Over the last few days, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve repaired a robot, driven a Rover across Mars and zapped objects with a laser gun.  I did all of that while mostly standing around in a far less interesting place: Las Vegas, where the International CES, the giant consumer electronics trade show, was being held. To escape from the artificial reality of Sin City during the show, I spent a few days trying out different virtual-reality headgear and applications to assess whether virtual reality was a gimmick or a lasting trend.My verdict: Virtual reality is here to stay for the long term, partly because the content looks and feels great (and also because so many tech companies will not stop talking about it). Whether it ends up widely appealing to consumers depends on how the companies market the technology and whether they bring prices down for virtual reality devices. But considering the high quality of the early content and applications already made for virtual reality, and given the amount of cash that companies are investing in the medium, this is probably not a fad that will fizzle out like 3D television. Virtual reality companies said 2016 is the year that many consumers will try out virtual reality for the first time and perhaps be wowed, though it will not be the year that it reaches mass adoption in terms of sales.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI haven\u2019t had anyone yet try the Rift and take it off and say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I didn\u2019t get it, that\u2019s not incredible,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Brendan Iribe, the chief executive of Oculus, in an interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMost people\u2019s reaction is, \u00e2\u0080\u0098That\u2019s probably the best thing I\u2019ve ever seen in technology in my life.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009dDuring my virtual reality jaunts at the trade show, I strapped on the Rift headgear, which connects to a computer, and looped the two controllers around my hands to test two applications. An app called Toybox places a user in a virtual playroom surrounded by objects that you can pick up and interact with, like ping pong paddles, a laser gun, a slingshot and fireworks. Another player can join you in the session, too, to hit the ping pong ball or shoot a paintball at you with the slingshot.Fox Entertainment also demonstrated a virtual reality app it developed for Oculus to promote the movie \u201cThe Martian.\u201d The app gives you the opportunity to be Mark Watney, the astronaut left stranded on Mars, who is played by Matt Damon in the film. The experience, which lasted about 20 minutes, consisted of seven scenarios, including a sequence where you use the hand controllers to operate a crane to load solar panels onto the Mars Rover. A less enthralling scene involved sorting potatoes by throwing them into different buckets. I was lousy at tossing the potatoes into the buckets, just as I am inadequate at throwing objects in real life.The hand controllers for both Rift and Vive took some time getting used to, but it felt natural to interact with objects on both devices. I figured out how to repair the Aperture robot and operate the crane in \u201cThe Martian\u201d app without any help. Chet Faliszek, a video game writer at Valve, said the intuitiveness of virtual reality should open the medium to broad applications, not just games. \u201cThe applications and the different ways that they can be used are so diverse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.Rift and Vive had some major differences. Rift is designed for use while standing or sitting. Vive encourages you to walk around \u00e2\u0080\u0094 there is a front-facing camera on the headgear to let you peek into the real world with the press of a button, in case you want to grab a glass of water, for instance.Both devices had some flaws. Rift was difficult to wear on my face; I failed to orient the device to block out the outside world in a space under my nose (perhaps because I have a long nose) and a quick head movement made the headgear go out of focus and required a readjustment. Because Vive encourages moving around, I tripped over the cord a few times. With both devices, I felt exhausted and overstimulated after 20-minute sessions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 virtual reality feels like media designed to be consumed in small doses, not hours at a time.Oculus and Vive are initially targeting gamers with their products, and there are limits to the appeal of the systems. Consider the aesthetics of the headgear, which could be off-putting to everyday consumers. Both pieces of headgear still look freakishly sci-fi, like something out of a \u201cStar Trek\u201d episode.Jaunt, which hopes to one day to become the \u00e2\u0080\u009cNetflix of VR,\u00e2\u0080\u009d believes that, at least initially, the smartphone, not fancy headgear like Rift or Vive, will be the key to mass consumer adoption of virtual reality.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all about smartphone technology,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said David Anderman, the chief business officer of Jaunt. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEverybody who has a smartphone in their pocket \u00e2\u0080\u0094 quite soon that could be everybody \u00e2\u0080\u0094 can play VR content.\u00e2\u0080\u009dTed Schilowitz, the resident futurist at Fox who helped develop the virtual reality app for \u201cThe Martian,\u201d said the smartphone had trained consumers to embrace virtual reality. Smartphones, he said, act as robots that are our virtual assistants \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and now people should be comfortable with becoming even more intimate with virtual environments.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u2019s happened to our psychology, to our humanity, has set the stage for what\u2019s going on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u2019re ready for this now.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFollowAdvertisement"}

Mr. Dassey was also convicted of sexually assaulting her.Calls for pardons have come after the 10-part documentary series, by the filmmakers Laura Ricciardi and Moira Demos, questioned the validity of the convictions while impugning the criminal justice system at virtually every level.

{"Headline": "Stock Market Ends Sharply Lower as Worries About Economy Surface", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byIt may be time for everyone to take the markets seriously again.As stock prices started tumbling in the first trading days of the year, many Wall Street professionals were tempted to describe the declines as the sort of adjustment that the market has gone through in recent years before moving higher.But that optimism evaporated this week as the selling intensified. Concerns are now growing that the markets are signaling that the United States economy, despite its recent bright spots, is on the verge of a slowdown.The fear is that economic problems in China have set off negative reactions around the world that could ultimately weigh on American households and corporations.On Friday, stocks in the United States touched their lowest levels since late August. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, the main benchmark for the United States market, is now down 8 percent for 2016 and nearly 12 percent below its benchmark high reached last year.In the face of the market turmoil, investors are showing signs that they are again seeking out safe-haven investments like government bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which falls as its price rises, declined to 2.05 percent from 2.09 percent on Thursday, after earlier falling below 2 percent for the first time since October.\u201cThere is just a broad reassessment of risk right now.\u201dA bear market occurs when stocks are down more than 20 percent from a high. The Russell 2,000, a measure of small-cap stocks, is actually down 23 percent from its peak. It fell 1.75 percent on Friday.On the one hand, it is important not to read too much into market moves. Markets often misinterpret what is really going on in the economy. The stock market came roaring back from sharp declines in 2011 and, more recently, from a rout last summer.Also, since the financial crisis of 2008, the United States economy has displayed the ability to power through rough patches in financial markets.Analysts note that the world\u2019s central banks can always increase their stimulus policies if the economies they watch over start to sag again.The global sell-off in stocks started in China, where the main Shanghai index dropped 3.6 percent on Friday. The index has fallen more than 20 percent from its December high. Stocks in London ended down 1.93 percent. Stocks in Frankfurt closed down 2.54 percent.The S.&P. 500 ended Friday down 41.51 points, or 2.16 percent. The much narrower Dow Jones industrial average fell 390.97 points, or 2.39 percent. The Nasdaq composite index declined 2.74 percent.Investors were quick to sell companies that appear most vulnerable to a drop in global growth.Shares of Intel, the giant chip maker, for instance, plummeted over 9 percent on Friday. When reporting earnings Thursday afternoon, Stacy J. Smith, Intel\u2019s chief financial officer, made comments about future sales that unsettled investors. \u201cThis outlook represents a soft start to the year as we remain cautious on the level of economic growth, particularly in China,\u201d Mr. Smith said.Investors also shunned shares of companies that had soared in 2015. Netflix, which fell 2.8 percent on Friday, is now down 20 percent from its high in 2015.The turbulence in the markets is causing pessimism over the economy to grow. And economists say they are taking seriously some of the signals they see in markets. Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, asserted that the markets that, in effect, predict interest rates and inflation appear to be doing a better job than, say, officials at the Fed.Such markets have in recent months been more pessimistic, predicting lower interest rates and inflation, both of which can act as an early warning of lower economic growth ahead.\u201cHere\u2019s where I believe the market has it right,\u201d Mr. Bernstein said.A month ago, investors in an interest rates futures market were predicting a nearly 90 percent chance that the Fed would increase interest rates in April, according to Bloomberg. Now that market is predicting only a 32 percent chance.The United States economy is expected to grow 2.5 percent this year, according to a poll by Reuters of over 90 economists. A year ago, they were forecasting growth of 2.8 percent.One school of pessimists asserts that the central banks\u2019 policies used to stimulate slowing economies since the crisis are losing effectiveness. Such policies stoked huge increases in debt that borrowers will now struggle to pay back, causing broader stress on large economies. This threat seems particularly large in China, which unleashed a credit binge after 2008, but the defaults in the United States energy industry are also a sign of how debt-fueled growth can backfire.A less gloomy camp contends that markets are just getting used to a world that is going to grow more slowly than in the past. Stock markets may struggle for a time, they say, but they are not going to crash and they are not signaling a severe global recession.A lukewarm economic outlook could be heard in the comments from the executives of United States banks that are reporting their fourth-quarter earnings.\u201cThere are pockets of strength,\u201d John Stumpf, the Wells Fargo chief executive, in a call with analysts. \u201cI am not going to say it is robust.\u201dThe bank\u2019s executives expect lower gas prices to bolster growth more broadly, as consumers and businesses enjoy smaller energy bills. Still, Mr. Stumpf added, consumers \u201chave not spent a lot of their gas savings.\u201dLikewise, Mr. Fink of BlackRock expressed concern that low energy prices here and abroad were not feeding through into the real economy.\u201cWe have just not seen the consumer consuming,\u201d he said. \u201cAt some point we will find a bottom in energy, and then things will stabilize.\u201dLower global economic activity can cause prices to fall in the United States, which can erode the profitability of American companies and make their shares less attractive to investors.Shares of Citigroup were down far more than those of other large United States banks on Friday, falling more than 6 percent.Investors are now on tenterhooks as they wait for data that might clarify the strength of the United States economy and the stance of central banks.\u201cThe market is acting as if China is already in recession and is dragging the U.S. into recession and there is nothing we can do about it,\u201d Mr. Orlando said, \u201cand there is nothing you can do to refute it until there are more data points.\u201dAn article on Saturday about the United States stock market\u2019s recent decline referred incorrectly to the Russell 2,000. It is an index of companies with small market capitalizations; it is not a broad measure of the stock market.Reporting was contributed by Landon Thomas Jr., Michael Corkery, Neil Gough and Stanley Reed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bronx Science Bans Cellphones From Wi-Fi as Students Devour It", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported byBut the change also unleashed tens of thousands of smartphones in the hands of teenagers, eager to gobble away at the nearest Wi-Fi connection like so many hungry termites, eating up their schools\u2019 bandwidth with YouTube streams, Snapchat exchanges and the like. That can leave little capacity for teachers to use the Internet for actual instruction.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to exacerbate the problem we already have any more,\u201d Jean Donahue, the principal at Bronx Science, said.Ms. Donahue noted that the school\u2019s network had been struggling for several years under an increasingly technology-heavy curriculum, and that the Education Department was working with the school to increase its broadband capacity.\u201cWe know,\u201d she added of students\u2019 cellphones, \u201cit doesn\u2019t help.\u201dAnthony Barbetta, the principal of Townsend Harris, a top high school in Queens, said his school\u2019s network had also seen a cellphone slowdown this year.

I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s enforceable realistically.\u201cWe\u2019re hoping for an upgrade, just like I think everybody else is hoping to get an upgrade.\u201dWhen Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s administration announced last year that schools would be allowed to decide their own cellphone policies going forward, Bronx Science \u2014 one of the city\u2019s top high schools, where applicants must pass a test to gain entry \u2014 said students could use their phones at lunch and during free periods.Several Bronx Science students on their way home from school last week said they most frequently used the wireless network to send pictures to their friends on Snapchat, an app they said the school did not block; Facebook, by contrast, was not accessible. This being Bronx Science, some students said they found the wireless most useful for statistics classes, or to use Google Slides to put together school projects.\u201cA friend once told me he was watching Netflix\u201d at school, said Eugene Park, a senior and Snapchat enthusiast. \u201cNetflix is not blocked, conveniently.\u201dMiguel Mercado, 16, a junior, said he used the school for YouTube, mostly to listen to music.\u201cAdele\u2019s good,\u201d he offered by way of example.A classmate named Phillip, who was standing beside him, gave a snicker.\u201cWhat? I like Adele,\u201d Miguel said. \u201cIs there a problem?\u201dDespite the new rule barring students\u2019 cellphones on the wireless network, Miguel said he was still able to use it on his phone last week. Many of his schoolmates who were unscientifically surveyed said the same.Since then, amid a national push to increase the speed and connectivity of schools, the department has upgraded the wiring at more than 250 school buildings, Devora Kaye, a department spokeswoman, said. Ms. Kaye added that the city plans to spend $650 million over the next three years to further upgrade school technology.At Bronx Science, Ms. Donahue said she was working with the department to improve the school\u2019s broadband capacity. She added that the department had been quite responsive, helping with short-term upgrades while it works toward a more systemic upgrade.In the meantime, the school was identifying personal mobile devices one by one and blocking them from the network. (Students are still free to use their own data plans, though many complained of spotty service in the building.)Just changing the password is not an option, said Phoebe Cooper, an assistant principal at the school, \u201cbecause the kids will figure it out within days.\u201d\u201cWe tried that,\u201d she explained. \u201cA kid found it, wrote it on his hand and put a picture on Facebook.\u201dAnd students seemed fairly certain they could stay ahead of administrators, anyway.\u201cGive it a month and everyone will be back on,\u201d Kevin Zhang, a senior, said. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly for a lack of trying that people aren\u2019t on it now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Vinyl,\u2019 Backed by Martin Scorsese and Mick Jagger, Looks at 1970s Rock", "Date": "2016-01-20", "News": "Supported byIt is no accident that, from its opening minutes, \u201cVinyl,\u201d with its mixture of grimy reality, nostalgia for 1970s New York and a throbbing rock \u2019n\u2019 roll soundtrack, feels like a Martin Scorsese movie. Mr. Scorsese, the Academy Award-winning filmmaker, is an executive producer of the series and directed its two-hour pilot episode.Should that pedigree feel insufficient for a narrative about bad behavior, existential crises and the redemptive power of music, Mr. Scorsese is joined on \u201cVinyl\u201d by Mick Jagger, the lead singer of the Rolling Stones and a fellow executive producer on the series, which has its debut on Feb. 14.With a cast that includes Olivia Wilde, Ray Romano and Juno Temple, and an aesthetic that mixes fictional characters with actors playing real-life music stars (like David Bowie, Elvis Presley and Lou Reed), the series is ambitious, expensive and \u2014 to its creative team \u2014 the closest proposition to a sure thing this side of a Led Zeppelin reunion.As its show runner, Terence Winter, said, when he was invited to participate on the project: \u201cI remember pitching it to myself and going, \u2018All right: Martin Scorsese. Mick Jagger. Rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. I don\u2019t care what it is \u2014 there\u2019s no way I wouldn\u2019t watch this.\u2019\u201dFor HBO, which is now the network of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d \u201cSesame Street,\u201d Jon Stewart and Bill Simmons, \u201cVinyl\u201d is an important addition to its lineup: a way to keep people like Mr. Scorsese and Mr. Jagger in its talent stable, and to guard against encroachments from cable competitors like Showtime and streaming services like Netflix, which are preparing 1970s period series of their own.To succeed, \u201cVinyl\u201d will have to fulfill the promise of its sexy subject matter and its superstar producers. And it will have to find a coherent, compelling narrative in a heartfelt if abstract idea about how music defined people\u2019s lives in that era.As Mr. Scorsese explained earlier this month at the Television Critics Association press tour, to have grown up with rock \u2019n\u2019 roll means \u201cyou see life around you played to that music.\u201dThe goal for \u201cVinyl,\u201d he said, is \u201cthat music becomes part of the narrative, but the whole narrative is like a piece of music.\u201dBy focusing on the 1970s in \u201cVinyl,\u201d Mr. Jagger explained in an interview, the series could depict a thrilling, uncertain time in music, when a declining metropolis provided a crucible for punk, disco and hip-hop.\u201cNew York was broke,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of poverty, a lot of rich people and a lot of disparity \u2014 all these scenes going on against a background of quite tough and grimy cityscapes.\u201dAlso, Mr. Jagger added: \u201cI forgot about the silly clothes. Some of them were ridiculous, and some were kind of sharp.\u201dMr. Winter, an Emmy Award-winning producer of \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d and show runner of \u201cBoardwalk Empire,\u201d was among the screenwriters who worked on \u201cThe Long Play.\u201d But in 2008, he said, \u201cThe world economy dropped out, and suddenly the phone stopped ringing.\u201d\u201cThe studio was like, \u2018Eh, this is maybe not the time to do a three-hour epic period piece,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Winter, who also wrote \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d for Mr. Scorsese.Taking a page from \u201cBoardwalk Empire,\u201d HBO\u2019s costly Prohibition-era gangster drama (which ran five seasons and drew about two million to three million viewers an episode), Mr. Winter reshaped the rock project as a cable-TV pilot.At an early table read, as he performed one of Rosetti\u2019s increasingly violent scenes, Mr. Cannavale recalled, \u201cMarty starts giggling \u2014 giggling, giggling, giggling.\u201dWhen Rosetti beat another character to death in the scene, Mr. Cannavale said Mr. Scorsese \u201clost it \u2014 he was crying with laughter and hitting me on the leg.\u201d\u201cHe said to me, \u2018You\u2019re a big guy, and you put your hands all over people,\u2019\u201d Mr. Cannavale recalled. \u201cEvery time I would go near him, I could feel him pull back a little bit. He said: \u2018I want you to keep that. I want Richie to be like that.\u2019\u201dMs. Wilde, a veteran of TV shows like \u201cHouse\u201d and \u201cThe O.C.,\u201d also sought input into her character, Devon, who is Richie\u2019s wife and a one-time denizen of New York\u2019s decadent art scene.In conversations with the \u201cVinyl\u201d producers, Ms. Wilde said: \u201cI am already a fan. But in order to sign up for it, I need to know that you\u2019re not asking me to be the long-suffering housewife. I want to make sure there\u2019s something there.\u201dMs. Wilde said she was satisfied not only by the back story for Devon, a former muse and confidant to Andy Warhol, but also by the producers\u2019 attitudes of openness and collaboration.\u201cThis was not a case of, \u2018There\u2019s an auteur whose words you are to speak, and you must dot every i,\u2019\u201d she said.Other co-stars just seemed happy for the opportunity to see themselves reimagined in wide lapels and luxuriant facial hair.Mr. Romano, the comic star of \u201cEverybody Loves Raymond,\u201d who plays Richie\u2019s record-label partner Zak Yankovich, said that when he submitted his audition tape to Mr. Scorsese, the response he got back was, \u201cHe\u2019s never heard of you.\u201dStill, said Mr. Romano (who has since appeared on shows like \u201cParenthood\u201d and \u201cMen of a Certain Age\u201d): \u201cIt ended up being a blessing. He didn\u2019t have any preconceived notions of me.\u201dProduction for the \u201cVinyl\u201d pilot began in the summer of 2014 and ran 35 days, during which time Mr. Winter said he left Mr. Scorsese to his work.(During the making of the \u201cBoardwalk Empire\u201d pilot, Mr. Winter said, he approached an assistant director to give Mr. Scorsese a creative note. \u201cI said, \u2018How do I do this?\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd he said: \u2018I don\u2019t know. No one\u2019s ever given him a note before.\u2019\u201d)Mr. Cannavale, who worked 16- to 17-hour days, five or six days a week, playing a frantic and frequently coked-up executive, said the commitment to Mr. Scorsese was worthwhile. \u201cThis is what I\u2019ve always wanted to do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could have been twice as long.\u201dSince being picked up as a series, \u201cVinyl\u201d has become a significant undertaking for HBO, occupying some 11,400 square feet of stage space at Steiner Studios in Brooklyn, where the offices of American Century, about 6,400 square feet alone, have been created in intricate detail.It is a sprawling workplace filled with vintage album covers, ashtrays, Rolodexes and typewriters, and filled with a simulated low-level haze of (presumably) cigarette smoke. On floors above the stages are the show\u2019s production offices and estimable costume department, occupying real estate inherited from \u201cBoardwalk Empire,\u201d which concluded in 2014.No one would comment on production costs for \u201cVinyl,\u201d which uses enough new and licensed music that HBO plans to release a soundtrack album for each episode. But Mr. Winter said he told HBO, \u201cYeah, there\u2019s going to be a big price tag, but the payoff is awesome.\u201d (He added an expletive for emphasis.)Mr. Winter, who wrote the \u201cVinyl\u201d pilot with George Mastras (\u201cBreaking Bad\u201d), acknowledged a criticism frequently leveled against \u201cBoardwalk Empire,\u201d that the show took its time setting up characters and plot lines before it came to explosive fruition.\u201c\u2018Boardwalk\u2019 was a slow burn, but it was a completely different story,\u201d Mr. Winter said. On \u201cVinyl,\u201d he said: \u201cYou\u2019re shot out of a cannon. It should feel like you\u2019re strapped onto a rocket, and it just goes.\u201dShould \u201cVinyl\u201d draw comparisons to a series like \u201cMad Men,\u201d the AMC drama about a conflicted, hard-living New York executive in an era of social and cultural upheaval, Mr. Winter could only shrug.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. People work in offices. It\u2019s New York City.\u201dDespite a drumbeat of competition, including coming shows like Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Get Down\u201d (whose creators include Baz Luhrmann, and which is also set in 1970s New York) and Showtime\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m Dying Up Here\u201d (set in the Los Angeles comedy scene of that era), Mr. Winter was unconcerned.\u201cI\u2019m not going to pay attention to any of those other projects,\u201d he said.For Mr. Jagger, the ongoing production of \u201cVinyl\u201d has been his introduction to one of very few showbiz experiences he has never had before, and a continual lesson in how much to be involved in the process.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to spend every minute of your life on this \u2014 that\u2019s not your job,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s your baby, and you don\u2019t want to give it away. Without getting to be obsessive, you have to keep your hand on the tiller.\u201dMr. Winter said that \u201cVinyl\u201d had been another chapter in Mr. Scorsese\u2019s cultural education, too, in learning how to apply a rock fan\u2019s ear to a visual medium and bring his cinematic skills to television.Reflecting on an early conversation about \u201cBoardwalk Empire,\u201d Mr. Winter recalled explaining to Mr. Scorsese the difference between a mini-series and an ongoing series.\u201cI said, \u2018A mini-series is a finite amount \u2014 six, eight, 10 episodes, and that\u2019s it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Winter said. \u201c\u2018A series is, you do the pilot, and then it continues.\u2019\u201dSlipping into an affectionate imitation of Mr. Scorsese\u2019s rapid-fire delivery, Mr. Winter continued: \u201cHe goes, \u2018So the pilot is the movie, and what happens in the series is after the movie? I get it. I\u2019ll do the movie, and then you do the series.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "My Take on the Republican Presidential Debate", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Republican candidates for president dueled in another televised debate, the modern version of gladiatorial combat. Instead of writing a column, I\u2019m collecting some of my tweets about the debate in this blog post, which I\u2019m updating until it ends. These are raw and rushed ruminations, journalism on the fly, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an attempt to hold politicians accountable instantaneously for their rhetorical stretches. I welcome your comments.Ted Cruz starts by saying Americans opened their papers this morning and were horrified by what they saw.I thought Cruz was referring to the article about his financing his campaign with a Goldman Sachs loan. But he meant photo of GI\u2019s in Iran.Christie says that if he were Pres, Iranians wouldn\u2019t seize US ships. More likely, Iran would have seized them, but we\u2019d now be at war.Republican candidates competing with each other to see who can denounce @HillaryClinton most vitriolically. Hm. Not the same as governing.I think @marcorubio just implied that in his administration we\u2019re back to torturing detainees.Donald Trump: \u201cOur country is a mess.\u201d This is so far from President Reagan\u2019s praise of America as the \u201cshining city on a hill.\u201dIf Ted Cruz is going to denounce the @nytimes, he should at least have the courtesy to drive traffic to our site by giving the web address.Trump says that Syrian refugees are almost all young men. It\u2019s true that 62% of refugees in Europe are male (of all ages).But 2/3 of Syrian refugees referred by the UN to the US for consideration are women or children under 12.Ted Cruz is right that the law is clear: A child of a US citizen born abroad is a \u201cnatural-born citizen\u201d eligible for the presidency.Donald Trump always strikes me as emotionally insecure, desperate for applause and compliments. Actually, lots of politicians like that.Ted Cruz says he won\u2019t take legal advice from Donald Trump. Then goes into tirade against Larry Tribe of Harvard.Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio are the best natural debaters in the group, both talented communicators. Cruz smarter, Rubio more likable.Trump: \u201cIllegal immigration is beyond belief.\u201d Not true. There\u2019s now net emigration to Mexico, not net immigration.Rubio says that under Obama the US military is underfinanced. But US military spending is greater than that of next 8 countries combined.Chris Christie is denouncing all his old positions (in which, for example, he embraced gun safety). I liked the old Christie better.Chris Christie now claims he never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood. But in 1994 he said he made a \u201cpersonal contribution\u201d to it.I thought \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d was entertaining but its politicians too bizarre to be real. Now I watch Trump & Cruz. So, Netflix, I apologizeCandidates have always spun the facts. Now they invent them. Check out the first item in NYT fact-checker, re Trump https://t.co/Q4sR1ZkmjDJeb Bush praises Gov @nikkihaley for her leadership after the church shooting. It\u2019s true and well-deserved.Bush says we need to make background checks work better. But now they\u2019re easy to evade: 40% of guns are bought without a background checkRubio seems to think that gun laws are irrelevant. But Connecticut tightened gun laws, and gun homicides fell 40%.Meanwhile, Missouri eased laws on handguns, and gun murders rose 25%. Gun laws aren\u2019t a panacea, but they do matter.Candidates are thundering about terrorism, which has killed 300 Americans over last decade. Guns have killed 330,000 in US in same period.Cruz is explaining \u201cNY values.\u201d And he\u2019s right. NY and cities generally are more secular and more socially liberal than rest of country.As an Oregon farm kid, i have some rural values. But urbanites were leaders on civil rights, on gay rights, on women\u2019s rights.Cruz may not like \u201cNew York values,\u201d but he evidently likes \u201cNew York financing\u201d from Goldman Sachs.Ben Carson doesn\u2019t understand collateral damage issue. Eg, an ISIS hq also had a jail. If we kill officials, we also kill hostages.Chris Christie is right to criticize Obama on Syria, which is Obama\u2019s biggest single failing. But not clear what Christie would do.Trump: \u201cWe can\u2019t be the stupid country any more. We\u2019re laughed at all over the world.\u201d Yes, we are. Partly because of Trump.Good for Bush for saying that Trump is \u201cunhinged\u201d for proposing to bar Muslims. An appeal to better angels\u2013who may not vote in GOP primary.I once asked Trump how he would ban Muslims. Ask people their religion? Or just ban all Arabs, including Christians? He didn\u2019t answer.As a son of a refugee whom the US admitted, it hurts to hear presidential candidates make scapegoats of the world\u2019s most vulnerable peopleJeb Bush notes that it may be a bit awkward to plan a coalition against iSiS if we don\u2019t admit Muslims. Lots of Skype calls, I guess.Trump denies that he told the NY Times that he urged a 45% tariff on Chinese goods. Hm. I was there. He said it.I\u2019ve met lots of politicians over the decades. Trump is charming\u2013and the most vapid and ill-informed and evasive of the lot.Rubio makes the important point that US consumers would pay a tariff on Chinese goods. EG no more iPhones.Trump\u2019s exact words to the @nytimes about the China tariff he proposes were: \u201cthe tax should be 45 percent.\u201d https://t.co/WQ2rU7lGB7Trump is referring to his proposed \u201cbusiness flat tax.\u201d Watchers may not realize it\u2019s a VAT, value-added tax, similar to a sales tax.Christie is talking, reasonably, about repairing infrastructure and bridges. But Christie talking about bridges with no irony?Ben Carson always comes across as very likable. If I were looking for a guy to drive across the country with, it would be Carson.Now Rubio is whacking Cruz on his tax as a VAT. There\u2019s a legitimate argument to be had about a VAT, with pluses and minuses.In her TV speech, Nikki Haley was a model of reasoned outreach to voters. Trump and Cruz strike me as the opposite.Tweeps are saying that if Ben Carson & I drove cross country, he\u2019d put me to sleep. Well, then he could give my brain a tune-up.Sad to see two smart politicians who are sons of immigrants, Rubio and Cruz, compete to see who can be more hostile to immigrants.I spend so much time hounding countries like China to be more democratic. Then I watch US democracy in action. And flinch.John Kasich is among the most experienced and reasonable of the candidates. And completely marginalized. But maybe as running mate?On the https://t.co/kuUCHg63PO betting site, Ted Cruz is seen as winning the debate (getting the biggest bump from the polls). I agree.Debate\u2019s over.Cruz, Trump, Rubio were really the only ones who mattered. I doubt it had huge effect, but my guess is Cruz may have gained.The debate also underscores the basic problem of GOP presidential politics: How to win primaries without scaring general election voters?Jeb Bush seemed to do better than in previous debates, but I think it may be too little too late.I once thought Rubio would get the nomination (he\u2019d be strongest GOP candidate) but increasingly I\u2019m thinking it\u2019ll be Trump or Cruz.Trump denies that he backed a 45% tariff on Chinese goods, and he accuses the NYT of lying.

{"Headline": "Looking for Signs That Apple\u2019s Runaway Growth Is Waning", "Date": "2016-01-24", "News": "Supported byAlready, some investors have begun to treat Apple in a new way: as a \u201cvalue\u201d stock, a label typically attached to companies that generate predictable business results or a reliable dividend, rather than ones that deliver runaway revenue growth. Value stocks often command much lower valuations than growth stocks.\u201cPeople were in love with Apple because hits like the iPod and iPhone created phenomenal growth,\u201d said Ernesto Ramos, a fund manager at BMO Global Asset Management, which manages $18 billion and counts Apple as its largest holding. \u201cAs investors shifted their minds around the fact that it\u2019s no longer going to deliver the same sort of huge growth over the next five years, the stock became a value play.\u201dMr. Ramos says his firm still owns Apple in some of its growth funds, but began including the stock in value funds in mid-2013.Switching from being a growth stock to being a value stock can also be a long and painful process. Growth investors need to sell a company\u2019s shares and drive down the price until it is low enough to tempt value investors, who buy stocks they think are cheap compared with the intrinsic value of the company. In the tech industry, a shift from growth to value also often signals to investors that a company is facing newer competitors with more innovative products, raising the question of how relevant the company can remain.\u201cInvestors don\u2019t like to see the words tech and value combined because when growth slows at a tech company, it usually means that something essentially is not working,\u201d said Angelo Zino, a senior analyst at the research firm S&P Capital IQ.A spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment.Any change would have repercussions beyond Apple because its soaring performance in recent years helped lift the broader market. If Apple shares were removed from the equation, the performance of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index in five of the last seven years would drop by about 1 percentage point, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices. In 2014, for instance, the index rose 13.7 percent with Apple and 12.9 percent without Apple.The Apple effect is even more pronounced when technology names are isolated. For tech stocks on the S.&P. 500 as a group, annual gain in 2009 declined by 6 percentage points when Apple shares were not included, dropping to 56 percent from 62 percent.The effect was more muted last year as Apple\u2019s growth decelerated, according to the data.Investors have turned to Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet, which owns Google \u2014 collectively referred to as the FANG stocks \u2014 for growth. Those companies are each expected to show annual revenue gains of 23 to 40 percent for the last three months of 2015, while Apple is projected to deliver 3 percent revenue growth, according to Bloomberg data.Mr. Ramos says companies like Amazon have bigger growth potential for his fund than Apple, though he plans to continue owning Apple shares. \u201cAmazon will see about 20 percent revenue growth, and earnings per share are expected to jump considerably,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a very strong growth story.\u201dApple shares have already been buffeted in recent months because of worries about the slowing economy in China, which the company counts as one of its largest markets. Half a dozen companies that provide parts for the iPhone also blamed weak demand from Apple for lower-than-expected earnings, causing worries about the company\u2019s sales trajectory.\u201cIf you wanted to outperform the market, the FANG stocks did better,\u201d said Jonathan Krinsky, an analyst at MKM Partners, though he added that Apple remained a must-watch stock because it composed such a large part of many stock indexes.Investors may still someday reanoint Apple as a growth stock, especially if the company can create a best-selling new product that drives up its sales rate. Wall Street analysts cite Microsoft as an example of a business that lost steam and then made the adjustments necessary to deliver strong revenue growth again.Apple has been reclassified as a value stock before. FTSE Russell, which makes several closely followed stock indexes, found in 2013 that Apple no longer met its criteria to be treated purely as a growth stock. Some of the company\u2019s enormous market capitalization was reallocated to the Russell Value Index, as well as being in the Russell Growth Index. A year later, when the company\u2019s sales had risen strongly with the introduction of the iPhone 6, FTSE Russell placed Apple solely back in the growth index.Tom Goodwin, FTSE Russell\u2019s senior research director, said that stock price, sales growth and analyst expectations determine whether a company is placed in the growth or value index, or in both. About a third of the stocks that Russell tracks are included in both indexes, he said.But until Apple reveals another hit or shows a significant pickup in iPhone sales growth, Apple should be viewed as a value-oriented name, Mr. Zino said.\u201cHistorically Apple was the name to own if you wanted to outperform the market,\u201d he said. \u201cNow there are other places to look.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Michael B. Jordan Shrugs, and Jennifer Lopez Shimmies", "Date": "2016-01-11", "News": "Supported byThe Carpetbagger26 PhotosMan, are the Golden Globes after-parties ever a gloriously sprawling corporate free-for-all. They fill the Beverly Hilton\u2019s parking lots and stretches of open space: giant tents with indoor-outdoor carpeting, D.J.s, twinkly lights, cater waiters, security guards, updos and swag. It\u2019s like being aboard a very strange, very expensive cruise ship.Right after the Globes wrap, everyone makes a beeline for the Warner Bros./InStyle party, so this year the Bagger, by now somewhat in the know, did too. (In 2015 she hit it last.) And there she found folks from A24, the production and distribution company behind \u201cRoom,\u201d ebullient over Brie Larson\u2019s best actress award \u2014 it was the their first Golden Globe win.She also chatted with Michael B. Jordan from \u201cCreed.\u201d His co-star Sylvester Stallone had won best supporting actor, and had been receiving social media heat for an acceptance speech that did not acknowledge Mr. Jordan or Ryan Coogler, who wrote and directed the movie. But Mr. Jordan quickly shrugged the criticism off.\u201cNah, I don\u2019t get upset about that stuff. I know how it is when you get up there onstage,\u201d Mr. Jordan shouted over the music, grinning. \u201cI love the guy!\u201dGeorge Miller, the 70-year-old director of \u201cMad Max: Fury Road,\u201d was nearby, looking jolly as could be, even though he\u2019d lost best director to Alejandro G.

Selena Gomez followed a few feet away.Where were the other big bright stars? Unclear. And, in a way, not that relevant: hadn\u2019t we been listening to them yammer on the entire night? The Bagger went to festivities sponsored by NBC Universal, Netflix/Weinstein Company (hands down the prettiest) and Fox. But it soon somehow felt as if the peak party moment had passed, with good reason, as it turned out. The wait for the shuttles bringing people who\u2019d been offsite to the parties was hourslong, apparently thanks to new security measures, meaning a lot of the party people arrived late, often fuming, headed straight for the bar.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Making a Murderer\u2019 Town\u2019s Answer to Netflix Series: You Don\u2019t Know", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byMANITOWOC, Wis. \u2014 In the tourism office here, where workers are accustomed to cheery inquiries about Manitowoc County\u2019s best jogging paths and beach views, the questions have suddenly turned dark: How could you possibly promote tourism in such a corrupt town? Why would anyone visit here?Fury \u2014 by telephone, email and on social media \u2014 has also flooded the Manitowoc County Sheriff\u2019s Department, the Manitowoc City Police Department, Manitowoc City Hall and pretty much anywhere else with the name Manitowoc attached to it.Ten years ago, when I first came here, Steven Avery, the county resident now at the center of 10 Netflix episodes over more than 10 hours, had been arrested on suspicion of murder a few days before.Mr. Avery\u2019s past was what drew me to Manitowoc in November 2005: For months, he had been held up in Wisconsin as a symbol of everything wrong with the justice system, having served 18 years in prison for a sexual assault that DNA evidence later linked to a different man.Back then, as I drove to the county seat and along the stark, rural stretches closer to the salvage yard, I found a close-knit community in mourning over a young woman\u2019s death and an array of Avery supporters stunned by the turn of events.\u201cWe lived through this 10 years ago,\u201d Jason Ring, the president of the Manitowoc Area Visitor and Convention Bureau, said from a counter covered in maps and brochures.\u201cWe made our judgment, and the trial came to an end, and locally most people were in support of that,\u201d Mr. Ring said. \u201cNow it\u2019s back \u2014 by no choosing or no doing of anyone in this community.\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s the first point of injustice,\u201d he added. \u201cThat we have to live through it again.\u201dIn downtown Manitowoc, the county seat, the talkative, curious people I had come upon a decade earlier were no longer surprised \u2014 or the least bit pleased \u2014 to see yet another reporter. Many avoided any talk about \u201cMaking a Murderer,\u201d or simply spotted my notebook and walked away. The mayor declined to be interviewed. Business owners refused to discuss it: One said she had read online about a call for a protest in the town, and she was worried about safety.\u201cLook, we lived this whole thing like a juror,\u201d Suszanne Fox, who lives not far from here, told me as she ate a burger at the Fat Seagull. \u201cHe was guilty as sin.\u201dMany viewers of \u201cMaking a Murderer\u201d do not agree. Hundreds of thousands of people signed petitions asking President Obama to pardon Mr. Avery and Mr. Dassey, to which the White House has responded that the president cannot issue pardons in state cases. And Gov. Scott Walker has long pledged to issue no pardons while in office.The series left viewers with unrelenting questions: Did Mr. Avery\u2019s civil lawsuit for his wrongful sexual assault conviction motivate the Manitowoc County authorities to plant evidence against him in the second case, for murder? How was it that an old sample of Mr. Avery\u2019s blood, which was found in the victim\u2019s car, appeared to be tampered with while in the care of the authorities? Should Mr. Dassey, at his young age and with a limited intellect, have been questioned alone by investigators? Was his appointed lawyer working against his cause?But Ken Kratz, who prosecuted the cases against Mr. Avery and Mr. Dassey, said the series was one-sided and omitted significant pieces of evidence, including DNA from Mr. Avery on the latch under the hood of Ms. Halbach\u2019s Toyota RAV4, found in the Averys\u2019 auto salvage yard.\u201cIt\u2019s not a documentary at all; it\u2019s an advocacy piece,\u201d Mr. Kratz said in a telephone interview from New York, where he said he was being put up at the Waldorf Astoria while taking part in television newsmagazine interviews in the wake of the Netflix series.Sheriff Robert C. Hermann of Manitowoc County, who was the undersheriff at the time of the Avery case, said his office had gotten emails and voice mail messages calling the department corrupt.\u201cIt\u2019s not how Manitowoc wants to be put on the map,\u201d Sheriff Hermann said. He said he had few regrets, though he wished, given all he knows now, that only officials from a nearby sheriff\u2019s office, without Manitowoc\u2019s perceived conflicts, had held any role in the investigation.The filmmakers, Laura Ricciardi and Moira Demos, say they believe their series accurately portrayed the essential arguments the prosecutors made. The point, they said in a telephone interview, was to look at the Manitowoc cases as a window into the American justice system.\u201cWe have empathy for Manitowoc because we know that people have been reaching out in unkind ways and posting things about the city and the county,\u201d Ms. Ricciardi said. \u201cThat\u2019s an unfortunate response, because we have always wanted the series to be constructive, not destructive.\u201dMr. Avery, now 53, and Mr. Dassey, now 26, have not seen the series, their lawyers said. Prisoners do not get Netflix. But as Mr. Dassey awaits a federal court decision on claims that his confession was coerced and that he had a right to a lawyer who would mount a defense, Netflix viewers have barraged him with letters of support, said his lawyer, Laura Nirider of the Center on Wrongful Convictions of Youth at Northwestern University.\u201cHe is incredibly hopeful for the first time that when people hear the name Brendan Dassey, they don\u2019t think of a murderer, they think of someone who has been wronged,\u201d she said.And a new lawyer, Kathleen T. Zellner, well known for taking on wrongful conviction cases, has since signed on to handle Mr. Avery\u2019s next legal step.At the auto salvage yard, along dead-end Avery Road, tiny, jittery dogs watch from a green trailer where Dolores Avery, Mr. Avery\u2019s mother, says she is too tired for more interviews. Years ago, I sat with her, her husband and a brother in the living room here as they insisted that Mr. Avery was being railroaded for a second time.Standing in her doorway this month, Ms. Avery, a constant presence in the series, said she hoped people now saw \u201cthe crooked things the county has done\u201d to her family.But all the renewed talk, the calls for interviews from around the world? \u201cI\u2019m too old for this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s too much.\u201dRecently, tourists have been spotted on the property, with its row after row of forgotten, snow-topped cars, stopping in front of the yellow and black Avery\u2019s Auto Salvage & 24 Hour Towing sign to snap selfies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Media Titans Would Be Wise Not to Overlook Netflix", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtImagine you run a global media conglomerate. Say you\u2019re Robert A. Iger, the chief executive of Disney, or Brian L. Roberts, of Comcast, or perhaps you\u2019re slightly lower down on the ladder of behemoths \u2014 the boss of Twenty-First Century Fox or Time Warner, perhaps. In any case, you own a lot of valuable stuff: movie studios, broadcast and cable TV networks, perhaps a broadband infrastructure, maybe some theme parks with roller coasters and a few impressive castles.Yet Netflix is still a tiny frigate in the global sea of the content business, and surely it\u2019s no threat to the mightiest fleets in the industry. Your castles are safe, right?Well, here\u2019s a scarier proposition for you and your fellow media executives to ponder while roasting marshmallows by the fire at Davos next week. What if Netflix is the Amazon of the entertainment industry \u2014 the embodiment of a slow, expensive, high-risk effort to consume the entirety of your business?The good news for the Davos set is that there are lots of reasons that Netflix\u2019s strategy won\u2019t work. The bad news: So far, it just keeps working.Netflix\u2019s audacious strategy arouses strong feelings among folks on Wall Street. The company, based in Silicon Valley, is now valued at $50 billion, but many analysts rapturously say its efforts to reinvent TV could be worth several times more. Others find the ardor for Netflix to be nearly physically repulsive.\u201cI\u2019ve covered stocks for more than 15 years, and it\u2019s amazing how bad my idiot competitors are on this,\u201d said Michael Pachter of Wedbush Securities, who believes Netflix is highly overvalued. \u201cIt\u2019s like they drink the Kool-Aid and they\u2019re done.\u201dThe reason opinion is split is that, like Amazon before it, Netflix\u2019s business is so daring that it seems like it shouldn\u2019t work \u2014 and yet the company keeps surprising everyone. Observers and rivals were expecting Netflix to go global over the course of the next couple of years, not to open up just about everywhere on a single day. But the rest of the industry always seems to be a step or two behind in realizing the scope of Mr. Hastings\u2019s ambition.A capacity for surprise is the first and most obvious similarity between Netflix and Amazon. There are lots of others.Consider that like Mr. Bezos\u2019s retail machine, Netflix has been given leeway by investors to spend huge sums to build a globe-spanning video jukebox available to anyone. For Amazon, the investment was in warehouses; for Netflix, the money is being plowed into original content. During a speech at the International CES trade show last week, Ted Sarandos, Netflix\u2019s chief content officer, said the company would produce 600 hours of original programming in 2016, about double what it created last year, and on par with most major TV networks.In a recent note to investors, Nat Schindler, an analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, counted all the new shows Netflix is offering this year. He tallied 31 TV series, 10 feature films, 30 children\u2019s shows, 12 documentaries and 10 stand-up comedy specials.\u201cTo put it into perspective, you would have to watch Netflix for 25 days straight to consume all of its new original content next year,\u201d Mr. Schindler wrote.But Netflix isn\u2019t an ordinary TV producer. Like Amazon, it is amassing a cache of intelligence on what customers want, and it\u2019s using that data to create content that appeals to a wide range of demographics globally. In his CES speech, Mr. Sarandos argued that Netflix\u2019s business model and its data allowed it to produce shows that wouldn\u2019t have existed in traditional TV.\u201cTo make a baseball analogy, linear TV only scores with home runs,\u201d Mr. Sarandos said. \u201cWe score with home runs, too, but we also score with singles and doubles and triples.\u201dAnd finally, Netflix, like Amazon, is a flywheel that keeps spinning faster: As it gets more subscribers, it gets more data and more money to fund more content, which in turn helps it bring in more customers, and on and on, ever faster. Netflix barely ekes out a profit now, but the bulls say that as the flywheel spins, it will eventually begin earning enormous sums.They argue that Netflix will gain enough power in the content business to demand favorable pricing on content. Analysts also expect Netflix to begin raising its subscription fees, which are currently the most attractive in the media business. Customers streamed 12 billion hours of Netflix video during the last three months of 2015, the company says. That means customers paid around 14 cents per hour of Netflix, according to Rob Sanderson, an analyst at MKM Partners.\u201cCable is between 25 and 30 cents an hour \u2014 so Netflix is basically half,\u201d Mr. Sanderson said. \u201cIf you look at the dollars per hour of Netflix, there\u2019s nothing even close.\u201dAnd then there is Netflix\u2019s demonstrated ability to surprise with new ventures. Like Amazon\u2019s expansion from books to everything, Netflix grew from delivering DVDs to streaming old-run movies to, now, producing movies and TV shows. Some expect Netflix to keep moving deeper into the industry \u2014 to build its own studio, for instance. One day, if things keep going the way they are, maybe it, too, can have theme-park castles.There are Netflix skeptics, of course. Mr. Pachter argues that Netflix will have a difficult time lowering its content costs. As media giants realize Netflix is pulling away their best customers from cable, they will begin demanding more for licensing deals. He also predicted Netflix would have trouble raising subscription prices given increased competition from Amazon, which offers original programming as part of its Prime subscription service. (Prime costs $99 a year, about $20 less than a year of Netflix, and it includes free shipping.)Considering these hurdles, Mr. Pachter believes Netflix can create a modestly profitable business, just not a spectacular one. \u201cThese guys aren\u2019t going away \u2014 I just think the stock will drop to about $70 or $75,\u201d he said, from its current price of around $115. (In an email after the interview, Mr. Pachter revised his price target to \u201caround $60\u201d per share.) \u201cOtherwise, things just don\u2019t make sense. Because really, for Netflix to win, everyone else has to lose.\u201dAnd that can\u2019t happen. Right?Email: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjoo Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Netflix\u2019s Opaque Disruption Annoys Rivals on TV", "Date": "2016-01-17", "News": "Supported byPASADENA, Calif. \u2014 Tensions between Netflix and traditional television networks escalated this weekend after industry executives expressed mounting frustration over Netflix\u2019s refusal to disclose ratings. At a Television Critics Association event, NBC Universal introduced viewership figures last Wednesday provided by an outside firm that suggested several of Netflix\u2019s shows fall in line with broadcast and cable shows, implying that traditional television remains vibrant. On Saturday, John Landgraf, the chief executive of the cable network FX, picked up the theme, saying it was \u201cridiculous\u201d that Netflix did not release viewership numbers. Netflix\u2019s chief content officer, Ted Sarandos, shot back on Sunday, saying the numbers provided by NBC were \u201cremarkably inaccurate\u201d and asking why NBC would spend time and energy to \u201ctalk about our ratings.\u201d\u201cMaybe because it\u2019s more fun than talking about NBC ratings,\u201d he said.The pitched back-and-forth occurred as ratings are falling for broadcast and cable networks while Netflix\u2019s offerings of original programs are growing. Mr. Sarandos said that the streaming service would spend $6 billion on content this year, and original scripted programming would be part of that budget.Television executives have been frustrated because Mr. Sarandos has at times suggested Netflix shows would fare better than what is on cable and broadcast television. Last month, for instance, he said the Netflix show \u201cNarcos\u201d would be the most-viewed show on cable, not HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d\u201cNetflix brought it on themselves when they make assertions like their show would be the highest-rated cable show,\u201d Gary Newman, co-chief executive of the Fox Television Group, said in an interview. Likewise, Mr. Landgraf said in an interview, \u201cIf Ted doesn\u2019t give ratings, he shouldn\u2019t then be saying, \u2018This is the biggest hit in the history of blah blah blah.\u2019 He shouldn\u2019t say something is successful in quantitative terms unless you\u2019re willing to provide data and a methodology behind those statements. You can\u2019t have it both ways.\u201dThe battle over ratings began when Alan Wurtzel, NBC Universal\u2019s head of research, said on Wednesday that he was confronting the \u201c800-pound gorilla\u201d and gave the news media what he described as a \u201cNetflix reality check.\u201dRatings, particularly among 18- to 49-year-olds, dictate how much money cable and broadcast networks make from advertisers.Mr. Wurtzel provided data from a firm named Symphony Advanced Media, which uses audio content recognition installed on phones to recognize what is being watched and when. According to Symphony\u2019s data, the Netflix show \u201cJessica Jones\u201d was viewed by 4.8 million people within the first 35 days of its premiere in the 18- to 49-year-old bracket important to advertisers. In that demographic, Mr. Wurtzel said that, according to Symphony\u2019s data, \u201cMaster of None\u201d had 3.9 million viewers, \u201cNarcos\u201d had 3.2 million and Amazon\u2019s \u201cThe Man in the High Castle\u201d had 2.1 million viewers. Mr. Wurtzel said the data showed that when streaming-service shows debut, viewership is strong and then peters out after a few weeks before viewers return to watching cable or network television. \u201cMy only point is I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s enough stuff on Netflix that is broad enough and is consistent enough to affect us in a meaningful way on a regular basis,\u201d Mr. Wurtzel said.Mr. Newman, of Fox, was particularly interested in this.\u201cIf you look at the data, it\u2019s very compressed and it falls off,\u201d he said. \u201cOur shows tend to be in the cultural conversation for three to four months at a time. And I think that\u2019s powerful to our advertising partners.\u201dHe also said that the numbers were \u201cwithin the mid- to upper level of cable dramas and within the ballpark of what I\u2019d expect.\u201d Mr. Landgraf said that the data did not \u201cfeel rigorous enough.\u201d And Mr. Sarandos pushed back hard on Symphony\u2019s data, particularly its focus on 18- to 49-year-olds since Netflix sells subscriptions, not advertising based on a specific demographic. \u201cThe methodology and the measurement and the data itself don\u2019t reflect any sense of reality of anything that we keep track of,\u201d Mr. Sarandos said. \u201cThat could be because 18- to 49-year-old viewing is so insignificant to us I can\u2019t even tell how many 18- to 49-year-old members we have. We don\u2019t track it.\u201dMr. Sarandos, instead, pointed to the number of Netflix subscribers, which he said is about 70 million worldwide, and 43 million in the United States. In keeping with his public stance that Netflix would never release ratings, he said he did not want to engage in a \u201cweekly arms race.\u201d\u201cOnce we give a number for a show, then every show will be benchmarked off of that show even though they were built sometimes for very specific audiences,\u201d he said.He added: \u201cThere is a very natural inclination to say, \u2018Relative to this show, this show is a failure.\u2019 That puts a lot of creative pressure on the talent.\u201dMeanwhile, Mr. Landgraf said on Saturday that FX pursued \u201cMaster of None\u201d and Netflix\u2019s coming show, \u201cThe Crown,\u201d but the free-spending streaming service \u201coverwhelmed us with sort of shock\u2013and-awe levels of money and commitment.\u201d FX, he said, has to be profitable whereas Netflix does not have to worry about that now.\u201cI mean, basically, we are competing against payrolls \u00e0 la the Oakland A\u2019s and the New York Yankees that are three, four times ours,\u201d he said. He called it a \u201clittle frustrating\u201d because \u201cFX\u2019s earnings alone are many, many times higher than Netflix\u2019s globally, many times higher.\u201dAs for NBC\u2019s ratings numbers, Mr. Landgraf said that at some point Netflix\u2019s viewership levels would be reliably revealed.\u201cI think the national security apparatus of the United States has the right to secrecy,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a strategic need to that and what\u2019s at stake is the security of America. I don\u2019t think Netflix has that high a call on secrecy. If they\u2019re willing to be judged on merit and truth, they should put the information out there.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Idris Elba, who had been forecast to land on the best supporting actor list, and was the subject of a very hefty Netflix marketing push, did not. His spot on that list \u2014 assuming he had one \u2014 might have been taken by Sylvester Stallone, who came roaring back this year for his role in \u201cCreed,\u201d for which he won a Golden Globe on Sunday.

The narrative throughout this awards season has been that despite the film\u2019s success at the all-important Telluride and Toronto film festivals, people found it too difficult to watch and stayed away from screenings.

{"Headline": "How the Daily Fantasy Sports Industry Turns Fans Into Suckers", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byFeatureSince the start of this N.F.L. season, I have lost roughly $1,900 on DraftKings and FanDuel, the two main proprietors of daily fantasy sports (D.F.S.). I play pretty much every night. This requires me to pick a team of players \u2014 whether baseball, basketball, football, hockey or soccer \u2014 each of whom have been assigned a dollar amount, and fit them all under a salary cap. I base these lineups on reasonably educated hunches, something to the effect of: I\u2019ll play the Indiana Pacers point guard George Hill tonight, because he\u2019s going up against the New Orleans Pelicans, who have been a defensive train wreck this season, especially on the perimeter. Also, Monta Ellis, Hill\u2019s back-court partner, is sitting out, which means more of the usage load should fall to Hill. Sometimes, usually while walking the dog, I\u2019ll even sit down on a park bench and check to make sure that at least some of those facts are real. My bets range anywhere from $3 to $100. My losses in D.F.S. are not financially crippling, nor are they happening at a rate that should be cause for concern. But every gambler, whatever the size of the problem, wants to know that he or she has some chance of winning.The ads, I admit, are what got me. For the first 10 months of 2015, DraftKings and FanDuel spent more than a combined $200 million on advertising, a surge that peaked at the start of the football season, when a DraftKings ad ran seemingly every couple of minutes on television. In addition to the ads, many of which showed regular guys like me who had won, in the DraftKings parlance, \u201ca shipload of money,\u201d there were DraftKings lounges in N.F.L. stadiums, FanDuel sidelines in N.B.A. arenas and daily fantasy advice segments in the sports sections of newspapers and all over ESPN, which, during the first weeks of the N.F.L. season, felt as if it had been converted into a nonstop publicity machine for DraftKings. As of August, both companies had billion-dollar valuations and promised weekly competitions with huge payouts and fast and easy withdrawals.Initially, D.F.S. seemed harmless enough \u2014 on Sunday mornings, I would challenge a couple of my friends in California to head-to-head match-ups for $50 and put a few $20 entries into the million-dollar fantasy-football contest. Then, on Sunday, Sept. 27, Ethan Haskell, an employee at DraftKings, inadvertently published information that could have given him an edge over his competitors. That day, Haskell won $350,000 in prizes on FanDuel. (DraftKings later concluded, in an internal review conducted by a former United States attorney, that Haskell obtained the information after the deadline for submitting his lineup in the contest and couldn\u2019t use it for profit.) Haskell\u2019s accidental disclosure and subsequent bonanza caught the attention of several media outlets, including The Times, leading to a volley of articles and columns that placed the operations of daily fantasy sports under close scrutiny.Since the scandal broke, I have traveled to D.F.S. events, spent dozens of hours playing on DraftKings and FanDuel and talked to players and industry media figures. I initially intended to write an article about the bro culture that had sprouted up around D.F.S., which, from a distance, reminded me of the sweaty, sardonic camaraderie you typically see at high-stakes poker events. At the time, the crusade against D.F.S. felt a few degrees too hot \u2014 DraftKings and FanDuel struck me as obviously gambling sites, but the game itself felt sort of like homework. You research players. You build a spreadsheet. You project data and enter a team. You watch the team either fulfill or fall short of your projections. The next day, you start over again. The ruinous thrill of other forms of gambling \u2014 sports betting, blackjack, poker \u2014 just wasn\u2019t there.Instead, I came across a different sort of problem: a rapacious ecosystem in which high-volume gamblers, often aided by computer scripts and optimization software that allow players to submit hundreds or even thousands of lineups at a time, repeatedly take advantage of new players, who, after watching an ad, deposit some money on DraftKings and FanDuel and start betting. Both companies mostly looked the other way. And, when evidence of the competitive advantages enjoyed by these high-volume players became too overwhelming for the companies to ignore, DraftKings and FanDuel enacted rules that in the end are likely to protect the high-volume players rather than regulate them. In any case, a stricter ban on computer scripting would have been functionally impossible \u2014 because, as a representative of FanDuel told me, D.F.S. companies cannot reliably detect it on their sites.Each company took advantage of language in a federal law that allowed them to plug directly into two huge, overlapping populations \u2014 fantasy sports players and gamblers. Each company was able to raise hundreds of millions of dollars in venture capital funding and sponsorships, all of which created pressure to increase user bases, which, in turn, led to an advertising deluge this past fall. It takes years of testing, regulation and outside oversight to create a reliable betting market. But DraftKings and FanDuel rose to prominence \u2014 and now, seemingly, have become derailed \u2014 in the course of a single N.F.L. regular season.The betting economy that has been created is highly unstable and corrupt. One critic I spoke to was Gabriel Harber, a well-known D.F.S. podcaster and writer who has worked in the D.F.S. industry since its inception and goes by the handle CrazyGabey. He has come forward to discuss the rampant exploitation in D.F.S.\u2019s betting economy.\u201cThe idea that these sites exist so that regular guys can make a lot of money playing daily fantasy sports is a lie,\u201d Harber told me. \u201cFanDuel and DraftKings are optimized for power players to rape and pillage regular players over and over again.\u201dAbout a year after the passage of the U.I.G.E.A., Chris Fargis, a poker pro, wrote a post on his personal blog that explained a new business venture he had started called Instant Fantasy Sports. The idea, Fargis wrote, was to \u201ctake the time frame of season-long fantasy sports leagues and shrink it. \u2026 The site will look familiar to many of you who are reading this blog because it\u2019s set up a lot like an online poker site.\u201d\u201cGiven the current state of online gaming, the next logical question is, \u2018Is this site legal?\u2019\u201d Fargis continued. \u201cHappily, I\u2019m able to tell you that fantasy sports games are explicitly protected by the U.I.G.E.A. (the same law that has given online poker so much trouble in the U.S.A.). Instant Fantasy Sports is 100 percent legal in the U.S.A. and Canada.\u201dThe D.F.S. industry is still inextricably tied up in those poker roots. Players talk about \u201ctilting\u201d because of \u201cvariance,\u201d especially when a \u201cfish\u201d puts in a \u201cdonkey\u201d lineup that ends up going crazy. (In regular American English, this translates roughly to \u201cI am really mad because some idiot punched in some random lineup that ended up catching every conceivable break and beating me.\u201d) And it\u2019s not only the former poker players who talk like this \u2014 when I first spoke to Nigel Eccles, the C.E.O. and founder of FanDuel, he referred to the different denominations of D.F.S. games as \u201ctables,\u201d in the same way a pit boss at a casino might point you to the $10 blackjack or the $25 baccarat tables. Rotogrinders, by far the biggest site for D.F.S. discussion, commentary and content, was founded in part by Cal Spears, a former poker player from Tennessee who used to run an online forum for poker strategy called PocketFives. Jonathan Aguiar, DraftKings\u2019 director of V.I.P. services, is also a former poker player known as FatalError. Fargis, too, now works at DraftKings.Over the next few years, dozens of other gaming entrepreneurs started their own daily fantasy companies. There were DraftDay and DraftStreet, along with pretty much every possible portmanteau of \u201cdraft,\u201d \u201cfan\u201d and \u201cfantasy.\u201d The sites made no attempts to hide their connection to poker. They weren\u2019t big enough to warrant attention from law enforcement or regulators. Many of the contestants were career game players who all knew one another from the poker circuit. Prize pools rarely rose much higher than $10,000. The companies failed for all the obvious reasons that companies run by gamblers usually fail.Then, in March 2009, Nigel Eccles, a wiry, youthful entrepreneur from Northern Ireland and an alumnus of the management consulting firm McKinsey, started FanDuel. He had never played fantasy sports before. In Britain, Eccles, who holds an advanced degree in statistics, had started a company called Hubdub that hosted prediction markets on news stories. Readers who had just finished an article on, say, Hillary Clinton\u2019s chances in the New Hampshire primary could then put a wager on it using virtual currency. According to Eccles, Hubdub failed because it \u201cdidn\u2019t have a business model.\u201dBut in the burgeoning D.F.S. scene, Eccles saw a completely legal opportunity to make a huge amount of money. Initially, his investors weren\u2019t so sure. They believed D.F.S. was a niche product that would appeal only to a hard-core audience. But at FanDuel\u2019s first live final in December 2010, where all the qualifying players met up in Las Vegas, Eccles realized that the investors were wrong. The players who had qualified weren\u2019t all oddball quants and gamblers. \u201cThey were all mainstream sports fans,\u201d Eccles said. \u201cThat was the point where I was like, O.K., this is not niche. If we can convert a couple hundred, even a few thousand players, then we can probably convert millions of players. There\u2019s no difference between these players and the tens of millions of fantasy sports fans out there.\u201dEccles often talks about how FanDuel cultivates a sense of community among fans. There\u2019s some truth to what he says. D.F.S. can be a way to connect with people who live far away (I certainly used it that way), and, like Words with Friends or any card game, it can be a fun, low-investment excuse to talk smack with your friends. But on the whole, Fargis, in his introductory blog post, had it spot on: D.F.S. is the bastard child of online poker, with its dizzying prize pools, fast action and, perhaps most important, the dream of an easy living. The only difference is that poker, despite its seedy glamour, is associated with casinos and shady underground games. Fantasy sports, by contrast, evokes visions of dads sitting in basements with their college friends, yelling out the names of their favorite athletes.Here\u2019s how it works: Let\u2019s say you run D.F.S. Site A, and D.F.S Site B has just announced a weekly megacontest in which first place will take home $1 million. Now you have to find a way to host a comparable contest, or all your customers will flee to Site B to chase that seven-figure jackpot. The problem is that you have only 25,000 users, and the most you can charge them to enter is $20 per game (anything higher is prohibitively expensive). And you\u2019ll need $2 million or even $3 million in a prize pool if first prize is valued at $1 million (remember, you still have to pay second place, third place and beyond). So you need to somehow quadruple the number of entries. But how? You\u2019re already paying high cost-per-acquisition fees to sites like RotoGrinders, which charge, according to Harber, anywhere between $100 and $200 per person they refer to your site, and you\u2019ve already put your logo on every bus, trash can and ESPN screaming-heads show out there. You\u2019ve also kicked in some of your own money (known as \u201coverlay\u201d) to spice up the pot.The solution is simple: You let each contestant enter hundreds of times. But even given this freedom, a majority of people will enter only a few more times, which will help but probably won\u2019t get you all you need. If, however, you can attract a few high rollers who are willing to book several hundred or even several thousand entries apiece, the path to the $1 million first prize becomes a lot more manageable. And as long as you can make sure those players keep pouring in their thousands of entries, you can keep posting the $1 million first prize all over your ads. (Each company has instituted caps on the number of entries per player, but more enterprising high rollers have found ways around this.)Now, however, you have an even bigger problem: You need the high roller more than he needs you. You need his entry fees to gas up your prize pools, and you also need the roughly 10 percent service fee he pays for the hundreds of thousands of dollars he bets on the site. In big casinos, high rollers have been known to negotiate rules with the house. If, for example, a whale from China wants to play a variant of blackjack in which the dealer has to hit on soft 17, the casino, especially if it is struggling, will sometimes adjust to please the whale.D.F.S. high rollers similarly come with demands, and because there\u2019s no powerful regulatory body involved, DraftKings and FanDuel have been mostly free to set the parameters of play, which, as it turns out, is near anarchy, especially for the D.F.S. elite. High rollers want to be able to use third-party computer scripts that will allow them to enter thousands of lineups at once, something that your average player cannot do. High rollers can gain access into D.F.S.\u2019s inner circle, in which they get to be on first-name, texting basis with executives and employees at DraftKings and FanDuel. They can operate under the cover of plausible deniability \u2014 if other players complain that the high roller has been using tools that destroy competitive balance, he might expect the sites to stick up for him.The difference between the D.F.S. high roller and the blackjack whale, of course, is that the whale is trying to take millions from a multinational casino corporation and not from the honeymooners from Fresno who are betting away at the $5 tables.In the game lobbies of DraftKings and FanDuel, however, sharks are free to flood the marketplace with thousands of entries every day, luring inexperienced, bad players into games in which they are at a sizable disadvantage. The imbalanced winnings in D.F.S. have been an open secret since this past September, when Bloomberg Businessweek published an expos\u00e9 on the habits of high-volume players. The numbers are damning. According to DraftKings data obtained by the New York State attorney general\u2019s office, between 2013 and 2014, 89.3 percent of players had a negative return on investment. A recent McKinsey study showed that in the first half of the 2015 Major League Baseball season, 91 percent of the prize money was won by a mere 1.3 percent of the players.In their escalating legal battles, DraftKings and FanDuel have used these statistics to bolster their argument that D.F.S. is a game of skill, not of chance: How could a contest in which the same people win nearly all the time not be the ultimate test of skill? DraftKings and FanDuel have each tried to prove that the act of projecting player performance and selecting a lineup takes more thought and expertise than, say, playing a poker hand. In paperwork filed on Dec. 24 in Illinois, the latest state to question the legality of D.F.S. lawyers wrote that D.F.S. is \u201clike chess, Scrabble or crossword-puzzle tournaments in that they do not test athletic skill, but instead mental prowess.\u201d They went on to argue that \u201cthe success of a contest is not a matter of luck any more than was the success of the architects of the 1985 Super Bowl-winning Chicago Bears.\u201dWhile it\u2019s true that some of the skill required to win in DraftKings and FanDuel lies in statistical modeling, general sports knowledge and due diligence, it\u2019s also true that it\u2019s nearly impossible to make a net positive return on investment without bumhunting. You have to win roughly 53 percent of your bets to beat the \u201crake,\u201d another poker term for the roughly 10 percent service fee DraftKings and FanDuel take out of each wager. The most efficient way to hit that number is to play as many bad opponents as possible.For the 17 weeks I played D.F.S., whether at a $5 entry fee or for $100, I routinely was matched up against top players. But unless I examined win rates and researched the strengths and weaknesses of my opponents, I would never have known that I was being repeatedly bumhunted by high-volume players.On Dec. 16, for example, I entered three $20 N.B.A. head-to-head contests on DraftKings. My opponents were gunz4hire, Dinkpiece and Nadia4Fashion. Gunz4hire was then ranked 47th on the Rotogrinders players ranking and is generally considered one of the better players in the world. Dinkpiece, who was 20th on that same list, is the alias for Drew Dinkmeyer, a former stock trader whose winnings in D.F.S. have been so well publicized that he has his own Wall Street Journal stipple drawing.On Christmas, the biggest day in the N.B.A.\u2019s regular season, I entered 17 head-to-head contests on DraftKings for prices between $1 and $20. Once again, I was matched up against Dinkpiece and gunz4hire, along with a handful of other professionals.The next day, I entered three more $20 N.B.A. contests. I was able to avoid Dinkpiece and gunz4hire, but found myself in a $20 head-to-head against Birdwings, the 2nd-ranked player in the Rotogrinders rankings.In three days, I played three of the best D.F.S. players in the world.In December, I traveled to the FanDuel World Fantasy Football Championships in San Diego. The festivities, which would end with one player winning a staggering $3 million first prize, included an obstacle course in which Joe Montana and Dan Marino threw footballs at the qualifiers, as well as an extremely drunken couple in Patriots jerseys (those of Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski, of course) who kept screaming, \u201cWe\u2019re [expletive] rich!\u201d While the championships raged on, I asked Eccles about the gross imbalance of winners detailed in the McKinsey report. He said that baseball was not an accurate marker for how the site worked. The majority of D.F.S. novices only come to play football, and their sheer numbers and the natural variance in fantasy football distributes the money more equally. He admitted the Sunday Million, FanDuel\u2019s most-hyped N.F.L. tournament, was extremely difficult for the average player to win. He suggested, instead, that new players enroll in beginner leagues, which are open exclusively to players who have entered only a few contests, and in 50/50s, where several, even thousands of players pool their money together and reward the money to the players who finish in the top half, and head-to-head competitions, in which two players play one another, winner-take-all.On Sunday, Dec. 27, I took Eccles\u2019s advice and entered myself into 20 separate N.F.L. head-to-head contests with buy-ins ranging from $2 to $20. This time, I drew Mtom347, a high-volume player ranked 42 on the Rotogrinders leader board; David Potts, winner of the 2014 FanDuel Daily Fantasy Baseball Championship; and TwoSHAE, one of the 25 top ranked daily fantasy football players in the world.On Dec. 28, I had a phone conversation with Justine Sacco, FanDuel\u2019s director of communications. She told me that I must have misunderstood Eccles and that he was probably referring only to 50-50 match-ups, in which a large group of people enter a pool and roughly the top half wins the bottom half\u2019s money, and not head to heads, which were admittedly tough to beat. The next day, I entered an N.B.A. 50-50, once again for $20.There were 3,638 total entries in the 50-50 that day. Roughly two-thirds of these came from players who entered multiple lineups. Here is a small selection of those players and the number of lineups they entered:Maxdalury, generally considered the top player in the world: 100 lineups.Birdwings, the No. 2-rated player on the RotoGrinders rankings: 22 lineups.rayofhope, the screen name for Cory Albertson, a former poker pro, widely regarded as one of the best: 40 lineups.Kobe4MVP, the screen name for Eytan Jankowitz, also one of the best players in the world: 100 lineups.Youdacao, the No. 6 player on the RotoGrinders rankings: 100 lineups.Notorious, a regular contributor to the Rotogrinders site and the No. 24 player on their rankings: 40 lineups.Dinkpiece, my nemesis from the last two times: five lineupsIf we are going to talk about games of skill and the legal protection they deserve, we should acknowledge that much of the skill in D.F.S. lies in bumhunting. It\u2019s why maxdalury and Birdwings are slumming it in a $20 50-50 competition with me. It\u2019s how the top players ensure their profitability. In D.F.S., as in poker, the easiest way to win money is to turn a sucker into an A.T.M.Over the course of extensive phone conversations and correspondence this fall and winter, Harber explained that he had begun to turn against DraftKings and FanDuel when the companies were unresponsive to complaints from the D.F.S. community about the prevalence of scripting. Last March, when maxdalury, a player named Saahil Sud, used a script that enabled him to adjust most of his 400 lineups in less than an hour, the community took notice. Sud was reacting to the breaking news that Channing Frye, usually a reserve forward for the Orlando Magic, would be starting in place of the injured Nikola Vucevic. Sud won first, third, fourth and seventh place in a big DraftKings competition that night and took home hundreds of thousands of dollars. The speed with which he made the adjustments caused many within the D.F.S. community to protest. How could they be reasonably expected to compete if one of the players was using a tool that allowed him to both blanket the field with entries and avoid the work and hassle of manually adjusting his lineups to reflect late-breaking news? What\u2019s worse, these scripts were not supposed to be used under DraftKing\u2019s terms of service.In July, after months of review, instead of banning scripting, or at least forcefully regulating it, as the D.F.S. community would have liked, both DraftKings and FanDuel announced that they would change their policies to permit some scripting. The founder of DraftKings, Matt Kalish, who declined to comment for this article, told ESPN\u2019s David Purdum in July that the decision had been made to \u201cincrease and improve the experience for a couple of users, who I think were experiencing a very poor usability of the site.\u201d In other words, DraftKings had decided to accommodate players who wanted to modify the site to their own specifications. FanDuel, for its part, clarified its position on the practice and asked players to send in their scripts for \u201capproval.\u201d This, by definition, is a game played by different rules.Harber explained how his frustration with DraftKings and FanDuel reached a breaking point. \u201cPeople may wonder why I\u2019m coming forward now, and it\u2019s a good question,\u201d Harber wrote in one of two emailed statements to me. \u201cMy focus as a broadcaster in this industry for the last four years has been primarily as an ambassador to the community. The daily fantasy community has had very real concerns about competitive imbalances at FanDuel and DraftKings for quite some time now. I have publicly submitted simple questions in writing to both companies on numerous occasions, and both companies have completely ignored the community\u2019s concerns about the use of automated processes, sniping, multiaccounting and their own terms of service.\u201d\u201cYour average Joe sees a commercial for daily fantasy sports, signs up, plays and loses,\u201d Harber wrote. \u201cHe has no idea his games are being sniped by professional power users with access to automated processes and optimization software. He has no idea that the large-field tournament he\u2019s playing in features power users with hundreds of unique lineups, all optimized using third-party software. In truth, D.F.S. is more like the stock market, with athletes instead of commodities. No new player attempting to trade stocks has any shot at success without a sizable amount of training.\u201dHarber continued: \u201cI believe the major sites are fully aware of these competitive issues, yet they continue to do nothing about them because of the high amount of rake the power users are bringing in for them. As long as they can spend advertising money to bring fresh meat to the table, the power users will eat up the new players extremely fast by using their competitive advantages. No one is saying that better players should not win money off worse players, but it should not be at this rate and it should not be with misleading advertisements that prey on consumer confidence. Everyone does not have an equal chance, and everyone is not playing on the same field.\u201cThe major daily fantasy sites do not want attention drawn to these competitive issues because they are also afraid that doing so will increase the likelihood of negative legal consequences for them. Their rationale is that if the various attorneys general and prosecutors were to become knowledgeable about these competitive issues, they would be much more likely to outright ban daily fantasy.\u201dDraftKings and FanDuel have instituted rules to address some of these problems \u2014 each site has sections dedicated to new players, and FanDuel, at least, says that all scripts must be approved by the company. (DraftKings\u2019 terms of use permits \u201climited use of scripts\u201d and prompts users to email them for details.) But those measures only protect players from the worst excesses of bumhunting behavior.I asked Justine Sacco why FanDuel allowed scripting at all. She told me: \u201cYou want to allow people on the site to make their experience meaningfully better. So the idea that big players can\u2019t bring in features to improve their time, honestly \u2014 it feels a bit Orwellian.\u201dSacco emphasized that any script that was deemed \u201canticompetitive\u201d would immediately be banned, and that the company had caught and banned players for using scripts in the past, but she declined to release any specific names. She also estimated that FanDuel had approved approximately 30 scripts over all and that some of these were benign, voluntary devices used by sites like Rotogrinders to track the wins of their players. When asked if part of FanDuel\u2019s decision to allow scripts was based on a desire to keep players from taking more of their business to DraftKings, Sacco said, \u201cYou do have to take that into account \u2014 if someone is playing hundreds of thousands of dollars and comes and says, \u2018I have some ideas that would help me keep doing what I\u2019m doing,\u2019 only a bad business would not take that into consideration.\u201dSacco also said that one reason FanDuel allowed some scripting was that the company could not completely stop it. This confirms the suspicions of many in the D.F.S. community who believe that DraftKings and FanDuel do not regulate scripts because they have become so sophisticated that the companies simply don\u2019t know how to detect or disable all of them. (DraftKings, when asked for comment, said these \u201cassumptions\u201d were \u201cinaccurate.\u201d) When I asked Justin Park, maxdalury\u2019s business partner at RotoQL, a site that provides third-party tools, including a scripting program that plugs straight into the DraftKings interface, if he had asked DraftKings for permission to alter their site, he said he didn\u2019t know. He later remembered an email exchange with DraftKings. DraftKings could not confirm this.This amounts to gaming chaos \u2014 nobody really knows what the next guy might be doing, and everyone who should be making decisions that ensure fairness is afraid to punish power players for their indiscretions. There is no gambling hole in America, whether Atlantic City or Las Vegas or a riverboat in the Mississippi, that could put out a game like DraftKings or FanDuel without running straight into the state gaming commission.Knowledge about sports will always be the main sorting mechanism for the types of dudes (FanDuel reports that 95 percent of its contestants are male) who play games like D.F.S., and there\u2019s certainly nothing wrong \u2014 especially morally wrong \u2014 with putting some money on it, but there is a point where rampant bumhunting turns a gambling economy into a predatory market.There is, in theory, a version of D.F.S. that could work. All that\u2019s required is a transparent marketplace in which a player can reasonably expect to enter a head-to-head or 50-50 or even one of the big-money tournaments without going up against hundreds of lineups generated by professional gamblers who have been lying in wait for him.During my many conversations with Harber, we would often find ourselves talking about my D.F.S. match-ups for the night. Both of us love the N.B.A. above all things, and we would invariably start talking about DeMarcus Cousins and his sad six years in the N.B.A., or Gerald Green\u2019s shot volume, or whether we could trust Tony Parker to put up fantasy points anymore. These, I believe, are the sorts of moments the best of the D.F.S. community wants to promote \u2014 fantasy sports is essentially a way to turn the usual sports arguments into a game.At the start of the N.B.A. season, a couple of friends and I started a friendly league on DraftKings. Every night, we draft teams, watch the points accumulate and make fun of one another for our picks. On the first of each month, we pay one another what we owe. One of these friends creates N.B.A. player performance models. They help him escape the cynical demands of his job as a corporate lawyer. To date, I am down $350 to him.\u201cYes, yes, yes,\u201d Harber said when I told him about this league. \u201cThat\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to be.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incompletely to action against DraftKings and FanDuel. It was a judge\u2019s order telling the companies to stop accepting wagers \u2014 not an order by the New York attorney general \u2014 that was stayed on appeal.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Making a Murderer\u2019 Is About Justice, Not Truth", "Date": "2016-01-12", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorDurham, N.C. \u2014 THE release last month of \u201cMaking a Murderer,\u201d a 10-part documentary from Netflix, capped a year in which popular culture\u2019s portrayal of the criminal justice system seems to have shifted. Out with the old tropes about truth-seeking investigators and tidy resolutions; in with the disquieting, dysfunctional reality of many courtrooms and police stations.The documentary, which has captivated viewers and critics, chronicles the trials of Steven Avery and his nephew Brendan Dassey for the 2005 killing of Teresa Halbach. Its depiction of alleged police corruption and prosecutorial bias has inspired some viewers to quip that they hope they are never arrested in Manitowoc, Wis., the county where the two men were convicted. But what happened to them happens to low-status criminal defendants across the country all the time.Searing images of law enforcement abuses in Chicago, Cleveland and elsewhere have eroded the public\u2019s trust in police power on the street. At the same time, serialized true-crime programs, such as \u201cMaking a Murderer\u201d and the first season of the podcast \u201cSerial,\u201d are bringing the failures of due process into focus: careless police work, flawed forensics, forceful interrogations, unreliable witnesses and the woeful condition of state-funded criminal defense.It takes hours rather than seconds to appreciate this procedural violence. That hasn\u2019t stopped listeners and viewers. \u201cSerial\u201d was downloaded some 75 million times. (Netflix doesn\u2019t release any audience statistics, but \u201cMaking a Murderer\u201d has generated widespread discussion in social and traditional media.) Yet after the shows are over, audiences still hunger for narrative resolution. Reddit users have written thousands of posts about \u201cMaking a Murderer,\u201d weighing evidence and acting as armchair detectives trying to find the \u201ctrue\u201d perpetrator. Petitions seeking pardons for Mr. Avery and Mr. Dassey have gathered 380,000 signatures. A spinoff from the \u201cSerial\u201d podcast, sponsored by the defendant\u2019s lawyers, updates listeners on appellate claims and advocates for a retrial.Why wouldn\u2019t Americans want a satisfying finale? Our culture is steeped in procedural crime dramas. Hundreds of \u201cLaw and Order\u201d episodes concluded with definitive guilty verdicts, punctuated by a signature sound effect. CBS\u2019s hit show \u201cCSI: Crime Scene Investigation\u201d suggested that instant forensics always yielded definitive results.Mr. Avery, the focus of \u201cMaking a Murderer,\u201d had a 1985 sexual assault conviction overturned after forensic proof of his innocence emerged. In the closing line of the documentary, he says, \u201cThe truth always comes out sooner or later.\u201d That line feels unfortunately misplaced. We may never know the facts behind the gruesome murder of which Mr. Avery was accused. Nor did \u201cSerial\u201d \u201csolve\u201d the 1999 murder case it exhaustively explored.The lack of resolution may be as valuable a lesson as the evidence of law enforcement misconduct. When I was a federal prosecutor, I had the luxury of working only on carefully screened cases with strong evidence. But fewer than 70,000 federal felonies are prosecuted each year, while roughly 2.5 million felonies proceed through the state courts. Many state cases involve near-simultaneous investigation and prosecution. One rarely finds out \u201cwhat really happened.\u201dThe prosecutor in Mr. Avery\u2019s trial argued in his closing statement that \u201creasonable doubts are for innocent people.\u201d They are not. And procedural protections like access to defense counsel and freedom from coerced interrogations extend to both the innocent and the guilty. The real contribution of these documentaries is not to ask \u201cwhodunit\u201d but to reveal what was done to the defendants.As listeners and viewers consume these stories, they are reminded of the humanity of the individuals involved \u2014 and they learn to see the defendants as more than abstractions. That knowledge should lead people to understand that resolution and justice are not the same thing. And whether or not the truth of these crimes ever comes out, shows, podcasts and narrative articles can make the public aware of distortions that occur in the legal process.The United States\u2019 criminal justice system needs fewer guilt-assuming interrogation tactics, more disclosure of potentially exculpatory information to the defense, expanded oversight units within prosecutors\u2019 offices to investigate potential miscarriages of justice, and fuller appellate scrutiny of convictions.The moment is ripe for reform, culturally and politically. There is even some bipartisan support for legislation to reduce some federal criminal sentences and address the problem of mass incarceration. But unless our empathy generates demand for greater procedural integrity, only the narrative will change while the system stays the same.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Another Oscar Year, Another All-White Ballot", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byIs it the members who vote on the Oscars, the films, the campaigns behind them or something else?On Friday, the day after the Oscar nominations were announced, revealing that all 20 contenders for acting awards were white and that films with black themes had been shut out of the best picture category, industry critics were asking how filmdom\u2019s top awards could be so narrowcast a second year in a row.But the truth probably springs from a murkier confluence of factors both sweeping and granular, from missteps and misjudgments in awards campaigns in support of individual movies to the systemic lack of diversity in Hollywood.The studios behind two films that focus on black characters, \u201cCreed\u201d and \u201cStraight Outta Compton,\u201d seemed to come late to the realization that their productions were awards contenders or proved unable to win enough votes. The Academy\u2019s preferential voting system also works against films and actors not selected as voters\u2019 top picks. And, perhaps the biggest factor of all, the industry\u2019s overall offerings: Many of the 305 films eligible for Oscars did not, demographically speaking, reflect the lives and complexions of movie audiences.\u201cEvery time I say the same thing: Until we get a position of power, with a green-light vote, it\u2019s not going to change,\u201d Spike Lee said in an interview a few hours after the nominations came out. \u201cWe may win an Oscar now and then, but an Oscar is not going to fundamentally change how Hollywood does business. I\u2019m not talking about Hollywood stars. I\u2019m talking about executives. We\u2019re not in the room.\u201dChief among the surprise omissions this year were Idris Elba, projected to get a best supporting actor nomination for his performance as an African warlord in \u201cBeasts of No Nation\u201d; Michael B. Jordan, the shining lead boxer of \u201cCreed\u201d; and the biopic \u201cStraight Outta Compton,\u201d about the seminal rappers N.W.A. The star of \u201cConcussion,\u201d Will Smith, had also been considered a possible nominee.Make your Oscar picks and share your ballot with your friends.Yet \u201cConcussion\u201d was overlooked entirely; the only nomination for \u201cCreed\u201d went to a supporting actor, Sylvester Stallone; and \u201cCompton\u201d landed just one nomination, for its white writers. (They were handpicked by two of the film\u2019s producers, Ice Cube and Dr. Dre.)Nearly all potential Oscar films are the subject of expensive, monthslong campaigns to woo Academy voters, and some said \u201cCreed\u2019s\u201d campaign was too late out of the gate. That film was released in late November, long after campaigning had begun for other eventual best-picture nominees like \u201cRoom.\u201dMr. Elba\u2019s exclusion was the biggest head-scratcher, not least because Netflix had conducted an extensive campaign, including blanketing Hollywood with ads. (Though the film\u2019s subject was tough and the fact that Netflix, new to the scene, was behind the film might have hurt it.)Academy members and watchers said chances were voters did not love \u201cCompton\u201d enough, or at least not enough to make it their top choice, necessary for a film to advance in the preferential voting system.Gangsta rap is also a hard sell to an Academy that in years past failed to give a best picture nomination to the Eminem drama \u201c8 Mile\u201d (2002) or the widely praised \u201cBoyz N the Hood\u201d (1991), which nonetheless earned nominations for John Singleton, its writer and director.\u201cDid anyone in the marketing department say \u2018Straight Outta Compton\u2019 really has potential with older white men?\u201d said Marty Kaplan, a professor of entertainment and media at the University of Southern California. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge in a group dominated by older white men to make it a contender without buzz among their peers.\u201dYet this was also the same Academy that awarded best picture two years ago to \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d and named one of its stars, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, best supporting actress. Its lead, Chiwetel Ejiofor, was also up for best actor. But \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d had a narrative that resonated deeply with voters, and the awards campaign included advertisements that simply read, \u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201dThe omission of minority actors two years in a row is an aberration in recent Academy history: The last time there were only white acting nominees for two consecutive years was for films released in 1997 and 1998.Cheryl Boone Isaacs, who is black and became the Academy\u2019s president in 2013, said on Friday that while she found the all-white nominations \u201cunfortunate, really disappointing,\u201d she did not see a trend in the back-to-back shutouts. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any pattern at all,\u201d she said, noting that good work was perennially snubbed at the Oscars.Part of Ms. Isaacs\u2019s effort to broaden the voter ranks has involved inviting a younger, more diverse crowd to join the Academy, which bestows lifetime memberships. A good number of the 322 people invited last year were from abroad, and one awards campaigner privately suggested that this group could be making it tougher for African-American films, whose stories might resonate less with international audiences. But Ms. Isaacs dismissed this notion, adding that the international component of the Academy was probably too small to significantly shift awards trends. So was this year\u2019s shutout just an unlucky bounce? \u201cA bounce I never want to see happen again,\u201d she said.\u201cHollywood,\u201d Mr. Lee said, shaking his head. \u201cThey got it on lock.\u201dAn article on Saturday about the Oscar nominations, in which all 20 contenders for acting awards are white and films with black themes were shut out of the best-picture category, misstated the timing of the awards campaign for one of those films, \u201cStraight Outta Compton.\u201d It began in August; it was not late getting started.Michael Cieply contributed reporting from Los Angeles.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "At CES, Netflix Adds Over 130 Countries to Streaming Service", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byNetflix went live with its streaming television service in nearly every country across the world on Wednesday, an unexpected acceleration of the company\u2019s aggressive quest for global ubiquity by the end of 2016.Yet one major region on Netflix\u2019s world map remains dark: China, home to nearly a quarter of the world\u2019s broadband households. And in many of the 190 countries where Netflix now is available \u2014 including Turkey, Russia and Poland \u2014 the service is available in English, but not the local language.\u201cWe still have a lot of work to do,\u201d Reed Hastings, chief executive of Netflix, said in a telephone interview Wednesday afternoon. \u201cBecause of the number of countries, it seems like we are ahead of plan. But we still have China \u2014 we still have a quarter of the world to go.\u201d\u201cRight now, you are witnessing the birth of a global TV network,\u201d Mr. Hastings said from the stage in a keynote address. A montage of global flags scrolled in the background followed by a map of the world emblazoned with the hashtag #netflixeverywhere.\u201cWhether you are in Sydney or St. Petersburg, Singapore or Seoul, Santiago or Saskatoon, you now can be part of the Internet TV revolution,\u201d Mr. Hastings added.The proclamation was a bold move from Netflix to address growing skepticism about whether it can sustain its breakneck expansion and deliver on its promises.Costs are running high for Netflix. In addition to its global rollout, the company plans to spend more than $6 billion in cash on programming in 2016, offering more than 600 hours of original series, films and other content. And after running roughly at break-even profitability through this year, Netflix has pledged to deliver material global profits starting in 2017.International expansion is increasingly crucial for the company as growth slows in the United States. The opportunity is big. While the United States has about 100 million broadband households, according to SNL Kagan, that is just a fraction of the 730 million total global broadband households.Yet there are steep challenges, including whether Netflix will be able to land programming rights to series that appeal to customers around the globe and compete with local streaming rivals.\u201cInternational is really the place where people have a bigger sense of debate,\u201d said Michael Nathanson, a media analyst with MoffettNathanson Research. \u201cIt has never been attempted before.\u201dMr. Hastings said that Netflix was now in about 70 million homes and he expected the number of customers outside the United States to surpass the number domestically at some point in 2017. Netflix\u2019s long-term goal is to reach 60 million to 90 million subscribers in the United States, but has yet to set a similar target internationally.Around the globe, Netflix will be available for one monthly price \u2014 in India that is 500 rupees, or about $7.50 \u2014 and global subscribers will be able to watch Netflix original series as well as a library of licensed television shows and movies. Netflix said that in 2016 it planned to release 31 new and returning original series, 24 films and documentaries, 30 original children series and stand-up comedy specials. They will become available to all subscribers at the same time around the world.Netflix also announced that it was including Arabic, Korean and simplified and traditional Chinese to the 17 languages already available.The service will not be available in Crimea, North Korea and Syria because of United States government restrictions on American companies.China remains the major unanswered question, analysts said. \u201cThat is the big wild card that Netflix and investors are waiting for,\u201d said William V. Power, analyst at Baird Equity Research. \u201cThe questions are: Just how do you tackle that market with the various governmental or regulatory obstacles? Can they go it alone or do they partner with somebody?\u201dMr. Hastings said that Netflix continued to explore its options in China but that establishing a service there could take many months or even some years. \u201cWe are building relationships and trying to be very patient,\u201d Mr. Hastings said. \u201cThe strategy is to think very long term, to be like Disney, Apple or Starbucks in China.\u201dWall Street is watching Netflix\u2019s moves carefully. The company\u2019s share price surged 135 percent in 2015, making it the top performer on the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. But some analysts question whether the company can maintain the momentum. On Monday, Netflix shares dropped after an analyst downgraded the company\u2019s stock, citing concerns over weaker-than-expected subscriber growth in the United States.Mr. Power, the analyst at Baird who downgraded the stock, outlined other risks, including escalating content costs, international expansion and rising competition from Amazon, Hulu and YouTube.\u201cGiven Netflix\u2019s high valuation, any missteps could prompt outsize movement in the stock,\u201d Mr. Power said.On Wednesday, Netflix shares increased about 9 percent.Advertisement"}

The film stars Boyd Holbrook as a man wrongfully imprisoned for a grisly crime he didn\u2019t commit who, upon his release, meets an equally scarred woman (played by Elisabeth Moss of \u201cMad Men\u201d) who again turns his life upside down. The two actors and friends are no strangers to Sundance \u2014 Holbrook first attended in 2011 with the drama \u201cHigher Ground,\u201d directed by Vera Farmiga, and Moss made her first trip in 2013 for the Sundance Channel series \u201cTop of the Lake.\u201d Here, they share a few things they\u2019ve learned along the way.Few aspects of the Sundance experience are more dependable than a slate of films with harrowing themes. Those planning to catch the premiere of \u201cThe Free World\u201d might be wise to brush up on another case involving miscarried justice: Netflix\u2019s hit docuseries \u201cMaking a Murderer.\u201d \u201cI love that show,\u201d Moss gushes. \u201cIf Steven Avery didn\u2019t do it, it\u2019s so incredibly unlucky what happened to him. I don\u2019t think he did it, and I don\u2019t think Brendan did it either.\u201d Adds Holbrook, \u201cI want to think the cops did it, because you\u2019re talking about $36 million that the state wasn\u2019t going to pay, and that\u2019s a lot of money. People get pretty creative, you know?\u201d\u201cWe had high hopes for Jason and we obviously liked his script, but then actually being on the set, he was one of the best directors that I\u2019ve ever worked with,\u201d says Moss of the 34-year-old Lew. \u201cThere was a lot of focus on not having a lot of people around, because scenes of loneliness and solitary confinement are very prevalent in the film. Jason was right there with us, and he was so supportive.\u201dNot only did Holbrook put on weight for his role, but he also had to learn Arabic (his character converts to Islam). \u201cI was so engaged in this project, and I believe in it so much. But you\u2019re also thinking, \u2018Am I going to look like an idiot on-screen?\u2019\u201d he says.\u201cSundance is my favorite festival, primarily because you can wear jeans, boots and a jacket and don\u2019t have to dress up,\u201d says Moss of the decidedly unstuffy dress code. \u201cIn fact, if you are too dressed up, it\u2019s super weird. And it\u2019s cold, so definitely bring warm stuff. It\u2019s no joke.\u201dAttending a film festival on a ski resort has obvious perks\u2026 so long as you have a good chiropractor. \u201cThe last time I went, I hadn\u2019t skied in, like, 10 years, and I went down and couldn\u2019t move my neck for two months afterward,\u201d Holbrook says.Sundance is notorious for its lack of quality food options, but it\u2019s another kind of shortage that has Holbrook concerned: \u201cWe travel with Moscow mules,\u201d he says, laughing. Moss commiserates. \u201cI\u2019m definitely concerned about my ability to get Moscow mules in Park City,\u201d she says. \u201cIs it weird to bring ginger beer on the plane? Is that not a good thing to do?\u201dCompared to, say, a restaurant in SoHo, the streets of Park City are a much gentler ground for approaching your favorite actor. \u201cThe cool thing is that you get to run into these people in this really casual way that\u2019s not on the red carpet or at an awards show,\u201d says Moss, pointing to the added pressure that comes with such events. \u201cYou get to actually see people in a way where everyone\u2019s relaxed.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never seen another movie, other than \u2018Whiplash,\u2019\u201d says Holbrook. Both actors echoed the complaints of other Sundance stars, who are often whisked by publicists from one event to another. \u201cThey keep you running all day from like, 7 in the morning until night,\u201d Moss says. \u201cI\u2019ve never gotten to see anything else.\u201dBecause of the way films are scheduled, Moss says, \u201csometimes you end up hanging out with the same people all day.\u201d That was certainly the case in 2014, when her group was unknowingly followed by William H. Macy and Selena Gomez. \u201cIt was a weird pairing to begin with, but then everywhere we went there were all these fans, and of course I thought, \u2018All these people are here for me! They totally want an autograph,\u2019\u201d she remembers. \u201cThen I found out that Selena Gomez was following us, and I was like, \u2018Oh, I guess they\u2019re here for her.\u2019\u201dAn earlier version of this post misidentified the year Elisabeth Moss first attended Sundance.

{"Headline": "Major Cities Grind to a Halt and Face Days of Digging Out Snow", "Date": "2016-01-23", "News": "Supported by13 PhotosMaking up for a remarkably mild winter, the first major snowstorm of the season charged up the East Coast on Saturday, a blizzard propelled by tropical-storm-force winds that brought much of the Northeast to a standstill and left more than two feet of snow in New York City, where Mayor Bill de Blasio called it \u201cvery likely one of the worst snowstorms in our history.\u201dA travel ban, imposed Saturday afternoon in and around the city to keep drivers off streets, was lifted at 7 a.m. on Sunday.Four Hudson River crossings \u2014 the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels and the George Washington and Tappan Zee Bridges \u2014 that were shut down in conjunction with the ban re-opened at 7 a.m. as well. The city\u2019s public bus service also began operating again with limited service. But suburban commuter railroads in New York, as its elevated subway lines, remained closed, following the lead of mass transit systems in Washington, Baltimore and Philadelphia.A satellite image from NASA shows the extent of the huge winter storm that blanketed the East Coast with snow on Saturday.New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Saturday that service to aboveground subways and to Long Island Rail Road and Metro North Railroad could be restored on Sunday, weather permitting. Travelers hoping to fly into or out of New York City\u2019s two airports, La Guardia and Kennedy Airports, would not be so lucky. The governor said \u201cthe vast majority\u201d of flights would be canceled on Sunday.From Tennessee to North Carolina and north along the Interstate 95 spine, those who persisted found the going slow and treacherous. In some places, long-haul trucks lined up behind snowplows. In others, cars mistook entrance ramps for exits. Officials throughout the Mid-Atlantic region warned that it could be days before residents finished digging out.Mr. Cuomo declared a state of emergency for New York and implored residents to stay home. Governors in at least nine other states did the same as road crews from Nashville to New York did battle with what the National Weather Service called a \u201cpotentially crippling winter storm.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s clearly significant,\u201d said Faye Barthold, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service\u2019s New York area office. \u201cYou don\u2019t typically get three-inch-an-hour snowfall rates, but this system is so dynamic and has all that energy.\u201dThe storm \u2014 blustery in some places, blinding in others \u2014 was a swirling, sprawling mass with a reach of nearly 1,000 miles. It flooded low-lying beaches and brought down trees and power lines, leaving thousands without electricity. The storm also glazed roads and varnished trees as it walloped the Mid-Atlantic region with destructive force.The ocean poured into shore towns in southern New Jersey: In Sea Isle City, floodwaters laden with chunks of ice surged down the streets, and in Wildwood the frigid, brackish water submerged cars halfway up to their windows. In Belmar, the wind drove a sailboat out of its marina and tangled its mast in overhead wires, knocking out power.But most of the storm\u2019s victims died while attempting to drive on icy highways or shovel snow in the punishing winds. Three of those who died while shoveling were New Yorkers \u2014 men aged 67, 78 and 80 \u2014 in Queens and Staten Island, the authorities said. Two more were on Long Island, a 61-year-old man in West Hempstead and a 94-year-old man in Smithtown whose body was found next to a snow blower, the authorities said. A sixth shoveling death occurred in Maryland, where a 60-year-old man died of a heart attack on Saturday morning while removing snow outside his home, a spokesman for the Prince George\u2019s County Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department said.The storm slammed Washington on Friday and continued through the night amid reports of \u201cthunder snow\u201d \u2014 snow accompanied by thunder and lightning. As television newscasters predicted a \u201c100 percent chance of snowball fights,\u201d Mayor Muriel Bowser repeated a solemn plea that echoed Mr. de Blasio\u2019s: Stay indoors, she said, warning that the storm was not over yet. With another six to 10 inches expected, streets needed to be clear for emergency vehicles, she said. But the mayor warned it was uncertain how long it would take the city to recover and services, including schools and all public transit, to resume.New York awoke to a wall of white, but by arriving on a Saturday, the storm gave the city a break. There was no rush-hour commute to contend with, and officials did not have to wrestle with whether to close schools. For many, it was a day for sledding, snowboarding and snowshoeing \u2014 or for binge-viewing whatever was on the DVR or on Netflix. The music of chains clanking on snowplows and buses provided a muffled accompaniment, the snow quieting the noise against the pavement. Most of the buses \u2014 when they were still operating \u2014 were empty, and pedestrians, realizing they had the streets to themselves, stepped off sidewalks and walked triumphantly down usually busy avenues.There were other sounds \u2014 the whine of snow blowers clearing narrow sidewalk passes and the achy groan of shovelers who did it the hard way, only to ask themselves why.\u201cIt\u2019s not worth it,\u201d said Mike Diakakis, the foreman at an apartment building on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. \u201cIt\u2019s coming down as fast as we clear it away.\u201dThe snow fell as much as three inches an hour, the National Weather Service said. But that did not stop those who had destinations \u2014 and perhaps hopes of a sled run or a snowball fight \u2014 in mind.\u201cIt\u2019s fun,\u201d said Beth Kastner, on the way to a romp in Central Park with her dog, a 5-year-old Labrador mix named Nala. \u201cYou can\u2019t sit in an apartment all day with a large dog. That\u2019s kind of a nightmare. She\u2019ll be O.K., and I\u2019ll be happier.\u201dWhat is open and closed as the New York region copes with its first big snowstorm of 2016.Saturday had begun with subways and buses running in New York, but Mr. Cuomo said buses were \u201chaving significant issues\u201d and that some commuter trains faced equipment problems.Mr. Cuomo called in to New York 1, a local television station, to praise New York City officials on Saturday, saying they did a \u201cfantastic job.\u201d\u201cThe Department of Sanitation, the N.Y.P.D., Mayor de Blasio, they all handled the situation extraordinarily well,\u201d he said.Even before Mr. Cuomo announced that bus service was being halted, some passengers reported long waits in the cold, and as the noon cutoff approached, they worried that they would be stranded. Oscar Garcia, who lives in East Elmhurst, Queens, stood in the Jackson Heights-Roosevelt Avenue station, waiting and watching. He did not like what he saw: As his bus pulled in, the driver changed the sign to \u201cNot in Service.\u201dThat only added to Mr. Garcia\u2019s frustration. He had been on his way to his job at an Italian restaurant in Rego Park when his boss called to say the restaurant would be closed for the day.The storm stranded airline passengers up and down the East Coast, with 4,993 flights canceled on Saturday and 2,169 canceled for Sunday, according to Flightaware.com, a website that tracks such things. At La Guardia Airport, there were no lines at security checkpoints and no baggage carousels rumbling: With virtually no flights coming in, there was no baggage to unload and there were no passengers to claim it.Those forced to wait at the airport killed time. Mykhaylo Komar, an artist from Ukraine, fretted. He and his wife were scheduled to fly to Miami for a six-day cruise to Jamaica and the Cayman Islands.\u201cSnow,\u201d Mr. Komar said, shaking his head. \u201cVery big problem.\u201dThe mail did not go through in Manhattan on Saturday \u2014 the United States Postal Service suspended delivery, a spokeswoman said, and directed its letter carriers to return to their post offices at noon. And as the day went on, the list of cancellations grew longer. Broadway shows scheduled for Saturday were canceled, as was a hockey game in Brooklyn between the Islanders and the Philadelphia Flyers. The Metropolitan Opera and the New York City Opera canceled performances, as did the New York Philharmonic. Bruce Springsteen said on Twitter that his Sunday concert at Madison Square Garden would be postponed.Some people took the warnings seriously and stayed indoors. Some did not. Ron Hickey, the manager of a Lowe\u2019s home-improvement store on the Upper West Side, said there were two kinds of customers on Saturday: \u201cthe overpreparers and the people coming last second, saying, \u2018Oh, no!\u2019 \u201d Those in the first category, he said, were buying the usual stuff people buy on a Saturday \u2014 doors, light bulbs, plungers. The others were buying what those in the first group had bought when they heard the storm warnings on Friday \u2014 shovels, salt and batteries.Chris Rudney, the general manager of Beacon Wines and Spirits, on Broadway at 74th Street, had an explanation for sparsely filled stores, his own included. Based on the blockbuster sales at his store on Friday, it seemed, people were home, having a drink.\u201cI guess,\u201d he said, \u201cstaying inside is worthy of celebration.\u201dReporting was contributed by\u00a0Nicholas Fandos and Sheryl Gay Stolberg in Washington; Jon Hurdle in Ocean City, N.J.; and Michael Barbaro, Mark S.

He was a co-\u00adcreator of \u201cThe State,\u201d the influential sketch show that flourished briefly on MTV in the 1990s, and he starred in \u201cWet Hot American Summer,\u201d the wonderfully shaggy satire of 1980s summer camp comedies. Black, playing a counselor named \u00adMcKinley, shared the screen with Bradley Cooper during Cooper\u2019s first sex scene, making love to Camp Firewood\u2019s closeted drama instructor in a dusty equipment shed. Though he\u2019s now over the hill, Black has the energy, and platform agnosticism, of a man half his age. He recently reprised his role as McKinley in the Netflix prequel \u201cWet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp.\u201d He hosts a podcast, \u201cHow to Be Amazing,\u201d in which he conducts amiable interviews with the likes of Elizabeth Gilbert, Miranda July and Bob Odenkirk. He\u2019s the author of the children\u2019s books \u201cNaked!\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m Bored.\u201d He writes memoirs: \u201cNavel Gazing\u201d is a follow-up to \u201cYou\u2019re Not Doing It Right\u201d (2012), a frank, slightly cranky assessment of marriage and parenthood. He is a tireless Twitterer. He does stand-up.The weaker moments in Black\u2019s writing show the strain of this diversified enterprise. His prose can feel as if it began life in a subterranean comedy club, only to be cut from his tight five; lines that Black\u2019s charisma might have carried onstage can be groaners on the page. \u201cI, too, have experienced the runner\u2019s high,\u201d he writes in a section on jogging. \u201cI get it every time I stop.\u201d As an observational comic, Black lacks the craftsmanship of a perfectionist like Jerry Seinfeld or the electric shock of a more committed boundary-pusher like Louis C.K. A chapter about his lifelong disgust with his feet offers little in the way of revelation about the human foot. They smell, we learn, and are susceptible to ugly maladies, like the fungal infection he describes in unstinting detail. At its best, however, Black\u2019s writing crackles with the antic absurdity that infused \u201cThe State.\u201d The soles of his feet, he reports, have \u201cthe same crumbly texture as the original draft of the Declaration of Independence,\u201d a comparison you don\u2019t see coming, and won\u2019t soon forget. As for Black\u2019s musings on the indignities of aging, they work better when he abandons the observational mode and instead searches for the stories behind his failing flesh. A chapter on his deteriorating hearing is a portal back to his childhood in New Jersey and his stint in a high school punk band. The group made up for a decided lack of talent by playing their music at punishing decibel levels \u2014 punishment they mostly visited on their own eardrums. Lacking any training in an instrument, Black acted as the frontman and wrote songs. \u201cThe first lesson in any writing is, of course, \u2018Write what you know,\u2019\u2009\u201d he says, recalling that his debut number concerned the racial politics of apartheid-era South Africa. \u201cObviously, nobody understood that subject better than me.\u201d He may never have mastered the guitar, but Black is a virtuoso of self-deprecation. He also possesses an aversion to \u00adnostalgia, an admirable quality in a memoirist. \u201cWas my year as a punk rocker worth losing my hearing over?\u201d he asks, having enumerated its pleasures. \u201cHell, no.\u201d Black the teenager may have found solace in the making of bad music. Black the adult would like to be able to hear his wife from across the dinner table.What was Black trying to drown out with his punk pretensions? In part, the conventional teenage tribulations \u2014 the unwanted interest of bullies, the unwanted indifference of young women. (Recalling one teenage tryst, Black describes his lover as responding to his \u201cartless ministrations in a vague, disinterested way, as if she were hearing about them from a friend.\u201d) But Black\u2019s childhood held less conventional unhappiness as well. His father died at age 39, the victim of a violent assault. Black\u2019s mother is a lesbian who began dating women after her divorce from his father but maintained, for the neighbors, the fiction that she and her partner were sisters. You can see how the Dead Ken\u00adnedys might have appealed. Black\u2019s mother eventually came to terms with her sexuality, though only shortly before her health failed her. She is engaged in a continuing battle with uterine cancer, and it is her struggle to survive that ultimately gives this book about bodies its soul. A Jewish mother in good standing, she uses her diagnosis to guilt her son into more frequent phone calls to South Florida. Black, in turn, uses those calls to interrogate his mother about the life they\u2019ve shared and the illness that threatens to part them.Black writes of his mother unsentimentally, refusing to let her condition cloud his judgment of her mixed record as a parent. But he observes the increasingly invasive treatments with genuine awe at her physical and spiritual resilience, and revulsion at his own laziness. It spurs him to run, and finish, a 10K. The titular bit of anatomy, it turns out, is not the author\u2019s but his mother\u2019s. \u201cNavel Gazing\u201d opens with a description of the surgery that claimed it as collateral damage; gazing at the belly that bore him, Black now sees a void. \u201cHow strange to not have a bellybutton,\u201d he writes. \u201cHaving it taken seems like a peculiar kind of bodily transgression, as if a burglar broke into your house but only stole your high school ring.\u201d Confronting such transgressions, Black never shies from their wretchedness. But neither does he give in to woe. NAVEL GAZINGTrue Tales of Bodies, Mostly Mine (but Also My Mom\u2019s, Which I Know Sounds Weird)By Michael Ian Black194 pp. Gallery Books. $24.99.

But this is an era in which executives are increasingly reluctant to cancel a show quickly.\u201cWe believe in the show,\u201d Mr. Pedowitz said. \u201cWe stand by the show.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re going to give it a chance to get seen.\u201dAline Brosh McKenna, the show\u2019s co-creator, suggested that binge viewing could help it find an audience.\u201cIt\u2019s an unusual show,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of my favorite shows are shows that took a little while to catch on, or maybe people discovered a little bit later they had bought the season pass from iTunes.\u201dGlenn Geller, the new president of CBS Entertainment, presented at the event for the first time last week and said that he was going to pick right up at the network where his predecessor, Nina Tassler, left off.Mr. Geller said Ms. Tassler \u201cliked strong and narrative stories just like I do. She loved strong central characters just like I do. I don\u2019t think that will ever change. Our brand works. Our audience loves it, and I love our shows too.\u201dCase in point: As serialized programming becomes more and more popular on television, and procedurals are falling out of favor, CBS won\u2019t be abandoning its bread-and-butter programming, even in the era of bingeing.\u201cThe No. 2 show on television is a regular old procedural in \u2018NCIS,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Geller said. \u201cThere\u2019s a great interest in shows that are about the good guys putting the bad guys away.\u201dMr. Geller did make a strong defense for Stephen Colbert, whose \u201cLate Show\u201d has struggled to find a devoted viewership.\u201cI think the show is fantastic, and we want Stephen to be Stephen. And that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s doing,\u201d he said. \u201cI think he is clearly the pre-eminent interviewer in late night.\u201dAt the Golden Globes last week, Amazon became the first programmer in nine years to win the best comedy series award for two consecutive years for two different shows. The streaming service won last year for \u201cTransparent,\u201d and this year for the relatively obscure \u201cMozart in the Jungle.\u201d (ABC won consecutively in 2005-6 with \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d and \u201cUgly Betty.\u201d)\u201cI think that\u2019s the good part about the Globes,\u201d said Joe Lewis, Amazon\u2019s head of comedy, at the company\u2019s post-awards party. \u201cThey are able to look at shows that might not get the broadest audience, and that\u2019s what we try to do. We\u2019re not trying to make everyone\u2019s third-favorite show.\u201dThe next morning, Roy Price, the head of Amazon Studios, said in an interview that Woody Allen\u2019s much-anticipated show for the streaming service would begin filming in the spring and would debut later this year.There are cord-cutters and cord-nevers, and now Showtime\u2019s president, David Nevins, has added a new term to the television industry lexicon: Cord-cobblers. To recap: A cord-cutter is someone who has cable and cancels; a cord-never is usually a younger person who has no intention of ever subscribing to cable. So what exactly is a cord-cobbler?Mr. Nevins \u2014 who said someone else came up with this term \u2014 explained that a cord-cobbler is \u201cmuch more likely to have Hulu, Netflix, Amazon, and so you\u2019re seeing a phenomenon of a lot of people putting things together that they care about.\u201d(Showtime has its own stand-alone app, too.)And Showtime\u2019s shows are now going to be staggered throughout the year, less concerned with, say, making sure \u201cHomeland\u201d is a lead-in for \u201cThe Affair.\u201dMr. Nevins said that David Lynch was more than halfway through his shooting schedule for the much-anticipated revival of \u201cTwin Peaks.\u201d It will debut in the first half of next year, he said. And, he added, the sixth season of \u201cHomeland\u201d will be filming in and around New York City.Fox is jumping on the live-musical bandwagon, with \u201cGrease: Live,\u201d broadcasting this month, and, in March, \u201cThe Passion,\u201d a musical about Jesus Christ\u2019s final days. And later this year, it will unveil another musical, \u201cThe Rocky Horror Picture Show.\u201dNBC unleashed the live-musical genre in recent years with its productions of \u201cThe Sound of Music,\u201d \u201cPeter Pan,\u201d and, most recently, \u201cThe Wiz.\u201d But Fox sees the musical business as true to its brand.\u201cMusic is so much a part of the Fox DNA,\u201d said Dana Walden, co-chief executive of Fox Television Group. Gary Newman, the other chief executive, pointed to \u201cGlee\u201d and \u201cEmpire\u201d as examples that illustrate Fox\u2019s music bona fides.These sort of musicals generally lose money, But in creating live television events in an industry hungry for them, they serve as important promotional platforms for other shows on the network.In the meantime, NBC Entertainment\u2019s chairman, Robert Greenblatt \u2014 who announced that \u201cHairspray\u201d would probably be the network\u2019s next live musical \u2014 made reference to the fact that ABC is working on a \u201cDirty Dancing\u201d musical and took a small victory lap at his Television Critics Association session: \u201cIf we spawned a little kind of uprising of musicals,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\u2019s great.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wall St. Slides After Chinese Stocks Plunge", "Date": "2016-01-04", "News": "Supported byOn the first trading day of the new year, investors\u2019 old worries flooded back.Global stock markets tumbled on Monday, as further fears about a slowdown in China\u2019s economy reignited concerns about global growth.The selling on Monday started after China released a weak manufacturing report, and continued after the United States did the same. Chinese stocks lost nearly 7 percent of their value, although they appeared to stabilize Tuesday morning. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, the main benchmark for the United States stock market, posted a decline of 1.5 percent, while European stocks also fell.The sharp drops bring back memories of the sell-off last summer. China\u2019s surprising decision in August to devalue its currency prompted concerns about the health of the country\u2019s economy and helped ignite a global rout.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.But there was a new twist to investors\u2019 anxieties. Measures to help steady stocks that were put in place after the market turmoil last year now appear to be exacerbating the selling in China.\u201cThis will be the theme for the year,\u201d said Devendra Joshi, an HSBC Asia equity strategist. \u201cThere will be more volatility.\u201dThe market volatility, if it continues, may create headaches for the Federal Reserve, which in December raised interest rates for the first time in over nine years. The Fed chose not to raise rates in September, in part because it was concerned that the turbulence of the summer would weigh on the United States economy.The manufacturing data released on Monday could strengthen the arguments of some economists who say the Fed was too quick to raise interest rates. The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s measure of manufacturing activity fell to 48.2 in December, its lowest reading since 2009. (A number below 50 signals that the manufacturing sector is contracting.)Chinese manufacturing has been steadily contracting for 10 straight months. The Caixin purchasing managers\u2019 index for December fell to 48.2, well below expectations and lower than the reading in November.\u201cIt was a one-two punch from the manufacturing sector,\u201d said Gina C. Martin Adams, institutional equity strategist at Wells Fargo Securities. Some of the stocks that soared in 2015 were among the hardest hit on Monday. Netflix, the top-performing stock in the S.&P. 500 last year, declined by almost 4 percent, while Amazon, the second-biggest gainer last year, plunged 5.8 percent. Investors also appeared to seek some safety in government bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which falls as its price rises, declined slightly to 2.25 percent, from 2.27 percent.The oil markets shrugged off increased tensions in the Middle East. Early in the day, the conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran, two major oil producers, sent the price of crude soaring. But oil ultimately ended down, as concerns about the Chinese slowdown crimped commodity prices.Analysts cautioned that it would be a mistake to read too much into one day\u2019s trading, and they pointed out that markets around the world rallied strongly after the sell-off in the summer. The outlook for Europe appears to be stronger than it was a year ago. And the United States economy has proved its resilience in recent years, growing even as the dollar increased in value and as the plunge in oil prices damaged the prospects of the energy sector.Still, China\u2019s challenges will most likely unsettle investors for a while. As the world\u2019s second largest economy, China is a critical piece of the growth puzzle. If China decelerates markedly, Chinese companies and consumers buy less in goods and services from other countries.Chinese demand is particularly worrisome for commodity producers around the world, which have been hurt by the country\u2019s slowdown. On Monday, Anglo American\u2019s shares fell about 7 percent, while Glencore\u2019s were off 5.8 percent. The pressures on the Chinese currency add to the global worries.The Chinese government is allowing the value of its currency, the renminbi, to decline as a way of spurring its own economy. On Monday, the central bank set the renminbi at its lowest level since May 2011.But this approach risks fanning market tumult and trade tensions.Companies and individuals have moved their money overseas, prompted by economic weakness and the fear that the renminbi will lose more value. Those outflows further weigh on the value of the currency.\u201cThe People\u2019s Bank of China needs to be careful,\u201d said Li-Gang Liu, the chief economist for greater China at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group. \u201cIt cannot create a one-way bet for renminbi depreciation. If they were to do that, we would run into an out-of-control scenario like we saw in the second half of last year.\u201dFrom a trade perspective, China\u2019s policy can prompt other countries to devalue their currencies to try to regain competitiveness. Some Asian countries have already moved in that direction.It is also a challenge for American companies. As other currencies have weakened, the dollar has remained relatively strong. That makes it harder for United States companies to export and it forces them to cut prices to compete \u2014 all of which potentially drags down earnings.The Chinese government\u2019s stock stabilization plan is also playing into the market sell-off.A new rule, which went into effect on Monday, suspends trading in the major mainland markets when the CSI 300 index of blue-chip shares falls 5 percent during a session. The circuit breaker kicked in Monday, setting off a temporary halt. Analysts indicate that the suspension might have led investors to later dump shares, which then brought on a halt for the day.Another measure, a six-month ban on major shareholders\u2019 offloading stocks in Chinese-listed companies, expires at the end of this week. The policy was imposed to stabilize share prices last summer. But now it could be having the reverse effect, leading those with smaller holdings to sell before larger shareholders do. After opening lower on Tuesday, shares in Shanghai wavered between small gains and losses. Hao Hong, chief strategist at the Bank of Communications International, predicted that the tough start to 2016 could continue. \u201cVolatility tends to beget volatility,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will more likely than not spill over to other asset classes. Given we had such dramatic volatility, it\u2019s really too early to see the bottom, especially now that the fundamentals are looking so ugly.\u201dDavid Jolly contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But another American president \u2014 albeit a fictional one \u2014 has been a talk of the town this week.The actor Kevin Spacey has attracted attention at his first visit to the forum, as even high-powered business executives whisper about glimpses of the man who plays President Frank Underwood in Netflix\u2019s \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201dOfficially, Mr. Spacey is here for a session on Friday to discuss playing the Machiavellian Mr. Underwood and the drama unfolding in the race for the United States presidency.But the actor has instead become quite the man about town.There he was at an intimate reception hosted on Wednesday by the Alibaba Group, the Chinese e-commerce titan, breaking bread with Leonardo DiCaprio and Bono.Soon after, he popped up at the famed piano bar at the Hotel Europe, the longtime redoubt of the Davos night life crowd. Invited as a guest of a party thrown by the investment firm Skybridge Capital, Mr. Spacey commanded the crowd\u2019s attention around 11 p.m.Clad in a plaid suit and dark turtleneck, the actor wisecracked with the attendees, many of whom held their phones aloft to record the event. Slipping into the smooth Southern accent of Underwood, Mr. Spacey joked that the difference between Donald Trump and his television antihero was that \u201cone of these characters is a fictional character, and the other is a fictional character.\u201dNext came a zinger about Hillary Clinton and emails, in Mr. Spacey\u2019s impression of President Clinton.Mr. Spacey then offered some sincere words about the crowd at the Forum. \u201cIt\u2019s so incredible to be here the past couple of days and realize that change can happen and that ideas are extraordinary,\u201d he said.Finally, he crooned a short tune a cappella, honoring a longtime tradition of the piano bar. Soon after his barely five-minute stint, as the crowd returned to sip high-end Champagne and Bordeaux red wine, the actor quietly slipped out of the bar and off into the night.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Under New Leader, Discovery Channel\u2019s Brand Reboot Shows Promise", "Date": "2016-01-03", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Hollywood loves a comeback story. And right now, there is perhaps none better than Rich Ross and Discovery.And ratings are up. The channel delivered a 12 percent year-on-year gain in total viewers, according to Nielsen data, along with a 3 percent increase in adults 18 to 49, a bracket that advertisers often pay a premium to reach. For the first time in its 34-year history, Discovery just ended a year as the No. 1 nonsports cable network among men age 25 to 54, a target demographic.Discovery\u2019s strength comes as other cable networks have faltered. Viewership plummeted in 2015 for stalwarts like History, A&E, USA, MTV and Comedy Central. Reasons include poor programming choices, the loss of popular stars, competition from streaming services and a glut of similarly themed reality shows.\u201cPeople told me when I took this job, \u2018You came to the party, and the punch bowl is empty,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Ross said in an interview at his Los Angeles office last month. \u201cNot true. We can get ratings by doing things the right way, by inspiring people, by influencing people, by activating people.\u201dHe added, after pausing to straighten the lace on one of his high-top leather sneakers, \u201cIt\u2019s about not confusing what the audience wants with your taste.\u201d\u201cPeople here looked at me and said, \u2018Well, that\u2019s not a show for you. It\u2019s not aspirational,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018In what universe are you living? Craft alcohol is changing people\u2019s lives, changing the way people think about organic versus corporate.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u201cKilling Fields\u201d brings a new test.One of the first new shows created under Mr. Ross, it follows a colorful detective, Rodie Sanchez, who comes out of retirement to try to solve a 1997 murder case \u2014 possibly tied to a serial killer \u2014 that has never stopped haunting him. With its artistic pacing and lush, foreboding images of Louisiana topography, \u201cKilling Fields\u201d resembles the celebrated first season of HBO\u2019s \u201cTrue Detective,\u201d except that the Discovery version is true.The stylized show has a strong pedigree, especially for Discovery. Its executive producers are Tom Fontana, whose credits include \u201cHomicide: Life on the Street\u201d and HBO\u2019s \u201cOz,\u201d and Barry Levinson, the Oscar-winning director of \u201cRain Man,\u201d neither of whom had worked in unscripted television before.\u201cI came into this with a bit of a snobby attitude \u2014 reality TV? \u2014 and I have been completely won over,\u201d Mr. Fontana said. \u201cIt\u2019s a character piece. The murder is obviously important, but what\u2019s really compelling to me are the men and women we meet along the way.\u201dMr. Levinson added, \u201cWhen you think of reality television, this feels like a step forward, something that has not been done over and over already.\u201d\u201cThe challenge now, for Discovery and other cable networks, is to broaden their audience without alienating core viewers,\u201d said Andy Donchin, chief domestic investment officer for Amplifi, a division of Dentsu Aegis Network, an ad agency that counts General Motors and Home Depot as clients. \u201cThat has to be done very carefully.\u201dTo grow, Discovery must work harder to maintain its stronghold on its core audience of men while becoming more inviting to other audiences, notably women.Mr. Ross has considerable television experience, helping to build Nickelodeon in the late 1980s and running Disney Channels Worldwide during its \u201cHigh School Musical\u201d-fueled 2000s. It was when he was promoted in 2009 to run Walt Disney Studios that he encountered difficulties, gaining a reputation for imperiousness as he carried out a fast-paced overhaul and overseeing bombs like \u201cJohn Carter.\u201dBut those days now seem firmly behind him.\u201cHe\u2019s working on the weekends, he\u2019s working late at night, and he\u2019s driven,\u201d David Zaslav, the chief executive of Discovery Communications, said of Mr. Ross last month at a UBS global media and communications conference. Mr. Zaslav, who recently gave Mr. Ross control of two additional networks, Animal Planet and Science Channel, added that Discovery had been steered back toward quality.\u201cHe wrote off a lot of content that was off brand,\u201d Mr. Zaslav said. (Ms. O\u2019Neill, who left behind numerous hits, including the Alaskan fishing series \u201cDeadliest Catch,\u201d declined to comment about the turn Discovery took late in her tenure.)Not on Mr. Ross\u2019s agenda are programming stunts.\u201cIn challenging times, people need a spiral up, not a spiral down,\u201d Mr. Ross said from his office. \u201cWe have an enormous opportunity to make a difference that way.\u201dWithout question, Discovery\u2019s surge has been aided by plummeting ratings at its rival History Channel, which is co-owned by Disney and Hearst. History experienced a 26 percent drop among 18- to 49-year-olds in 2015. But Mr. Ross \u2014 crediting lessons he learned early in his career \u2014 says he has pushed his team to pay less attention to the competition.\u201cWhen I came here, there was a lot of history of focusing on History,\u201d he said. \u201cI kept hearing, \u2018The pitch for this show is competitive with History.\u2019 I said, \u2018Stop talking about that. I really don\u2019t care.\u2019 If we think of ourselves only in the scheme of beating History, that\u2019s small ball. We have to think about what Discovery can be.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens,\u201d which picked up five nominations in craft categories, came up far short of the original \u201cStar Wars,\u201d which was a best picture nominee in 1978.The acting groups were peppered with familiar faces. As expected, Cate Blanchett came away with her seventh nomination, for \u201cCarol.\u201d Jennifer Lawrence, now a four-time nominee, this time for \u201cJoy,\u201d joined Ms. Blanchett in the category. Also selected were Brie Larson from \u201cRoom,\u201d Charlotte Rampling from the indie drama \u201c45 Years\u201d and Saoirse Ronan from \u201cBrooklyn.\u201dMr. DiCaprio, picking up his fifth acting nomination, will be competing against the reigning best actor winner, Eddie Redmayne, who picked up a nod for \u201cThe Danish Girl.\u201d Voters also backed Matt Damon (\u201cThe Martian\u201d), Bryan Cranston (\u201cTrumbo\u201d) and Michael Fassbender (\u201cSteve Jobs\u201d).Although Mr. Scott received the coldest shoulder, there were other slights. Aaron Sorkin was not among the adapted screenplay nominees for \u201cSteve Jobs,\u201d even though he took the screenwriting prize at the Golden Globes on Sunday. Receiving nothing were \u201cConcussion,\u201d starring Will Smith; \u201cBeasts of No Nation,\u201d featuring Idris Elba; and \u201cBlack Mass,\u201d with Johnny Depp.The racially diverse \u201cCreed,\u201d directed by Ryan Coogler, was shut out, except for a nomination for its (white) war-horse supporting actor, Sylvester Stallone.The documentary category also brought two prominent rebukes, as two widely viewed investigative films, Alex Gibney\u2019s \u201cGoing Clear,\u201d which focused on Scientology, and Kirby Dick\u2019s \u201cThe Hunting Ground,\u201d about college rapes, were left out. Instead, nominations went to \u201cAmy,\u201d about the rise and fall of the singer Amy Winehouse; \u201cCartel Land,\u201d set in Mexico; \u201cThe Look of Silence,\u201d about genocide in Indonesia; and a pair of heavily campaigned Netflix films, \u201cWhat Happened, Miss Simone?\u201d and \u201cWinter on Fire: Ukraine\u2019s Fight for Freedom.\u201dAs documentaries go, \u201cAmy\u201d has done well at the box office, taking in about $8.4 million in the United States and Canada. Speaking from his home in London, Asif Kapadia, who directed the film, said Ms. Winehouse\u2019s drug addiction and death seemed to mirror problems in many viewers\u2019 lives. \u201cIt started off being a film about Amy, and ended up being a film about ourselves,\u201d Mr. Kapadia said.Under the Academy\u2019s complex counting method, an eight-film best picture spread (for the second year), indicates that opinion was fairly fragmented. In 2009, the Academy increased the number of films nominated in the best picture category to 10 from five. Two years later, the rules were again changed, to permit a variable number of nominees, between five and 10, depending on voter support.\u201cStraight Outta Compton\u201d was not shut out completely. Alan Wenkus and S. Leigh Savidge, who conceived the film, were nominated as part of a screenwriting team in the original screenplay category, which also saw \u201cInside Out,\u201d \u201cSpotlight,\u201d \u201cBridge of Spies\u201d and the futuristic \u201cEx Machina\u201d honored. Mr. Wenkus said he was disappointed to see others from \u201cStraight Outta Compton\u201d overlooked.\u201cWithout those actors, those incredible young actors, and Gary Gray drawing out those characters on screen, this would not be the movie it is,\u201d Mr. Wenkus said.Among studios, 20th Century Fox had a very good morning, with three films in its stable \u2014 \u201cThe Revenant,\u201d \u201cBrooklyn\u201d and \u201cThe Martian\u201d \u2014 receiving best picture nominations. But small, relatively new film companies will also be shouldering the work and expense of ongoing Oscar campaigns. Open Road Films is backing \u201cSpotlight,\u201d for instance, while Bleecker Street released \u201cTrumbo.\u201dThe small A24 Films, which released \u201cRoom,\u201d \u201cAmy\u201d and \u201cEx Machina,\u201d will be backing nominees in seven categories. A groggy Ms. Larson, reached by phone in Australia, where she is filming \u201cKong: Skull Island,\u201d said she was ready and willing to join the next wave of Oscar glad-handing, although she didn\u2019t know quite what form that would take. \u201cI\u2019m completely ignorant, I\u2019ve never done this before,\u201d she said.After three years of entrusting its ceremony to the producers Neil Meron and Craig Zadan, who brought in Seth MacFarlane to sing about female on-screen nudity as host and Neil Patrick Harris to stand in his underwear, the Academy has turned to a new pair of telecast producers: Reginald Hudlin, a filmmaker whose raucous comedies include \u201cHouse Party,\u201d and David Hill, a producer with credits on \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d and the 2011 World Series broadcast.Under pressure to lift ratings \u2014 the audience for the last year\u2019s ceremony dropped nearly 15 percent, to around 36.6 million viewers, from 43 million in 2014 \u2014 the new producers decided to bring back Mr. Rock.An article on Friday about the Oscar nominations misstated the number Cate Blanchett has received in her career.

The many things on top of it include a tidy pile of fan letters, a jar of Lubriderm, a jar of extra-crunchy Skippy and a check for $20 from an admirer \u2014 for beers.In a moment, Mr. Tovey and his 3-year-old bulldog moved past a wee office occupied by the stage managers Martha Donaldson and Sherry Cohen.\u201cGreat show tonight, darling,\u201d Ms. Donaldson said.\u201cYeah?\u201d Mr. Tovey replied.\u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cReally good.

He could be a gay Hitler or Manson, should the opportunity arise, and, unlike Julianne Moore, he may not be able to shut it off at will.

I\u2019m buzzing. I have to go out, I need to drink whiskey!

If you poke him, he seems ready. Enthusiasts, and the gay press, too, have long discussed Mr. Tovey in exceedingly graphic terms, with a seeming fetish for his distinctive ears. He is unfazed. \u201cIt\u2019s a compliment!\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not saying: \u2018Ew. I wouldn\u2019t go anywhere near it.\u2019 Then, I\u2019d be upset.\u201dWhen a devotee goes too far in an online comment, he screen-shots it for a laugh, as he did when one fan once described an act he would like to perform involving his ears (before covering them with cheese and boiling them). \u201cI was like, \u2018That\u2019s sweet,\u2019\u201d Mr. Tovey said. \u201cAnd my mum was like, \u2018That\u2019s disgusting.\u2019\u201dBut he is not unflappable. \u201cIf I find someone attractive, I can get blushy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I fight that.\u201dSo that\u2019s how you\u2019ll know. You already know he\u2019s a good egg; he\u2019ll never cash that fan\u2019s $20 check.It was about midnight, and Mr. Tovey said he was going home. Tomorrow was matinee day. The call at the Lyceum was 1:30 for a 2 o\u2019clock show. \u201cSee you afterward,\u201d the waitress said, meaning after every curtain.Mr. Tovey and Rocky went up a block and down the subway stairs before catching the F train downtown. Mr. Tovey sat on the train bench and put an ankle atop a knee and the dog atop all that. In the harsh light of a subway car, there was a hint of dark roots growing beneath his bleached hair. Rocky stood atop Mr. Tovey\u2019s legs, sternly surveying anyone who might approach, and at last folded himself down into Mr. Tovey\u2019s lap.

{"Headline": "Parents Monitoring Teenagers Online, and Mostly, Getting It Right", "Date": "2016-01-07", "News": " \u00e2\u0080\u009cChildren who felt like their parents were monitoring their activity online were noticeably less distressed by online conflict,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Underwood said. Particularly early in our children\u2019s online lives, we should also monitor, but openly. When we help our children learn to socialize in this domain, we help them moderate their own behavior, and also help them put the world of the Internet into context as just one piece of a much greater whole. Parents who participated in Pew\u2019s research seem to be doing just that. We\u2019re talking: Over 90 percent of parents say they have talked with their teenager about what is appropriate for them to share or view online and how they should treat others there. Those conversations appear to be more frequent for parents of younger teenagers, and when it comes to more specific monitoring of websites visited, parents of younger teenagers are more likely to check on them than parents of teenagers aged 15 to 17; similarly, of teenage cellphone owners, parents of children in the younger age group (13 and 14) were more likely to know the password than parents of older teenagers. Relatively few parents rely on technology to monitor technology. Just 39 percent of parents report using parental controls for blocking, filtering or monitoring their teenager\u00e2\u0080\u0099s online activities, while only 16 percent use parental controls to restrict their teenager\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use of his or her cellphone. That triumph of talk over tech may be in part because technology\u2019s ability to help parents limit and monitor is still itself limited. Blocking software often blocks too much or too little, and many gatekeepers are easier for teenagers to circumvent than they are for parents to install.  And, parents may be more interested in being aware of what their teenagers are doing online than they are in actively putting a stop to it.  No matter how good the tools to monitor children and teenagers online get, talk will always remain more powerful. The goal, after all, isn\u2019t to control our children and prevent their doing anything foolish or dangerous on the Internet, or even spending too much time there \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but to raise adults who can control themselves.

On Monday, the Academy\u2019s president, Cheryl Boone Isaacs, promised a review of recruitment efforts, saying, \u201cThis is a difficult but important conversation, and it\u2019s time for big changes.\u201dLike many, The New York Times\u2019 chief film critics, Manohla Dargis and A. O. Scott, and the critic at large Wesley Morris were not surprised by the nominations. Here are excerpts from their conversation:The statistics are unequivocal: Women and minorities are vastly underrepresented in front of and behind the camera. Here, 27 industry players reveal the stories behind the numbers.The shocking \u2014 or maybe not so shocking \u2014 whiteness of this year\u2019s field of nominees exposes not only the myopia of the nominating body but also the deep structural biases of the industry that feeds it. The Oscars have, since the century began, done a reasonably good job of recognizing black talent, belatedly making up for decades of neglect. \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d won best picture. Denzel Washington, Jamie Foxx, Halle Berry, Forest Whitaker and Mo\u2019Nique all collected statuettes for acting, as Geoffrey Fletcher (\u201cPrecious\u201d) and John Ridley (\u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d) did for screenwriting. But somehow (and I hope we can shed some light on exactly how), these victories, in the larger context of Hollywood racial politics, can smack of tokenism rather than real change. Spike Lee\u2019s lifetime achievement award feels like belated and inadequate compensation for a career\u2019s worth of slights. At the movies, we may be in the age of \u201cChi-Raq\u201d and \u201cStraight Outta Compton,\u201d but the Academy is still setting the table for \u201cGuess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner.\u201dIn the case of both \u201cCreed\u201d and \u201cCompton,\u201d I just don\u2019t think the campaigns were there for these movies. Just as I don\u2019t think they were there for \u201cSelma\u201d the previous year. And as nauseating as that sort of thing can be, that\u2019s how these things work: positioning, narratives, spinning, hype, overexposure, wanton whoring. So some of this is a matter of there not being enough movies in the pool. Some of it is the studios\u2019 misunderstanding the worth of the movies they have. It strains credibility that \u201cCreed\u201d wouldn\u2019t be a film the Academy would go for. But I also don\u2019t think any voter wants to be told that he or she has to vote for a predominantly black film or: racism!Manohla, wouldn\u2019t you say that\u2019s what happened in the last year and the year before? The audiences paid to see women, films with mostly black actors and racially diverse casts, and paid often: \u201cThe Force Awakens,\u201d \u201cInside Out,\u201d \u201cFurious 7,\u201d \u201cPitch Perfect 2,\u201d \u201cSpy,\u201d \u201cMad Max: Fury Road,\u201d \u201cTrainwreck,\u201d \u201cStraight Outta Compton,\u201d \u201cCinderella,\u201d \u201cCreed,\u201d \u201cGet Hard,\u201d \u201cSisters,\u201d that second \u201cDivergent\u201d movie and the last \u201cHunger Games.\u201d There\u2019s demonstrable proof that North America wants to see itself \u2014 more of itself \u2014 in its entertainment. And the Academy \u2014 which is working to add more women, young people and color to its ranks \u2014 should want to see more of its ideal self at the Oscars.But I don\u2019t want to let the Academy and its members off the hook. Or rather, I want to broaden the indictment beyond the specific complaints that they ignored Mr. Elba, \u201cCreed,\u201d \u201cStraight Outta Compton\u201d and Will Smith\u2019s excellent Nigerian accent in \u201cConcussion.\u201d It\u2019s not as if the 6,000 Academy members exercised the singular intention to ignore those contenders. The nominations are a numbers game, and in each case you can offer a nonracial explanation for the oversight. Other movies and actors just had a few more votes. \u201cBeasts of No Nation\u201d came from Netflix, which is a scary interloper in the hidebound, turf-protective world of the studios. The violence may have put off some voters. \u201cCreed\u201d did not get much of a campaign from Warner Bros., which may have figured that the seventh movie in a 40-year-old franchise with a mixed track record wasn\u2019t exactly Oscar bait. \u201cConcussion\u201d is terrible. \u201cStraight Outta Compton\u201d \u2026I think it\u2019s when you get to that one that race sneaks back into the picture. The Academy, in its function as the culture industry\u2019s upholder of the ideology of Quality, has for a long time been open to African-American talent and even eager to promote and reward it. But at the same time, it has been consistently blind, indifferent and hostile to African-American culture, or at least to certain popular manifestations of blackness at the moment of their greatest impact elsewhere. A Ray Charles biopic in 2005 is unlikely to cause any Academy member the slightest discomfort. An N.W.A biopic in 2015 is another story. \u201cMillion Dollar Baby\u201d and \u201cRocky\u201d are both excellent boxing pictures and worthy best picture winners that breathed fresh life into perhaps the most clich\u00e9-ridden genre in all of cinema.\u201cCreed\u201d belongs in their company, but I think some of its particular virtues flew under the Academy\u2019s radar, much as the glories of \u201cBeyond the Lights\u201d (2014) did. In addition to being a fight movie, \u201cCreed\u201d is a quiet, sweet love story about two people who happen to be young, gifted and black. It\u2019s also suffused with hip-hop and Philadelphia street culture, but in a way that feels entirely organic. It\u2019s not a film that is pointedly \u201cabout\u201d race or class or any particular social problem. It\u2019s not sending a message or teaching a lesson. It\u2019s about the lives, feelings and aspirations of its characters.Which, if those characters are not white, is apparently not enough. American cinema \u2014 more than television or pop music or literature \u2014 still prefers to treat black people as symbols, problems and members of a \u201cniche\u201d audience.The year 2010 was the first that the field went back to including more than five best-picture nominees, and that was a reaction to the omission of \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d from the best-picture list in 2009. That was perceived at the time to be a cataclysm. And what happened in 2010 was a pretty astounding range of movies (of varying excellence, but still!): \u201cAvatar,\u201d \u201cThe Blind Side,\u201d \u201cDistrict 9,\u201d \u201cAn Education,\u201d \u201cThe Hurt Locker,\u201d \u201cInglourious Basterds,\u201d \u201cPrecious,\u201d \u201cA Serious Man,\u201d \u201cUp,\u201d \u201cUp in the Air,\u201d all up for best picture.What a bounty. And to think it came about because the world was mad that the Oscars dissed a comic-book movie. The question is: Could the range happen again now that the system seems thoroughly rigged for campaigns, and this time be even more diverse?So, I\u2019m not sure that the bounty of 2010 is an honest reflection, as you put it Wesley, of the Academy\u2019s taste and priorities. A lot of variables go into every nomination round, including box-office and auteur branding, which may largely explain why James Cameron\u2019s \u201cAvatar\u201d made the cut, though pleasure shouldn\u2019t be discounted. My guess is that the inclusion of titles like \u201cDistrict 9,\u201d a genre movie about race, was primarily a function of the membership scrambling to answer the criticism over \u201cThe Dark Knight.\u201d Now, though, it\u2019s back to a certain old-fashioned idea of Quality, hence all those pale, pretty faces \u2014 Eddie Redmayne, seriously? \u2014 and a great animated movie like \u201cInside Out\u201d downgraded to the best animated feature rather than being allowed to vie as best picture.As to your question, Wesley, could the range of 2010 be replicated \u2014 could it be improved on? Yes and yes again. But much depends on who gets a meeting and who doesn\u2019t; what gets the greenlight and what doesn\u2019t; what\u2019s in the pipeline, and what is still struggling to be made for no reason other than the fact that the person struggling is black or Latino or Asian or a woman of any color and the person who could have said yes instead said no. A lot of this is about who\u2019s cutting the checks, running the companies, calling the shots. Mostly, as we know, those people are white men, and while I have no complaint against them as a class of people (some of my best friends are white guys), none of this will change until they actively help bring about the necessary change or until the country\u2019s demographics force them out. Because while we\u2019ll probably be writing this same story next year, change is coming.This year, at least, the contradictions will be heightened. Spike Lee will get his lifetime achievement award. Chris Rock will be the host. Many of the presenters will be minorities. Integrally close to none of the winners will be. There will be awkward remarks and uncomfortable smiles. The intensity of the discomfort might be a hopeful sign.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stocks Slide as Worries Persist Over Global Growth", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported byHopes for a recovery in the United States stock market were dashed on Wednesday as investors\u2019 deepening fears about the strength of the world\u2019s largest economies drove another wave of selling.The 2.5 percent slide in the market\u2019s main benchmark, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, was the worst so far this year, and came after two days of slight gains that had suggested some confidence was returning after a rocky start to the year. The index is now in what Wall Street calls a correction: a decline of 10 percent or more from its most recent high.The market decline indicates that investors still see plenty of risks lurking, many of them stemming from China\u2019s slowing economy. The persistent weakness in the price of oil is another market indicator that has raised questions about global growth.The United States economy has been showing some signs of steady growth. But investors are concerned that problems in China\u2019s economy, and the stress that creates for other countries, could unleash forces that ultimately weigh on the United States.\u201cWhen you change perceptions for the growth rate of the third-largest economic region in the world,\u201d said Jim Vogel, interest rates strategist at FTN Financial, \u201cyou have to reprice across all financial markets to account for that slowing growth.\u201dThe last time stocks slid into a correction was in August, when a small but surprising devaluation of China\u2019s currency rattled investors.Stocks rallied after the summer rout, as a recovery in Europe appeared to take hold and the Chinese currency steadied. As the year closed, most Wall Street analysts released mildly optimistic forecasts for the stock market in 2016.But it didn\u2019t take long for the fear to return.One of the headwinds that investors now face is higher interest rates in the United States. The Federal Reserve in December raised interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. Higher rates can tighten financial conditions in markets and push the dollar up against other currencies, which can in turn make it harder for United States companies to compete.Some economists, fearing that the markets are giving an early signal of a slowdown, may now call on the Fed to hold off on any further interest rate increases.And China is again unsettling investors. Figures show that capital is continuing to rush out of the country, a phenomenon that can add downward pressure to its currency, the renminbi.One of the ways that China\u2019s slowing can hurt the United State is through energy prices. As China has less demand for commodities, their prices have fallen. Oil-producing countries have continued to oversupply the markets with cheap crude.Lower oil prices lead to cheaper gasoline prices, which can prompt consumers to increase their spending on other goods and services, usually a fillip for the wider economy. But lower energy prices are hurting the United States companies that produce oil and gas.Energy stocks generally performed poorly on Wednesday. The Williams Companies tumbled 17.7 percent, while ConocoPhillips closed down more than 3 percent.Some of the fiercest selling took place in technology stocks that did extremely well in 2015. Netflix, for instance, plummeted 8.6 percent on Wednesday. Amazon declined 5.8 percent. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index ended down 3.4 percent.Stocks of consumer companies whose products or services are considered nonessential were among the hardest hit on Wednesday. Shares of the hotel chain Marriott closed down 6.3 percent, while Royal Caribbean Cruises ended down 5.3 percent.The market decline has been broad and even some of Wall Street\u2019s most successful and sophisticated investors have not been spared the downturn. William A. Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square Holdings, for example, has already lost 11.4 percent through Jan. 12In this fraught environment, investors are looking for any early clues on how the global economy is performing. They are now scouring the fourth-quarter earnings of large companies, which are starting to come out.\u201cThe low gas prices, the low commodity prices, the strength of the dollar \u2014 all three of those together are really pushing,\u201d he said.Investors will most likely listen carefully to the earnings calls of the large banks, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo included, that will report results on Thursday and Friday.Since the financial crisis of 2008, the major banks have built up buffers that help them withstand turbulent markets. But their earnings are always vulnerable if consumers and companies demand fewer loans and struggle to pay back existing ones. Senior bank executives most likely will be called upon to give their impressions of financial conditions.If the stock market continues to fall and deplete households\u2019 savings, consumers may then pull back on their spending, which can weigh on the economy. Already this year, the value of the companies in the S.&P. 500 has fallen by $1.3 trillion, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.Still, the selling may pass. Many Wall Street analysts say there are reasons a bear market \u2014 a decline of more than 20 percent from a high \u2014 will not occur. Stocks, they say, aren\u2019t wildly overvalued. Jobs growth in the United States is starting to create competition for hiring, which could push up wages, giving consumers more money to spend. Europe appears to have stabilized.But few analysts are expecting a big bounce in the stock market. Investors may now have to get used to lower returns from stocks, after several years of strong gains.\u201cWe believe this year is going to look very much like 2001, 2002,\u201d said Mark Yusko, the chief investment officer at Morgan Creek Capital Management. \u201cPeople forget the markets basically went down for 30 months and the economy slowed and eventually went into a mini-recession.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the decline in the Dow. It closed down 9.9 percent on Wednesday from its most recent high, not 10 percent or more, which would have put it in correction territory.Stanley Reed and Alexandra Stevenson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "So Far, Amazon and Netflix Are Sundance\u2019s Top Buyers", "Date": "2016-01-25", "News": "Supported byPARK CITY, Utah \u2014 It was the independent film equivalent of a crack of thunder.\u201cWe\u2019re interested in distinctive films by artists who have something new and interesting to say,\u201d said Roy Price, head of Amazon Studios.The streaming service shopping spree does not just reflect the ability of these deep-pocketed insurgents to outspend the entrenched studios. Filmmakers, once dismissive of streaming companies, have been looking at the struggling art-house box office and deciding that getting their work seen by the widest possible audience \u2014 while being handsomely paid, of course \u2014 may be what matters most.\u201cYou always want your film to be shown on a big screen with perfect sound and the best projection,\u201d said Sian Heder, who wrote and directed \u201cTallulah,\u201d a comedic drama that had its premiere here on Saturday and sold to Netflix for about $5 million. \u201cBut that\u2019s not always the reality anymore. The way that people consume media is changing.\u201dA look at select films screening at the Sundance Film Festival.In other words, Mr. Price\u2019s Sundance purchases will arrive on the Amazon Prime streaming platform only after playing in theaters (for varying periods).In addition to buying \u201cTallulah,\u201d which stars Ellen Page and Allison Janney, Netflix paid $7 million for the global streaming rights to \u201cThe Fundamentals of Caring,\u201d a Sundance road movie starring Paul Rudd, Craig Roberts and Selena Gomez. Other Netflix purchases include \u201cUnder the Shadow,\u201d a horror movie set in Iran.\u201cWe\u2019re in the market for enjoyable films that have a great creative vision and that we can show to our members in 190 countries,\u201d said Jonathan Friedland, Netflix\u2019s chief communications officer.Roadside Attractions, co-founded by Howard Cohen and Eric d\u2019Arbeloff, will work with Amazon to distribute \u201cLove & Friendship\u201d in theaters. \u201cThe theatrical model continues to have a lot of value, especially because it means something to viewers when films play in theaters,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. In his view, releasing films simultaneously in theaters and on video-on-demand platforms, streaming or otherwise, leaves consumers with a bad impression. \u201cIt has somehow become a signal that the movie isn\u2019t any good,\u201d he said.A decade ago, before the digital entertainment boom vastly expanded viewing options, independent films were routinely able to break through in theaters. \u201cLittle Miss Sunshine,\u201d for instance, bought at Sundance in 2006 by Fox Searchlight, collected about $70 million at theaters in North America, after adjusting for inflation. At its widest release, the movie played in 1,602 locations.But smaller films today are having a more difficult time selling tickets. Now, a movie like \u201cBrooklyn\u201d is considered a success. Fox Searchlight bought it at Sundance last year and it has taken in about $27.5 million since its release in November, playing in 906 theaters at its peak. Of the films sold at Sundance in 2015, only a handful took in more than $1 million at the domestic box office.As a result, some sales agents say, traditional distributors are being more selective at Sundance. \u201cEvery year we have a little bit of that syndrome,\u201d said Jessica Lacy, head of independent and international film at ICM Partners. \u201cThis time around, the breakout potential of some films in the lineup is not as obvious. That can be challenging for a traditional studio as it tries to figure out what deals make sense.\u201dMs. Lacy continued, \u201cThat said, there are still quite a few promising films to debut.\u201d A premiere is scheduled on Tuesday, for instance, for \u201cThe Intervention,\u201d about a fumbled attempt by a group of friends to halt a marriage.\u201cThe market is a bit slower this year than last, but that is also because filmmaker teams have to sort through more options and decide what\u2019s most important to them,\u201d said Paul Davidson, senior vice president for film and television at the Orchard, an entertainment company known for movies like \u201cCartel Land,\u201d an Oscar-nominated documentary. \u201cFor some, it\u2019s the largest check,\u201d Mr. Davidson said. \u201cFor some, it\u2019s a real theatrical release.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Little Walmart Gift Card for You, a Big Payout for Lawyers", "Date": "2016-01-30", "News": "Supported byThe HagglerIn this episode, we learn a new definition of the word \u201cgift\u201d and plumb the meaning of the word \u201ccoupon.\u201d No, you don\u2019t need a dictionary. But a sense of humor might help.Q. A few months ago, I received an email from Walmart with the header:\u201cOnline DVD Rental Settlement has sent you a $12.32 eGift Card for Walmart.\u201dIn the body of the message it said, \u201cWe hope you enjoy your gift!\u201dThis is obviously a payment, compelled by a judge or arbitrator, for some kind of misconduct. But there is no mention of what exactly Walmart did wrong. Would you agree that it is a little galling that Walmart has framed this penalty as a gift?JOHN FRIZELL, MANHATTANA. Mr. Frizell, it turns out, was part of a very interesting class-action lawsuit, filed in 2009. The suit emerged from a deal that Walmart and Netflix cut with each other in 2005. That year, the companies announced \u201ca joint promotional agreement.\u201d Under it, Walmart abandoned the market for rental DVDs, which was Netflix\u2019s strong suit, and Netflix exited the market for the sale of DVDs, which was Walmart\u2019s strong suit.At the time, the Netflix chief executive, Reed Hastings, cast this as something that was great for consumers, because it provided them with \u201ceven more choice and convenience.\u201dYes! It was terribly inconvenient when these two companies competed. Do you remember? Of course not. Your mind was addled. The options hurt your brain.But some people weren\u2019t grateful for this convenience. They claimed in the lawsuit that the deal resulted in artificially high Netflix subscription prices. Netflix refused to settle and won on summary judgment. (To be clear, this means a judge found the suit so meritless that it wasn\u2019t worthy of a trial.) Walmart decided not to fight and in 2011, the company settled with the plaintiffs for just over $27 million.Claimants \u2014 anyone with a Netflix subscription to rent DVDs online, from May 2005 to September 2011 \u2014 were given the option of receiving either a check for a little more than $12 or a gift card worth a little more than $12.Appeals court delays held up the distribution of the booty, which is why Mr. Frizell doesn\u2019t recall opting for the gift card, which he did in 2011. But the long wait aside, the settlement raises questions about the appropriate way to resolve such matters. For some insights, the Haggler called Ted Frank, a regular and vocal critic of the terms of class-action deals and a lawyer at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a Washington nonprofit organization.Mr. Frank filed a legal objection to this settlement, arguing that the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers enriched themselves to the detriment of consumers. To begin with, he said that claimants were steered toward the gift card because they could request it online. To get a check, they had to send a snail mail letter.Now, note that the gift card is not called a coupon, even though it sounds, to the Haggler\u2019s na\u00efve ears, a lot like a coupon. Who cares what it\u2019s called? It turns out that plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers care because of the Class Action Fairness Act (CAFA), passed by Congress in 2005. Part of the point of the act was to reduce the number of exceptionally lame mass settlements, some of which were described in a Senate Judiciary Committee report at the time. The Haggler\u2019s favorite: $55 off on the purchase of a crib from a company that was accused of making defective cribs.CAFA addressed coupons. One of its stipulations was that in coupon cases, lawyers would be paid based on the number of people who actually redeemed coupons instead of the number of people who were eligible for those coupons.The point is to incentivize plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers. Typically, lawyers get 25 percent of a total settlement in such cases. So the more relief they deliver to consumers, the more the lawyers earn.Unfortunately, that 2005 law did not define \u201ccoupon.\u201d Oops. In the Walmart case, a Federal District Court judge ruled that what was offered in the settlement was not a coupon, for a few reasons. Among them: The gift cards were transferable, and they had no expiration date.This was good news for the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers. They could collect a quarter of the value of the gift cards that were sent to consumers who asked for them \u2014 which totaled $8.9 million \u2014 not a quarter of the value of the cards that were actually used.So how many of those gift cards have been cashed in? We don\u2019t know. That information has not been publicly revealed, Mr. Frank said. And the lead lawyers\u2019 firm for the plaintiffs in the case, BakerHostetler \u2014 a firm that apparently can\u2019t afford a space between its names \u2014 declined the Haggler\u2019s request for an interview.Here is what is known. Enough consumers asked for checks via snail mail to yield $5 million in relief. The plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers were awarded $6.8 million in fees. They also got $1.7 million in expenses, but let\u2019s leave that aside. Using the $6.8 million figure, the lawyers could say, \u201cSee, we got the standard 25 percent fee,\u201d because $6.8 million is about one-quarter of $27 million.The more the Haggler learned about this case, the more it sounded as though the lawyers for Walmart and those for the plaintiffs had devised a settlement that would pump up fees for the latter while limiting outlays from the former.The key is the gift cards. They help raise the final settlement figure \u2014 in this case to $27 million \u2014 which delights the plaintiffs\u2019 side. And Walmart is happy because when people use gift cards, the company sells at retail prices stuff that it has acquired at wholesale prices. (A $12 T-shirt, for instance, costs Walmart a fraction of that sum.) People who receive checks for $12, on the other hand, can spend that money anywhere they like. In short, they cost Walmart the full $12.And that\u2019s if the cards are redeemed at all.\u201cThis is the way to maximize the illusion of relief,\u201d Mr. Frank said.And this case is positively pro-consumer compared with others. Mr. Frank pointed to a Duracell case, filed in 2012, that ended with these terms: $6 million for charity, $5.7 million for plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers and a mere $345,000 for consumers. (The case is under appeal, so no one has been paid yet.) The reason the consumer side is so meager is that less than 1 percent of the 7.2 million class members actually submitted for reimbursement. But the lawyers\u2019 fees were calculated based on the $43 million that could have been disbursed if all eligible consumers had asked for a $6 check.Everybody won!O.K., not everybody.Advertisement"}

(Nominations will be announced Thursday; voting closed last week.)Television losers included HBO, which was nominated for seven awards but only managed to take home one \u2014 Oscar Isaac won for \u201cShow Me a Hero\u201d \u2014 and the streaming services Netflix (eight nominations, zero wins) and Amazon, which saw \u201cTransparent\u201d blanked.Amazon\u2019s \u201cMozart in the Jungle,\u201d however, about a charming New York conductor, did find surprisingly strong support among voters, who have a history of backing shows that have yet to pop. The series won best comedy \u2014 dethroning \u201cTransparent\u201d \u2014 and Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal won best comedic actor. He was one of the (very) few minority winners on Sunday.Television awards consumed most of the first half of the ceremony, with USA\u2019s fledgling \u201cMr. Robot\u201d winning the Globe for best drama, beating the HBO juggernaut \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d Christian Slater won best supporting actor for the series, which peers into the dark corners of the Internet.On the film side, \u201cSteve Jobs,\u201d which flopped at the box office, was a repeat winner. Kate Winslet won supporting actress for her portrayal of an Apple marketing executive, while Aaron Sorkin collected the Globe for best screenplay.Unlike last year\u2019s Globes, when stars and filmmakers made a grand show of their support for free speech and civil rights, winners for the most part kept things light. \u201cCookies for everyone tonight!\u201d shouted Taraji P. Henson, a winner for best actress in a television drama. (She plays Cookie on Fox\u2019s \u201cEmpire.\u201d) Jon Hamm won best actor for \u201cMad Men,\u201d which concluded its celebrated run last year.Jennifer Lawrence, thanking her \u201cJoy\u201d director David O. Russell, swiftly collected a Globe \u2014 her third, at the age of 25 \u2014 for best comedic actress. Matt Damon, in a widely expected win, was named best actor in a film comedy or musical for \u201cThe Martian.\u201d \u201cI know how lucky I am to do this for a living,\u201d said a smiling Mr. Damon, whom Mr. Gervais had introduced earlier in the show as \u201dthe only person Ben Affleck hasn\u2019t been unfaithful to.\u201dSpreading their prizes around, as is their custom, the press association gave Brie Larson best actress in a drama for playing a mother and kidnapping victim in \u201cRoom.\u201dHungary\u2019s \u201cSon of Saul,\u201d set at a Nazi death camp, was awarded best foreign film, as expected. \u201cThe Hateful Eight\u201d took the Globe for best score; Quentin Tarantino, the film\u2019s director, accepted the award on behalf of the composer Ennio Morricone. The best song Globe went to Sam Smith and Jimmy Napes for \u201cWriting\u2019s on the Wall,\u201d from the latest James Bond movie.Denzel Washington, winning the Cecil B. DeMille lifetime achievement prize, took the stage saying that he had lost his speech. He finally found it, thanking the press association, his wife and his agents, past and present, before becoming unable to read his notes and trying (unsuccessfully) to borrow a pair of glasses.\u201cGod bless you all,\u201d he said, hurrying off the stage.Sunday\u2019s ceremony, broadcast on NBC from the ballroom of the Beverly Hilton hotel, will be scrutinized for clues about the Oscar race, but the truth is that the Globes are often predictive of little.Last year, \u201cBoyhood\u201d and \u201cThe Grand Budapest Hotel\u201d took the top Golden Globes. Oscar voters selected \u201cBirdman\u201d as best picture. Globe voters are also notoriously quirky; this year, for instance, they rather bizarrely classified \u201cThe Martian\u201d as a comedy.Globe nominations were announced before \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens\u201d was screened, so that blockbuster\u2019s absence on Sunday said nothing about its Oscar prospects. A snub last Tuesday by the Producers Guild of America, which did not count \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d among 10 best picture nominees, was perhaps more telling. But the Producers Guild also left out the Weinstein Company\u2019s \u201cCarol.\u201dBehind the scenes, stylists spent last week fretting about weather. Rainstorms started pounding the Los Angeles area on Tuesday, threatening a repeat of the 2010 Globes ceremony, when the red carpet turned into a lake and golf umbrellas and bedraggled assistants became the accessories of choice. On Sunday the weather was chilly for Los Angeles (mid-50s) and overcast.Inside the hotel, waiters scrambled to serve dinners that went largely uneaten, at least at the starrier tables. (On the menu: \u201csalt-baked heirloom sweet potatoes with creamed corn glaze.\u201d) Once upon a time, the Globes were a boozy spectacle, but most nominees \u2014 heeding the scolding eyes of their handlers \u2014 also avoided the plentifully available Mo\u00ebt & Chandon Champagne. One exception: Mr. DiCaprio, a best actor nominee, who arrived and knocked back a Ruby Red, a brightly colored mixture of Champagne and vodka.As ever, the ceremony\u2019s success will be determined by the Nielsen ratings. Last year, about 19.3 million people watched the Globes telecast, a 7 percent decline from 2014. Among adults 18 to 49, the group that advertisers pay a premium to reach, viewership fell by 11 percent. (NBC aggressively promoted the show in recent weeks, even though it was the only broadcast network not to receive a single nomination. Awkward.)Mr. Gervais, who hosted the Globes for three consecutive years starting in 2010, has previously said that he would like to host the Oscars. But an unwritten rule has generally kept the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences from employing an M.C. who has sharpened his or her teeth at the competing Globes.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Making a Murderer\u2019 Left Out Crucial Facts, Prosecutor Says", "Date": "2016-01-05", "News": "Supported byThe 10-part series, by the filmmakers Laura Ricciardi and Moira Demos, depicts a true-crime saga that seethes with troubling questions over whether Steven Avery, a Wisconsin man convicted of the 2005 murder of a young woman, was framed by law enforcement officials.The series \u201creally presents misinformation,\u201d Mr. Kratz said in an interview on Monday.He portrayed the program as a tool of Mr. Avery\u2019s defense and accused the filmmakers of intentionally withholding facts that would lead viewers to see his guilt.Much less than a dispassionate portrayal of the case, the film is a result of the filmmakers\u2019 \u201cagenda\u201d to portray Mr. Avery as innocent and stoke public outrage, Mr. Kratz said. \u201cThat is absolutely what they wanted to happen,\u201d he added.Ms. Ricciardi, Ms. Demos and one of Mr. Avery\u2019s lawyers, Dean Strang, disputed Mr. Kratz\u2019s remarks in interviews on Monday, arguing that the documentary couldn\u2019t have included every facet of the case.\u201cOur opinion is that we included the state\u2019s most compelling evidence,\u201d Ms. Ricciardi said.Mr. Strang echoed that view. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to watch a 600-hour movie of gavel-to-gavel, unedited coverage of a trial,\u201d he said.\u201cMaking a Murderer\u201d has given rise to an army of armchair detectives since its release the week before Christmas. Ten years in the making, the film tracks the legal troubles of Mr. Avery, the part owner of an auto salvage yard who, in 2003, was freed after 18 years in prison when DNA evidence cleared him in a 1985 sexual assault.He later sued Manitowoc County, Wis., officials for $36 million. Then in 2005, shortly after several county officials were deposed over their handling of evidence in the case, Mr. Avery was accused once again. This time, he was charged with the murder of Teresa Halbach, a 25-year-old photographer who had visited his property to take pictures of a vehicle for Auto Trader magazine.In 2007, Mr. Avery was convicted and sentenced to life in prison without parole. The same year, his 16-year-old nephew, Brendan Dassey, was convicted of participating in the murder as well as the sexual assault of Ms. Halbach. He is serving life with the possibility of early release in 2048.The documentary impugns the criminal justice system\u2019s pursuit of Mr. Avery and Mr. Dassey at nearly every turn, pointing the finger at investigators, prosecutors and a defense lawyer who was assigned to Mr. Dassey.The most explosive contention comes from Mr. Avery\u2019s defense team \u2014 that law enforcement officials planted evidence to frame him.On Monday, Mr. Kratz called the scenario \u201cnonsense,\u201d and he said the jury in Mr. Avery\u2019s trial considered evidence either left out or glossed over by the filmmakers.That evidence included DNA from Mr. Avery\u2019s sweat found on a latch under the hood of Ms. Halbach\u2019s Toyota RAV4, a discovery made by investigators after they were led there by Mr. Dassey, Mr. Kratz said.Mr. Avery\u2019s blood was found inside Ms. Halbach\u2019s vehicle, and the documentary explains the defense theory that it could have been planted there by officers who had access to a vial of his blood. Sweat, however, never came up.\u201cHow do you get Avery\u2019s sweat underneath a hood latch of a vehicle?\u201d Mr. Kratz said. \u201cThat is completely inconsistent with any kind of planting.\u201dMr. Kratz also said a bullet with Ms. Halbach\u2019s DNA on it found in Mr. Avery\u2019s garage was matched to a rifle that hung over Mr. Avery\u2019s bed. The gun was confiscated when officers searched his trailer on Nov. 5, 2005, and the bullet was found in the garage in March 2006, Mr. Kratz said.\u201cIf they planted it, how did they get a bullet that was shot from Avery\u2019s gun before Nov. 5?\u201d he said.Mr. Strang, the defense attorney, said on Monday that the DNA found under the hood was never identified as sweat and that its presence did not require that Mr. Avery touched the car. And bullet fragments were all over the property, where the family often shot guns. That Ms. Halbach\u2019s DNA was on the bullet \u201creally didn\u2019t move the needle one way or another,\u201d Mr. Strang said.Mr. Kratz acknowledged some missteps in the handling of Mr. Avery\u2019s case, saying he wished the Manitowoc County sheriff\u2019s deputies had been less involved in the investigation. \u201cThat made the case a little more challenging for me, because I certainly took every step to keep those people out of it,\u201d he said.He also expressed regret about a news conference he held when Mr. Dassey was charged in early 2006. The documentary portrayed the prosecutor\u2019s lurid description of the rape and murder of Ms. Halbach in front of a bank of news microphones as polluting the potential juror pool.Mr. Kratz thought, at the time, that it was important to refute accusations of wrongdoing by law enforcement officers, he said.\u201cIn retrospect, I wish I would have simply released the complaint and allowed the media to cover that however they wanted to,\u201d he said.\u201cHe was uniquely positioned to take us and viewers from one extreme of the American criminal justice system to the other,\u201d she said.Ms. Ricciardi rejected the accusations of bias from Mr. Kratz, saying that his refusal to be interviewed for the documentary rendered them baseless. Mr. Kratz, who resigned as prosecutor in 2010, said he declined to participate because he did not believe the film would be impartial.\u201cSteven Avery committed this murder and this mutilation, and Steven Avery is exactly where he needs to be,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t have any qualms about that, nor do I lose any sleep over that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "F.C.C. Proposes Changes in Cable Set-Top Box Market", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The cable set-top box, long a scourge of consumers and a moneymaker for cable companies, appears set for a makeover.The move could have broad implications for the industry, allowing Google, Amazon and Apple, for instance, to expand their footprints in the media industry with devices that would blend Internet and cable programming in a way the television industry has resisted. The reactions on Wednesday reflected those possibilities: The technology industry widely cheered the proposal, while the cable industry criticized it.The F.C.C., though, said its focus was on improving people\u2019s television experience. The clunky technology of cable boxes, and the burdensome requirements of long-term contracts, have long been a source of customer complaints. Tech companies like Apple and Amazon make devices that connect to televisions and have new interfaces, but they provide streaming Internet video and do not replace the cable box.The F.C.C. said the agency\u2019s five commissioners would vote on the proposal on Feb. 18. The proposal will most likely have the support of the three Democratic commissioners, including Mr. Wheeler, and will be opposed by the two Republican commissioners.Tech companies have pushed a vision of TV viewing that would look and feel more like a smartphone interaction, with users selecting and using apps rather than scrolling through hundreds of channels on cable TV. Netflix and Amazon have also challenged the industry head-on, offering original programming and streaming-video packages that have led consumers to cut their cable subscriptions all together.The proposed rule would require cable and satellite providers to give device makers access to cable and satellite programming. While that is possible today, cable and satellite companies often impose restrictions on third-party device makers. As a result, there has been a virtual lock on the set-top box market by cable and satellite companies, with 99 percent of their users leasing one or more boxes from them.\u201cConsumer choice should fuel the video box market, not cable company control,\u201d Senator Markey said on Wednesday. \u201cI commend Chairman Wheeler for his proposal to help ensure that consumers are not captive to bloated rental fees forever.\u201dSenior officials at the agency said the plan would not affect contracts between cable and media companies. Consumers would still have to pay their satellite and cable provider for their programming. The cable bundle, in which people pay for dozens or hundreds of stations or none at all, is expected to remain in place.Still, media executives expressed concern that the change could undermine the foundation of their businesses. The concern is that the new arrangement could negate contracts between cable companies and entertainment companies, in which the cable companies pay television groups billions of dollars a year for the rights to distribute programming. Those contracts stipulate how the programming can be distributed, for instance, whether it is included in video-on-demand packages, how it is branded, certain copyright protections and the treatment of advertising.The executives said the proposal could allow a new set of companies, like Google or Apple, to step in to distribute and sell ads in and around television programming that they neither paid to create, or license. A set-top box can control the flow of data on users\u2019 viewing habits, the sort of information that is at the heart of Google\u2019s business.\u201cDistributors will be forced to reconsider what they pay for programs that can be siphoned off, repackaged and resold, drying up the revenue needed to underwrite quality shows,\u201d said Alfred C. Liggins, the chief executive of TV One, a digital cable and satellite network that serves 57 million households. \u201cThese arrangements \u2014 including critical terms such as channel placement, advertising, scheduling and more \u2014 are the lifeblood of the video marketplace today.\u201dAt the same time, television networks like HBO, Showtime and CBS have introduced a range of \u00e0 la carte offerings that allow people to subscribe to an individual network without paying for the full cable bundle.Efforts to hand over programming to tech firms would \u201cslam the brakes on this progress and harm consumers,\u201d Nomi Bergman, president of Bright House Networks, said. \u201cIt\u2019s the ultimate example of the government trying to fix something that isn\u2019t broken.\u201dTrade groups representing Google, Amazon and TiVo say the set-top-box industry would inject fresh competition into the TV market, leading to more options and lower prices for consumers. Mr. Wheeler, who has favored rules that support streaming-video providers, is expected to act with haste to make sure the rules are adopted before he leaves his job. His term could end next year. If approved, consumers will most immediately see its effects in their pocketbooks, advocates say. They could start using just one device to access video content \u2014 whether it be Internet streaming or cable television.Marta Tellado, president and chief executive of Consumer Reports, said the changes were long overdue.\u201cWith the ever-increasing price of cable and all of the advances in technology,\u201d she said, \u201cwhy should consumers have to keep renting a set-top box?\u201dCecilia Kang reported from Washington, and Emily Steel from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Killing Fields,\u2019 on Discovery, Examines a Cold Case", "Date": "2016-01-04", "News": "Supported byRather than the re-examination of a conviction (like \u201cMaking a Murderer\u201d and the first season of \u201cSerial\u201d) or the profiling and seduction of a suspect (\u201cThe Jinx\u201d), \u201cKilling Fields\u201d is a more ordinary television exercise \u2014 the reopening of a cold case, specifically a 19-year-old unsolved murder in Iberville Parish, La.To set itself apart, it\u2019s adopted two conceits. One is a focus on places, like the Louisiana bayous, reputed to be especially suited for dumping bodies. The more important wrinkle is that the show follows the investigation \u201clive\u201d \u2014 in the first episode, as the case is being reopened, we\u2019re told that we\u2019re seeing events that took place just 21 weeks ago.Perhaps because of the demands of that schedule, or perhaps because this is Discovery rather than HBO or Netflix, \u201cKilling Fields\u201d relies on the kind of obviously staged or at least partly artificial action that typifies the reality-TV end of true crime. The team of investigators holds meetings, tracks down witnesses and waits tensely for DNA results, always with an awkward consciousness of the hovering cameras.The effect, as with so many reality shows, is to lower the emotional stakes and to take the tenor of the action in the direction of fiction, as the real-life actors ape the moves, attitudes and rhetoric they\u2019ve learned from crime dramas. That \u201cKilling Fields,\u201d at least by its second episode, begins to generate some whodunit interest may trace back to two of its executive producers, Tom Fontana and Barry Levinson, who worked together on \u201cHomicide: Life on the Street\u201d and \u201cOz.\u201dIt\u2019s also unclear, through two episodes, how the show will reconcile what seems to be a significant issue: Most of the drama is provided by new testimony and clues that Rodie Sanchez, the veteran detective, apparently didn\u2019t uncover when he first investigated the case in 1997. Each discovery piques your curiosity and seems to dent Mr. Sanchez\u2019s credibility at the same time, a contradiction that isn\u2019t addressed. He may have some explaining to do before the season ends.Advertisement"}

Who tinkered with Ms. Bee\u2019s phone so that whenever she types the name \u201cJason\u201d it comes out \u201cI want to marry Ted Cruz\u201d?And how should Ms. Bee deal with the fact that when \u201cFull Frontal\u201d has its premiere, it will be the only late-night satire program currently hosted by a woman, and one of very few in the decades-long history of the genre to feature a female star?Can she embrace her role as a barrier-breaking performer and provide late-night TV with the diversity it desperately lacks, even though she is not trying to tailor her show for women, and does not expect anyone to watch simply because she has two X chromosomes?Just as she did on \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d Ms. Bee, 46, a deceptively upbeat comedian, was meeting these challenges with cheerfulness tempered by a sarcastic streak.Ms. Bee said wryly that, as an ambassador for her gender: \u201cI think I get immunity from prosecution. I can murder someone.\u201dMore seriously, she said she was ignoring any preconceptions, good or bad, that an audience might have about a female host.\u201cWhen I wake up panicking at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s because I\u2019m thinking about how best to do the show, not worrying about those external forces.\u201dNo one who knows her previous work, she said, will \u201clook at this piece and go, \u2018Hold on a minute \u2014 where are the Kim Kardashian jokes?\u2019\u201dBut being funny is not Ms. Bee\u2019s only goal for \u201cFull Frontal.\u201d Now that she can create her own show from the ground up, she said it would be hypocritical if she and her colleagues failed to hire the inclusive staff they had always wanted to see.\u201cIt actually takes a lot of effort to change things,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing process, and it has to just be a part of your mental state.\u201dThere is a baseline level of incestuousness that Ms. Bee cannot avoid in her field. She will record \u201cFull Frontal\u201d at a West Side studio shared with John Oliver\u2019s \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d on HBO; and her offices, located over a car dealership, previously belonged to Stephen Colbert and his CBS \u201cLate Show\u201d team before they moved into the Ed Sullivan Theater.(The portrait in Ms. Bee\u2019s private office, depicting a shirtless Vladimir Putin riding a bear, was her own decorating choice.)Like her friendly competitors Mr. Oliver and Mr. Colbert, Ms. Bee, a Toronto-born comedian and actress with a blithe delivery and seemingly no self-consciousness, came to prominence on \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d when Jon Stewart hosted that Comedy Central program.\u201cA lot of performers will not go as far as she\u2019s willing to go,\u201d said Mr. Jones, a fellow \u201cDaily Show\u201d alum and the father of their three children, who are 10, 7 and 5.\u201cShe can go into a room where no one knows who she is,\u201d he said, \u201ceven if a couple jokes don\u2019t land that well, and win people over by talking normally and having a conversation with people.\u201dIt quickly occurred to executives at TBS, which has Conan O\u2019Brien\u2019s talk show \u201cConan\u201d but is still struggling to be known for more than reruns of \u201cSeinfeld\u201d and \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d that Ms. Bee could play a bigger role for them.\u201cWe were talking about being more in touch with current events, being part of the cultural conversation,\u201d said Kevin Reilly, the president of TBS and TNT and chief creative officer for Turner Entertainment.What Ms. Bee offered, Mr. Reilly said, was a recognizable, well-liked personality and a savvy perspective, as well as a proven aptitude for finding comedy in the everyday world.\u201cShe\u2019s not going to be strapped behind a desk, doing commentary on the news,\u201d he said. \u201cShe likes to get into the field and talk to people.\u201dMs. Bee\u2019s gender, Mr. Reilly said, was not the core of the show. \u201cThat\u2019s a trough you can only feed from for so long, if everything is about that,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s honestly too smart and has too much to say.\u201dOf course, she said, she thought about being offered Mr. Stewart\u2019s former seat. \u201cIt\u2019s not like it wasn\u2019t in my brain, but it didn\u2019t stay there for long,\u201d she said.\u201cI loved \u2018The Daily Show,\u2019\u201d she added. \u201cBut it is a machine that\u2019s already running.

My heart started to speed up.\u201dMs. Bee had saved on her phone an image that Mr. Kahn had created of her as a tattooed centaur with laser beams shooting from her eyes (\u201cI just liked to look at it, and it made me laugh,\u201d she explained). From the cider-doughnut hut at the pumpkin patch, she contacted Mr. Kahn and asked him to digitally insert the image into the Vanity Fair photograph.The visual retort became a social-media sensation, and Ms. Bee said she felt her message \u2014 tongue-in-cheek, but sincere in its desire for more equal representation \u2014 had been embraced.\u201cIt lifted my spirits so much, to feel like there\u2019s a whole community of people who would like to do things differently,\u201d she said. \u201cIt struck a nerve, and I was really happy that it did.\u201dOther experienced late-night writers and producers say that for as often as the lack of diversity in their field is talked about, little progress has been made, even when new shows were introduced last year.\u201cWriting for late night is the closest TV gets to a Civil Service job, so there\u2019s not a lot of turnover,\u201d said Nell Scovell, a former writer for David Letterman and now a co-executive producer of ABC\u2019s \u201cThe Muppets.\u201dMs. Scovell specifically pointed to CBS\u2019s \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert\u201d and \u201cThe Late Late Show With James Corden\u201d as programs that were restarted from scratch but neglected women.\u201cThe talent is out there,\u201d she said, \u201cso late-night shows need to stop saying, \u2018Diversity is a priority\u2019 and instead make it a reality.\u201dLizz Winstead, who created \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d with Madeleine Smithberg, said that despite the success of shows like \u201cBroad City\u201d and \u201cInside Amy Schumer,\u201d \u201cthere\u2019s still an undercurrent, at networks and studios, that anything that comes from a lens of quote-unquote other will not be accepted by white male viewers.\u201d\u201cThen,\u201d she said, \u201cit will be glaring when a writers\u2019 room is dominated by one gender, one color. Until that happens, we\u2019re still going to see disparity.\u201dMs. Miller and Mr. Kahn, who were hired from \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d by Ms. Bee to work with her on \u201cFull Frontal,\u201d said that they encountered diversity issues at Comedy Central, and that these problems were bigger than any individual program.Now the show runner of \u201cFull Frontal,\u201d Ms. Miller said that at \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d whenever its departing college interns were asked if they wanted to continue in the industry, the responses always broke down along gender lines.\u201cIt\u2019s always, \u2018I\u2019m Kyle \u2013 yeah, I\u2019m going to be a writer,\u2019\u201d Ms. Miller said. \u201c\u2018I\u2019m John, I want to be a writer.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m Melinda, I don\u2019t know, maybe. I\u2019m not really good enough. Maybe someday.\u201dMs. Miller added: \u201cSomewhere in between the unearned overconfidence of the young men, and the unwarranted self-censorship of the young women, the truth lies. None of you are good enough yet, but apply and you\u2019ll get better.\u201dThe \u201cFull Frontal\u201d producers used a blind submissions process to hire new writers, meaning that they did not know the names or backgrounds of the people whose material they were reading.Ms. Miller went a further step by creating an application packet for prospective writers to show them what their submissions should look like \u2014 what formatting, margins, abbreviations and lingo to use \u2014 so that no one would be penalized for inexperience.\u201cIf you\u2019re outside looking in, you can\u2019t crack the code of how it\u2019s made,\u201d Ms. Miller said. \u201cYou have to crack the code for them. Then you\u2019re just reading the jokes and the content.\u201dMr. Kahn, who oversees the field-producing staff at \u201cFull Frontal\u201d (and who describes himself as the \u201ctoken Jewish white executive producer here\u201d), said that he also made concerted efforts to find new contributors who might not think of themselves as late-night comedians.\u201cI talked to really interesting people who, frankly, weren\u2019t white guys, to say, \u2018Who do you like \u2013 who\u2019s new and up-and-coming that I don\u2019t know about, who\u2019s not in this world?\u2019\u201d Mr. Kahn said.\u201cI didn\u2019t want just my viewpoint,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t have just my viewpoint. My viewpoint\u2019s well represented.\u201dMs. Bee said that the gender breakdown of the \u201cFull Frontal\u201d writing staff was 50-50 female and male; a December staff meeting observed by a reporter was attended by about two dozen people, and appeared equally divided between men and women.\u201cShe speaks fluent Arabic, and she\u2019s traveled in the Middle East,\u201d Mr. Kahn said. \u201cWe\u2019re already talking about doing a story in Jordan. She\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, yeah, I\u2019ve been there.\u2019\u201dNo matter whom it hires, \u201cFull Frontal\u201d will ultimately rise or fall on Ms. Bee, who is more obsessive and single-minded about the task of creating the program than her carefree comedic persona might suggest.At the editing session for her V.A. hospitals segment, she would often dictate her changes aloud, with her eyes closed and a hand pressed to her temple, as if she could already see the show in her mind\u2019s eye. She said she has been jotting down notes to herself pretty much around the clock, even in her early-morning SoulCycle classes, when she\u2019s supposed to be composing inspirational messages.But just because Ms. Bee is fixated on the task at hand does not necessarily mean she is nervous about it.Speaking from her corner office, she said: \u201cMaybe I should be more panicky about it, but I actually feel pretty mellow. I\u2019m really confident.\u201dThen again, she added, \u201cIf you look down this row of offices, there is a bottle of alcohol in every single desk.\u201dThe show\u2019s format, she said, is still a work in progress but is likely to feature a mix of \u201cbig headlines,\u201d field pieces (featuring Ms. Bee as well as other contributors) and other \u201cgrab bag\u201d segments.\u201cWe are still putting ideas and research into our little buckets,\u201d she said.Mr. Reilly of TBS said that he expected it would take time for \u201cFull Frontal\u201d and Ms. Bee to hone their voices. \u201cThat\u2019s the nature of these shows,\u201d he said. \u201cAt a certain point, you\u2019ve got to put it on its feet and work it out as you go, and they evolve.\u201d\u201cI have a high degree of certainty we\u2019re going to succeed,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I can tell you, she\u2019s not going to err on the side of being too safe.\u201dMs. Bee was giving her own explanation of the sensibilities of \u201cFull Frontal\u201d when something caught her attention. She glanced at the transom window above her door and saw a maintenance worker perched high on a ladder, his rear end pointed directly at the glass.\u201cThere it is,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the show.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Even the gays seemed to have their own event: They followed Madonna.At the W party Thursday night at Chateau Marmont, Cate Blanchett barely made it up in the elevator. Rooney Mara, her co-star from the movie \u201cCarol,\u201d was in the penthouse, posing for photographers in front of black-and-white images from Lynn Hirschberg\u2019s Hollywood issue. Nearby were her fellow nominees Brie Larson and Alicia Vikander.Two years ago, Ms. Blanchett won the Academy Award for her role in \u201cBlue Jasmine\u201d and delivered a speech lamenting the state of things for actresses in Hollywood. This year, there\u2019s so much competition in her category that studio chiefs can barely see straight.\u201cI have Cate Blanchett in \u2018Truth,\u2019 and I\u2019m competing against Cate Blanchett in \u2018Carol,\u2019\u201d said Michael Barker, co-president of Sony Pictures Classics, as he scanned the room. \u201cI have Alicia Vikander in \u2018Testament of Youth.\u2019 She\u2019s in eight other movies.\u201dThankfully, there were free drinks to be had and gossip to be exchanged, much of which centered not on the race to the Oscars, but the status of a former Hollywood couple who have been spending time together.We are referring, of course, to Madonna and Sean Penn.For months, the former spouses had been getting close. Entertainment reporters were hearing reports that they were back together and that she was due to appear at the annual fund-raiser for Mr. Penn\u2019s Haiti charity J/P HRO as his date.It turned out to be a surreal evening. On Saturday night, Mr. Penn and his former wife were hand in hand at the Montage hotel in Beverly Hills, looking every bit like the Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor of 2016.\u201cMadonna, what brought you out?\u201d Marc Malkin of E! screamed out.\u201cHaiti!\u201d she said, rushing in.Inside, guests strained to read about El Chapo on their cellphones and check out the couple at the center table. Then, Mr. Penn got down on one knee from the stage, to audible gasps from the crowd. Was he proposing, or punking the news media at a very moment when everyone wanted to know more about his interview with Mr. Guzm\u00e1n?A few seconds later, Madonna came onstage with a ukulele, gave her former husband a kiss on the cheek and delivered a speech.\u201cI want to say, Sean, that I love you from the moment that I laid eyes on you,\u201d she said, \u201cand I still love you just the same. I just wish you would stop smoking so many cigarettes.\u201dThe next day, another couple prompted plenty of chatter: Rupert Murdoch and the former model Jerry Hall showed up together at the Golden Globes ceremony itself at the Beverly Hilton.And they weren\u2019t the only ones who left their seats during the ceremony. By the time Lady Gaga won a Globe for her performance in \u201cAmerican Horror Story,\u201d there were fewer people watching the show inside the Hilton than hanging out by the bar.A fan walked up to Aziz Ansari and told him he was rooting for him and his Netflix show, \u201cMaster of None.\u201d \u201cThanks,\u201d Mr. Ansari said. \u201cI already lost.\u201dWhen the ceremony finally concluded, celebrities spilled out into the hotel\u2019s lobby, which was carved into different after-parties, each with their own scanners and multiple security checkpoints.At HBO\u2019s party, Larry David was at the bar looking like a king. A few feet away were Judd Apatow and Viola Davis.Down the hall at InStyle/Warner Bros. were Taraji P. Henson and the seven-time InStyle cover girl Kate Hudson.Over at the Weinstein Company/Netflix party, a tropical vibe prevailed, with plush furniture and more orchids than anyone could count. Mr. Ansari and the host of the Globes, Ricky Gervais, sat on banquettes in the back. On sofas in the front were Quentin Tarantino and Les Moonves.Photographers screamed out to Ms. Blanchett, who posed for photos, and then headed off into the night with her husband, the theater director Andrew Upton. \u201cWe\u2019re going on a date,\u201d she said.They were not headed to the InStyle party across the street, but were grabbing a bite after which they planned to make an appearance at Creative Artists Agency\u2019s bash at the Sunset Tower Hotel.And one by one, that\u2019s where the cool kids went, including Julianne Moore, Jennifer Lawrence, Leonardo DiCaprio, Michael Fassbender, Ms. Vikander and Helen Mirren.This was the party for a different clique, the one actually looking forward to graduation. Befitting its status, no photographers were allowed inside.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Many Workers, Staying Home Is Not an Option During Blizzard", "Date": "2016-01-23", "News": "Supported byThere were the workers who boarded a Manhattan-bound subway train before sunrise in boots and denim shirts, looking for a place to sit between the men sprawled out and sleeping on the benches who had no other place to spend the night.There was the bartender waiting and waiting at a bus stop in Queens who was considering giving up and calling his boss to say he could not come in. And there was the superintendent of an apartment building who is usually off on Saturdays but was outside the building, the wind hitting his face, as he tried and failed to make a dent with his shovel in the accumulating snow.\u201cThe snow took my day off,\u201d said Krzysztof Prostko, 58, who had been working at the building on the Upper West Side since 7 a.m.For many, the storm could not be more perfectly timed. The snow started falling in force early Saturday, making for a weekend of bundling up at home and catching up on novels neglected on the bedside table or working through a backlog of films on Netflix. School was not a concern, and for many 9-to-5 professionals, neither was work.But this is New York City, where the grind never stops.On the streets on Saturday, pushing their way through wind-driven snow, were police officers and snowplow drivers, restaurant workers and store clerks \u2014 all headed to work, if not already on the job. For them, staying in was not an option.A satellite image from NASA shows the extent of the huge winter storm that blanketed the East Coast with snow on Saturday.In the morning, Melanie Castillo, a registered nurse, waited in the snow on 96th Street and Broadway for a crosstown bus that would take her to work at a pediatric clinic on Lexington Avenue. She had come from the Bronx.Ms. Castillo, 26, was scheduled for a 12-hour shift. \u201cHopefully, we\u2019ll close early,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get stuck there.\u201dAt the same bus stop, Rick Azar, who works in real estate, was running late for an appointment. He had a meeting scheduled for 8 a.m. with clients to show them a property in Harlem. He checked his watch: 8:02. His bus still had not come.\u201cThey were supposed to leave today, but I doubt that will happen,\u201d Mr. Azar, 58, said of the clients, who were visiting the city from Savannah, Ga. \u201cAnd with this weather, we\u2019ll see if they come back.\u201dUmberto Soto, who works at a liquor store on the Upper West Side, had been fielding orders from customers all morning. Some of them were only a few blocks away. \u201cWe\u2019re so close,\u201d Mr. Soto said, \u201cbut they still want it delivered.\u201dBut he could not be too critical. He had ordered a delivery of his own: coffee and a breakfast sandwich from a 24-hour Mexican restaurant nearby.\u201cAre you riding your bicycle today?\u201d Mr. Soto, 58, speaking in Spanish, asked the delivery man.\u201cNo,\u201d the man replied, rubbing his gloved hands together. \u201cToday, I\u2019m walking.\u201dAt the Church of the Holy Name of Jesus on the Upper West Side, Jason Garcia, 29, was part of the maintenance crew tasked with the futile job of clearing the rapidly falling snow. \u201cEvery chance you got to get inside, you\u2019d go warm up, then head back out,\u201d he said, wiping the snow from his gloves.\u201cAt least our boss is buying us lunch,\u201d he added.By the late morning, officials said that bus lines in the city would shut down in the afternoon. The conditions on the street had deteriorated too much.At La Guardia Airport, workers who had shown up on Saturday worried how they would get home, and some sneaked away early so they could catch one of the last buses. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t see it on the news,\u201d said one worker, who did not want to be named because he left without permission, \u201cI\u2019d be in a wrap.\u201d He did not know of any other way to get home.As the storm intensified, officials announced that service on elevated subway lines, as well as on trains carrying commuters out of the city, would be suspended. A travel ban was imposed to keep drivers off the road.Nate Schweber contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As \u2018The X-Files\u2019 Returns, Do We Still Want to Believe?", "Date": "2016-01-21", "News": "Supported byIN 2002, after 202 episodes of government conspiracies, bright lights in the sky, black oil, creepy monsters and sexual tension, \u201cThe X-Files\u201d said goodbye. On Sunday on Fox, the F.B.I. agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) return for a six-part mini-series.The New York Times TV critics James Poniewozik and Mike Hale emailed over encrypted lines from undisclosed locations to discuss the new series and the legacy of the original.Not at first, not at all. The first episode is called \u201cMy Struggle,\u201d which aptly describes the experience of sitting through it. It lumbers. It plods. The actors chew sawdusty mouthfuls of expository dialogue. It introduces an Alex-Jones-like conspiracy-talk-show host (Joel McHale), who\u2019s meant to be played straight but comes off like parody. Above all, it\u2019s handicapped by the fact that it has to tear down much of the show\u2019s mythology and construct a new one in an hour. It\u2019s like rebuilding a sports car just to back it down the driveway.Test your knowledge of \u201cX-Files\u201d monsters-of-the-week in this interactive quiz.Thankfully, the second episode shakes the dourness and gives Mulder and Scully more room to breathe. But it\u2019s the third \u2014 a comic palate-cleanser in the \u201cmonster of the week\u201d vein \u2014 that finally recreates the show\u2019s oddball delights. As Scully says, in one of the script\u2019s many meta comments, \u201cI forgot how much fun these cases could be.\u201d She\u2019s right. Still, while \u201cThe X-Files\u201d has a great legacy \u2014 on serial TV, on sci-fi and, thematically, on television at large \u2014 I wonder if its time has passed. Has the show changed, or have we?To your question: \u201cThe X-Files\u201d was a show about a certain mode of fear and style of conspiracy, and in the 14 years since it ended our culture has been overtaken by a new, more grim, more literal sense of fear. (The last season started on Nov. 11, 2001.) In the opening episode, the extended U.F.O. history lesson feels like a wrongheaded attempt to explain what all the excitement used to be about. In the exponentially better second and third episodes, the writers mostly ignore the time lapse, except to poke fun at Mulder\u2019s incompetence with personal electronics. They\u2019re confident that the show\u2019s structure still stands up.As a fan I loved the self-referentiality of the third episode \u2014 my favorite line was probably Mulder\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m just looking for some internal logic\u201d \u2014 but as a critic I wondered how interesting the episode would be for someone who hadn\u2019t watched the show before. It was really heavy on the in-jokes. Did that bother you at all? Does it matter?Which is interesting, because there\u2019s something very prebinge about its structure \u2014 a ratio of a couple of stand-alone episodes for every mythology episode. That\u2019s very much an artifact of the TV business of the \u201990s. Before Netflix, before \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d before \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d (from Vince Gilligan of \u201cThe X-Files\u201d), complicated serial TV was considered a risk. (\u201cTwin Peaks\u201d was an exception, but also a cautionary tale.) Before DVRs and streaming made catching up easier, you might permanently lose viewers every time they missed an episode, so older TV was aimed at making every installment accessible to a brand-new audience. \u201cThe X-Files,\u201d appropriately, was a DNA-engineered hybrid. Part of the time it was a complex sci-fi saga. Other times, it was an anthology \u2014 part \u201cTwilight Zone,\u201d part buddy-cop show. It contributed to the show\u2019s surreal atmosphere, but I wonder if Mr. Carter would make the same show starting today \u2014 if an \u201cX-Files\u201d of 2016 would be \u201cLost\u201d or \u201cBlack Mirror.\u201dAnother thing I appreciated about that third episode (titled \u201cMulder and Scully Meet the Were-Monster\u201d) was that it allowed Mr. Duchovny and Ms. Anderson to be a little silly. Humor, and those actors\u2019 comic talents, were an important ingredient in the mix of the original series that gets overlooked. Mr. Duchovny, especially, is a natural comedian with a genius for self-deprecation. He still gives just the right note of innocent vanity to a line like: \u201cI\u2019m a middle-aged man, Scully. No, I am.\u201d Like you, I\u2019ve forgotten a lot, but it\u2019s my sense that in general, mythology worked against humor \u2014 the serialized episodes had a severity to them, a \u201cwe\u2019re being serious now\u201d tone.When the new episodes work, it\u2019s because Mulder and Scully work. One thing I like about the new stand-alone episodes is that they\u2019re not entirely static; they carry the weight of history between these characters. (Oh yeah, remember that they had a kid together?) Even the lighter third episode reminds us how experience has changed their perspectives. Mulder has been burned enough to be dubious, while Scully has seen enough to be open to the impossible.It\u2019s especially good to see Ms. Anderson, such a beacon of intensity in \u201cThe Fall,\u201d get to flex her dry humor again. When she pulls an obscure fact out of thin air, as Scully is wont to do, she shrugs it off in a way that both acknowledges how much time has passed and tells us the important things haven\u2019t changed. \u201cI\u2019m old school, Mulder,\u201d she says. \u201cPre-Google.\u201dMany shows have tried to follow the \u201cX-Files\u201d template to one degree or another, but they\u2019re always missing that Mulder-Scully umami. \u201cFringe\u201d tried to reconstitute it with Anna Torv and Joshua Jackson as an F.B.I. agent and a skeptical civilian. \u201cSupernatural\u201d cut women out of the equation and made the show\u2019s demon hunters two brothers whose devotion was to each other.Chris Carter was reviving a television tradition of science-fiction-inflected horror (or horror-inflected science fiction) that ran from \u201cThe Twilight Zone\u201d to \u201cNight Gallery\u201d to \u201cKolchak: The Night Stalker,\u201d but his and his writers\u2019 great contribution was the addition of flirtatiousness and genuine adult emotion to the mix. The legacy of \u201cThe X-Files\u201d may be that it made TV hospitable again to a range of genre shows after the sitcom domination of the 1980s, helping pave the way for future fantasists like J. J. Abrams and Joss Whedon. But when it was at its best, the show was equal parts suspense, horror, science fiction \u2014 and romance.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Roller Coaster Year Ends With U.S. Markets Mostly Down", "Date": "2015-12-31", "News": "Supported byInvestors may be disappointed with the lackluster performance of the United States stock market in 2015, but, given all that happened, it could have been worse.It was a year when corporate earnings underwhelmed, Greece nearly crashed out of the euro, China carried out a shock devaluation of its currency, the price of oil slumped and the Federal Reserve increased interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.After its close on Thursday, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index finished the year down 0.73 percent. The performance was well below the solid gains of the last three years.But the index was still up 63 percent over the last five years. What is more, the stock market was able to bounce back from a summer rout that dragged the S.&P. 500 more than 10 percent below the nominal high it reached in May. After reinvesting dividends, the benchmark was up 2.35 percent in 2015.\u201cI don\u2019t remember a year where there were so many roller coasters along the way,\u201d said David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff. \u201cThe whole year was like a giant theme park.\u201dIn short, after many months of low volatility in the markets, the convulsions of 2015 were a jarring reminder that investing in stocks can be a risky business. And while plenty of analysts on Wall Street have relatively optimistic forecasts for 2016, many of the forces that upset markets in 2015 \u2014 like uncertainties about currencies and commodities and the potentially chilling effect of higher interest rates \u2014 could continue to buffet markets.The S.&P. 500 on Thursday fell 19.42 points, or 0.94 percent, to close at 2,043.94. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 178.84 points, or 1.02 percent, leaving it down 2.2 percent for the year, its first annual decline since 2008. The technology-heavy Nasdaq index did better than the other two benchmarks in 2015, rising 5.73 percent for the year.And technology firms were among the top performers in 2015.Shares in Netflix, which continues to add subscribers at a fast pace, were the biggest gainer in the S.&.P 500 index in 2015, soaring 133 percent. Amazon\u2019s stock was the second-best performer, more than doubling in 2015 as the company surprised investors with stronger profits. In contrast, Walmart, its bricks-and-mortar rival, dropped 29 percent.Lower oil and gas prices hurt the prospects of energy companies. This caused the energy companies within the S.&P. 500 to lose nearly one-fourth of their value in 2015.The pain in the oil and gas sector also caused stress in the junk bond market, where energy companies have borrowed huge amounts in recent years. The prices of junk bonds fell over 10 percent in 2015, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch\u2019s United States high-yield master index.The selling in the more speculative reaches of the credit markets is a sign that several years of speculation, brought about by ultralow interest rates, may now be unwinding. Some analysts expect the shakeout to intensify.\u201cHigh-yield credit is going to get a lot worse,\u201d said Atul Lele, chief investment officer at Deltec International, an investment firm. He also thinks emerging markets, where stock markets fell steeply in 2015, will continue to suffer in 2016, as companies in developing countries struggle to repay dollars that they borrowed in recent years. \u201cThe problem is that they are going to be defaulting on U.S. dollar debt and they don\u2019t have the dollar liquidity,\u201d Mr. Lele said.The crucial question is whether the United States economy can continue growing at around its current rate as the Fed raises interest rates. Away from the stock market, there were indications that investors are not confident about the outlook for the economy. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note might have been expected to rise considerably in 2015 as the economy grew and unemployment fell. Yet the note closed on Thursday with a yield of 2.27 percent, barely higher than the 2.17 percent at the end of 2014.Likewise, the price of oil, as measured by the benchmark United States crude contract in New York, fell by nearly a third in 2015. Some analysts saw the plunge as a portent of weak global growth, since it might indicate that companies are buying less oil to fuel their operations.Yet despite such indicators, many analysts said they saw activity within the United States economy that could keep it growing at a moderate pace. For instance, they said, United States consumers, benefiting from potentially higher wages and lower energy costs, could gain further confidence in 2016. While higher wages might dent profit margins for firms, higher spending by consumers could also bolster sales for certain companies. \u201cNext year is going to be the year of the wage breakout,\u201d said Mr. Rosenberg, the strategist. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be a pervasive theme.\u201dGloomier stock market watchers, however, said that problems they perceived in the global economy would most likely deepen in 2016, undermining the United States\u2019 recovery and the country\u2019s stock market. In their view, the monetary stimulus of the world\u2019s central banks has been of limited effectiveness. As a result, countries are choosing to let their currencies fall as a way of stoking their exports and thus their economies. The starkest example of this occurred in August, when China shocked the world by letting its long-stable currency, the renminbi, devalue slightly.As others have devalued, the United States dollar has strengthened. This can hurt companies based in the United States in two ways. They might find it harder to export and they might have to sell their goods at lower prices within the United States to compete with foreign firms. Their profits would suffer as result, and the deflationary forces in the economy might gain strength. To the bearish analysts, the devaluations and the problems they cause are an indication that policy makers are running out of ideas.\u201cI look around the world and see financial markets believing that the authorities are in control \u2014 but they are not,\u201d said Albert Edwards, a strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale in London.The bulls, of course, scoff at such pessimism. But even they say the days of indiscriminately buying stocks and watching them go up are over for now. Many of the financial moves that companies have recently deployed to increase profits \u2014 like stock buybacks and borrowing at ever-lower interest rates \u2014 may become harder to carry out.\u201cThe era of throwing a dart against the wall, of the rising tide lifting all boats, is behind us,\u201d Mr. Rosenberg said, \u201cYou\u2019ll have to do more homework in the coming year.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sundance Fights Tide With Films Like \u2018The Birth of a Nation\u2019", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Supported byCritic's NotebookPARK CITY, Utah \u2014 Art and industry are still slugging it out at the Sundance Film Festival. That\u2019s true even if you no longer hear many anguished discussions about the meaning of independent cinema. These days, chatter about distribution deals, a movie\u2019s commercial potential and even if a title will be in play at the next Academy Awards tends to drown out meaningful discussions of cinema and whether independence can be quantified by vision, spirit, money or some ineluctable combination of these. Then again, given how thoroughly the industry has colonized the festival (as the clusters of agents at screenings suggest), anguishing about it can feel like misplaced nostalgia.It\u2019s also pointless because no matter how much the industry and its media minions seem determined to turn Sundance into a snowy exurb of Hollywood, the festival continues to push against the mainstream tide through some of its selections. Each January, there are titles here that rise above the noise, reminding you why Sundance, now 32, remains crucial for many. This is where worlds and cinema open up, whether in a documentary about the first girl in Mongolia to hunt with a golden eagle (\u201cThe Eagle Huntress,\u201d a bliss-out) or a movie that finds the American director Kelly Reichardt giving Kristen Stewart a role and a burger to sink into with \u201cCertain Women,\u201d whose western characters are as stubbornly self-determined as this undersung filmmaker.By turns affecting and frustrating, \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d has a scale and ambition too rarely seen in most directorial debuts at Sundance. It has moments of power, but also longueurs and some unfortunate visual choices. And as the story unfolds, it becomes difficult to parse its political and theological arguments. Although the authenticity of \u201cThe Confessions\u201d remains in dispute, Turner seems to have seen himself as a religious prophet. It\u2019s a view that the movie shares by turning Turner (Mr. Parker) into an avenging Christ figure who rises from a crucifix-like whipping post to take up an ax that\u2019s soon slicked with blood. For the most part, Mr. Parker tempers the violence both of slavery in its everyday existential horror and of the revolt (the rebels kill only men), choices that feel commercially expedient.\u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d shook the festival up, which is always welcome, although only partly because of the real history it revisits. Like every movie, this one is defined by its moment in time, which means that its premiere took place amid the continuing, fractious uproar over Hollywood and its lack of real diversity. Although much of this recent discussion has been spurred by this year\u2019s Oscar contenders (all of the acting nominees are white), the issues are far greater and more enduring than the industry\u2019s annual Saturnalia of self-congratulation. As boldly suggested by Mr. Parker\u2019s appropriation of the title \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d \u2014 a reference to D. W. Griffith\u2019s 1915 racist landmark \u2014 the history of American cinema is undeniably also a history of white supremacy.Movies like \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d are helping to write the next chapter of American cinema. And, to an extent, that\u2019s true of Sundance at its best. This is, after all, a festival that makes room for experimental narratives like \u201cDark Night,\u201d Tim Sutton\u2019s drifty, conceptual exploration of a mass shooting, alongside documentaries ready-made for television (\u201cUnder the Gun,\u201d Stephanie Soechtig\u2019s look at gun policies and politics briskly narrated by Katie Couric). It\u2019s also where numerous selections pass the Bechdel test (movies like the very fine \u201cChristine\u201d and \u201cSand Storm,\u201d in which two women talk to each other about something besides a man) and, in honor of the director and Sundance alumna Ava DuVernay, what might be called the DuVernay test, in which African-Americans and other minorities have fully realized lives rather than serve as scenery in white stories.Among the titles that pass the DuVernay test are \u201cMorris From America,\u201d Chad Hartigan\u2019s at times rather perilously cute story about a 13-year-old African-American boy (Markees Christmas as the title character) whose father (an appealingly gruff Craig Robinson) works as a soccer coach in a blindingly, at times intolerantly, white German city. Mr. Hartigan tends to oversell the uplift, perhaps in an attempt to reach a larger audience than he did with his last feature, \u201cThis Is Martin Bonner.\u201d But he also produces moments of tenderness and wistful charm, as in a scene in which Morris and the casually unkind older girl he likes share a bench in front of an elaborate stone fountain that suddenly erupts, creating a cascade that\u2019s at once slyly sexual and a representation of Morris\u2019s flooding emotion.\u201cMorris\u201d will make its way into American theaters, and it\u2019s likely that so, too, will many other selections. The major studios and companies may dominate the box office, but the demand for streaming product means that scores of off-Hollywood titles will probably find an audience, if only on a television or computer near you. Two of the biggest players in the streaming world are Amazon and Netflix, both of which have been creating a great deal of movie-business turmoil, including at festivals. Netflix went after \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d hard (losing to Fox Searchlight), while Amazon picked up Kenneth Lonergan\u2019s rapturously received \u201cManchester by the Sea.\u201d Largely set in a town north of Boston and girded by a moving, lapidary performance from Casey Affleck as a broken man, the movie showcases Mr. Lonergan\u2019s gift with actors and for dialogue that ebbs, flows and stings like life.Like some of my other favorite movies at Sundance this year, \u201cKiki\u201d and \u201cUncle Howard\u201d seem unlikely to find the kinds of larger, mass reception that many at this festival might wish for. Every movie is made for an audience, of course, but one of the pleasures of Sundance is that it remains a place for the kind of non-mainstream work that hasn\u2019t been produced to scoop up viewers by the millions. This is where one day you can watch \u201cWild,\u201d a terrifically original German fiction film from Nicolette Krebitz about a woman and her wolf and next day watch an eagle land on the arm of a girl (Otto Bell\u2019s \u201cThe Eagle Huntress\u201d). For women, for minorities, for those seeking something different, it can be hard to love movies, because they don\u2019t always love us back. Sundance makes it easier.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cable Acquisitions by Charter Communications Face Rising Opposition", "Date": "2016-01-21", "News": "Supported byComcast\u2019s failed $45 billion merger with Time Warner Cable collapsed last year under pressure from regulators, who found that the combined company would have had both the power and incentive to inhibit the future of streaming video.Now, as rival Charter Communications seeks approval for its $67.1 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, critics point to the same potential for harm.\u201cIf Comcast\u2019s deal for Time Warner Cable was a Category 5 hurricane, Charter-Time Warner is a Category 4,\u201d said Jeff Blum, deputy general counsel of Dish Network, the satellite television provider. Mr. Blum made his comments during a conference call Thursday held by a coalition of companies, advocacy and industry groups publicizing the potential harms of Charter\u2019s takeover bid. If approved, the proposed merger would create a powerful new force in the country\u2019s broadband market. The combined company would rank as the country\u2019s second-largest broadband provider behind Comcast with about 19.4 million subscribers, and the country\u2019s No. 3 video provider with 17.3 million customers, across about 40 states. That increased heft is coming under close scrutiny as federal regulators continue their review of the Charter deals. If approved, the merger would most likely include strong conditions meant to prevent Charter from leveraging its market power to hurt rival streaming services, regulatory experts said. With increased clout, for instance, the company could restrict television networks from selling their content through stand-alone streaming services. Charter, which already has announced a number of commitments related to the merger, has extra incentive to agree to conditions. Time Warner Cable would receive a breakup fee of up to $2 billion if the transaction falls apart. The company received nothing when Comcast walked away from its deal.Another prominent issue is the role and influence of John C. Malone, the media mogul whose company Liberty Broadband would hold a 20 percent stake in a reconstituted Charter. Some groups have called for regulators to place restrictions on the involvement of Mr. Malone, saying that his interests in entertainment companies \u2014 including Discovery Communications and Starz \u2014 could represent untenable conflicts. Whit Clay, a spokesman for the Liberty businesses, declined to comment.Charter has argued that its deals pose no threat to the online video market because the future of its business depends more on broadband than its legacy video business. Alex Dudley, a Charter spokesman, said in a statement that the company is committed to creating American jobs, offering innovative products, faster Internet speeds, preserving an open Internet and online video with no data caps or modem fees.\u201cIt should come as no surprise that Dish and other parties seeking to use the regulatory review process to extract concessions are also engaging in tired P.R. tactics to further their self-interests,\u201d Mr. Dudley said in a statement. \u201cTheir arguments against the pending transactions are baseless.\u201dFederal regulators declined to discuss their reviews of Charter\u2019s proposed merger with Time Warner Cable and Bright House. But in recent months, antitrust officials have provided some insight into their priorities when considering cable mergers. Central to their analysis has been whether bigger cable firms \u2014 with strong bargaining power with programmers and fast-growing broadband Internet businesses \u2014 could harm their newest threat: streaming video providers like Netflix and Hulu. In a September speech, Jonathan Sallet, the general counsel for the Federal Communications Commission, said that the agency focused on the streaming companies in its decision to reject Comcast\u2019s bid for Time Warner Cable.The biggest concern was how a combined cable giant, with more than half of the high-speed Internet market and a major portion of the cable video market, could pressure programmers to keep their best content off online video services that competed with cable TV. Such market concentration over distribution would have given the company too much of an incentive to do so, Mr. Sallet said.\u201cSimply put, the core concern came down to whether the merged firm would have an increased incentive and ability to safeguard its integrated Pay TV business model,\u201d Mr. Sallet said in the speech at a telecom policy conference.Announced a month after Comcast aborted its bid last spring, Charter\u2019s proposed acquisitions have been the target of significantly less backlash than the Comcast merger, which would have united the two largest cable operators in the country.\u201cThat means that we, Hulu, Amazon and others can compete on an open basis,\u201d Mr. Hastings said. \u201cWe think it would be a huge step forward for U.S. policy\u201d for streaming services.Yet criticism of the deal has escalated in recent weeks as a number of media and technology companies, public interest groups and other organizations stepped forward to voice concerns over Charter\u2019s proposed acquisitions.In a meeting with F.C.C. officials last week, for example, executives from the media giant Time Warner said that public and private statements by Charter executives suggested that the deal could deter the development of streaming video options to the detriment of consumers. Dish, one of the most vocal opponents, has urged regulators to reject the proposed merger; its new Sling TV video service, which offers streaming television without a traditional cable or satellite subscription, is one of the offerings that could be harmed.Dish has joined other opponents of the deal to form a new Stop Mega Cable coalition, which wants to raise awareness of the harms that could result from the deal, including increased costs and worse service for customers. In addition to Dish, members of the coalition include the public interest group Public Knowledge and industry trade group USTelecom \u2014 The Broadband Association, and Consumers Union, the advocacy arm of Consumer Reports.\u201cWe want to make sure that the very dangers that enforcers were willing to challenge in the Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger are not allowed to go forward through a second company that can coordinate with Comcast,\u201d Gene Kimmelman, chief executive of Public Knowledge and a former antitrust official at the Justice Department, said on the conference call Thursday. \u201cThere is the danger of coordination on one side,\u201d he added in an interview later. \u201cBut the opportunity here, through the right enforcement requirements, is to actually push for a new business model. That won\u2019t happen automatically. It will have to be pressured.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Building a Network for Virtual Reality", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "MENLO PARK, Calif. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 When Facebook releases its fourth-quarter earnings results on Wednesday, it is likely to announce it shows well over eight billion videos a day. It is certainly a big number, but video is most likely a means to an end for Facebook.Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, says he believes virtual reality will become a widespread computing platform that includes communications, artificial intelligence and voice-activated interactions. He bought Oculus Rift, the maker of virtual reality goggles, for $2 billion to capitalize on that potential.Video is a building block toward that virtual reality work.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a shift happening in the business,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jay Parikh, vice president of engineering. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFacebook started with text, then photos showed up. Now there are phones always with you with good cameras. People can capture more of their lives in a real times way, much more expressively than a photo and a caption.\u00e2\u0080\u009dPresumably, these immersive videos will also hold the attention of high-value advertisers.Building out a network that can handle this load of dense video costs billions of dollars, however. And that is before running a big virtual reality system.But Mr. Zuckerberg faced a similar challenge when he built Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s global computer network and is now following a similar playbook.Facebook is adept at open sourcing, or donating for public use, technologies like computer hardware. Much the way open-source software sped development of so-called cloud computing, open-source hardware meant more engineers tackling problems like computer server design.It is now video\u00e2\u0080\u0099s turn. Last Thursday, Facebook held at its headquarters an all-day event for about 300 engineers from video-related companies like Netflix, Yahoo, Akamai and even YouTube. Facebook talked about technologies in virtual reality, streaming and artificial intelligence related to video.\u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom our experience, innovation happens faster in the open,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Parikh said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEverything we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing in video, live-streaming, 360, all the technology we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing in our network, our data centers \u2014 that is all heading towards having these experiences in virtual reality.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFacebook is also looking at ways to make its 360 technology cheaper and more accessible, possibly even within a smartphone. Mr. Parikh declined to comment on these moves.Facebook also wants to get an even bigger global audience by lowering the cost of connecting to the Internet. While computers run lots of open source hardware and software, related gear in telecommunications has tended to be proprietary and expensive.On Wednesday, the Open Compute Project, the hardware design sharing group, announced it would move into open sourcing telecommunications gear. AT&T, Verizon and Deutsche Telekom were among the companies signing up.\u00e2\u0080\u009cA lot of Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story going forward will be making hardware and software work together with greater efficiency,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jason Taylor, who is Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vice president of infrastructure and the president of the Open Compute Project. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not interested in being a telecom operator, but in our mission to connect the world we need everyone to come together.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFollowAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Despite the CES Hype, It\u2019s Better to Wait on That 4K TV", "Date": "2016-01-05", "News": "Supported byTech FixMy advice: Wait at least another year or two before buying it \u2014 the hype and the TV sets themselves.Keep that bottom line in mind as you hear more about 4K TV, named for the high-definition resolution display. Plenty of announcements about the technology are on tap this week at International CES, the consumer electronics show in Las Vegas that is one of the tech industry\u2019s largest trade shows. The high-definition televisions will be a featured attraction at the four-day event, alongside virtual reality devices, drones and new smartphones.But after interviewing several technology companies and testing a premium Samsung 4K TV for more than a week, I was less than convinced that 2016 would be a good year to buy one of the sets. Televisions with the 4K feature remain expensive, ranging from $1,000 to tens of thousands of dollars. More important, the content available in the new 4K video resolution is sparse. And while images encoded in 4K do look better than normal high-definition ones, the differences aren\u2019t jaw-dropping.Still, even with more 4K content coming, the higher resolution may not be worth it. In my tests, I compared Samsung\u2019s flagship 4K television, the JS9500, which costs $4,500, side by side with my three-year-old Panasonic 1080p plasma TV. On the 4K version of \u201cJerry Maguire,\u201d I could see some details that were lost in the 1080p version, such as Cuba Gooding Jr.\u2019s pores, along with some details in the shadows of his face and horizontal lines on a television screen showing a football game. In other words, not breathtaking.More profound differences could be seen in newer content that was produced with 4K in mind, like Amazon\u2019s TV series \u201cMozart in the Jungle.\u201d The colors in that show looked especially vibrant and vivid, and the picture was noticeably clearer in 4K than in 1080p. Amazon declined to make an executive available for comment on its 4K offerings.A telltale sign that it\u2019s too early to buy a fancy television is you still won\u2019t be able to enjoy arguably the biggest show on television in ultra high definition: \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d Jeff Cusson, a spokesman for HBO, which airs the show, said the company had \u201cno plans at this time\u201d to begin supporting 4K content. So fans who were hoping to gaze at the pores of characters like Daenerys Targaryen this year are out of luck. Other popular HBO shows like \u201cGirls,\u201d \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d and the \u201cThe Leftovers\u201d will not be offered in 4K either.\u201c4K adoption has been phenomenally quick,\u201d said Dave Das, a Samsung executive, in an interview. \u201cAdoption has been as fast, or faster, than when we launched 1080p.\u201dSamsung estimates that altogether there are now 800 titles to watch in Ultra HD. Mr. Das said Samsung this quarter would begin selling its first 4K-capable Blu-ray players, which will give consumers another avenue for obtaining 4K content other than streaming.At CES, all the big TV manufacturers, including Sony, Samsung and Panasonic, are highlighting their 4K televisions. Many new sets this year will include high dynamic range. Samsung on Tuesday promoted its next flagship TV, the KS9500, which it says delivers the most realistic color range it has ever offered. Roku, the TV streaming device maker, said on Monday that it was working with TV manufacturers to introduce 60 Ultra HD television sets including Roku\u2019s software this year.And there is new branding for 4K television sets, too. The TVs that include high dynamic range will be called Ultra HD Premium. The Consumer Technology Association, a trade group that represents the electronics industry, said on Monday that the new specification would help consumers understand the differences between various Ultra HD technologies and navigate the growing marketplace.If you\u2019re happy with your current high-definition TV, do yourself a favor and wait at least a year or two before buying an Ultra HD television. By then, there should be plenty more 4K content to watch. Plus TV prices drop rapidly as their features become more commoditized \u2014 if you buy a 4K television set today, a TV with the same features will probably cost less than $1,000 in 2017 or 2018.Advertisement"}

He had worked late into the evening, and a December rain was coming down hard.As 9 p.m. approached, he was still in his workplace on West 14th Street, seated in a leather swivel chair.If he really wanted to do something, he added, he could walk up the street, get drunk somewhere and meet someone.\u201cBut I\u2019m going to wake up with a headache,\u201d he said, \u201cand I don\u2019t want that.\u201dMr. Choffel, a hairstylist whose clients include Sharon Stone, Fergie and numerous fashion models, was seated in his salon. There was nothing stopping him from going to a club. But here he was, thinking about what was missing from his life.\u201cWhen you\u2019re 27, there\u2019s no tomorrow,\u201d Mr. Choffel said. \u201cAt 42, today\u2019s tomorrow. Going home to kids and a family, you\u2019re creating something. You\u2019re building something.\u201dHe is not alone in his increasing distaste for a life that many married men would say they envy. With the freedom has come certain costs: isolation, regret and the feeling that, although you may still feel 25 in your heart, your knees are starting to ache and the years are slipping by fast.Full disclosure: My answer to each of Ms. Avgitidis\u2019s questions was \u201cyes.\u201dIt\u2019s hard to find someone who wants to be that guy. Although few single men are willing to admit to a sense of panic, they know there is always the chance of waking up one morning in a cold sweat.Friends will tell you not to worry. They will cite Tinder and the other magical dating apps hidden in your phone while arguing that you are only a swipe away from sudden cocktails and possibly more.But the single men in their 30s and 40s whom I spoke with \u2014 gay and straight alike \u2014 seemed very much aware that their options were narrowing. While they are not dealing with a reproductive deadline, they had the feeling that the party was nearing its end.\u201cPeople think that if you are gay and you are single, particularly in the city, that there is this sort of unbridled freedom,\u201d said Ryan Wallace, a 35-year-old who works in corporate communications for a Fortune 200 company. \u201cThat you\u2019re at the gym, you\u2019re at the office, you\u2019re at happy hour, and it\u2019s just a constant on-the-go lifestyle. That may be true for part of your life, in your 20s. Gender identities aside, as everyone gets older, your priorities change.\u201dThere may be perfectly good reasons that some men who went to college during the Clinton presidency have held on to singledom. Aside from taking pleasure in the feeling of moving untethered through the years, they may have wanted to make sure their careers were on track before starting a family during a rocky economic period.But what if the moment you finally feel financially secure comes too late? And what if focusing on building a solid career is a pretext for avoiding the big stuff?\u201cI\u2019m still at work,\u201d said Jonathan Lee, an internal auditor at an international bank who lives on the Upper East Side. \u201cThat says a lot.\u201dIt was nearly 8 p.m. Mr. Lee said things had been hectic lately, with his work hours reaching close to 60 a week.\u201cIt\u2019s not healthy,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I do have a sense of regret. I\u2019m definitely underdeveloped, in terms of dating and relationships, and these are things that take skill and know-how you only get through experience. I just turned 40. Thinking about the math, the longer I wait to start my own family, you start to think, \u2018When I consider someone to marry, I have to find someone young enough to have children. And the age difference. What\u2019s acceptable? What\u2019s O.K.? What doesn\u2019t work?\u2019 There are a lot more challenges the older you get, and I realize that now.\u201dMr. Lee and Mr. Choffel, the hairstylist, share little in the way of experience and worldview.While Mr. Choffel partied his way through his 20s as he climbed toward the peak of his profession, Mr. Lee, who described himself as a devout Christian, tended his career and avoided the weeknight bar scene. Yet both aspire to fatherhood, even as they worry that it may be getting late.The same holds true for Scott Slattery, a 35-year-old communications and marketing consultant in Manhattan.Asked if the recent deluge of weddings among those who have taken advantage of the legality of same-sex marriage in New York since 2011 has left him feeling pressed to find the right man, Mr. Slattery said, \u201cI think the pressure is more an age issue than anything like a gay issue.\u201dIn other words, he doesn\u2019t want to be far removed from his youth when he becomes a father.\u201cI would like to be a parent,\u201d Mr. Slattery said. \u201cLuckily, I don\u2019t have to have the kid. But I still want to take care of them through their entire lives, so I don\u2019t want to be old.\u201dIt seems that no single man can make it through his 30s without feeling a pang of regret for the life he could be having, even if it conflicts with his desire to do exactly what he wants all day long.\u201cI used to be terrified of having kids (and I still am to some extent),\u201d Alan Yang, who created the show with Mr. Ansari, wrote in an email. \u201cMy sister had a baby a couple of years ago, and the completely adorable nature of my niece has slowly started to change my mind. But it\u2019s still unbelievably scary. You\u2019re going from someone who is completely self-centered to someone for whom there\u2019s something more important than yourself and your own dumb everyday wants.\u201dHe started dragging himself to gatherings that he would have avoided at another time in his life: art exhibits, cocktail parties and work events where he might meet new people.One rainy Saturday in 2014, after having woken up still exhausted from the night before, he pulled himself out of bed for a wine and cheese party held by friends of friends in Park Slope.Once there, among the married couples, he spotted a woman named Maria Cabo whom he had met briefly once before. With the party winding down, Mr. Gollash worked up his courage and walked across the room, where she was seated with other women, all of them speaking Spanish. Not long after, while texting with her, he asked if she would like their first date to be in the Canary Islands, where he was scheduled to give a talk. Ms. Cabo replied with a photo of a swimsuit with a passport.They were married last May and are now the parents of a baby girl, Greta.\u201cOne of the ironies or lousy parts of getting older is that you do have less energy,\u201d Mr. Gollash said from a hotel suite in Madrid, where he was staying with his wife and daughter. \u201cDating always requires a lot of energy. When you are in your 20s, you have an abundance of it, right? So you can get out and get in front of people more often and more frequently. When you get older, your job is more intense, you have more demands on your time, and it\u2019s really easy to let the quest for finding a mate slip into the other bucket.\u201d\u201cAt a certain age I became more conscious of the fact that I knew the following year would be better if I was in a loving, committed relationship with someone that I was going to start a family with,\u201d Mr. Gollash said. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of my married friends had any illusions that I was living the dream. Maybe the guys would joke about it, but I would enlist the help of all the wives of my friends, or the women friends in my life, to help me become a better person, to get ready, so when I met the right person, I was in the right head space.\u201d\u201cI want a partner for life,\u201d Mr. Morris said over the phone a few hours before the start of his 44th birthday party. \u201cAnd sometimes, even with my close friends, I have to remind them about that, because it doesn\u2019t look like I want a partner for life, because I\u2019m not taking active control over seeking it. I could make excuses and say the job is what I\u2019m married to, which, I think, is true.\u201cI\u2019m committed to the work that PEN does. It can\u2019t be over 100 percent, but it is the overarching story of my life, and that is hard to compete with. And so what I am trying to do is find a better balance and actually try to imagine what a relationship would look like.\u201dAt 9 p.m. on this Sunday night, when most single men his age are at home, basking in the light of Netflix or Showtime, he stood among the artists and writers who were celebrating with him at a bar in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn.Those who still smoked stepped outside. Mr. Morris looked at all the revelers, who were drinking and starting to dance, and said: \u201cI don\u2019t know if this is what 44 looks like. I know it\u2019s what the end of 43 does.\u201dThe next night was when I met with Jean-Marc Choffel at his Manhattan salon. The rain that had sent passers-by under awnings had finally come to a stop. If ever there was a time to step out, it was now. But Mr. Choffel did not budge from the leather swivel chair.\u201cTonight I\u2019m doing nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cI could go out, grab a girl, have sex, have fun. But the sense of life is to have kids and try to give them as much as you know. I believe in the power of the universe. I believe the day you go somewhere where you aren\u2019t supposed to be, you end up falling in love and having babies. Definitely, I\u2019m not giving up.\u201dAdvertisement"}
