{"Headline": "Amtrak Says New York Region\u2019s Rail Projects Could Cost Up to $23.9 Billion", "Date": "2016-01-20", "News": "Supported byAmtrak officials on Wednesday provided the most detailed public account yet for the projected costs of building a new Hudson River rail tunnel and improving other critical parts of the rail infrastructure in the New York region.In a presentation to Mr. Foxx, Amtrak officials said the entire project could cost as much as $23.9 billion, with the largest share of about $7.7 billion going toward building the new Hudson tunnel and repairing the existing tunnel. The project includes a host of other elements, including expanding Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan at an estimated cost of $5.9 billion, and replacing rail bridges in New Jersey.After Mr. Foxx toured the tunnel on Wednesday, he said he would continue to advance the plans during the final year of the Obama administration.\u201cI\u2019d like to have a financing package that is solid enough by the time we walk out of the door that everyone has the certainty that the project will happen, and the funding set aside to get it done,\u201d he said.Seated at the front of a special train car with panoramic windows, Mr. Foxx examined the tunnel\u2019s crumbling bench walls and the line where floodwaters rose during the storm. A top Amtrak official, Stephen Gardner, stood nearby outlining the scope of the Gateway program and rough estimates for the cost and timeline for the plans.Amtrak officials have been reluctant to provide specific figures for the cost of the project while they are still in the early stages of planning. On Wednesday, they cautioned that the numbers were preliminary estimates, and the real costs would be determined after conducting engineering work and an environmental plan and considering available financing.On Wednesday, when Mr. Foxx asked whether the existing tunnel was safe, Amtrak officials said that it was structurally safe, but that service was becoming less reliable. Amtrak\u2019s chairman, Anthony Coscia, and its chief executive, Joseph Boardman, attended the tour, along with Sarah Feinberg, the head of the Federal Railroad Administration.After the tour, Mr. Foxx praised Mr. Cuomo\u2019s big infrastructure plans for the state, but he said officials must remain \u201claser-focused on fixing what is broken under the Hudson River.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s where our department\u2019s focus remains,\u201d he said, \u201cuntil we get that project on an irreversible path toward completion.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He had earlier said that he had only \u201cvague\u201d memories of his dealings with the construction company, which, according to a Japanese magazine, gave him and his aides cash and gifts totaling 12 million yen, or about $100,000.The funds were never reported in mandatory records on campaign financing, said the magazine, Shukan Bunshun. The company told the magazine that it was involved in a dispute with the government over a public works contract and was seeking Mr. Amari\u2019s help in settling the matter in its favor.Mr. Amari said little else about the allegations at the news conference but promised to provide more details \u201cwithin a week, after confirming my memories.\u201d He said that he had no plans to resign and that Mr. Abe had encouraged him to \u201cfocus on my job.\u201dFunding scandals are a recurring problem in Japanese politics, and Mr. Abe has lost several cabinet ministers to them in the past.

The issue was related to the disposal of industrial waste at a public works site in Chiba Prefecture, northeast of Tokyo.But Ms. Marukawa said the aide was merely seeking information about the case and did not try to influence its outcome.The minister of land, infrastructure, transport and tourism, Keiichi Ishii, said his ministry was examining allegations in the Shukan Bunshun report that the construction company, which the magazine did not identify by name, used Mr. Amari\u2019s office as a conduit to pass gift certificates to ministry officials with jurisdiction over other aspects of the case.\u201cI honestly had no idea what my secretaries were doing,\u201d Mr. Amari said.The opposition condemned Mr. Amari\u2019s response to the accusations as inadequate.\u201cHe hasn\u2019t provided a single explanation,\u201d Yoshiaki Takaki, a senior official of the Democratic Party of Japan, the largest opposition group, said in Parliament.Members of the opposition walked out of Parliament before a previously scheduled address by Mr. Amari on Friday.Makiko Inoue contributed reporting from Tokyo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Arrest of Leftist Israeli Activist Underlines Political Split", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "Supported byConsidered variously as a big-mouthed provocateur and a colorful human-rights adventurer, Mr. Nawi has become the latest symbol in the battle between advocacy groups on opposite sides of Israel\u2019s political spectrum, and the increasingly fierce debate here over the nature of Israeli society and democracy.The debate has heated up as Israel\u2019s conservative government is pushing forward contentious legislation that would require nongovernmental organizations to disclose funding they receive from foreign governments in their publications, advertising and meetings with public officials. The proposed bill, which supporters say is meant to increase transparency, would apply mainly to leftist groups critical of Israel\u2019s policy toward the Palestinians, since rightist groups mostly receive private funding from abroad, and it has already drawn harsh criticism from the Obama administration and European diplomats.Daniel B. Shapiro, the American ambassador to Israel, took the unusual step of meeting with Israel\u2019s justice minister, Ayelet Shaked of the rightist Jewish Home Party, and then released a pointed statement afterward noting Washington\u2019s \u201cconcern\u201d about the bill.\u201cA free and functioning civil society is an essential element of a healthy democracy,\u201d the statement said. \u201cGovernments must protect free expression and peaceful dissent and create an atmosphere where all voices can be heard.\u201dMr. Netanyahu said the legislation should \u201crequire reports about the first shekel or dollar from foreign governments,\u201d rather than apply only to groups that raise more than half their money abroad. But he also urged dropping a provision that would require representatives of foreign-funded groups who appear in Parliament to wear tags saying so.Here in Israel, it is part of a toxic tug of war over the boundaries of political discourse amid mounting international criticism of Israel\u2019s policies toward the Palestinians. The dwindling left is frequently vilified as traitorous, as empowered right-wingers create ever-narrower definitions of Zionism. And the tactics are getting uglier.Video from Ad Kan\u2019s hidden camera was broadcast by the respected television documentary program \u201cUvda\u201d \u2014 like an Israeli \u201c60 Minutes\u201d \u2014 on Jan. 7. A court-imposed gag order on Mr. Nawi\u2019s arrest \u2014 for, among other charges, contact with a foreign agent and conspiracy to commit a crime \u2014 was lifted on Thursday.It is an odd case. Mr. Nawi, described in a 2009 New York Times profile as \u201cthe Robin Hood of the South Hebron Hills,\u201d helping Palestinians who love him and \u201cthwarting settlers and soldiers who view him with contempt,\u201d is now accused of endangering the lives of Palestinians. That is because selling land to Israeli Jews is punishable by death according to the Palestinian Authority. Although the authority is not known to have carried out any executions for any offense in more than a decade, there have been reports of torture in its prisons.The Ad Kan video, from about a year ago, shows Mr. Nawi behind the wheel of his jeep, bragging about what appeared to be a dubious sideline to his activist work in the West Bank. He told the man sitting next to him, whom he believed to be a fellow sympathizer, that he sometimes posed as a land broker and engaged with other land dealers mediating sales of Palestinian-owned land to Jewish settlers, then handed over their details to the Palestinian Authority security services.Asked what the Authority did with such people, Mr. Nawi said it \u201ccatches them and kills them.\u201dDays later, he was arrested at the airport as he was about to leave the country.The Ad Kan sting also embroiled Nasser Nawajah, a Palestinian from the hills of the southern West Bank, who was filmed suggesting that Mr. Nawi arrange a meeting with a land dealer in an area under Palestinian Authority jurisdiction to facilitate the dealer\u2019s arrest. Mr. Nawajah, a field worker for B\u2019Tselem, an Israeli human rights group that monitors Israel\u2019s treatment of Palestinians, and a third activist, Guy Butavia, an Israeli, were also detained in connection with the case.B\u2019Tselem, in a statement, said that Mr. Nawajah reported to the Palestinian Authority that a Palestinian citizen of Israel, \u201cpurporting to be a land dealer,\u201d was trying to sell land partly owned by Mr. Nawajah\u2019s family. \u201cThis is the only legitimate course of action for Palestinians\u201d in such cases, the statement said, adding that the land dealer was alive and well, and had never been arrested.An Israeli court ordered the release of Mr. Nawajah on Thursday on the grounds that Israel had no jurisdiction in the matter. But all three men are expected to remain in custody until at least Sunday.For the left in Israel, the virulence of the rightist campaigns reflect an increasingly hostile environment in which liberal values and free speech appear to be under attack. The promotion of the so-called Transparency Law by the justice minister, Ms. Shaked, has added to the sense of threat hovering over the organizations.Mr. Netanyahu, though, likened the proposed legislation to a congressional requirement that witnesses at hearings disclose any federal grants or contracts of payments they receive originating with a foreign government.A final draft of the bill has not yet been published. But Peace Now, another Israeli group that opposes Israel\u2019s occupation of the territories captured in the 1967 war, said that it did not resemble the standing rules of the House of Representatives. Instead, Peace Now said, it includes \u201cdraconian clauses that consist of severe violations of freedom of speech which do not exist in any other democratic country.\u201dThe split over the bill reflects the broader political divide. Gerald Steinberg, a political science professor and the president of NGO Monitor, an advocacy group that tracks the work of nongovernmental organizations critical of Israel, said that the amount of funding provided by governments of the European Union was \u201cout of proportion.\u201d Describing it as \u201ca challenge to Israeli sovereignty,\u201d he said it gave \u201ca very narrow part of Israeli civil society a major boost in terms of their ability to influence internal debate and the marketplace of ideas.\u201dBut Talia Sasson, a lawyer who worked in the state attorney\u2019s office and is now the president of the board of the New Israel Fund, a nonprofit group that promotes civil rights in Israel and is a frequent target of criticism from the right, said that the connotation of the transparency bill was \u201cto tell the Israeli public that these organizations work against the state.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s Lead Over Bernie Sanders Slipping in New Poll", "Date": "2016-01-12", "News": "Supported byYet more than 7 in 10 Democratic voters \u2014 including most supporters of Mr. Sanders \u2014 still believe Mrs. Clinton will ultimately win the party\u2019s nomination. Voters expressed deeper confidence in her ability to be an effective commander in chief and more of her supporters say their minds are made up compared with Mr. Sanders\u2019s backers.Mr. Sanders\u2019s shifting fortunes underscore the unsettled state of the presidential race in both parties with just three weeks before the Iowa caucuses. Previous contests have seen candidates rise and fall in the weeks before the first votes are cast, and national polls at this stage of the race are not necessarily predictive of the final outcome of the monthslong nominating battle. But Mr. Sanders\u2019s surge has clearly unnerved the Clinton campaign, and she is responding aggressively.\u201cI like Bernie\u2019s sincerity,\u201d Dalton Paget, 27, an insurance agent from Spokane, Wash., said in a follow-up interview. \u201cHe\u2019s talking about working towards policies that he\u2019s been championing for a long time.\u201dIn particular, Mr. Paget cited Mr. Sanders\u2019s advocacy of overhauling the campaign finance system. \u201cHonestly, before I heard much about Bernie Sanders and realized he had a decent chance for winning, I might have supported Hillary,\u201d he said.Republican and Democratic primary voters give their opinions on the candidates.Only about a third of Republican primary voters who back a candidate say their minds are made up. But most Trump supporters \u2014 52 percent \u2014 say they have decided. A narrow majority of Republican primary voters say they expect Mr. Trump to be the party\u2019s nominee, similar to the finding of last month\u2019s poll.Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz run closely among very conservative voters, but Mr. Trump now leads among evangelicals 42 percent to 25 percent.\u201cI think he\u2019s going to try to do what\u2019s best for the working man,\u201d said Kevin Jarrell, 41, from Proctorville, Ohio, who said he was a born-again Christian. \u201cHe\u2019s got money so he\u2019s not going to try to do what\u2019s best for him. He\u2019s going to try his best to create jobs and he\u2019s going to shut out the refugees.\u201dBut Mr. Trump trails his top two rivals on whether he possesses the right kind of temperament and personality to be a good president. Half of Republican primary voters say he does, while about two-thirds say so of Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio.The latest New York Times/CBS News national poll finds a significant narrowing of the race for the Democratic nomination while Donald Trump maintains his sizable lead among Republican primary voters.The generational divide on the Democratic side was more pronounced than even the split among voters of differing political ideology. In addition to his strong support among younger voters, Mr. Sanders, who describes himself as a democratic socialist, is backed by 55 percent of liberals, compared with 40 percent who support Mrs. Clinton.Mrs. Clinton is boosted by older voters, who favor her by an even larger margin than younger voters favor Mr. Sanders. She fares better with moderates than Mr. Sanders does; 51 percent support her, while 33 percent back Mr. Sanders.She also holds a double-digit lead among female voters, but the race is closer among men \u2014 45 percent back Mr. Sanders, compared with 40 percent for Mrs. Clinton.\u201cI like the way he says the economy should be run,\u201d said Jerry Auguste, 28, of Brooklyn, who works in retail. He said he was more with Mrs. Clinton at first, but has been leaning toward Mr. Sanders in the past month or so, \u201cmainly because I\u2019ve heard more of what he\u2019s been saying about the economy and climate.\u201dAbout as many Democratic primary voters say Mr. Sanders shares their values as say Mrs. Clinton does. But Mrs. Clinton, who served as secretary of state in Mr. Obama\u2019s administration, holds an edge in an important area: Some Democratic voters seem to have an easier time envisioning her in the White House.More than 4 in 10 say they are very confident in her ability to be an effective commander in chief of the nation\u2019s military, compared with just over 2 in 10 who are very confident in Mr. Sanders\u2019s ability.\u201cAs far as commander in chief goes, she\u2019s been there, she knows what\u2019s been going on, and she would be effective,\u201d said Leona H. Alford, 81, a retiree from Brown Deer, Wis., who worked in social services.Likewise, about 8 in 10 Democratic primary voters say Mrs. Clinton has the right kind of temperament and personality to be a good president, compared with two-thirds who say Mr. Sanders does.About 3 in 10 say his involvement in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign makes them likelier to support her, though two-thirds said it does not make a difference.The national Times/CBS News poll, conducted Jan. 7 through 10 on cellphones and landlines, included 442 Republican primary voters and 389 Democratic primary voters. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 6 points for both Democratic and Republican primary voters.Marina Stefan, Megan Thee-Brenan and Giovanni Russonello contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Malaysia Closes Investigation Into Prime Minister Najib Razak\u2019s Funds", "Date": "2016-01-26", "News": "Supported byThe decision, greeted with outrage and cynicism by the opposition, appears to prolong the embattled premiership of Mr. Najib, who has struggled to explain why nearly $700 million had been transferred to him.Attorney General Mohamed Apandi Ali told reporters at a hastily convened news conference on Tuesday in the country\u2019s administrative capital, Putrajaya, that he had ordered the anticorruption commission to close the investigation into the money that Mr. Najib received.\u201cI am satisfied that there was no evidence to show that the donation was a form of gratification given corruptly,\u201d Mr. Apandi said in a statement released by his office.The statement also said that part of the money \u2014 $620 million \u2014 was returned to the Saudi royal family in 2013 \u201cbecause the sum was not utilized.\u201dIn a statement of his own on Tuesday, Mr. Najib said that he welcomed the attorney general\u2019s findings, and that the matter \u201chas been comprehensively put to rest.\u201dThe attorney general\u2019s remarks were the most explicit on the transfers to date.But no reason was provided as to why the Saudis would send Mr. Najib such a large sum.Nor did the attorney general say how much of the $61 million that Mr. Najib did not send back was spent.One of the more outspoken members of the opposition, Rafizi Ramli, sarcastically called Mr. Najib \u201cthe luckiest person\u201d to have received so much money, and \u201cmost generous\u201d for having returned so much of it.\u201cThis can only happen in fairy tales,\u201d Mr. Rafizi was quoted as saying by Malaysiakini, a news website. He called the prime minister a clown and said the explanation given on Tuesday by the attorney general made the situation \u201cmore ridiculous.\u201dIn addition to the assertion that Mr. Najib had received money from the Saudis, the attorney general\u2019s statement suggested that the prime minister was unaware that millions of dollars had been transferred into his personal accounts from a company owned by the Finance Ministry known as SRC.Documents from the investigation show that those transfers amounted to about $10 million. The attorney general\u2019s office said there was \u201cno evidence\u201d that Mr. Najib \u201chad any knowledge\u201d of these transfers.Mr. Najib \u201cwas of the belief\u201d that any of the money he spent had come from the Saudi royal family, the statement said.The case of SRC is potentially explosive because it involves the savings of Malaysian government employees: SRC received a loan of more than $930 million from the government fund that manages the retirement savings of civil servants, a decision approved by Mr. Najib\u2019s cabinet.Mr. Najib\u2019s government has moved aggressively to shut down leaks that led to the investigation. Last year, the police raided the offices of the anticorruption commission, the license of a crusading news organization was suspended and Mr. Najib purged his deputy prime minister, who had been pressing for further investigations.The opposition is leading calls for further investigations into the fund\u2019s billions of dollars in debts, its struggles to repay them, and opaque transactions involving offshore tax havens.The inquiry, being run by a unit of the Justice Department that investigates international corruption, was said to be focused on properties in the United States purchased in recent years by shell companies belonging to his stepson, as well as other real estate connected to a close family friend.An article on Jan. 27 about the closing of an investigation into the transfer of nearly $700 million into the personal bank accounts of the Malaysian prime minister, Najib Razak, misstated, in some editions, his role in 1Malaysia Development Berhad, a heavily indebted sovereign wealth fund that his critics say is linked to the money. Mr. Najib is chairman of the board of advisers, not chairman of the fund. The article was corrected online immediately, but editors failed to follow through promptly with a print correction.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Las Vegans, Hockey in the Desert Isn\u2019t So Strange", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Supported byLAS VEGAS \u2014 An N.H.L. team in Las Vegas may seem like a marriage made in one of the city\u2019s notorious wedding chapels, but the city has supported professional hockey before, with several minor league hockey teams having called it home as far back as 1968.\u201cI think it\u2019ll be a huge success,\u201d said Butch Goring, a former Islanders forward who coached the International Hockey League\u2019s Las Vegas Thunder for one season. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly enough money to sustain a hockey team. They have a brand-new building. I think it\u2019s a wonderful idea.\u201dIt is no secret that the league\u2019s forays into nontraditional hockey markets have yielded mixed results. Las Vegas has its own tumultuous history with minor league franchises, particularly in hockey.The Thunder operated for six seasons, from 1993 to 1999. Despite their lack of affiliation with an N.H.L. team, the Thunder averaged more than 7,000 fans per game in their first four seasons at the Thomas and Mack Center, located on the campus of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.\u201cIt was very, very well received,\u201d said Goring, who coached the Thunder to a 115-point season in 1993-94. \u201cThe Thomas and Mack Center wasn\u2019t ideal circumstances for hockey, but we played to near-capacity crowds every night, and there was a lot of talk around town. A lot of people enjoyed the I.H.L.\u201d7 PhotosAttendance dwindled as the team struggled in the subsequent two seasons, and the university refused to negotiate a new agreement with the Thunder after 1999. The team ended up folding after it failed to secure a suitable building.The Wranglers of the East Coast Hockey League, a minor league two levels down from the N.H.L., have a similar story. They existed for 11 years and were most famous for their annual midnight game. They played in the Orleans Arena at the Orleans Hotel and Casino, about a mile from the Las Vegas Strip. The Wranglers reached the Kelly Cup finals twice, including a 2008 appearance under the leadership of Glen Gulutzan, a former coach of the Dallas Stars.But hit hard by the recession and waning interest, the team ceased operation after Orleans Arena would not renew its lease in 2014.The brothers led last year\u2019s season-ticket drive and advertised on their rink\u2019s boards to raise awareness. That work, in part, allowed the Storm to become a member of the city\u2019s Founding 75, a committee of the most influential people committed to helping Las Vegas land an N.H.L. team.\u201cEach of these people was supposed to generate a certain number of tickets,\u201d John Brooks said of the committee members. \u201cWe wanted to put the youth organization as part of the Founding 75. We weren\u2019t worried about our own names being on the list. We want to help bring the N.H.L. to Vegas.\u201dThe Storm\u2019s in-house league accommodates about 200 players, and its Learn to Play and Learn to Skate programs are at capacity.\u201cIt\u2019s gotten a lot better,\u201d the longtime Las Vegas sports-talk radio host Dave Cokin said of the city\u2019s youth hockey leagues. \u201cWe\u2019ve even had a few kids who have gone on to major Division I colleges. Who knows how much better it would get with an N.H.L. team, but there\u2019s got to be a correlation.\u201dJason Zucker has a strong connection to Las Vegas. Except for two years spent in Newport Beach, Calif., he played the majority of his youth hockey in the Las Vegas Outlaws, a former youth organization, before moving to Michigan for junior hockey when he was 15.\u201cThe hockey was pretty good,\u201d Zucker said. \u201cWe used to travel to tournaments, and people would ask, \u2018You guys are from Vegas?\u2019 But when we\u2019d play against them, they were surprised by how good we were.\u201dAfter he was drafted by the Minnesota Wild in the second round of the 2010 N.H.L. draft, Zucker went to the University of Denver and has played for the Wild since 2012. Despite spending his N.H.L. career in hockey-mad Minnesota, Zucker has kept a close eye on the sport\u2019s evolution in Las Vegas.Zucker has seen people like Gauthier, who played eight N.H.L. games in the Kings\u2019 organization during a nine-year pro career, and Ken Quinney, a coach for the Flames who played for the Thunder and also played 59 N.H.L. games with the Quebec Nordiques, take over the youth programs and help in their progression.\u201cIt\u2019s evolved quite a bit,\u201d Zucker said. \u201cThere is better coaching \u2014 people who care about the kids and care about hockey in general. I think that\u2019s the thing people miss is that people care about hockey.\u201dBecause of its successful youth programs, Las Vegas may be ahead of other warm-weather expansion cities. In places like Tampa, Fla., Phoenix and South Florida, youth organizations cropped up as a result of N.H.L. teams\u2019 arriving in town, but hockey in Las Vegas has grown independently of the N.H.L. The league has held a number of exhibition games in the city, and its annual awards ceremony has been in Las Vegas for the past six years.\u201cWe have a foundation before the big-market N.H.L. team got here, and having that good foundation will make it grow even more,\u201d Gauthier said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working very hard to establish the youth program and create an identity in Las Vegas, and having the help of an N.H.L. team will help grow that faster.\u201d\u201cBeing the first sport added, you have a unique chance rather than being the third or fourth sport in a city like Denver or Phoenix,\u201d Brooks said.\u201cWhen you think of Las Vegas, you think of the gambling center of North America,\u201d Goring, the former Thunder coach, said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a town that is very in tune with what is happening in the sports landscape. They may be coming at it from another angle, but I don\u2019t foresee that as a problem. I think it\u2019ll do wonderfully.\u201dThe T-Mobile Arena is near completion on the Strip. It will seat 17,500 for hockey and was designed to attract either an N.B.A. or an N.H.L. team.MGM Grand Resorts and the Anschutz Entertainment Group privately financed the arena, which already has events planned \u2014 including an opening-night concert on April 6 featuring Wayne Newton and the Killers.An N.H.L. team in Las Vegas would not be without challenges, of course. Winning \u2014 a tall order for any expansion team \u2014 is the best way to gain attention. But the club must also be concerned with pricing itself fairly, but competitively, among the city\u2019s many entertainment options or risk shutting out the local population.Upper-level seats for full-season packages at T-Mobile Arena start at about $20 per ticket per game. Lower-level seats start at $90 apiece, and fans who place long-term commitments \u2014 some of which span 10 years \u2014 will have first choice of seat location.\u201cIf the average ticket price is going to be $90, then they\u2019ll have trouble selling tickets,\u201d Cokin, the radio host, said. \u201cThere\u2019s so much entertainment in this town, and asking a family of four to spend $400, that won\u2019t happen.\u201dBut Brooks said he believed a pro sports team \u2014 especially hockey \u2014 in town would be different.\u201cThere are a lot of people that say, \u2018Oh, you know Vegas has all that entertainment,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cBut nothing compares to pro sports. Plus, hockey is so much better live and in person.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And whether we like it or not, the pace of this change will only accelerate.America has been through big changes before \u2014 wars and depression, the influx of new immigrants, workers fighting for a fair deal, movements to expand civil rights.Each time, there have been those who told us to fear the future, who claimed we could slam the brakes on change, who promised to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening America under control. And each time, we overcame those fears.We did not, in the words of Lincoln, adhere to the dogmas of the quiet past. Instead we thought anew and acted anew.We made change work for us, always extending America\u2019s promise outward, to the next frontier, to more people. And because we did, because we saw opportunity where others saw peril, we emerged stronger and better than before.What was true then can be true now. Our unique strengths as a nation \u2014 our optimism and work ethic, our spirit of discovery, our diversity, our commitment to rule of law \u2014 these things give us everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generations to come.In fact, it\u2019s in that spirit that we have made the progress these past seven years. That\u2019s how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in generations.(APPLAUSE)That\u2019s how we reformed our health care system and reinvented our energy sector.(APPLAUSE)That\u2019s how \u2014 that\u2019s how we \u2014 that\u2019s how we delivered more care and benefits to our troops coming home and our veterans.(APPLAUSE)That\u2019s how we \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s how we secured the freedom in every state to marry the person we love.(APPLAUSE)But such progress is not inevitable. It\u2019s the result of choices we make together. And we face such choices right now. Will we respond to the changes of our time with fear, turning inward as a nation, turning against each other as a people? Or will we face the future with confidence in who we are, in what we stand for, and the incredible things we can do together? So let\u2019s talk about the future, and four big questions that I believe we as a country have to answer, regardless of who the next president is or who controls the next Congress.First, how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy?(APPLAUSE)Second, how do we make technology work for us, and not against us, especially when it comes to solving urgent challenges like climate change?(APPLAUSE)Third, how do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman?(APPLAUSE)And finally, how can we make our politics reflect what\u2019s best in us, and not what\u2019s worst?(APPLAUSE)Let me start with the economy and a basic fact. The United States of America, right now, has the strongest, most durable economy in the world.(APPLAUSE)We\u2019re in the middle of the longest streak of private-sector job creation in history.More than 14 million new jobs, the strongest two years of job growth since the 1990s, an unemployment rate cut in half. Our auto industry just had its best year ever.(APPLAUSE)That\u2019s just part of a manufacturing surge that\u2019s created nearly 900,000 new jobs in the past six years. And we\u2019ve done all this while cutting our deficits by almost three-quarters.(APPLAUSE)Anyone claiming that America\u2019s economy is in decline is peddling fiction. Now...(APPLAUSE)What is true \u2014 and the reason that a lot of Americans feel anxious \u2014 is that the economy has been changing in profound ways, changes that started long before the Great Recession hit, changes that have not let up. Today, technology doesn\u2019t just replace jobs on the assembly line, but any job where work can be automated. Companies in a global economy can locate anywhere, and they face tougher competition.As a result, workers have less leverage for a raise. Companies have less loyalty to their communities. And more and more wealth and income is concentrated at the very top.All these trends have squeezed workers, even when they have jobs, even when the economy is growing. It\u2019s made it harder for a hardworking family to pull itself out of poverty, harder for young people to start their careers, tougher for workers to retire when they want to. And although none of these trends are unique to America, they do offend our uniquely American belief that everybody who works hard should get a fair shot.For the past seven years, our goal has been a growing economy that also works better for everybody. We\u2019ve made progress, but we need to make more. And despite all the political arguments that we\u2019ve had these past few years, there are actually some areas where Americans broadly agree.We agree that real opportunity requires every American to get the education and training they need to land a good-paying job. The bipartisan reform of No Child Left Behind was an important start, and together, we\u2019ve increased early childhood education, lifted high school graduation rates to new highs, boosted graduates in fields like engineering.In the coming years, we should build on that progress, by providing Pre-K for all and offering every student...(APPLAUSE)... offering every student the hands-on computer science and math classes that make them job-ready on day one. We should recruit and support more great teachers for our kids.(APPLAUSE)And \u2014 and we have to make college affordable for every American.(APPLAUSE)No hardworking student should be stuck in the red. We\u2019ve already reduced student loan payments by \u2014 to 10 percent of a borrower\u2019s income. And that\u2019s good. But now we\u2019ve actually got to cut the cost of college.(APPLAUSE)Providing two years of community college at no cost for every responsible student is one of the best ways to do that, and I\u2019m going to keep fighting to get that started this year. It\u2019s the right thing to do.(APPLAUSE)But a great education isn\u2019t all we need in this new economy. We also need benefits, and protections that provide a basic measure of security. It\u2019s not too much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in America who are going to work the same job, in the same place with a health, and a retirement package for 30 years are sitting in this chamber. For everyone else, especially folks in their 40\u2019s and 50\u2019s, saving for retirement, or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher. Americans understand that at some point in their careers, in this new economy, they may have to retool, they may have to retrain, but they shouldn\u2019t lose what they\u2019ve already worked so hard to build in the process.That\u2019s why Social Security and Medicare are more important than ever, we shouldn\u2019t weaken them, we should strengthen them.(APPLAUSE)And for American short of retirement, basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today.That, by the way, is what the Affordable Care Act is all about. It\u2019s about filling the gaps in employer based care so that when you lose a job, or you go back to school, or you strike out and launch that new business you\u2019ll still have coverage. Nearly 18 million people have gained coverage so far, and in the process...(APPLAUSE)In the process health care inflation has slowed, our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law.Now, I\u2019m guessing we won\u2019t agree on health care anytime soon.(APPLAUSE)A little applause right there.(LAUGHTER)Just a guess.But there should be other ways parties can work together improve economic security. Say a hardworking American loses his job, we shouldn\u2019t just make sure he can get unemployment insurance; we should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business that\u2019s ready to hire him. If that new job doesn\u2019t pay as much, there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills. And even if he\u2019s going from job to job, he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him. That\u2019s the way we make the new economy work better for everybody.I also know Speaker Ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty. America is about giving everybody willing to work a chance, a hand up, and I\u2019d welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support, like expanding tax cuts for low-income workers who don\u2019t have children.(APPLAUSE)But there are some areas where we just have to be honest. It has been more difficult to find agreement over the last seven years, and a lot of them fall under the category of what role the government should play in making sure the system\u2019s not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest corporations.(APPLAUSE)And it\u2019s an honest disagreement. And, the American people have a choice to make.I believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy. I think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed, there is red tape that needs to be cut.(APPLAUSE)There you go. Yes.(APPLAUSE)See?But after years of record corporate profits, working families won\u2019t get more opportunity or bigger paychecks just by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules at everybody else\u2019s expense.(APPLAUSE)Middle-class families are not going to feel more secure because we allowed attacks on collective bargaining to go unanswered. Food Stamp recipients did not cause the financial crisis; recklessness on Wall Street did.(APPLAUSE)Immigrants aren\u2019t the principal reason wages haven\u2019t gone up. Those decisions are made in the boardrooms that all too often put quarterly earnings over long-term returns. It\u2019s sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts.(APPLAUSE)The point is, I believe, that in this new economy, workers and start-ups and small businesses need more of a voice, not less. The rules should work for them. And...(APPLAUSE)... I\u2019m not alone in this. This year, I plan to lift up the many businesses who\u2019ve figured out that doing right by their workers or their customers or their communities ends up being good for their shareholders...(APPLAUSE)... and I want to spread those best practices across America. That\u2019s part of a brighter future. In fact, it turns out many of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative.And this brings me to the second big question we as a country have to answer: how do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our biggest challenges?Sixty years ago, when the Russians beat us into space, we didn\u2019t deny Sputnik was up there.(LAUGHTER)We didn\u2019t argue about the science, or shrink our research and development budget. We built a space program almost overnight, and twelve years later, we were walking on the moon. (APPLAUSE)Now, that spirit of discovery is in our DNA. America is Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers and George Washington Carver. America is Grace Hopper and Katherine Johnson and Sally Ride. America is every immigrant and entrepreneur from Boston to Austin to Silicon Valley racing to shape a better future.(APPLAUSE)That\u2019s who we are, and over the past seven years, we\u2019ve nurtured that spirit. We\u2019ve protected an open Internet, and taken bold new steps to get more students and low-income Americans online.(APPLAUSE)We\u2019ve launched next-generation manufacturing hubs and online tools that give an entrepreneur everything he or she needs to start a business in a single day. But we can do so much more.You know, last year, Vice President Biden said that, with a new moon-shot, America can cure cancer. Last month, he worked with this Congress to give scientists at the National Institutes of Health the strongest resources that they\u2019ve had in over a decade.(APPLAUSE)Well, so \u2014 so tonight, I\u2019m announcing a new national effort to get it done. And because he\u2019s gone to the mat for all of us on so many issues over the past 40 years, I\u2019m putting Joe in charge of mission control.(APPLAUSE)For the loved ones we\u2019ve all lost, for the families that we can still save, let\u2019s make America the country that cures cancer once and for all. What do you think? Let\u2019s make it happen.(APPLAUSE)And medical research is critical. We need the same level of commitment when it comes to developing clean energy sources.(APPLAUSE)Look, if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change, have at it. You will be pretty lonely because you\u2019ll be debating our military, most of America\u2019s business leaders, the majority of the American people, almost the entire scientific community, and 200 nations around the world who agree it\u2019s a problem and intend to solve it.(APPLAUSE)But even if \u2014 even if the planet wasn\u2019t at stake, even if 2014 wasn\u2019t the warmest year on record until 2015 turned out even hotter \u2014 why would we want to pass up the chance for American businesses to produce and sell the energy of the future?(APPLAUSE)Listen, seven years ago, we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history. Here are the results. In fields from Iowa to Texas, wind power is now cheaper than dirtier, conventional power. On rooftops from Arizona to New York, solar is saving Americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their energy bills and employs more Americans than coal \u2014 in jobs that pay better than average.We\u2019re taking steps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and store their own energy \u2014 something, by the way, that environmentalists and Tea Partiers have teamed up to support. And meanwhile, we\u2019ve cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly 60 percent and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on Earth.(APPLAUSE)Gas under $2 a gallon ain\u2019t bad either.(LAUGHTER)Now we\u2019ve got to accelerate the transition away from old, dirtier energy sources. Rather than subsidize the past, we should invest in the future, especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels. We do them no favor when we don\u2019t show them where the trends are going. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet. And that way, we put money back into those communities and put tens of thousands of Americans to work building a 21st century transportation system. (APPLAUSE)Now, none of this is going to happen overnight, and yes, there are plenty of entrenched interests who want to protect the status quo. But the jobs we\u2019ll create, the money we\u2019ll save, the planet we\u2019ll preserve, that is the kind of future our kids and our grandkids deserve. And it\u2019s within our grasp.Now, climate change is just one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world, and that\u2019s why the third big question that we have to answer together is how to keep America safe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nation- build everywhere there\u2019s a problem.I told you earlier all the talk of America\u2019s economic decline is political hot air. Well, so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker. Let me tell you something. The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth, period. Period.(APPLAUSE)It\u2019s not even close. It\u2019s not even close. It\u2019s not even close. We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined.(APPLAUSE)Our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world.(APPLAUSE)No nation attacks us directly or our allies because they know that\u2019s the path to ruin. Surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when I was elected to this office, and when it comes to every important international issue, people of the world do not look to Beijing or Moscow to lead. They call us.(APPLAUSE)So I think it\u2019s useful to level set here, because when we don\u2019t, we don\u2019t make good decisions. Now, as someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing, I know this is a dangerous time. But that\u2019s not primarily because of some looming superpower out there, and it\u2019s certainly not because of diminished American strength.In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re threatened less by evil empires and more by failing states. The Middle East is going through a transformation that will play out for a generation, rooted in conflicts that date back millennia. Economic headwinds are blowing in from a Chinese economy that is in significant transition. Even as their economy severely contracts, Russia is pouring resources in to prop up Ukraine and Syria, client states that they saw slipping away from their orbit. And the international system we built after World War II is now struggling to keep pace with this new reality.It\u2019s up to us to help, the United States of America, to help remake that system. And to do that well, it means that we\u2019ve got to set priorities. Priority number one is protecting the American people and going after terrorist networks.(APPLAUSE)Both Al Qaida and now ISIL pose a direct threat to our people, because in today\u2019s world, even a handful of terrorists who place no value on human life, including their own, can do a lot of damage. They use the Internet to poison the minds of individuals inside our country; their actions undermine and destabilize our allies. We have to take them out.But as we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top claims that this is World War III just play into their hands. Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages, they pose an enormous danger to civilians, they have to be stopped, but they do not threaten our national existence. That is the story ISIL wants to tell; that\u2019s the kind of propaganda they use to recruit.We don\u2019t need to build them up to show that we\u2019re serious, and we sure don\u2019t need to push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie that ISIL is somehow representative of one of the world\u2019s largest religions.(APPLAUSE)We just need to call them what they are: killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out, hunted down, and destroyed.(APPLAUSE)And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing. For more than a year, America has led a coalition of more than 60 countries to cut off ISIL\u2019s financing, disrupt their plots, stop the flow of terrorist fighters, and stamp out their vicious ideology. With nearly 10,000 air strikes, we are taking out their leadership, their oil, their training camps, their vicious ideology.With nearly 10,000 air strikes, we\u2019re taking out their leadership, their oil, their training camps, their weapons. We\u2019re training, arming and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in Iraq and Syria.If this Congress is serious about winning this war and wants to send a message to our troops and the world, authorize the use of military force against ISIL. Take a vote.(APPLAUSE)Take a vote. But the American people should know that, with or without Congressional action, ISIL will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them. If you doubt America\u2019s commitment \u2014 or mine \u2014 to see that justice is done, just ask Osama bin Laden.(APPLAUSE)Ask \u2014 ask the leader of Al Qaida in Yemen, who was taken out last year, or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks, who sits in a prison cell. When you come after Americans, we go after you. And it may take time, but we have long memories, and our reach has no limits.(APPLAUSE)Our foreign policy has to be focused on the threat from ISIL and Al Qaida, but it can\u2019t stop there. For even without ISIL, even without Al Qaida, instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world \u2014 in the Middle East, in Afghanistan and parts of Pakistan, in parts of Central America and Africa and Asia.Some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks. Others will just fall victim to ethnic conflict or famine, feeding the next wave of refugees.The world will look to us to help solve these problems, and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet-bomb civilians. That may work as a TV sound bite, but it doesn\u2019t pass muster on the world stage.We also can\u2019t try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis...(APPLAUSE)... even if it\u2019s done with the best of intentions. That\u2019s not leadership; that\u2019s a recipe for quagmire, spilling American blood and treasure that ultimately will weaken us. It\u2019s the lesson of Vietnam. It\u2019s the lesson of Iraq, and we should have learned it by now.(APPLAUSE)Fortunately, there is a smarter approach, a patient and disciplined strategy that uses every element of our national power. It says America will always act, alone if necessary, to protect our people and our allies, but on issues of global concern, we will mobilize the world to work with us, and make sure other countries pull their own weight.That\u2019s our approach to conflicts like Syria, where we\u2019re partnering with local forces and leading international efforts to help that broken society pursue a lasting peace.That\u2019s why we built a global coalition, with sanctions and principled diplomacy, to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. And as we speak, Iran has rolled back its nuclear program, shipped out its uranium stockpile, and the world has avoided another war.(APPLAUSE)That\u2019s how \u2014 that\u2019s how we stopped the spread of Ebola in West Africa.(APPLAUSE)Our military, our doctors, our development workers \u2014 they were heroic. They set up the platform that then allowed other countries to join in behind us and stamp out that epidemic. Hundreds of thousands \u2014 maybe a couple million lives were saved. That\u2019s how we forged a trans pacific partnership to open markets, and protect workers and the environment, and advance American leadership in Asia. It cuts 18,000 taxes on products made in America which will then support more good jobs here in America. With TPP, China does not set the rules in that region, we do. We want to show our strength in this new century? Approve this agreement, give us the tools to enforce it. It\u2019s the right thing to do.(APPLAUSE)Let me give you another example.Fifty years of isolating Cuba had failed to promote democracy, it set us back in Latin America. That\u2019s why we restored diplomatic relations, opened the door to travel and commerce, positioned ourselves to improve the lives of the Cuban people.(APPLAUSE)So, if you want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere, recognize that the Cold War is over. Lift the embargo.(APPLAUSE)The point is American leadership in the 21st century is not a choice between ignoring the rest of the world, except when we kill terrorists; or occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling. Leadership means a wise application of military power, and rallying the world behind causes that are right. It means seeing our foreign assistance as part of our national security, not something separate, not charity. When we lead nearly 200 nations to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change, yes, that helps vulnerable countries, but it also protects our kids. When we help Ukraine defend its democracy, or Colombia resolve a decades-long war, that strengthens the international order we depend on. When we help African countries feed their people and care for the sick...(APPLAUSE)It\u2019s the right thing to do, and it prevents the next pandemic from reaching our shores. Now right now, we are on track to end the scourge of HIV/AIDS, that\u2019s within our grasp, and we have the chance to accomplish the same thing with malaria, something I\u2019ll be pushing this Congress to fund this year. That\u2019s American strength. That\u2019s American leadership. And that kind of leadership depends on the power of our example. That is why I will keep working to shut down the prison at Guantanamo. It\u2019s expensive, it\u2019s unnecessary, and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies. There\u2019s a better way.(APPLAUSE)And that\u2019s why we need to reject any politics \u2014 any politics that targets people because of race or religion.(APPLAUSE)Let me just say this. This isn\u2019t a matter of political correctness. This is a matter of understanding just what it is that makes us strong. The world respects us not just for our arsenal, it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith. His Holiness, Pope Francis, told this body from the very spot I\u2019m standing on tonight that \u201cto imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place.\u201d When politicians insult Muslims, whether abroad, or fellow citizens, when a mosque is vandalized, or a kid is called names, that doesn\u2019t make us safer. That\u2019s not telling it what \u2014 telling it like it is, it\u2019s just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world.(APPLAUSE)It makes it harder to achieve our goals. It betrays who we are as a country.\u201cWe the People.\u201d Our Constitution begins with those three simple words, words we\u2019ve come to recognize mean all the people, not just some. Words that insist we rise and fall together, that that\u2019s how we might perfect our union.And that brings me to the fourth, and maybe most important thing that I want to say tonight. The future we want, all of us want \u2014 opportunity and security for our families, a rising standard of living, a sustainable, peaceful planet for our kids \u2014 all that is within our reach. But it will only happen if we work together. It will only happen if we can have rational, constructive debates. It will only happen if we fix our politics.A better politics doesn\u2019t mean we have to agree on everything. This is a big country, different regions, different attitudes, different interests. That\u2019s one of our strengths, too. Our Founders distributed power between states and branches of government, and expected us to argue, just as they did, fiercely, over the size and shape of government, over commerce and foreign relations, over the meaning of liberty and the imperatives of security.But democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens. It doesn\u2019t \u2014 it doesn\u2019t work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice, it doesn\u2019t work if we think that our political opponents are unpatriotic or trying to weaken America.Democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise or when even basic facts are contested or when we listen only to those who agree with us. Our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get all the attention. And most of all, democracy breaks down when the average person feels their voice doesn\u2019t matter; that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some special interest.Too many Americans feel that way right now. It\u2019s one of the few regrets of my presidency \u2014 that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better. I have no doubt a president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide, and I guarantee I\u2019ll keep trying to be better so long as I hold this office.But my fellow Americans, this cannot be my task \u2014 or any president\u2019s \u2014 alone. There are a whole lot of folks in this chamber \u2014 good people \u2014 who would like to see more cooperation, would like to see a more elevated debate in Washington but feel trapped by the imperatives of getting elected, by the noise coming out of your base. I know; you\u2019ve told me. It\u2019s the worst-kept secret in Washington. And a lot of you aren\u2019t enjoying being trapped in that kind of rancor.But that means if we want a better politics \u2014 and I\u2019m addressing the American people now \u2014 if we want a better politics, it\u2019s not enough just to change a congressman or change a senator or even change a president. We have to change the system to reflect our better selves.I think we\u2019ve got to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters and not the other way around.(APPLAUSE)Let a bipartisan group do it.(APPLAUSE)I believe we\u2019ve got to reduce the influence of money in our politics, so that a handful of families or hidden interests can\u2019t bankroll our elections.(APPLAUSE)And if our existing approach to campaign finance reform can\u2019t pass muster in the courts, we need to work together to find a real solution, because it\u2019s a problem. And most of you don\u2019t like raising money. I know. I\u2019ve done it.We\u2019ve got to make it easier to vote, not harder. We need to modernize it for the way we live now.(APPLAUSE)This is America. We want to make it easier for people to participate. And over the course of this year, I intend to travel the country to push for reforms that do just that.But I can\u2019t do these things on my own. Changes in our political process \u2014 in not just who gets elected, but how they get elected \u2014 that will only happen when the American people demand it. It depends on you. That\u2019s what\u2019s meant by a government of, by, and for the people.What I\u2019m suggesting is hard. It\u2019s a lot easier to be cynical, to accept that change is not possible, and politics is hopeless, and the problem is, all the folks who are elected don\u2019t care, and to believe that our voices and our actions don\u2019t matter.But if we give up now, then we forsake a better future. Those with money and power will gain greater control over the decisions that could send a young soldier to war, or allow another economic disaster, or roll back the equal rights and voting rights that generations of Americans have fought, even died, to secure. And then, as frustration grows, there will be voices urging us to fall back into our respective tribes, to scapegoat fellow citizens who don\u2019t look like us, or pray like us, or vote like we do, or share the same background.We can\u2019t afford to go down that path. It won\u2019t deliver the economy we want. It will not produce the security we want. But most of all, it contradicts everything that makes us the envy of the world.So, my fellow Americans, whatever you may believe, whether you prefer one party or no party, whether you supported my agenda or fought as hard as you could against it, our collective futures depends on your willingness to uphold your duties as a citizen, to vote, to speak out, to stand up for others, especially the weak, especially the vulnerable, knowing that each of us is only here because somebody somewhere stood up for us.(APPLAUSE)We need every American to stay active in our public life and not just during election time so that our public life reflects the goodness and the decency that I see in the American people every single day. It is not easy. Our brand of democracy is hard. But I can promise that, a little over a year from now, when I no longer hold this office, I will be right there with you as a citizen, inspired by those voices of fairness and vision, of grit and good humor and kindness, that have helped America travel so far.Voices that help us see ourselves not first and foremost as black or white or Asian or Latino; not as gay or straight, immigrant or native born; not Democrat or Republican; but as Americans first, bound by a common creed.Voices Dr. King believed would have the final word \u2014 voices of unarmed truth and unconditional love. And they\u2019re out there, those voices. They don\u2019t get a lot of attention. They don\u2019t seek a lot of fanfare, but they\u2019re busy doing the work this country needs doing.I see them everywhere I travel in this incredible country of ours. I see you, the American people. And in your daily acts of citizenship, I see our future unfolding.I see it in the worker on the assembly line who clocked extra shifts to keep his company open, and the boss who pays him higher wages instead of laying him off.I see it in the Dreamer who stays up late at night to finish her science project, and the teacher who comes in early, maybe with some extra supplies that she bought, because she knows that that young girl might someday cure a disease.I see it in the American who\u2019s served his time, made bad mistakes as a child, but now is dreaming of starting over, and I see it in the business owner who gives him that second chance; the protester determined to prove that justice matters; and the young cop walking the beat, treating everybody with respect, doing the brave, quiet work of keeping us safe.(APPLAUSE)I see it in the soldier who gives almost everything to save his brothers, the nurse who tends to him until he can run a marathon, the community that lines up to cheer him on. It\u2019s the son who finds the courage to come out as who he is, and the father whose love for that son overrides everything he\u2019s been taught.(APPLAUSE) I see it in the elderly woman who will wait in line to cast her vote as long as she has to; the new citizen who casts his vote for the first time; the volunteers at the polls who believe every vote should count, because each of them, in different ways, know how much that precious right is worth.That\u2019s the America I know. That\u2019s the country we love. Clear- eyed, big-hearted, undaunted by challenge, optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word. That\u2019s what makes me so hopeful about our future.(APPLAUSE)I believe in change because I believe in you, the American people. And that\u2019s why I stand here, as confident as I have ever been, that the state of our Union is strong.(APPLAUSE)Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.ENDAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Prods China on North Korea, Saying Soft Approach Has Failed", "Date": "2016-01-07", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In a striking public rebuke of China, Secretary of State John Kerry warned Beijing on Thursday that its effort to rein in North Korea had been a failure and that something had to change in its handling of the isolated country it has supported for the past six decades.\u201cChina had a particular approach that it wanted to make, and we agreed and respected to give them space to be able to implement that,\u201d Mr. Kerry said a day after North Korea\u2019s latest nuclear test, after a phone call with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi. \u201cToday in my conversation with the Chinese I made it clear: That has not worked, and we cannot continue business as usual.\u201d Two administration officials said the United States was now drafting a proposed resolution for United Nations Security Council approval that would impose sanctions on North Korean trade and finance, including a partial ban on permitting North Korean ships to enter ports around the world, an effort to cut off more of the country\u2019s trade. A second set of sanctions under consideration is a cutoff of North Korean banking relationships, similar to the restrictions placed on Iran in the successful effort to drive it to the negotiation table on its nuclear program.After past North Korean nuclear tests, China, a member of the Security Council, has agreed only to Council resolutions that banned weapons shipments to the North and imposed sanctions on specific companies and individuals linked to the nuclear program.Although administration officials cast the proposed new sanctions as severe, in the past enforcement of such restrictions has been poor. \u201cWhat we really want to see is better teeth in the enforcement,\u201d one senior American official said, declining to be identified because he was discussing the internal process of drafting the sanctions.During President George W. Bush\u2019s administration, the United States shut down transactions at one particular institution, Banco Delta Asia in Macau, that was used by the North Korean leadership, including Kim Jong-il, the country\u2019s leader at the time. That caused considerable pain \u2014 the bank was used to finance the lifestyles of many in the North Korean elite \u2014 but eventually the Bush administration relented and lifted the sanction, in part because of pressure from the government then in place in South Korea. The most effective step against North Korea, most experts believe, would be the one that the Chinese most oppose: a restriction or cutoff of oil exports to the North. The country is highly dependent on oil that runs through a small number of pipelines from China.\u201cWe just think it would be a nonstarter with the Chinese,\u201d said one American official, who said that it would be counterproductive if the inclusion of an oil ban led the Chinese to veto the entire resolution. China\u2019s fear is that without oil, the North Korean regime could collapse, putting South Korea, and its American ally, on the Chinese border.The United States Pacific Command met on Thursday to take up other, if largely symbolic steps. One is an overflight of the border between North and South Korea with a nuclear-capable bomber, the B-52 or the B-2. Such flights were sent up after North Korea\u2019s third nuclear test, in 2013.\u201cThe North Koreans noticed,\u201d James Miller, the under secretary of defense for policy during that test, said Thursday. \u201cAnd the rest of the world saw that they noticed.\u201d But clearly the effect eventually wore off, given the North\u2019s decision to conduct a fourth test.South Korean and American officials said there was also renewed discussion of deploying an advanced missile defense system, called the Thaad for Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, in South Korea. The United States has been pressing for such a deployment for some time, but the South has resisted, largely because of opposition from China, which is the South\u2019s leading trade partner.Taken together, those steps amount to what one American official called \u201ca big wish list.\u201d And they all reflect the reality of economic interdependence, which makes it hard for the South Koreans, or the United States, to be too confrontational with China.The United States itself has imposed many sanctions against North Korea, including some a year ago in response to the destructive cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment, which the Obama administration said had emanated from North Korean leaders. But without Chinese participation, those sanctions inflict relatively little pain.South Korea\u2019s decision to turn on the loudspeakers was made Thursday, when top national security officials met in Seoul to discuss a response to the North\u2019s test.South Korean officials said privately on Thursday that resuming the propaganda broadcasts was the simplest and quickest way they could think of, for now, to retaliate. They insisted on anonymity while agreeing to discuss their thinking on a delicate security issue. Like the United States, the South has few options for punishing the North for its nuclear ambitions, which it has continued to pursue despite decades of international sanctions and resolutions from the United Nations Security Council.North Korea did not immediately respond to the resumption of the broadcasts.David E. Sanger reported from Washington, and Choe Sang-Hun from Seoul, South Korea.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Young Moviemakers Meet Old Masters at the Frick", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "Supported bySince last February, 20 juniors and seniors have gone to the museum on Mondays, when the Frick is closed, for lively discussions with its chief curator, Xavier Salomon, on art by Fragonard, Vermeer, Rembrandt, Bellini and other old masters. The students, who had never been to the Frick before, wrote scripts inspired by the setting or works they saw, then selected one story \u2014 by the 17-year-old Gabby Martinez \u2014 to film, with classmates holding every position on the crew, including director, cinematographer and editor. (The actors were professionals, but Ms. Martinez had a cameo role as the teenage niece.) Their film, \u201cThe Progress of Love,\u201d will be screened for family and friends on Feb. 10 at the French Institute Alliance Fran\u00e7aise.A recent art museum diversity survey, conducted by the Association of Art Museum Directors and the American Alliance of Museums in partnership with the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, found that only 7 percent of the museum curators, conservators, educators and leaders were African-American, Hispanic or Native American. Another study underway by the de Blasio administration is reviewing the diversity of boards, staffs and audiences at all New York City cultural institutions.The partnership program defies stereotypes of the Frick as a bastion of Upper East Side exclusivity and the South Bronx as an incubator of underperforming kids. \u201cThe illogic of the marriage,\u201d Ms. Easton said, \u201cis what I hope encourages other people to its possibilities.\u201dMs. Easton was the matchmaker between Mr. Salomon, a former curatorial fellow in her program, and Joe Hall, the founder of the Ghetto Film School, begun in 2000 as an after-school program for talented neighborhood kids and expanded in 2009 into what is billed as the nation\u2019s first film high school, in partnership with the Bloomberg administration.Mr. Salomon pitched Mr. Hall the idea of introducing students to new ideas of visual storytelling through the Frick\u2019s collection, which in turn could inspire the making of a film. Mr. Hall was thrilled. \u201cMy goal is always to have whatever we\u2019re doing with the students finish in a product, so they\u2019re actually applying what they\u2019re learning,\u201d he said.Mr. Hall had sought to integrate art appreciation into his curriculum but had limited success dealing with museum education departments. \u201cThat track too often is constructed around the conventionally held wisdom that these kids don\u2019t want to be at the museum,\u201d said Mr. Hall, a former social worker. \u201cXavier doesn\u2019t make the mistake almost everyone makes when talking to black and brown kids of trying to make the material \u2018relatable.\u2019 He just gives it to them full throttle, and it\u2019s highly engaging.\u201dMr. Salomon recalled that for the first lesson in the Fragonard Room, \u201cthe minute we started talking, they all responded to this idea of the cycle of human love, and the discussion was fantastic.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want the kids reciting names and dates,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is about getting them comfortable in the museum world, making them understand they can go to any museum and look at any piece of art and learn about it and be critical about it.\u201d He has been in conversation with colleagues from the National Gallery in London who are interested in adapting the program.Not many people have had the run of Henry Clay Frick\u2019s former home, let alone manipulated lights and equipment there. \u201cLens coming through!\u201d warned one student on a crew of a dozen, rolling a large camera nerve-rackingly close to the massive chandelier in the Fragonard Room during filming last summer.\u201cThe Frick is literally my favorite place in New York,\u201d said Natalie Popoter, an 18-year-old Bronx native now a freshman at Hunter College, who has taken friends and relatives to the museum. She is considering majors in communications, marketing and film and added, \u201cI tell them at the Frick all the time, \u2018I\u2019d love to work here.\u2019\u201dMs. Martinez, who has been going to museums to draw since she was a little girl, had an instant affinity with the Rococo style from the moment she walked into the Fragonard Room. \u201cI brought my mom and my grandmother, and they said this place looks like some of the drawings you\u2019ve always sketched,\u201d she said. When it came time to write her script, Ms. Martinez felt inspired by Mr. Salomon\u2019s class to express that modern love is more difficult than Fragonard\u2019s \u201ceasy four steps to falling in love with someone,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s not one exact meaning, and we all have different visions of one painting, which I really like.\u201dIn May, Ms. Martinez heard her words brought to life at a table reading organized by Mr. Hall with professional actors including Alfre Woodard and feedback from the director Baz Luhrmann. (Since the director David O. Russell joined Mr. Hall\u2019s board in 2002, the school has raised over $6 million; outside donors and fees generated by the students\u2019 film work provided $450,000 to this year\u2019s school budget, in addition to the standard funding per student from the city\u2019s Department of Education.)\u201cGabby, how old are you?\u201d Mr. Luhrmann asked the teenager after the reading to a packed audience at the Standard Hotel. Her answer \u2014 16 at the time \u2014 was in a barely audible voice, because she was nervous.\u201cI thought so, because 16 is the perfect age to write the story of a gay relationship going from 18 to 42 inspired by the linear telling of these paintings,\u201d Mr. Luhrmann said waggishly. He added, \u201cThis is a tremendously sophisticated piece of work.\u201d One of her lines \u2014 \u201cLife\u2019s little pleasures are worth rotting for\u201d \u2014 was singled out for its originality.Among those present was Agnes Gund, a philanthropist and co-founder of the Center for Curatorial Leadership. \u201cThese kids not only get welcomed into the Frick but have the chance to pursue something thought up by them, relevant to their experiences, \u201d Ms. Gund said. Having the art history sessions lead to the making of a film \u201cis a brilliant idea,\u201d she continued. \u201cMany more curators could think of very inventive things like the Frick has.\u201dMs. Gund has financed summer internships at museums for college students with monetary needs. And in 2014, the Mellon Foundation started a curatorial fellowship program for college students from diverse backgrounds to train at the Art Institute of Chicago, the High Museum of Art in Atlanta and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, among others.\u201cWe need to broaden the pipeline of students interested in careers in museums,\u201d said Mari\u00ebt Westermann, vice president of the Mellon Foundation. \u201cIf museums just open the visor a little bit, they will find those community organizations and elusive populations that they sometimes think won\u2019t be interested,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Ghetto Film School proves that whether you do it with film or in another way, young people can be absolutely motivated to think about types of art that might not have been in their canon \u2014 if only you open up the space.\u201dWhether anyone in Mr. Salomon\u2019s crew is destined for a museum career has yet to be seen. Ms. Martinez wants to major in art education.\u201cI think Gabby just fell in love with the Frick,\u201d Mr. Hall said. \u201cShe can be an artist. She can be a curator. She can work in a museum. Anything like the Frick from this point forward in her life, she\u2019s going to feel like she belongs there.\u201dA picture caption with an article last Sunday about the Ghetto Film School and its collaboration with the Frick Collection, using information from a publicist, reversed the identities of two actors in the movie \u201cThe Progress of Love.\u201d Grant Lancaster was on the left, and Max Woertendyke was on the right.

{"Headline": "Social Security in an Election Year", "Date": "2016-01-02", "News": "Supported byEditorialThis election season offers an opportunity to reframe the debate over Social Security. It is necessary, of course, to ensure the program\u2019s long-term health beyond 2034, when the system is projected to come up short. But this can\u2019t be done by broadly cutting benefits. In fact, there\u2019s mounting evidence that Social Security, which has become ever more important in retirement, needs to be expanded.Despite these facts, nearly all Republican candidates have called for cuts to Social Security benefits.Mr. Bush and Mr. Cruz have said that Social Security payroll taxes should be diverted into new private accounts for employees, a reprise of President George W. Bush\u2019s failed privatization attempt in 2005. Private accounts do not enhance retirement security. They divert money that would otherwise finance Social Security to Wall Street and shift the risk from government to individuals.Donald Trump opposes benefit cuts, including a higher retirement age, but he has offered no meaningful ideas for reform.The Democratic candidates have played defense and offense. They have opposed benefit cuts and privatization. They have proposed increasing the system\u2019s revenues by raising the ceiling on the amount of wages, currently $118,500, that are subject to payroll taxes. That reform is overdue. If the wage ceiling had kept pace with the income gains of high earners over the decades, it would be about $250,000 today.More important, they have stressed that an aim of reform is to bolster the system, not shrink it. Hillary Clinton would raise benefits for widows and for retirees who had long absences from the work force to care for relatives. Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley would increase benefits more broadly, especially for low-income recipients.Ultimately, strengthening Social Security requires a growing and healthy economy. The Democratic candidates have credible ideas for creating jobs and raising wages that would revitalize the tax base for Social Security. Those and other sensible fixes, not deep and broad cutbacks, will ensure that the system continues to provide a basic level of guaranteed retirement income for all workers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama\u2019s Plea to \u2018Fix Our Politics\u2019 Leaves Both Sides Looking Inward", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisThe answer is that both sides did. A steady erosion underway for years has accelerated during Mr. Obama\u2019s time in the White House and now shows itself in congressional dysfunction and campaign vitriol. The restoration project could take some time.\u201cI think there\u2019s probably a lot of us to blame,\u201d Denis McDonough, the White House chief of staff, told reporters Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s the structure of our campaigns, the structure of our districts, what\u2019s happening in terms of news media \u2014 that is to say that you can select your news media the same way you select your neighborhood or your church.\u201dIn fact, intense polarization of the sort that has dominated Mr. Obama\u2019s tenure is nothing new in American history, said Joanne B. Freeman, a Yale University historian, although she said Mr. Obama\u2019s status as the first African-American president had brought a sharper edge to the discord.\u201cIt is not unique to President Obama,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the tone of it now is extra harsh and in some cases tinged with ugly things, including race.\u201d\u201cWe need to be honest with each other, and with ourselves,\u201d Ms. Haley said. \u201cWhile Democrats in Washington bear much responsibility for the problems facing America today, they do not bear it alone. There is more than enough blame to go around.\u201dBoth parties trace much of the current hostility to the bitter fight over President Ronald Reagan\u2019s nomination of Robert H. Bork to the Supreme Court in 1987, when Democrats succeeded in defeating him and Republicans vowed revenge. Eight years later, Newt Gingrich became House speaker and ushered in an era of confrontation and government shutdowns that culminated in the impeachment of President Bill Clinton.Mr. Obama\u2019s address Tuesday was in some ways the culmination of his own evolution, from a hopeful first-term senator exhorting voters to resist the negative fringe of campaign commentary to a frustrated president who has essentially conceded that the forces of division now reign.In fact, it was over almost before he entered the White House. Congressional Republicans, stunned by Mr. Obama\u2019s victory in 2008 and the ability of Democrats to win a supermajority in the Senate, quickly discovered that they could reap political benefit from united opposition to the president. So when Mr. Obama faced a financial system in tatters and an automobile industry on the brink of collapse in early 2009, he developed an economic stimulus package and pushed it through almost entirely with Democratic votes.The president\u2019s arm\u2019s-length relationship with Capitol Hill throughout his tenure only deepened the sense of suspicion and animosity. Lawmakers in both parties still complain on a regular basis that the White House treats them as an afterthought in important decisions and fails to respond to their concerns.Republicans united in opposition to Mr. Obama to gain control of the House in 2010 and, ultimately, control of the Senate in 2014. Republicans are now so determined not to be seen as supportive of Mr. Obama that they sat silently Tuesday as he proclaimed the United States the most powerful nation on earth \u2014 usually a sure applause line.\u201cIt used to be a very positive thing for a member of Congress to say, \u2018I can work with the president of the United States,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said former Representative Vin Weber of Minnesota, a Republican strategist. \u201cNow there\u2019s no margin for that\u201d for a lawmaker of the opposite party. \u201cEven if it were possible, the grass roots have become so polarized that it\u2019s now seen as a negative, even dangerous,\u201d Mr. Weber said.Mr. Obama, after forcing through an aggressive economic and social agenda in his first two years in office, quickly grew frustrated with Republican resistance and engaged in a concerted campaign to go around lawmakers. His series of executive actions on health care, immigration and the environment drove Republicans into a frenzy of opposition. As divisions grew, Mr. Obama was increasingly defiant about his prerogative to act where Congress would not.In the process, the two parties spent much of the Obama era trying to make the other responsible for the sorry state of political relations and gridlock. But both have contributed, as the permanent battle for congressional supremacy has at times led lawmakers to put political gain ahead of national interest and to oppose bills they actually support.\u201cTo have the president of the United States talk about it in a State of the Union message illustrated that, without romanticizing the past, our politics is fundamentally changed from what it was, and in very disturbing ways,\u201d Mr. Weber said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t yet fully figured out, as the political class, what exactly is the source of this.\u201dAs room for compromise disappeared, the public grew grimmer in its assessment as well.In 2007, as the presidency of George W. Bush drew to a close, two-thirds of Americans thought the country was more politically divided than in the past, according to a poll by the Pew Research Center. With Mr. Obama\u2019s election, that number dropped 20 percentage points, to 46 percent, but it has risen steadily throughout his tenure. The latest survey, conducted in the fall of 2015, found 79 percent saying the country was more polarized than it had been before.Seeking a solution, Mr. Obama on Tuesday advocated a series of nuts-and-bolts changes along with his grander call for more civic engagement. But the steps he outlined \u2014 nonpartisan redistricting, campaign finance changes, rules to ease voting \u2014 are the kind that both sides talk about but rarely act on because of the political advantages one side or the other sees in maintaining the current system. Republicans, who control most state legislatures, like the current system of redistricting because it allows them to draw the lines. (Democrats enjoy the same advantage in states where they have the upper hand.)The question is whether this time will be any different, though Mr. Obama pledged to press the case in his final year and when he is out of office.At the same time, the president has no plans to pull back on his aggressive use of unilateral action to skirt Congress and accomplish his objectives, promising still more fodder for the cycle of division and blame he assailed in Tuesday\u2019s speech.Nor will Republicans shy from opposing such actions. Hours after Mr. Obama finished speaking on Tuesday, the House voted to nullify a set of water regulations Mr. Obama had issued, denouncing what they called another power grab. After that vote, they headed to Baltimore for a joint House-Senate retreat to plot an aggressive opposition agenda for 2016.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Some Would Level the Playing Field: Free Harvard Degrees", "Date": "2016-01-14", "News": "Supported byShould Harvard be free?But they have tied the notion to another, equally provocative question: Does Harvard shortchange Asian-Americans in admissions?Their argument is that if Harvard were free, more highly qualified students from all backgrounds would apply, and the university would no longer have trouble balancing its class for racial or ethnic diversity \u2014 making sure, they say, that Asian-Americans do not lose out.Coincidence or not, the plaintiffs in that case are seeking from Harvard exactly what the Unz slate wants: disclosure of data showing how the university\u2019s freshman class is selected each year.The politically charged data holds the potential to reveal whether Harvard bypasses better-qualified Asian-American candidates in favor of whites, blacks, Hispanics and the children of the wealthy and powerful, the group argues.\u201cOur focus is entirely on greater transparency in admissions,\u201d Mr. Unz said, \u201cnamely urging Harvard to provide much more detailed information on how they select the very small slice of applicants receiving offers of admission, in order to curb the huge potential abuse possible under the entirely opaque system.\u201dThe expense of college has become a hot topic in the presidential race, with several candidates proposing solutions ranging from government-financed tuition to private investors\u2019 financing of school expenses in exchange for a share of an individual\u2019s future earnings. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill have proposed an idea similar to the one held by Mr. Unz\u2019s slate \u2014 that college endowments be tapped to cover tuition.The United States Supreme Court is considering whether race should be used as a factor in college admissions. As so-called underrepresented minorities \u2014 blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans \u2014 get a boost at Harvard and many other colleges, some Asian-Americans are among those who say they are not treated fairly.Maybe. Officials at Harvard suggested that even if the slate were to win, the idea is a nonstarter, pointing out that the endowment is split into thousands of funds designated for specific uses that have nothing to do with undergraduates.\u201cThere is a common misconception that endowments, including Harvard\u2019s, can be accessed like bank accounts, used for anything at any time as long as funds are available,\u201d Jeff Neal, a Harvard spokesman, said. \u201cIn reality, Harvard\u2019s flexibility in spending from the endowment is limited by the fact that it must be maintained in perpetuity and that it is largely restricted by the explicit wishes of those who contributed the endowed funds.\u201dMr. Neal also said that although tuition is high, Harvard, like many universities with large endowments, is generous with financial aid, awarding more than $1.4 billion to undergraduates in the past decade.But Mr. Unz says that even with potential aid, prospective low-income applicants may be discouraged by the published tuition of $45,000 a year.Lawmakers have proposed requiring that about 90 colleges with endowments of $1 billion or more spend about 25 percent of their annual earnings for tuition assistance \u2014 or forfeit their tax exemptions.Representative Tom Reed, a New York Republican who is behind the proposal, said this would partly address a crisis in college costs for low- and middle-income families.At universities like Harvard with large endowments, Mr. Reed said, \u201cif my math is correct, that would essentially wipe out any tuition bill that a child would be responsible for.\u201dMr. Nader, who also got his law degree from Harvard, said the admissions system has been \u201cbollixed up for decades\u201d by legacies and other preferences.The Board of Overseers, with 30 members elected for rotating six-year terms, is the second most powerful board at the university. Members are generally elected from nominees selected by the Harvard Alumni Association.To be placed on the ballot, other candidates must get petitions signed this month by 201 Harvard graduates.Mr. Unz, who these days is busy collecting signatures, believes his group stands a good chance.

Its mission is growing ever more urgent: to cut smuggling routes used by jihadists who have turned this inhospitable terrain into a sprawling security challenge for African and international forces alike.But, analysts and military officials say, there is also deepening collaboration among groups using modern communications and a sophisticated system of roving trainers to share military tactics, media strategies and ways of transferring money.Their threat has grown as Libya \u2014 with its ungoverned spaces, oil, ports, and proximity to Europe and the Middle East \u2014 becomes a budding hub of operations for both Al Qaeda and the Islamic State to reach deeper into Africa.And as Africa\u2019s jihadists come under the wing of distant and more powerful patrons, officials fear that they are extending their reach and stitching together their ambitions, turning once-local actors into pan-national threats.\u201cTerrorists with allegiances to multiple groups are expanding their collaboration in recruitment, financing, training and operations, both within Africa and transregionally,\u201d General Rodriguez warned months before the Mali attack.The transfer of expertise can be witnessed in the spread of suicide bombings in Libya, Tunisia and Chad and in the growing use of improvised explosive devices in Mali, analysts and officials pointed out.Such exchanges have been enhanced as groups shift shape, sometimes merge, and come under the wing of more powerful and distant patrons.The leaders of the two groups \u2014 Abdelmalek Droukdel and Mokhtar Belmokhtar, both Algerians \u2014 have loyalties that reach far beyond Africa, however.All three men are veterans of fighting in Afghanistan in the 1980s, swore allegiance to Osama bin Laden and now profess loyalty to Al Qaeda\u2019s current leader, Ayman al-Zawahri, based in Pakistan.Mr. Droukdel, routed by French forces in Mali in 2013, is reportedly holed up in the mountains in southern Algeria. Mr. Belmokhtar and Mr. Ben Hassine have made rear bases in Libya, where they have been targeted by American airstrikes.Today, despite French and American efforts to disrupt their networks, they still stretch across the continent.French troops have led repeated operations to break communication and supply lines from Libya that have fortified such groups. The November operation was part of coordinated maneuvers in eastern Mali and northern Niger to try to disrupt jihadist links between the two nations.The smuggling route patrolled by the French is one of the main arteries for jihadists, arms and drugs. French troops call it the \u201cautoroute\u201d to southern Libya, which they describe as a \u201cbig supermarket\u201d for weapons.The route crosses one of the most remote places on earth. Devoid of human habitation or water for hundreds of miles, it is a treacherous terrain of unbearable heat in the summer and nearly impossible navigation. Yet small convoys of smugglers attempt the crossing several times a week.For the French, it is like looking for a tiny craft in an ocean, said Lt. Col. \u00c9tienne du Peyroux, the commanding officer leading the Niger operation.\u201cIt is like a naval battle,\u201d he said, sketching out the hunt on maps on the hood of his desert jeep. \u201cThe zone of operations is 40,000 square kilometers, an area the size of Holland, for 300 men.\u201d\u201cWe try to find them, to block, to constrain, to work out how they will be channeled by a particular piece of terrain,\u201d he said.The French rarely catch anyone \u2014 the last capture was of a drug haul in June. But, they say, their operations are at least disrupting the jihadists\u2019 movements, evidenced by a drop in traffic and tracks in the sand showing smugglers\u2019 vehicles having turned back.\u201cWe want them to abandon the fight, until they cannot do it anymore or until the effort is too great,\u201d the colonel said.That, however, seems unlikely. \u201cWeak government and chaos are always conducive to terrorism,\u201d said Hans-Jakob Schindler, coordinator of a United Nations Security Council committee that monitors the Qaeda sanctions list. \u201cThese groups do take advantage of that.\u201dThe development of jihadist training camps in Libya over the past four years represents a regional and international threat, with particular significance for Africa, he warned in a recent report.Especially worrying, he said, is \u201cthe growing numbers of foreign terrorist fighters and the presence of a globalized group of terrorists from different Al Qaeda backgrounds.\u201dNorth Africa and the Sahel, a vast area the breadth of the United States \u2014 with its difficult geography, impoverished populations and weak states \u2014 is acutely vulnerable, military and civilian analysts said.Poverty, corruption, poor government and unfair elections are all making populations susceptible to Islamist propaganda, said Adam Thiam, a columnist for the Malian daily newspaper Le R\u00e9publicain.\u201cElections are corrupt; services are corrupt,\u201d he said, and young people have lost confidence in government, \u201cso they will go and listen to the religious leaders rather than the political leaders.\u201dOthers blame foreign interventions in Libya and Mali, and repressive counterrevolutions like Egypt\u2019s, for fueling support for the jihadists.\u201cThey do not need much; they just need to be determined,\u201d said Col. Louis Pena, a commander of French troops in N\u2019Djamena, Chad.The deepening reach of Al Qaeda and the arrival of the Islamic State are raising fresh alarm.While the two groups are rivals, that competition can pose a significant challenge from a broader security standpoint \u2014 as extremists seek to prove their potency and relevance, inspire and attract recruits, and play on a bigger stage.Boko Haram has been around for two decades. But money and training from Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb gave its leader, Abubakar Shekau, a substantial boost when he assumed control in 2010.Last year, Boko Haram switched allegiance to the Islamic State, which claimed that its West Africa division had killed more than 1,000 people since November, according to the Site Intelligence Group, which monitors jihadist websites.Despite setbacks in Nigeria, Boko Haram has become a regional scourge by exploiting contacts in the wider jihadist network, and it has now spilled into Chad, Cameroon and Niger.At Madama, an oasis about 50 miles south of Libya, a mud-brick fort built by the French in 1931 guards Niger\u2019s northern desert approaches.In the past two years, the French have built a sprawling base dwarfing the old fort still manned by Nigerien troops, and posted 300 French troops to create a buffer against jihadist advances from Libya.Nigerien soldiers accompany the French on their missions, hurtling in battered pickups across the desert terrain, much like their jihadist opponents do. Many of the local soldiers have been through six-month training programs run by American forces. Farther east, Chadian troops guard their part of the border.In this lonely spot, French soldiers watch from their guard post out across the empty sand toward Libya. French commanders agree that the root of the problem is there, and that until it is addressed the entire region is threatened.\u201cThey are still fragile countries,\u201d Colonel Pena said. \u201cThey are countries that need stability to grow and develop. That is the real danger.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Saturday about signs of increased collaboration by once-competitive jihadist groups in North Africa misstated the nationality of the troops manning a mud-brick fort in the Sahara and those accompanying French soldiers on their missions to cut jihadist smuggling routes across the desert. They are Nigerien, or from Niger, not Nigerian.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Planned Parenthood, in Its First Primary Endorsement, Backs Hillary Clinton", "Date": "2016-01-07", "News": "Planned Parenthood, which has become an ideological minefield in the 2016 presidential election, said Thursday that it would endorse Hillary Clinton \u2014 its first endorsement in a presidential primary in the nonprofit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 100-year existence.Mrs. Clinton will officially accept the group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s support Sunday at a campaign rally in Manchester, N.H. The decision to break with tradition and endorse Mrs. Clinton comes as the House has approved a measure, endorsed by the leading Republican presidential candidates, that would repeal parts of the Affordable Care Act and strip away federal financing for Planned Parenthood, which provides reproductive and health care services.\u00e2\u0080\u009cEverything Planned Parenthood has believed in and fought for over the past 100 years is on the ballot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood.In a statement, Mrs. Clinton said she was \u00e2\u0080\u009chonored\u00e2\u0080\u009d by the endorsement and called the bill to defund the group \u00e2\u0080\u009ca jarring reminder of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at stake in 2016,\u00e2\u0080\u009d adding that as president she would \u00e2\u0080\u009cdefend against attacks on reproductive health care, and protect access to affordable contraception and safe and legal abortion across the country.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe endorsement, technically made through the nonprofit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advocacy arm, the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, brings with it at least $20 million to spend in this election cycle on presidential and Senate races in crucial battleground states, including New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania and WisconsinOther groups that support abortion rights, including NARAL Pro-Choice America PAC, have already endorsed Mrs. Clinton. But in Planned Parenthood\u2019s case, Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future and the group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s are intrinsically linked: Planned Parenthood needs to have a Democrat elected president to protect its funding, and Mrs. Clinton is hoping abortion rights and the Republican candidates\u2019 positions will motivate female voters to support her.In almost every speech, Mrs. Clinton receives some of her most rousing applause with the line: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am for a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right to choose, and I will fight against efforts to defund Planned Parenthood.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe Clinton campaign has functioned almost as a marketing arm for Planned Parenthood, featuring a section on its official website titled \u00e2\u0080\u009c17 times Hillary Clinton stood with Planned Parenthood,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Facebook messages and Instagram posts with the hashtag #StandwithPP. (Ms. Richards\u2019 daughter works on the campaign\u2019s staff in Iowa.)The strategy has merits. While Republican promises to restrict abortion rights resonate with conservative voters, polls show that access to legal abortion is one of the most motivating issues for female voters, particularly in critical swing states.The endorsement does not come without risks for Mrs. Clinton. Planned Parenthood is a polarizing topic and the group suffered damaging public relations setbacks this summer when anti-abortion rights activists released video of an official from the group discussing the price of providing fetal parts. Mrs. Clinton promptly called the video part of a \u00e2\u0080\u009cconcerted attack\u00e2\u0080\u009d against \u00e2\u0080\u009ca woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right to choose.\u00e2\u0080\u009dConservatives accused the group of profiting from the sale of fetal tissue (a charge Ms. Richards called \u201ccategorically untrue\u201d) and threatened to shut down the government rather than continue federal funding for the group. Republican presidential candidates, most notably the lone woman in the Republican field, Carly Fiorina, seized on the controversy to denounce the Planned Parenthood\u2019s videos in visceral terms.Both Mrs. Clinton and Planned Parenthood have tried to remind voters that the group\u2019s clinics around the country provide more than reproductive services to nearly three million mostly low-income and minority patients. \u201cFor many women, we are their only doctor,\u201d Ms. Richards said. At the rally on Sunday in Manchester, Natarsha McQueen, a 40-year-old Planned Parenthood volunteer from Brooklyn, N.Y., is set to tell her story of detecting breast cancer at a local Planned Parenthood clinic.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in the same economic state or haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been to our communities, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t relate to how important this is to women of color,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. McQueen said.Mrs. Richards said the Planned Parenthood Action Fund sent endorsement surveys out to all the presidential candidates on both sides, but only heard back from Democrats. She said Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record on women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s issues and health care gave her an edge against her Democratic rivals, including Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

Its revenue was weaker than Wall Street analysts had anticipated. The falloff in sales from its big oil-field equipment unit was one reason, but so was $1 billion in other equipment deals that G.E. expected to close in the fourth quarter but did not. G.E. executives insisted that most of those were fairly normal delays in completing heavy-equipment transactions rather than a signal that customers were becoming reluctant to buy, given the uncertain economic outlook.In a conference call, Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.\u2019s chief executive, said the crucial signal of future business for the company \u2014 orders for its industrial products \u2014 was growing. And at the end of 2015, the company said it had a robust $315 billion backlog of orders for products including jet engines, power turbines and railway locomotives, and for services to care for the machinery.Mr. Immelt acknowledged the sluggish global economy and the \u201cespecially volatile\u201d early weeks of 2016. But he emphasized that G.E.\u2019s diverse collection of industrial businesses, its global reach and its cost-cutting programs should allow it to achieve double-digit profit growth this year. \u201cWe have all the elements to help ourselves in a tough economy,\u201d he said.The financial scorecard for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2015 provides further evidence of the progress G.E. is making as it focuses increasingly on its industrial operations and pares back its once-huge finance arm, GE Capital.Revenue for the quarter rose 1 percent to $33.89 billion, below the analysts\u2019 forecast of $35.96 billion. G.E.\u2019s share price fell 2 percent shortly after it announced the results and closed down 1.2 percent.\u201cThe revenue shortfall was a disappointment,\u201d said Steven Winoker, an analyst at Bernstein Research. But the strong order backlog and disciplined management of expenses, he said, should \u201cease concerns.\u201dG.E. is undergoing two major shifts: in its portfolio of businesses, by shedding financial assets; and on the industrial side, by moving to become what G.E. executives call a \u201cdigital industrial company.\u201dG.E. is a leader among industrial companies in placing sensors on heavy equipment and then analyzing the machine data with software to predict, for example, when a locomotive needs maintenance before it breaks down. The company\u2019s revenue in its digital business rose 22 percent to $5 billion last year, with a goal, set by Mr. Immelt, of reaching $20 billion by 2020.But Alstom, G.E. executives said, adds significantly to the global stance of G.E.\u2019s power-generation business. About $30 billion of G.E.\u2019s $315 billion backlog comes from Alstom, said Jeffrey S. Bornstein, G.E.\u2019s chief financial officer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "President Obama May Require Federal Contractors to List Campaign Gifts", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama is seriously considering an executive order that would require companies doing business with the federal government to disclose their political contributions, White House officials said on Tuesday, a step long awaited by activists to reduce the influence of secretive corporate donations in elections.The directive, known as the \u201cdark money\u201d executive order, would mandate that government contractors publicly report their contributions to groups that spend money to influence campaigns. Advocates inside and outside the White House believe the executive order would prompt some companies to spend less, by exposing their donations to public scrutiny. Mr. Obama has been considering the action for more than a year, but discussions have intensified in recent weeks, according to activists and administration officials, as the president moves to deliver on unfulfilled promises in his final year in office. Brandi Hoffine, a White House spokeswoman, declined to comment on internal deliberations, and officials said no final decisions had been made.\u201cWhile we will continue to examine additional steps we can take to reduce the corrosive influence of money in politics, only Congress can put an end to it,\u201d Ms. Hoffine said. She noted that legislation to require companies to reveal their campaign giving, known as the Disclose Act, died in 2012 amid Republican opposition.In a report last spring, Public Citizen Congress Watch estimated that the proposed directive would apply to 70 percent of Fortune 100 companies, noting that large ones including Exxon Mobil, Apple, General Motors and General Electric had federal contracts worth more than $100,000 over the previous year.Business groups that have fiercely opposed campaign finance restrictions argue that the executive order would encroach on free speech rights. And some advocates have privately questioned whether the directive would be enforceable.\u201cThe real goal of the disclosure proponents is to harass, intimidate and silence those with whom they disagree,\u201d said Blair Latoff Holmes, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \u201cWe continue to believe that one\u2019s political activities should play no role in whether or not you get or keep a federal contract, and we encourage the administration to leave this bad idea right where it is.\u201dBut outside groups that have long pressed for Mr. Obama to act on his own believe the moment is close at hand. In his State of the Union address last week, the president made a lengthy plea to \u201cfix our politics,\u201d specifically calling for reducing the role of money in campaigns and denying \u201chidden interests\u201d the ability to bankroll elections.The discussions are intensifying at a time when Mr. Obama has made it clear that he is looking for expansive ways to use his executive power before leaving office.\u201cWe\u2019ll do audacious executive action throughout the course of the year \u2014 I\u2019m confident about that,\u201d Denis R. McDonough, his chief of staff, told reporters the morning after Mr. Obama\u2019s speech. He added that the president had informed his staff that the central question he would be asking himself about potential actions was, \u201cWhy not?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going to lean pretty hard into it,\u201d Mr. McDonough said.Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has been among the advocates for the move, officials and advocates said. Administration aides said that top White House officials, including David Simas, who leads Mr. Obama\u2019s political team, and W. Neil Eggleston, the White House counsel, were weighing the move but had not yet reached a decision. Still, proponents heard last week\u2019s speech as a signal that a president who came to office promising to transform politics and has often called for campaign reforms \u2014 but has never used his authority to force them \u2014 was ready to act more aggressively.\u201cThis issue of dealing with the systemic problem of money in politics is outrageously popular, and there\u2019s no rational reason for the administration to be presiding over an approach of do-nothingness \u2014 it has been a huge disappointment,\u201d said Lisa Gilbert, the director of Public Citizen. \u201cWe took this loud call to action in the State of the Union as a signal that they are changing course.\u201dMr. Obama has \u201cnot yet done the simple thing that he can do,\u201d Ms. Gilbert said, referring to the executive order, adding that last week\u2019s speech was \u201cfinally an acknowledgment that this is not the legacy that he wants on this issue.\u201d Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, spoke to Mr. Obama in person about the executive order in November and handed him a letter from 155 Democrats urging him to issue it. \u201cRequiring corporations to disclose their unlimited spending in our elections was the only path the misguided Citizens United Supreme Court decision left us to protect the sanctity of our democracy,\u201d she said through a spokesman.Around the time she met with the president, a coalition of 19 outside interest groups led by Rootstrikers, a grass-roots activist organization, launched a petition on the White House website calling on Mr. Obama to \u201ctake action to fight secret money immediately \u2014 and redeem your failed money-in-politics legacy.\u201d It specifically called for the executive order.\u201cYou must act now or be remembered as the president whose inaction aided the rise of secret money politics,\u201d said the petition, which gathered more than 100,000 signatures within 30 days \u2014 the threshold for getting a White House response. Lawmakers who have long pushed for stricter campaign finance rules said the order would build momentum for broader changes.\u201cIt\u2019s the easy thing that he can do,\u201d Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, said. \u201cIt gets at a little bit of the problem, but more to the point, it buoys everybody who\u2019s looking at this disgraceful political mess that we have out there that is infuriating Democrats and Republicans alike with the sense that they don\u2019t control politics anymore, and it\u2019s all being left to the special interests.\u201dRepresentative John Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, who has introduced legislation to finance congressional campaigns with public money, said the order would be part of a \u201cpackage of solutions\u201d he has discussed with Mr. Obama to contain the influence of corporations in politics and empower ordinary citizens.\u201cIt\u2019s about having a referee there to police the conduct of the big-money players, but also bringing everyday Americans out of the bleachers and out onto the field themselves,\u201d Mr. Sarbanes said.Advertisement"}

Ms. Mota was still in her pajamas as the men approached her parents\u2019 breezeblock house. She was in the bedroom, but most of her family was in the front room, cooing over a newborn baby. As the family prepared a milk bottle, the assassins smashed the door open. Amid the commotion, Ms. Mota came out of her bedroom and said firmly, \u201cI am Gisela.\u201d In front of her terrified family, the men beat Ms. Mota and shot her several times, killing her.Five days after the killing, Ms. Mota\u2019s mother, Juana Ocampo, joined a march through Temixco along with hundreds of residents dressed in white. Ms. Ocampo, a veteran community activist, knew her daughter had taken a dangerous job; hired killers, known as sicarios, have killed almost 100 mayors in Mexico in the last decade. But Ms. Mota had been undeterred.\u201cSince Gisela was a child, she wanted to get into politics, to change things,\u201d Ms. Ocampo told me. Ms. Mota had called for an end to corruption in Temixco and for police reform, which may have made her a target. Still, Ms. Ocampo said, \u201cI had never imagined that something like this could happen.\u201d Ms. Ocampo, her face strong, held back her pain and tears. \u201cI hope there is justice. Or we will have to take actions to demand that justice is done and the case is cleared up.\u201d Marchers held banners proclaiming, \u201cI am Gisela.\u201dMs. Mota\u2019s murder is the latest turn in the evolution of the Mexican drug business, a process that American and Mexican officials seem unable to grasp. For a decade, Mexican troops have worked with American agents to pursue kingpins, in what is known as the cartel decapitation strategy. Flamboyant gangsters with nicknames like \u201cTony Tormenta,\u201d \u201cthe Engineer\u201d and \u201cthe Viceroy\u201d have been shot down or arrested. El Chapo, or Shorty, has been detained twice in less than two years. Yet while these kingpins rot in prisons and graves, their assassins have formed their own organizations, which can be even more violent and predatory.Morelos State, which is home to Temixco, is a bloody example. Dotted with green valleys and hot springs, it had long been used by a drug lord called Arturo Beltr\u00e1n Leyva, alias \u201cthe Beard,\u201d to fly in cocaine from Colombia before taking it north. Mr. Beltr\u00e1n Leyva was an ally-turned-enemy of El Chapo who rivaled him in his capacity to move product. But during the early 2000s, while Mr. Beltr\u00e1n Leyva built his empire in Morelos, murder rates were relatively low.In 2009, American agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration got intelligence on Mr. Beltr\u00e1n Leyva\u2019s whereabouts. The D.E.A. gave the address to Mexican marines \u2014 an elite American-trained force \u2014 who stormed in, killing Mr. Beltr\u00e1n Leyva and four of his accomplices. A senior D.E.A. official told me they paid their informant a $5 million reward for the information that led to the takedown \u2014 taxpayer money spent to try and win the drug war.But now gangsters are flipping this century-old deal. Instead of handing out bribes, they are making the mayors pay them. Politics is not just a way to help their criminal businesses; it is a business in itself. And as they take control of these politicians, the cartels transform themselves into an ominous shadow power, using the tools of the state to affect anyone who lives or works in its jurisdiction.International companies continue to operate in such cartel-dominated areas, especially in mining and increasingly in gas and oil. They have to work with mayors to coordinate operations and regulatory compliance; as a result, an American executive for one mining company in Guerrero told me, businesses have no choice but to deal with suspect officials (though they try to identify and avoid working with the worst of them).Company bosses prefer not to talk publicly about the level of cartel control, as it offends their political partners in Mexico. But last year Rob McEwen, the chairman and chief executive of the Canadian company McEwen Mining, broke the silence after gangsters stole more than $8 million worth of his gold from a mine in northwest Mexico.As cartels have entrenched themselves in Mexico\u2019s local politics, finding a solution to the drug war mess has gotten even tougher. Drug policy reform, meaning wider legalization of some drugs, like marijuana, and better addiction treatment to reduce the use of others, like heroin, can help bleed the gangster financing. But with cartels now diversified into a portfolio of crimes and taking over the political establishment, it won\u2019t stop them.The most obvious response is to build an effective justice system to crack down on sicarios. Police reform, including incorporating Mexico\u2019s city-level officers into unified state forces, a step that Ms. Mota had supported, could help confront cartels. City police alone are too weak against the firepower of the gangster militias. Such a reform would also take some heat off mayors \u2014 if they didn\u2019t command their own police forces, they would be of less use to the crime bosses.Mexico also needs local politicians who can stand up to both the silver of bribery and lead of bullets. Unfortunately, the sheer brutality of murders like Ms. Mota\u2019s is a chilling example for those brave young people who might venture to follow her.Ioan Grillo is the author of the forthcoming book \u201cGangster Warlords: Drug Dollars, Killing Fields and the New Politics of Latin America.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Breakthrough Is Seen to Bolster U.S. on World Stage", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byNews Analysis\u201cOur national security and our economic security were very much at stake,\u201d Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said of the showdown over the I.M.F. \u201cAnd as someone who for the last three years has gone to international meetings\u201d \u2014 where he was badgered by ministers frustrated by American inaction \u2014 \u201cI can tell you that it was ratcheting to the point where it was doing real damage.\u201dAs 2016 begins, much has changed.\u201cIt\u2019s been critically important to get this done,\u201d Mr. Lew said in an interview. \u201cThe I.M.F. is really the first line of defense, the first responder, in global economic and financial crises. And for 70 years the United States has played the driving leadership role in the organization.\u201d\u201cThe U.S. has an opportunity now to set what its strategy is internationally on the economic side, but also on the strategic side, the security side,\u201d he said, adding that Mr. Lew\u2019s decision to work with Congress on the I.M.F. \u201cshows a kind of principled leadership.\u201d\u201cToo bad it took five years, to be sure,\u201d he said.That damaging delay, and conditions that Congress imposed, left Edwin M. Truman, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and an assistant secretary of the Treasury for international affairs during the Clinton administration, with a glass \u201conly half full with champagne,\u201d he wrote after the I.M.F. measure\u2019s passage.\u201cWhether you\u2019re talking about trade or aid or finance or whatever, the politics of the country are in the direction of \u2018The world is dirty; let\u2019s wall ourselves off from it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Truman said in an interview.That was reflected, he said, in the \u201cstealth\u201d way that Mr. Lew had to work behind the scenes to ensure Republicans\u2019 assent, given the I.M.F.\u2019s unpopularity with conservatives. And it shows, he added, in the language of Republicans seeking their party\u2019s presidential nomination: \u201cWe either want to say, \u2018Our way or the highway,\u2019 or we say, \u2018Build a wall.\u2019\u201dThe overhaul of the I.M.F., which now has 188 countries as members, will be the most significant since the organization was formed in 1945 as an international lender of last resort to foster global stability and reduce poverty after decades of world wars and economic depression.The changes, spearheaded in 2010 by the Obama administration, are intended to reset members\u2019 quotas for contributions and their voting shares to better reflect the current world. They would raise the status of emerging nations \u2014 in particular China, but also India, Russia and Brazil \u2014 at the expense of European and Persian Gulf nations. The United States would retain its veto power.While quotas would be doubled to buttress I.M.F. lending, that would cost the United States and other countries relatively little because emergency funds affluent countries provided in the crisis would be counted toward members\u2019 quotas.Yet after taking the lead in designing the overhaul, the United States was the holdout as the proposal languished in Congress. \u201cMy counterparts were saying, \u2018We trust you, but we don\u2019t know if we trust the United States to get this done,\u2019\u201d Mr. Lew said.He pressed Republican leaders in Congress and by April had their commitments to help pass the overhaul in 2015. Mr. Lew said he took part in hundreds of calls \u2014 including a crucial round with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, while he was in Armenia for the centennial of the Armenian massacre. With the phone system there overwhelmed by the throngs in the streets, the Americans kept losing their connections, Mr. Lew recalled.For months, a series of bills were considered and rejected as vehicles for an I.M.F. amendment, out of fear that the I.M.F. bill would endanger its carrier. In December, the overhaul got its ride on the year\u2019s last must-pass bill, which funded government operations through September.Mr. Lew said two factors crystallized the argument that American credibility and leadership were at stake. One was the need to persuade the I.M.F., and the emerging nations among its members, to aid Ukraine. The other was the rise of China\u2019s new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which was poised to fill a vacuum left by the United States.While I.M.F. members and its managing director, Christine Lagarde, supported the change, Mr. Truman called it \u201ca horrible precedent\u201d for Congress to impose such conditions. Still, he applauded Mr. Taylor for his role in gathering Republican support.Mr. Taylor, for his part, said: \u201cThis is an international organization, and many parts of the country don\u2019t even know what it is. Members had to have a reason to vote for it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Broken System\u2019 Allows ISIS to Profit From Looted Antiquities", "Date": "2016-01-09", "News": "Supported byLaws around the world are weak and inconsistent, and customs enforcement can screen only a portion of what crosses international borders, according to officials and experts in trafficking. Long-established smuggling organizations are practiced in getting the goods to people willing to pay for them, and patient enough to stash ancient artifacts in warehouses until scrutiny dies down. Despite a near-universal outcry over the Islamic State\u2019s actions, few countries have shown interest in imposing new restrictions to curb the booming trade in antiquities, estimated to be worth billions of dollars a year.Officials still do not know how the artifacts ended up in Shumen or whether they passed through Islamic State territory. For every seizure like the one here, many other pieces are believed to reach dealers and buyers in Vienna, Munich, London and New York. Dealers exploit the legal trade in antiquities to move objects that have been looted for years amid the conflicts in Syria and Iraq, as well as Libya, Yemen and Egypt, officials and experts said.\u201cWe\u2019re faced with the largest-scale mass destruction of cultural heritage since the Second World War, and we\u2019re going to have to do something about it,\u201d said France Desmarais, director of programs and partnerships at the International Council of Museums.The scale of the looting under the Islamic State has prompted many nations to try to stanch the flow, and the revenue, though it is hardly the group\u2019s largest source, given its trade in oil.Still, such efforts have done little to plug gaps in the enforcement of laws against trafficking or to stifle the insatiable demand of the antiquities market. In Germany, like some other countries, privacy laws protect buyers and sellers from scrutiny. The United States has no explicit prohibition on the sale of artifacts from Syria.Some of the collectors willing to buy black-market artifacts are believed to be in Persian Gulf countries. But many others, experts say, are in the West.\u201cThere appears to be an interesting geographic divide: Pre-Islamic objects go to Europe and North America, while Islamic art goes to countries of the gulf,\u201d said Markus Hilgert, director of the Museum of the Ancient Near East in Berlin, who is coordinating a research project on the illicit trade.Since 2011, the authorities in Turkey have seized 6,800 objects, a majority of them coins, and are holding them in regional museums until their origins can be determined, according to Necati Anaz, the deputy manager of the International Center for Terrorism and Transnational Crime in Ankara. Dr. Anaz said the challenge was that many of the smallest objects could easily be carried in bags or in clothes.Many of the recently looted artifacts, antiquities experts say, are probably being kept in warehouses in or near Syria and Iraq until attention has waned.\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate how patient the dealers with international connections are,\u201d he said.After antiquities leave the Islamic State\u2019s territory, experts say they fall into the hands of existing smuggling and criminal networks that are practiced at trafficking people, drugs or other contraband from Syria and Iraq. \u201cOnce they hit these networks, they go everywhere, and they\u2019re very hard to track,\u201d said Brent Easter, a customs special agent in New York who investigates art smuggling.Bulgaria, which is home to scores of ancient sites, has a notorious history as a conduit for smuggling, officials said. When illicit antiquities cross into Europe, it becomes easier for smugglers to create documents listing them as authentic discoveries that can be legally bought and sold.\u201cWe are the most direct route from Turkey and the Middle East,\u201d said Bozhidar Dimitrov, the director of the National History Museum in Sofia.Vladimir Kaidzhiyev, a senior police inspector in Shumen, said the police had acted on information that a smuggling network was moving a shipment through the region. Early one morning in March, dozens of officers raided the shed and three other places.They confiscated more than 9,000 items, including figurines, jewelry and coins that were 2,000 years old, as well as molds and other material that suggested some of them could be fakes. The 19 larger sculptures included a lion\u2019s head, a Gorgon relief and a funerary panel. Many were encrusted with dirt, suggesting they had been excavated recently, not taken from a museum.\u201cI\u2019ve seen something like this only in Rome,\u201d said Inspector Kaidzhiyev, who typically investigates more common crimes.The larger pieces had coded labels; the tablet, for example, was marked 12x. Three suspects were arrested, including the owner of the shed, Veysel Sanli, a Turk with citizenship in Bulgaria. They are free on bail while the investigation continues.The prosecutor overseeing the case, Margarita Georgieva, said in an interview that the items had arrived from Turkey, but that investigators had not been able to establish their destination or provenance, which makes trafficking cases hard to prosecute.She said Mr. Sanli claimed to collect as a hobby and to have acquired some of the items from a shop in Izmir, Turkey, though the shop specializes in reproductions, and the seized goods appeared genuine. She added that investigators had found photographs of more artifacts on Mr. Sanli\u2019s cellphone and on memory cards, suggesting they were being offered for sale in Germany.\u201cThere are not many people who could afford these items,\u201d Ms. Georgieva said.So far, Mr. Sanli has been charged only with possessing cultural property, a crime punishable by one to six years in prison. Reached through his Facebook account, he declined to comment.The State Department is discussing the case with Bulgaria.For now, the items remain in storage in the regional history museum in Shumen. The museum\u2019s director, Georgi Maystorksi, expressed relief that at least they had not fallen into private hands, never to be seen or studied. \u201cThere are so few successes in this world,\u201d he said.An article on Jan. 10 about the barriers that hamper the international fight against the illegal trafficking of antiquities, a crime that reached new heights as the Islamic State terrorist group plundered ancient sites in Syria and Iraq, misstated the year that the group declared its caliphate.

{"Headline": "Anger in Michigan Over Appointing Emergency Managers", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "Supported byLANSING, Mich. \u2014 In the spring of 2013, Detroit was groaning under the weight of its troubles. It had accumulated billions in debt, was riddled with crime and had seen much of its affluent tax base disappear. A former mayor, Kwame M. Kilpatrick, was convicted of racketeering and fraud.Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, swept in with a rescue plan: the appointment of an emergency manager, Kevyn D. Orr, who was charged with saving a city in fiscal despair. Many Detroiters were furious that Mr. Orr, then a high-profile bankruptcy lawyer from Chevy Chase, Md., had been given a role with extraordinary power, usurping control from local elected officials.In the cases of both Flint and the Detroit Public Schools, governance was under the jurisdiction of the governor, rather than local officials closer to the ground.In Flint, emergency managers not only oversaw the city \u2014 effectively seizing legal authority from the mayor and City Council \u2014 but also pressed to switch the source of the financially troubled city\u2019s water supply to save money.In Detroit, the schools are on the brink of insolvency after a series of emergency managers dating to 2009 repeatedly failed to grapple with its financial troubles, while also falling short on maintaining school buildings and addressing academic deficiencies. The current emergency manager for the schools, Darnell Earley, previously served in that role in Flint.Under the administration of Mr. Snyder, who has held office since 2011, seven cities or school districts have been declared financial emergencies and placed under appointed management, state officials said. During the eight-year tenure of his predecessor, Jennifer M. Granholm, a Democrat, five cities or school districts were given emergency managers.Three school districts \u2014 but no municipalities \u2014 remain under the control of emergency managers, a state official said.Residents of majority-black cities have long cried foul over the practice. They argue that it disenfranchises voters and violates a deeply felt ethos of American democracy that allows for local representation. They also say emergency management gives influence to what is now a mostly white, Republican leadership in Lansing, the state capital. And they worry that in their decisions, emergency managers are more concerned with fiscal discipline than public health.\u201cTell me what race dominates in those communities that get emergency managers?\u201d said Hubert Yopp, the mayor of Highland Park, Mich., which is 93 percent black and in past years has had an emergency manager. \u201cPeople have a very real reason to question what that\u2019s about. It would be one thing if the emergency managers worked with the local governments to make things better. But it\u2019s about having dictator power in the city. The locals have no say.\u201dSome form of state-over-locality oversight exists in about 20 states, with laws allowing for an appointed manager or board to advise distressed cities and school districts, said Eric Scorsone, the director of the Center for Local Government Finance and Policy at Michigan State University.Central Falls, R.I., went into receivership for a year before it declared bankruptcy in 2011. New York City was steered away from fiscal collapse in the 1970s with the help of a financial control board.In New Jersey, Camden was under state supervision for seven years until 2010, while the Newark Public Schools are still under state control two decades later. Philadelphia\u2019s public schools were taken over by the governor in 2001.This week, Gov. Bruce Rauner of Illinois, a Republican, said that he favored state oversight of the Chicago Public Schools, a measure that stands little chance of passing in a legislature controlled by Democrats.But Michigan\u2019s law is among the nation\u2019s most far-reaching, said Mr. Scorsone, a critic.\u201cWhen you have one voice, you essentially don\u2019t have checks and balances in a democracy,\u201d Mr. Scorsone said. \u201cThe outcome in Flint has revealed some significant flaws in the process.\u201dBut Mr. Scorsone also conceded that there was a grudging consensus that Mr. Orr\u2019s tenure in Detroit had been a success.State officials have argued that appointment of an emergency manager is a means to rescue residents from failed local elective leadership. Flint, a Democratic stronghold, was in a perilous financial state in 2011, when Mr. Snyder appointed an emergency manager. Nine years earlier, another Republican governor, John Engler, had taken the same action, appointing a manager who remained for two years.Mr. Snyder did not respond to a request for comment. But in an appearance on MSNBC on Friday, in response to questions about whether \u201cenvironmental racism\u201d had played a part in the government\u2019s response to Flint\u2019s water problems, he said his intent had been to help cities, and people, in need.\u201cSeveral cities \u2014 Detroit, Flint, Pontiac, Saginaw \u2014 I\u2019ve made a focused effort since before I started in office to say, we need to work hard to help people that have the greatest need,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve done a lot in terms of programs there to go help the structurally employed get work. In terms of public safety, we\u2019ve done a lot.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019ve chosen this policy, and this is the outcome,\u201d said Jim Ananich, a Democratic state senator whose district includes Flint. \u201cWe have poisonous water flowing through people\u2019s faucets. In the Detroit Public Schools, they have overcrowded classrooms and rats. Unfortunately, the emergency managers in these communities have been failing.\u201dMr. Ananich said the law allowing emergency managers should be \u201creviewed and repealed quickly.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a failed project,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no accountability with the government. They are trying to circumvent local democracy and say, \u2018This one individual knows best.\u2019\u201dMayor Deirdre Waterman of Pontiac, Mich., whose city was led by an emergency manager until shortly before her election in 2013, called the method an \u201cartificial disruption of democracy\u201d that should be used only sparingly.Pontiac\u2019s first emergency manager was appointed by Ms. Granholm. The city was released from an emergency manager under the Snyder administration, but even now it remains in a transition phase without full local control. For the law to have any kind of credence, Ms. Waterman said, \u201cit should be a shorter mission of directed engagement that is not prolonged.\u201dMarcus Muhammad, the new mayor of Benton Harbor, Mich., whose population is 89 percent black and which had been under emergency management, said the managers had been a \u201chorrific experiment\u201d that left the city defending itself against lawsuits filed over actions they had taken.\u201cI have said that a different strategy and a different law should be put in place to help distressed cities,\u201d he added. \u201cNot to poison democracies, poison water, poison communities.\u201dJulie Bosman reported from Lansing, and Monica Davey from Chicago.

{"Headline": "Sundance Roars for a Black Film, and Fox Searchlight Bids $17 Million", "Date": "2016-01-26", "News": "Supported byPARK CITY, Utah \u2014 With the outcry over an all-white field of acting nominees for the coming Academy Awards, and the shutout of several films focused on black characters from the best picture race, Hollywood has come under extreme pressure in recent weeks to find more prestige-minded movies with diverse casts.The specialty studio, owned by 21st Century Fox, has a long history as an Academy Awards powerhouse. In 2014, it maneuvered the similarly themed \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d to nine Academy Award nominations and three wins, including best picture. Fox Searchlight also distributed \u201cBirdman,\u201d the reigning best picture winner.Nancy Utley and Stephen Gilula, the presidents of Fox Searchlight, said in a statement that Mr. Parker\u2019s \u201cdedication and artistry in revitalizing Nat Turner\u2019s legacy and place in history has resulted in an extraordinarily compelling and moving film that delivers on every level.\u201d Aja Naomi King co-stars as Mr. Turner\u2019s wife, Cherry, the victim of a horrific gang rape. Armie Hammer plays a sometimes kind, sometimes brutal plantation owner. The film is Mr. Parker\u2019s feature directorial debut.The film, based on a true story, borrows its title from the 1915 D.W. Griffith movie that is considered both a classic for its innovative filmmaking technique and racist for its stereotypical depiction of blacks and its sympathetic portrayal of the Ku Klux Klan. \u201cGriffith\u2019s film relied heavily on racist propaganda to evoke fear and desperation as a tool to solidify white supremacy as the lifeblood of American sustenance,\u201d Mr. Parker, 36, said in a recent interview with Filmmaker Magazine.A look at select films screening at the Sundance Film Festival.He pointedly added, \u201cNot only did this film motivate the massive resurgence of the terror group the Ku Klux Klan and the carnage exacted against people of African descent, it served as the foundation of the film industry we know today.\u201dMr. Parker\u2019s \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d is poised to join a subgenre of films touching on slavery that Oscar voters have supported over the years, even as they have been slow to rally around films about contemporary African-American life. In addition to \u201c12 Years a Slave,\u201d Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cAmistad,\u201d about the events after a mutiny on a slave ship, was nominated for four Academy Awards in 1998; Quentin Tarantino\u2019s \u201cDjango Unchained\u201d drew five nominations in 2013, including one for best picture, and won two Oscars.While there are no official record keepers for Sundance prices, \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d sale far surpassed previous high-water marks, including that of \u201cLittle Miss Sunshine,\u201d which Searchlight bought in 2006 for roughly $12 million, after adjusting for inflation. (A high price, of course, does not necessarily mean a box-office hit. Focus Features in 2008 paid about $11 million for the comedy \u201cHamlet 2,\u201d which took in only half that amount in ticket sales.)Searchlight was the first traditional distributor to make a splash at Sundance this year. During the first half of the 11-day festival, the most active bidders were Amazon, which bought five movies, including the prestige drama \u201cManchester by the Sea,\u201d and Netflix, which made four significant purchases, including spending about $7 million for \u201cThe Fundamentals of Caring,\u201d a comedic drama.Losing bidders for \u201cThe Birth of a Nation,\u201d whose sale was handled by William Morris Endeavor, included Paramount, Universal, Sony and the Weinstein Company.The independently financed \u201cBirth of a Nation\u201d cost an estimated $10 million to make. Mr. Parker, known for his acting in films like \u201cThe Great Debaters\u201d and \u201cRed Tails,\u201d spent seven years working on the film, although the actual shoot, which took place in Georgia, lasted less than a month.In an unusual show of support, at least by Sundance standards, \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d received a standing ovation before it even played. The moment, which had a cathartic feeling after days of #OscarsSoWhite tension, coincided with Mr. Parker\u2019s introduction of the film at the 1,270-seat Eccles Theater. Mr. Parker brought what seemed to be his entire cast and crew, many of whom rose to their feet when he appeared.After the credits rolled \u2014 again, to whoops and cheers \u2014 Mr. Parker spoke of how deeply the racial injustices and atrocities covered in the film continued to reverberate today. \u201cAre you passive, or are you corrupt and complicit?\u201d he asked the audience. \u201cThere is no middle ground.\u201dHe added: \u201cI made this film for one reason: with the hope of creating change agents. That people can watch this film and be affected. That you can watch this film and see that there were systems that were in place that were corrupt and corrupted people, and the legacy of that still lives with us.\u201dCara Buckley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Report Is Expected to Detail Corruption in World Track and Field", "Date": "2016-01-12", "News": "Supported byA report to be released Thursday is expected to describe bribery and corruption at the highest levels of international track and field, two months after the sport was shaken by revelations of a state-sponsored doping system in Russia that implicated athletes, coaches, trainers, doctors, laboratories and the country\u2019s antidoping authorities.The report is the second installment from a commission appointed by the World Anti-Doping Agency to investigate allegations of widespread doping in track and field. According to people familiar with the report, the new findings are expected to focus on top global officials in the sport who have been accused of blackmailing athletes who tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs.The findings to be announced Thursday are expected to extend beyond Russia.The commission\u2019s investigation was inspired by reports from the German public broadcaster ARD, which released a documentary in December 2014 focused on doping in Russian athletics.In August, ARD and The Sunday Times of London released a second report regarding the leaked results of thousands of blood tests of international athletes dating to 2001. Those results reportedly included celebrated athletes with abnormal drug test results, prompting the antidoping commission to widen the focus of its inquiry.In its expanded investigation, the commission reviewed those suspicious test results and scrutinized how vigilant track and field\u2019s governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations, had been in following up on them and disciplining athletes when warranted.Lamine Diack, the longtime president of the I.A.A.F. until August, is expected to be central to the commission\u2019s investigation. Mr. Diack, of Senegal, is under criminal investigation in France, suspected of money laundering and soliciting and accepting bribes, the French authorities have said.Also under investigation in France are Habib Cisse, Mr. Diack\u2019s legal adviser, and Gabriel Doll\u00e9, a former director of the antidoping division at track and field\u2019s governing body.Perhaps pre-emptively, the I.A.A.F. announced last week that it had imposed bans from the sport on Mr. Doll\u00e9; Mr. Diack\u2019s son, Papa Massata Diack, a former marketing consultant to the organization; Valentin Balakhnichev, a former president of the All-Russia Athletic Federation; and Alexei Melnikov, a former Russian coach for long-distance walkers and runners. The I.A.A.F. said the four had conspired to blackmail athletes.Sebastian Coe, Mr. Diack\u2019s successor as the I.A.A.F.\u2019s president, said in a statement that in the new year he would be focused on rebuilding public trust. Mr. Coe, who worked directly under Mr. Diack for seven years, said that a team of outside lawyers and accountants had been hired to conduct a \u201cforensic review of operations and finance\u201d and that there would be a more vigilant vetting process for track and field officials by mid-2016.Mr. Coe also said he planned to double the I.A.A.F.\u2019s antidoping budget, to $8 million, from $4 million, by midyear.\u201cI represent a sport under intense scrutiny,\u201d Mr. Coe said in a statement. \u201cBe under no illusion about how seriously I take these issues.\u201dThis week, I.A.A.F. officials met with the Olympic Committee of Russia, the I.A.A.F. said Tuesday. The officials are evaluating Russia\u2019s progress in improving antidoping controls to fulfill criteria that would allow it to re-enter international competition.Speaking in Geneva in November while outlining the doping allegations against the Russian Federation, Dick Pound, the founding president of the World Anti-Doping Agency and the chairman of the commission that produced the November report and the one expected Thursday, said that Russia had many improvements to make.\u201cThe idea is not to exclude people from the Olympics if you can avoid that,\u201d Mr. Pound said. \u201cBut sometimes, if the conduct is not corrected, that\u2019s the price you pay for it.\u201dThursday\u2019s announcement, to be made by Mr. Pound and the two other members of the commission \u2014 Richard H. McLaren, a Canadian lawyer, and G\u00fcnter Younger, the head of cybercrime for the police in the German state Bavaria \u2014 will take place in Munich.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rams Moving to Los Angeles Area, and Chargers Could Join Them", "Date": "2016-01-12", "News": "Supported byHOUSTON \u2014 After more than two decades, the N.F.L. has found its way back to Los Angeles.The St. Louis Rams will move to the Los Angeles area, where they intend to build a new, nearly $3 billion stadium in an entertainment complex in Inglewood, Calif., just over 10 miles from downtown. The San Diego Chargers will have the option to join them as soon as next season, and if they decline, the Oakland Raiders could make the move.The Rams, who played in the Los Angeles area for decades, will give the area its first N.F.L. team since 1995, when they moved to St. Louis, followed by the Raiders, who left Los Angeles a few months later that year for Oakland. Owners for both teams could not agree with civic leaders on new or refurbished stadiums.The announcement came on Tuesday after a series of private meetings spread over 12 hours here among some of the biggest titans of industry, including Robert A. Iger, the chairman of Disney; Paul Allen, the Microsoft co-founder and now owner of the Seattle Seahawks; and E. Stanley Kroenke, the owner of the Rams, whose fortune derives in part from the Walton family of Wal-Mart fame, hashed out the move that had eluded the league for two decades.\u201cWe have the return of the Los Angeles Rams to their home,\u201d the N.F.L. commissioner, Roger Goodell, said in a news conference, looking tired after a day of marathon meetings and deliberations. \u201cWe have a facility that is going to be absolutely extraordinary, and that is going to set a new bar.\u201dFlanked by the chairmen of the Los Angeles Opportunities committee, Bob McNair of the Houston Texans and Art Rooney of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Goodell said that the facility in Inglewood was \u201cmore than just a stadium\u201d and would be a \u201csignature product.\u201dMoving two N.F.L. teams at once to the same city is unprecedented, and if the Chargers join the Rams, they will be the second current pair to share a stadium, after the Jets and the Giants, who moved to MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., in 2010.The return to Los Angeles fills a void for the nation\u2019s most popular sport, which has enjoyed explosive growth over the past two decades even without a team there.Over the years, some of Los Angeles\u2019s biggest power brokers, including the entertainment mogul Michael Ovitz, the philanthropist and developer Eli Broad and the supermarket magnate Ron Burkle, had made overtures to the league for a team, to no avail. The decision, in a 30-2 vote among the league\u2019s 32 team owners, comes after more than a year of often acrimonious lobbying by the Chargers, the Raiders and the Rams, who each applied to move to the Los Angeles area last month because, they said, they were unable to get enough public support to build new stadiums in their markets.At least 24 owners had to vote in favor of the move for it to gain approval.St. Louis fans reacted with anger, and civic leaders said the N.F.L. disregarded their efforts to keep the team.\u201cIt is troubling that the league would allow for the relocation of a team when a home market has worked in good faith and presented a strong and viable proposal,\u201d Gov. Jay Nixon of Missouri said in a statement. \u201cThis sets a terrible precedent not only for St. Louis, but for all communities that have loyally supported their N.F.L. franchises.\u201dLos Angeles leaders exulted.\u201cThe water drought is still with us, but the Los Angeles football drought is over,\u201d Mayor Eric Garcetti said in an interview.He added, \u201cI think there is tremendous excitement in L.A. I can feel it in the streets.\u201dThat remains to be seen.With Los Angeles the nation\u2019s second-largest television market, the N.F.L. has longed for a return to the area, where several Super Bowls have been played. But taxpayers\u2019 apprehension on financing stadiums or difficulties acquiring suitable sites have stymied previous efforts to put a team there.Los Angeles football fans also have a reputation for being among the most blas\u00e9 about following their teams; although civic leaders have chafed at the absence of a team, there has never been a strong outcry from the populace, in part because games from every other N.F.L. city are readily available on television.Some owners favored letting only one team move to Los Angeles because they did not believe two teams could be successful there right away. Still, three teams were willing to bet the attraction was strong and applied to move to Los Angeles, with the teams\u2019 owners planning to foot all or most of the bill for stadiums.The Rams will build a glass-roofed stadium that could cost nearly $3 billion, easily the most expensive building in sports.If an agreement is reached between the Rams and the Chargers, the Rams will play temporarily at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum \u2014 previously the home to the Rams, the Chargers and the Raiders and the site of two Super Bowls, including the first, in 1967 \u2014 starting in August 2016.Where the Chargers would play temporarily is unclear.\u201cMy goal from the start of this process was to create the options necessary to safeguard the future of the Chargers franchise while respecting the will of my fellow N.F.L. owners,\u201d Dean Spanos, the chairman of the Chargers, said in a statement. \u201cI will be working over the next several weeks to explore the options that we have now created for ourselves to determine the best path forward for the Chargers.\u201dKroenke \u2014 who also owns the Colorado Avalanche of the N.H.L., the Denver Nuggets of the N.B.A. and Arsenal of the English Premier League \u2014 has already acquired the land and rights to build in Inglewood.The Rams are expected to pay the league a relocation fee of $650 million, stretched out over about 20 years.The Chargers originally teamed with the Raiders, but that partnership fell apart when the Rams\u2019 proposal won 20 votes at a ballot earlier Tuesday. At that point, the other owners pressured the Chargers to work out a deal with the Rams in Inglewood.In 2014, Kroenke bought a 60-acre tract in Inglewood, and he later added land where the old Hollywood Park Racetrack stood. Last January, he announced plans to build a domed stadium surrounded by an entertainment district.Weeks later, the Chargers, who say that a quarter of their fans come from Los Angeles and Orange County, said they would build an outdoor stadium in Carson with the Raiders.The Chargers and the Raiders also recruited Iger, the chairman of Disney, to serve as an honorary executive and help plan the stadium. In the end, Iger\u2019s expertise and connections in the entertainment business were not enough to reassure other owners that the stadium in Carson could outdo the proposal in Inglewood.The Raiders will presumably begin fresh negotiations with the city of Oakland over a new stadium. Libby Schaaf, the mayor, has said the city cannot afford to help build a stadium, but it could provide the land and infrastructure improvements needed for one. On Tuesday, she welcomed the chance to restart talks with the team.Los Angeles has had professional teams for decades, and the Chargers, the Raiders and the Rams have all played in the city at some point. The Chargers, a charter member of the A.F.L., left Los Angeles for San Diego after one season. Los Angeles has long been a favorite of the league, and the league has been eager to have such a marquee city again on its map.In 1996, the Seahawks toyed with moving to Southern California, but the team was sold to Allen, who helped build a new stadium for the team in Seattle. Three years later, the league wanted to add a 32nd team, but when Los Angeles and the N.F.L. could not agree on a stadium site, the owners awarded the franchise to Houston.In the years afterward, proposals were offered to build stadiums in downtown Los Angeles, in nearby City of Industry and elsewhere. But none of the investors were able to persuade an N.F.L. team to move into a stadium that it did not control.Nevertheless, the absence of a team in Los Angeles was used as a bargaining chip by teams trying to build stadiums in their home markets. The Minnesota Vikings, among other teams, have floated the idea of moving to Los Angeles as a way to win public funding for a stadium.Although the N.F.L. has not had a team in Los Angeles in recent years, it has kept a foothold in that region. NFL Network is headquartered in Culver City, the owners have held meetings in the area, and the Dallas Cowboys hold their training camp in Oxnard. Television ratings for N.F.L. games are also strong in the region.The N.F.L. has expanded rapidly in the two decades since the Raiders and the Rams left, which has led some to posit that the league did not need to return to Los Angeles. The city has two big college teams, and fans from all over the country have moved to the region and root for an array of teams from elsewhere. Some sports business experts have suggested that placing a team in Los Angeles does not guarantee success.Los Angeles is merely the latest return destination for the N.F.L.; the league has put a team back in every city it has left in the past few decades, including Baltimore, Cleveland, Houston, Oakland and St. Louis, and generally succeeded.Mark Leibovich contributed reporting from Houston, and Mike Tierney from Los Angeles.Advertisement"}

The new cases had occurred on average 27 days apart, but there have been none since mid-November. Any risk diminishes over time, as survivors\u2019 immune systems clear out the virus.World Health Organization officials said that the health authorities in the affected countries had put in surveillance and rapid response mechanisms for managing the risk, and that those measures had proved effective in containing the flare-ups.\u201cPeople of course want to return to a normal, but it\u2019s a new normal,\u201d said Peter Graaff, a World Health Organization director who is in charge of Ebola response. \u201cEbola has been added to a number of their diseases that affect the population.\u201dThe three West African countries now have the world\u2019s biggest pool of expertise in handling Ebola and greater professionalism, confidence and resources for dealing with it, he said.On Saturday, the World Health Organization declared Liberia free of Ebola.Their approach, Mr. Graaf said, is that \u201cit\u2019s a problem, a big problem, it\u2019s going to affect us again, but we know how to handle it.\u201dSierra Leone was declared free of Ebola transmission in November and Guinea at the end of December; Liberia was declared Ebola-free in May but then reported a few new cases. \u201cToday is a monumental day of achievement \u2014 the end of human-to-human transmission of the Ebola virus in the region and Liberia.

Here is a sample of work.Mr. Ban indirectly acknowledged the criticism by saying that he looked forward to hearing the recommendations of independent panels about how to better prepare the global public health system for emergencies. He also said that he would ask the World Health Organization to issue reports on health security over the next two years.On Wednesday, an independent commission of 17 experts in public health, research and finance convened by the National Academy of Medicine called for greater international investment in preventing future epidemics.\u201cFrankly, this has not been on the A-list of global problems in the way that nuclear proliferation, or terrorism, or global climate change has been,\u201d said Mr. Summers, who was not involved in writing the report.Investing roughly $4.5 billion a year to improve health systems, advance research, and strengthen the abilities of the World Health Organization and other bodies could avoid $60 billion in losses in the event of a pandemic, the commission concluded.\u201cTo have contained this epidemic is an achievement,\u201d said Manuel Fontaine, a regional director for Unicef, \u201cbut we can\u2019t forget the terrible toll Ebola has taken on these countries.\u201dDionne Searcey reported from Dakar, Nick Cumming-Bruce from Geneva and Clair MacDougall from Monrovia, Liberia.

{"Headline": "Why Are Corporations Hoarding Trillions?", "Date": "2016-01-20", "News": "Supported byOn MoneyThere is an economic mystery I\u2019ve been struggling to understand for quite some time, and I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s confused: Among financial experts, it is often referred to as a conundrum, a paradox, a puzzle. The mystery is as follows: Collectively, American businesses currently have $1.9 trillion in cash, just sitting around. Not only is this state of affairs unparalleled in economic history, but we don\u2019t even have much data to compare it with, because corporations have traditionally been borrowers, not savers. The notion that a corporation would hold on to so much of its profit seems economically absurd, especially now, when it is probably earning only about 2 percent interest by parking that money in United States Treasury bonds. These companies would be better off investing in anything \u2014 a product, a service, a corporate acquisition \u2014 that would make them more than 2 cents of profit on the dollar, a razor-thin margin by corporate standards. And yet they choose to keep the cash.Take, for example, Google. Its new parent company, Alphabet, is worth roughly $500 billion. But it has around $80 billion sitting in Google\u2019s bank accounts or other short-term investments. So if you buy a share in Alphabet, which has sold for roughly $700 lately, you are effectively buying ownership of more than $100 in cash. With $80 billion, Google could buy Uber and its Indian rival Ola and still have enough left over to buy Palantir, a data-mining start-up. Or it could buy Goldman Sachs outright or American Express or most of MasterCard; it could buy Costco or eBay or a quarter of Amazon. Surely it could use those acquisitions to earn more than 2 cents on the dollar.This strange vogue for corporate hoarding seems to have begun around the turn of the millennium. General Motors is perhaps the most extreme: It now holds nearly half its value in cash. Apple holds more than a third. These numbers are maddening on their face. If the companies spent their savings, rather than hoarding them, the economy would instantly grow, and we would most likely see more jobs with better pay. In the 1990s, when companies saved far less of their profits, they built new factories, bought new buildings. In part because of all that corporate spending, the 1990s were a period of low unemployment and high growth. Remarkably, the United States government was able to tax all that productive corporate behavior so much that it came close to paying off all its debts for the first time in 160 years.So what is going on now? There are countless economic journal articles laying out theories about why corporations have shifted from borrowing to saving. Some of the reasons are prosaic. Just like people, companies might want to have money for emergencies or for lousy economic times, and the past decade has been a period of increasing risk. Also, corporations have become far more focused on something they call \u2018\u2018tax efficiency,\u2019\u2019 which the rest of us call \u2018\u2018tax avoidance\u2019\u2019: For various reasons, holding on to cash and carefully shifting it among subsidiaries, especially foreign ones, is a great tool to shrink your tax bill.Another reason to hold on to cash is a byproduct of the increasingly intense competition for talent and acquisitions, especially in technology and pharmaceuticals. When Apple or Google enter negotiations to buy a smaller company, any other firm considering a competing offer may be scared off by their nearly infinite resources. Oddly enough, then, holding on to all that cash might be saving these companies even more money, by allowing them to pay less for the firms they acquire. (Google buys about one company a week, on average; Apple\u2019s acquisitions are more sporadic, but not far behind.)But even if you accept all these reasons, we are still left with an enormous puzzle. Companies like Google and GM are holding on to far more cash \u2014 many times more \u2014 than could possibly be explained by emergency funds and tax efficiencies and M.&A. intimidation put together. Lee Pinkowitz, a professor at Georgetown, told me that finance economists agree that there is a puzzle here but break into two distinct camps over the cause. One camp believes that a large cash hoard is a sign of an unhealthy company. Maybe its whole industry is doing so poorly that there is nothing worth investing in; maybe it\u2019s because executives are up to something shady, stockpiling cash as a personal war chest to mask poor decision-making and protect their jobs (cash in the bank, suddenly deployed, can make a firm seem more profitable than it actually is). The other camp doubts that the free market could be allowing executives to hold all that cash if it were purely for their own benefit.Along with his colleague Rohan Williamson, Pinkowitz built a valuation model that analyzed how investors react to different levels of cash holding. He ran 50 years of data (originally from 1965 to 2004, but then he kindly updated his findings for me, through 2014) for 12,888 different publicly traded companies. The model shows how investors value a dollar of savings when it\u2019s held by different sorts of companies, divided into 43 industry types.His findings show that both theories have some truth to them. For several industries, hoarding cash is clearly correlated with negative results. When publishing and entertainment companies or aircraft manufacturers hold on to extra cash, investors perceive that money to be worth less than it should, somewhere in the neighborhood of 40 cents on the dollar (the authors make a specific estimate for each industry but also provide a range to account for error). The defense and coal industries are considerably worse, with a dollar in savings valued negatively. This might suggest protective behavior by chief executives in those industries, because the market is clearly not valuing their decision to save.For other industries, though, a dollar of savings is worth a lot more than itself. For pharmaceutical companies, a dollar in savings is worth $1.50. For software firms, it\u2019s even higher: more than $2. This means that investors are behaving as if they trust the executives in these industries, like Larry Page of Alphabet, to be smarter about using that money than the investors themselves could be. And a cursory scan of the industries in this second group \u2014 which also includes automakers, medical-equipment makers and others \u2014 correlates well with the ones hoarding the most cash. Corporations, it seems, may have amassed at least a good chunk of that $1.9 trillion in mysterious savings because the stock market is rewarding them for it.Which leaves one last question: Why? The answer, perhaps, is that both the executives and the investors in these industries believe that something big is coming, but \u2014 this is crucial \u2014 they\u2019re not sure what it will be. Through the 20th century, as we shifted from a horse-and-sun-powered agrarian economy to an electricity-and-motor-powered industrial economy to a silicon-based information economy, it was clear that every company had to invest in the new thing that was coming. These were big, expensive investments in buildings and machinery and computer technology. Today, though, value is created far more through new ideas and new ways of interaction. Ideas appear and spread much more quickly, and their worth is much harder to estimate. (Indeed, the impossibility of valuing the Internet is essentially what created the 2000 stock bubble.)Surely the most important economic question of our time is a fairly simple one: Are the good times over? Will wages continue to fall for many, while rising high for a few? In the cash conundrum, we might find a modest reason for optimism. If corporate leaders and their investors truly believed that the future were bleak, that innovation and economic growth were irreparably slowing, there would be little reason to hold on to all that cash. Their hoarding of it hints that they think the next transformative innovation could be just around the corner. If in fact they do \u2014 and if they\u2019re right \u2014 it\u2019s good news for all of us.Adam Davidson is a founder of NPR\u2019s \u2018\u2018Planet Money\u2019\u2019 and a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russian Fund Under Scrutiny for Loan to Company Linked to Kremlin", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "Supported byAnother big owner, Kirill N. Shamalov, is the son of Nikolai T. Shamalov who has similarly received sanctions for his connection to Mr. Putin. Kirill Shamalov is also widely reported in Russian and Western news media to be the son-in-law of Mr. Putin.\u201cWhen the economic crisis deepens, and this floats to the surface, it could be a serious blow to Putin,\u201d Stanislav A. Belkovsky, a political analyst, said of lending to a figure linked to Mr. Putin\u2019s family.The Russian Direct Investment Fund defends the Sibur deal, saying it follows the fund\u2019s investment guidelines. The chief executive, Kirill Dmitriev, in a written statement, characterized the loan as commercially motivated and issued \u201cin line with our established practices.\u201dMr. Putin, like many Russian officials, refuses to discuss his family or reveal family business activities. Mr. Shamalov has declined to confirm or deny whether he is married to the younger of Mr. Putin\u2019s two daughters; a representative for Mr. Shamalov did not respond to written questions. Sibur said in a statement that the company would not comment on \u201cspeculation\u201d that a shareholder is a son-in-law of the president and said that shareholders in any case had no role in negotiating financing.Mr. Shamalov\u2019s company, Ladoga Management, declined in a statement to say whether he is a son-in-law of Mr. Putin, asserting that, \u201clike every other person, Kirill Shamalov has the right to privacy.\u201d\u201cThe Soviet tradition was the relatives should not be in the public eye,\u201d said Mr. Belkovsky, the political analyst.Former President Dmitri A. Medvedev established the fund in 2011 with the explicit goal of restoring confidence in Russia\u2019s investment climate.Mr. Medvedev wanted to attract overseas investors to the country\u2019s companies, and tried to entice them by matching state funds with private capital. The partnership with the state, the theory went, would reduce the investors\u2019 worries about the risk of nationalization and arbitrary regulation.To further shore up support, the fund rounded up prominent investors to serve on the advisory board. Along with the TPG and Blackstone executives, the fund recruited Leon Black of Apollo Global Management; Richard M. Daley, the former mayor of Chicago; Kurt Bj\u00f6rklund of Permira; and Chinese and Middle Eastern fund managers.By lending their names to the fund\u2019s advisory board, these financial heavyweights were supposed to ensure that money did not flow to political pet projects. The first wave of deals focused on bread-and-butter investments in companies building out Russia\u2019s infrastructure and catering to the middle class.In a typical investment, the fund and the American investment management company BlackRock in 2012 together poured $50 million into a chain of private hospitals called Mother & Child. With more Russians watching movies, the fund also invested $100 million into a multiplex business, along with Baring Vostok Capital Partners, a Russian private equity company.But western players backed away after the sanctions targeted the fund\u2019s parent bank, Vnesheconombank, a major Russian state-owned bank, in response to Russia\u2019s intervention in the eastern Ukraine war. Mr. Schwarzman and Mr. Bonderman withdrew their names from the published list of advisers in 2014.Blackstone and TPG declined to comment about the Russian fund.In two deals, the Russian Direct Investment Fund helped invest about $800 million of this pension system money into companies building electrical power lines and expanding broadband Internet access to rural areas.An even bigger investment with Sibur soon followed.In December, the fund disclosed an investment totaling $5.05 billion for Sibur to build a petrochemical factory in the Siberian city of Tobolsk, to make precursor chemicals for plastics and synthetic rubber.The Russian Direct Investment Fund and foreign investors, including unspecified Middle Eastern sources and two German funds that tie financing to the export of German industrial goods, raised $3.3 billion. Such moves fulfilled the fund\u2019s mandate to raise private sector capital.The Russian Direct Investment Fund also arranged the $1.75 billion loan from the National Welfare Fund. It was structured as below-market-rate bonds sold to the sovereign wealth fund.\u201cYou can see the conflict of interest here,\u201d Vladimir A. Ryzhkov, a former deputy speaker of the Russian Parliament, said in a telephone interview. The National Welfare Fund, he said, is legally obliged to cover pension system deficits like those existing in Russia today because of the oil price slump. Pensions this year will decline relative to inflation.\u201cThe president controls the resources in these funds,\u201d Mr. Ryzhkov said, \u201cand if his son-in-law is a part owner of this company, there is a conflict.\u201dSibur is one of Russia\u2019s largest petrochemical companies, processing the country\u2019s rich supplies of oil and natural gas into plastic, synthetic rubber and other goods.

As usual, he declined to disclose details about his family. He denied that his daughters were involved in business, and offered few clues about their activities.A journalist from RBC, a Russian newspaper that has investigated Mr. Shamalov\u2019s business dealings, asked Mr. Putin whether his daughter, born Yekaterina Putina, has been living in Russia under the assumed name of Katerina Tikhonova.Mr. Putin declined to answer questions about his family at the conference.\u201cI read, of course, on the Internet and in some other publications about Yekaterina Tikhonova, just as I\u2019ve read things about other possible relatives and daughters at different times,\u201d Mr. Putin said, according to a Kremlin transcript. He said his daughter is living in Russia, but declined to say whether she is Ms. Tikhonova.\u201cI am proud of them,\u201d he said, speaking of his two daughters.\u201cThey are taking just first steps in their careers, but already achieved successes,\u201d he added. \u201cThey are not in business or politics, and are not sticking their nose into anything.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Michigan\u2019s Great Stink", "Date": "2016-01-25", "News": "Supported byIt took the Great Stink of 1858, when the stench made the Houses of Parliament unusable, to produce action.What we know so far is that in 2014 the city\u2019s emergency manager \u2014 appointed by Rick Snyder, the state\u2019s Republican governor \u2014 decided to switch to an unsafe water source, with lead contamination and more, in order to save money. And it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that state officials knew that they were damaging public health, putting children in particular at risk, even as they stonewalled both residents and health experts.This story \u2014 America in the 21st century, and you can trust neither the water nor what officials say about it \u2014 would be a horrifying outrage even if it were an accident or an isolated instance of bad policy. But it isn\u2019t. On the contrary, the nightmare in Flint reflects the resurgence in American politics of exactly the same attitudes that led to London\u2019s Great Stink more than a century and a half ago.Let\u2019s back up a bit, and talk about the role of government in an advanced society.In the modern world, much government spending goes to social insurance programs \u2014 things like Social Security, Medicare and so on, that are supposed to protect citizens from the misfortunes of life. Such spending is the subject of fierce political debate, and understandably so. Liberals want to help the poor and unlucky, conservatives want to let people keep their hard-earned income, and there\u2019s no right answer to this debate, because it\u2019s a question of values.There should, however, be much less debate about spending on what Econ 101 calls public goods \u2014 things that benefit everyone and can\u2019t be provided by the private sector. Yes, we can differ over exactly how big a military we need or how dense and well-maintained the road network should be, but you wouldn\u2019t expect controversy about spending enough to provide key public goods like basic education or safe drinking water.Yet a funny thing has happened as hard-line conservatives have taken over many U.S. state governments. Or actually, it\u2019s not funny at all. Not surprisingly, they have sought to cut social insurance spending on the poor. In fact, many state governments dislike spending on the poor so much that they are rejecting a Medicaid expansion that wouldn\u2019t cost them anything, because it\u2019s federally financed. But what we also see is extreme penny pinching on public goods.So are we just talking about the effects of ideology? Didn\u2019t Flint find itself in the cross hairs of austerity because it\u2019s a poor, mostly African-American city? Yes, that\u2019s definitely part of what happened \u2014 it would be hard to imagine something similar happening to Grosse Pointe.But these really aren\u2019t separate stories. What we see in Flint is an all too typically American situation of (literally) poisonous interaction between ideology and race, in which small-government extremists are empowered by the sense of too many voters that good government is simply a giveaway to Those People.But you can\u2019t understand what happened in Flint, and what will happen in many other places if current trends continue, without understanding the ideology that made the disaster possible.Advertisement"}

There he attracted many thousands of additional followers from all over the world.If Santa Claus and John Maynard Keynes could combine as one, he might well be Edward Hugh. He was roly-poly and merry, and he always had a twinkle in his eye, not least when he came across a data point or the hint of an economic or social trend that would support one of his many theories.His intellect was too restless to be pigeonholed, but when pressed he would say that he saw himself as a Keynesian in spirit, but not letter. And in tune with his view that economists in general had become too wedded to static economic models and failed their obligation to predict and explain, he frequently cited this quotation from Keynes:\u201cEconomists set themselves too easy, too useless a task if in tempestuous seasons they can only tell us that when the storm is long past, the ocean is flat again.\u201dEdward Hugh Bengree-Jones was born in Liverpool, England, on Dec. 29, 1948. He moved to London and received an undergraduate degree from the London School of Economics. He pursued his doctoral studies at Victoria University in Manchester, although he never completed them.Throughout the 1970s and 1980s he bounced from job to job, mostly in education, taking on projects such as teaching English to Chilean refugees.In 1990 he moved to Barcelona, having fallen in love with the city\u2019s multicultural flair during a holiday visit. He quickly became fluent in both Spanish and Catalan and decided that Barcelona would become his home.He would became a champion of Catalonia\u2019s push for independence and was an informal adviser to senior Catalan politicians, including Artur Mas, the leader of the movement\u2019s main party.While Mr. Hugh\u2019s pointed pen often ruffled feathers, especially in Spain, he did become a local celebrity of sorts. He was a regular presence in the papers and appeared frequently on television, where he would expound for hours in Spanish and Catalan.On occasion his prognostications were overly pessimistic, and Spain\u2019s surprisingly quick economic recovery was an event that he, along with many others, did not foresee.Until this summer, when his cancer worsened, he spent his days posting daily economic snippets on Facebook, digging deep into independent films from around the world, and having long, lazy lunches with local notables and friends.That he never finished his doctorate or wrote his great work never truly bothered him, he said in his interview with The Times.\u201cThe last time I was asked what it was I \u2018did,\u2019 I replied rather cantankerously, that I don\u2019t do, I think,\u201d he recalled.Besides his son, Morgan, his survivors include his wife, Barbara; a brother, David, and a half sister, Anne.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oil Market Tests Banks\u2019 Ability to Weather Losses", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported byBanks of all sizes are marking down the value of loans and setting aside reserves to absorb additional losses as oil producers struggle to pay their debts.On Tuesday, Bank of America said provisions for credit losses increased $264 million in the fourth quarter, driven by the downturn in the energy sector. Citigroup, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase reported last week that oil issues also weighed on fourth-quarter earnings.While the energy downturn is cutting into profits, it is not threatening the big banks\u2019 capital cushions, a testament, analysts say, to the rigorous regulations put in place to protect the financial system after the collapse of the mortgage market in 2008.Still, the worst pain for the banks may lie ahead. While many banks have reduced credit lines to oil producers, some lenders are loath to cut off financing entirely for fear of forcing energy companies into bankruptcy, according to energy lawyers and consultants.The banks \u2014 and their regulators \u2014 are also trying to determine loan values and forecast future losses amid great uncertainty about the direction of oil prices, which have dipped below $30 a barrel. Some analysts and energy executives say prices could rebound in a few months if the global oil glut eases. Others say it could take years for prices to rise again as the global economy slows and new supply comes online from countries like Iran.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.\u201cThe natural bias will be to keep these things on life support for as long as you can,\u201d said Dennis Cassidy, a co-head of the oil, gas and chemical practice at AlixPartners, a consulting firm.\u201cThe question becomes how much of that waiting can you endure before you get to the point where you say, \u2018It is never going to turn around,\u2019 \u201d he added.There are other factors that may be putting off a reckoning for oil companies and their lenders, even as the slump in oil prices enters its second year.When times were booming and oil was selling for more than $100 a barrel, many banks required energy companies to hedge, or protect against price drops. As a result of those deals, some companies are still receiving as much as $80 a barrel. But those hedges are supposed to expire early this year \u2014 dealing a big blow to some companies\u2019 cash flow and their ability to make debt payments.\u201cA lot of these energy companies are still enjoying some handsome hedges,\u201d said Brady Gailey, an analyst at the investment bank Keefe Bruyette & Woods, who covers regional banks in the oil-producing regions of the Southwest.Executives at the largest banks have stressed in recent days that oil and gas exposure does not make up a big percentage of overall loans.Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks\u2019 bottom lines.But that confidence is also prompting questions from some analysts about whether the banks are socking away adequate reserves in light of the prolonged oil slump.Shares of bank stocks have been hammered since the start of the year when the stock market turned volatile in the face of the collapse in oil prices and concern about China\u2019s slowing economy. Bank of America\u2019s shares, for example, are down more than 15 percent since the start of the year, while the broader market has fallen more than 8 percent.Loans to oil and gas companies make up less than 2 percent of the loans at Bank of America and Wells Fargo \u2014 a far cry from the residential mortgage exposure at some large banks, which was as high as 25 percent leading up to 2008.There is always risk, analysts say, that declining oil prices could lead to additional energy losses from trading positions or hedges that go against the banks.But it is not likely to equal the vast array of the derivatives like collateralized debt obligations and other mortgage-related investments that clogged the bank\u2019s balance sheets and nearly brought them down.\u201cYou could easily write off every dollar in oil and energy loans and have more capital than before that last crisis,\u201d said Mike Mayo, a banking analyst at CLSA. \u201cBanks have enough cushion.\u201dFor years, North America\u2019s expanding oil production \u2014 particularly in the shale fields of North Dakota and parts of Texas \u2014 was a boon to the nation\u2019s biggest banks. Over the last five years, oil and gas companies in the United States and Canada have issued bonds and taken out loans that are together worth more than $1.3 trillion, according to data provider Dealogic.In good times, the financing boom provided banks with billions in fees and interest incomes. The banks financed nearly every facet of the industry, from drilling operations to the service companies providing the drill bits. In the downturn, the risks are becoming clearer.Bank of America said on Tuesday that $8.3 billion of its $21 billion in energy exposure was in the \u201chigh risk\u201d activities of exploration and production and oil field services. The bank has classified about one-third of that debt as problematic.\u201cWe feel like we have a very good handle on our energy portfolio,\u201d the bank\u2019s chief financial officer, Paul Donofrio, said in a conference call on Tuesday morning.Wells Fargo said most of its $17 billion in energy exposure was to noninvestment-grade companies, which are at higher risk of default.Citigroup said 32 percent of its energy loans went to below-investment-grade borrowers.For regional banks, where energy exposure makes up as much as one in five of the bank\u2019s loans, the pain is more acute.Last week, BOK Financial, which includes banks in Oklahoma and Texas, updated investors ahead of its scheduled earnings release to say that its credit-loss provisions in the fourth quarter would total $22.5 million, not the $3.5 million to $8.5 million that it had previously forecast. A bank official said \u201ca single borrower reported steeper-than-expected production declines.\u201dMr. Gailey, the banking analyst, was blunt in his prediction: \u201cThese oil patch banks have a tough road ahead in 2016.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Let\u2019s call it, Who\u2019s Losing?But don\u2019t expect it to shift much. Asking \u201cwho\u2019s losing?\u201d misses a larger truth about how thoroughly Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft now lord over all that happens in tech.Who\u2019s really losing? In the larger picture, none of them \u2014 not in comparison with the rest of the tech industry, the rest of the economy and certainly not in the influence each of them holds over our lives.But for much of the last half-decade, most of these five giants have enjoyed a remarkable reprieve from the bogeymen in the garage. And you can bet on them continuing to win. So I\u2019m coining the name the Frightful Five.Though competition between the five remains fierce \u2014 and each year, a few of them seem up and a few down \u2014 it\u2019s becoming harder to picture how any one of them, let alone two or three, may cede their growing clout in every aspect of American business and society.Indeed, the Frightful Five are so well protected against start-ups that in most situations, the rise of new companies only solidifies their lead.This gets to the core of the Frightful Five\u2019s indomitability. They have each built several enormous technologies that are central to just about everything we do with computers. In tech jargon, they own many of the world\u2019s most valuable \u201cplatforms\u201d \u2014 the basic building blocks on which every other business, even would-be competitors, depend.These platforms are inescapable; you may opt out of one or two of them, but together, they form a gilded mesh blanketing the entire economy.The Big Five\u2019s platforms span so-called old tech \u2014 Windows is still the king of desktops, Google rules web search \u2014 and new tech, with Google and Apple controlling mobile phone operating systems and the apps that run on them; Facebook and Google controlling the Internet advertising business; and Amazon, Microsoft and Google controlling the cloud infrastructure on which many start-ups run.Many of these platforms generate what economists call \u201cnetwork effects\u201d \u2014 as more people use them, they keep getting more indispensable. Why do you chat using Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp, also owned by Facebook? Because that\u2019s where everyone else is.Then there\u2019s the data buried in the platforms, also a rich source for new business. This can happen directly \u2014 for instance, Google can tap everything it learns about how we use our phones to create an artificial intelligence engine that improves our phones \u2014 and in more circuitous ways. By watching what\u2019s popular in its app store, Apple can get insight into what features to add to the iPhone.\u201cIn a way, a lot of the research and development costs are being borne by companies out of their four walls, which allows them to do better product development,\u201d Mr. Parker said.This explains why these companies\u2019 visions are so expansive. In various small and large ways, the Frightful Five are pushing into the news and entertainment industries; they\u2019re making waves in health care and finance; they\u2019re building cars, drones, robots and immersive virtual-reality worlds. Why do all this? Because their platforms \u2014 the users, the data and all the money they generate \u2014 make these far-flung realms seem within their grasp.Which isn\u2019t to say these companies can\u2019t die. Not long ago people thought IBM, Cisco Systems, Intel and Oracle were unbeatable in tech; they\u2019re all still large companies, but they\u2019re far less influential than they once were.Even with these difficulties, it\u2019s unclear if the larger dynamic may change much. Let\u2019s say that Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce company, eclipses Amazon\u2019s retail business in India \u2014 well, O.K., so then it satisfies itself with the rest of the world.So get used to these five. Based on their stock prices this month, the giants are among the top 10 most valuable American companies of any kind. Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft are the top three; Facebook is No. 7, and Amazon is No. 9. Wall Street gives each high marks for management; and three of them \u2014 Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook \u2014 are controlled by founders who don\u2019t have to bow to the whims of potential activist investors.So who\u2019s losing? Not one of them, not anytime soon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Britain to Review How Airport Shops Collect Sales Tax", "Date": "2015-12-31", "News": "Supported byGeorge Osborne, the British chancellor of the Exchequer, announced a review on Thursday of how retailers at major airports in Britain collect sales tax from their customers.The investigation, which is expected to be completed by early 2016, comes after several retailers were accused of not passing along savings to consumers who bought items at major hubs including Heathrow Airport near London.Regardless of their nationalities, passengers at British airports who are flying to destinations outside the European Union are exempt from paying the valued-added tax, which can reach 20 percent. The measure applies not only to duty-free stores but also to retailers as varied as Boots, WHSmith or Dixons.But some retailers at the country\u2019s largest airports were found by the government to have been charging the additional tax in cases they were not allowed to, and keeping it rather than passing it on to the tax authorities.As a result, some travelers have refused to provide their boarding passes at cash registers. Airport retailers use boarding passes to determine whether customers are required to pay the sales tax, and the stores cannot claim rebates without that information.The new investigation will look at how retailers collect the sales tax from consumers traveling in the 28-member bloc and farther afield. It was unclear whether the inquiry would result in fines for retailers or refunds for shoppers.\u201cBut many people could be paying over the odds for their purchases because the government\u2019s V.A.T. concession isn\u2019t passed on,\u201d he added.This is not the first time that the British government has warned retailers about how they collect taxes from shoppers at airports.In August, the Finance Ministry scolded retailers at British airports, saying they should reduce prices for customers who are not required to pay value-added tax.\u201cWhile many retailers do pass this saving on to customers, it is disappointing that some are choosing not to,\u201d David Gauke, a Treasury official, said in August. \u201cWe urge all airside retailers to use this relief for the benefit of their customers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In Omaha, someone in the crowd called out to urge a third term. In Baton Rouge, an audience member said that since Mr. Obama could not do that under the Constitution, could Michelle Obama be persuaded to run instead. (\u201cNo,\u201d he answered emphatically.)Indeed, the president\u2019s town-hall-style meeting here at McKinley High School, where he took questions from an announced audience of 1,000 on Thursday, could be considered a lovefest.\u201cMy question \u2014 I don\u2019t have one,\u201d said the first woman he called on. \u201cI just want to thank you.\u201dAnother woman, referring to the president and his wife, said, \u201cYou are our biggest inspirations, and we want to be just like you guys.\u201d\u201cSo can you help us?\u201d she said. \u201cGive us some tips?\u201dA young man expressed his gratitude. \u201cThanks for being an inspiration, because I aspire to be where you are in the next 30 years.\u201dIn the end, of course, what president does not like to be bathed in admiration? Especially one whose poll numbers show that a majority of his constituents are not big fans anymore. Advisers to George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan and other presidents certainly arranged public appearances in which their bosses were surrounded by devotees and their exposure to contrary opinions was fleeting.After that meeting, aides told reporters that they hoped to reproduce the experience more often, starting after the State of the Union speech. \u201cHe wants to have more conversations with Americans like he did in the 2008 campaign, including with people who disagree with him,\u201d said Jen Psaki, the White House communications director.He did not find them in Omaha or Baton Rouge. In Omaha on Wednesday, the predominantly white crowd of 8,000 in a university sports arena cheered him raucously, reminiscent of campaign rallies. \u201cThis is a pretty good crowd!\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThis is so nice. What a wonderful welcome.\u201dIf anything, the welcome in Baton Rouge was even nicer, as a predominantly black audience in the high school gymnasium cheered and shouted and, in some cases, jumped up and down. \u201cHe\u2019s here! He\u2019s here!\u201d one woman yelled as his motorcade arrived.Some of the questions Mr. Obama took were serious and heartfelt. A 10-year-old girl asked about curing cancer. (\u201cIt probably won\u2019t be cured in my lifetime,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I think it will be cured in yours.\u201d) A judge asked if she could offer ideas about overhauling the criminal justice system. (\u201cI\u2019ll have my people call your people,\u201d he said.)He was asked what he would do after leaving office and said he was too busy to think about it much. The question about a campaign by Mrs. Obama seemed to particularly amuse him.\u201cLet me tell you, there are three things that are certain in life: death, taxes and Michelle is not running for president,\u201d he said. (His spokesman later said that presumably applies to any other elected office.)White House officials were not the only ones who had anticipated that Mr. Obama might hear voices of dissent.\u201cThe president is trying to convince us that down is up,\u201d Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, said in a statement, meaning that neither the economy nor the president\u2019s health care program were doing as well as he has said. \u201cIf the president listens to the people of Louisiana and doesn\u2019t just speak, he will understand life for those outside of Washington.\u201dIt is not as if presidents are unaware of opposing viewpoints. Mr. Obama, like Mr. Bush, shies away from television news, but he spends evenings scouring the Internet on his iPad.Experiencing such views in person, however, is rarer. Supporters are more likely than critics to endure long lines, security sweeps and then sometimes hours of waiting for his arrival. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said the audience at the session on guns last week was more balanced because it was selected by a news organization. Crowds like those in Omaha and Baton Rouge, he said, tend to be more \u201cself-selecting,\u201d not through any design of the White House.\u201cIt\u2019s not because we choose the audiences,\u201d Mr. Earnest said. \u201cIt\u2019s because the audiences choose themselves.\u201dStill, the White House preselected a range of questions for Mr. Obama to choose from during a session on Twitter that followed his meeting on Thursday. He chose none that challenged him in any way.Others posed more substantive, but still friendly, questions about climate change, college affordability, discrimination against Muslims and gun control. Mr. Obama did not answer questions posted by the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, about the war against the Islamic State or executive overreach.On his way back to the airport, Mr. Obama stopped at Poor Boy Lloyd\u2019s to pick up oyster, shrimp and roast beef po\u2019 boys for lunch. Patrons eagerly shook his hand and snapped pictures, but again none offered any conflicting views, at least not that were heard by reporters.\u201cI\u2019m going to enjoy these po\u2019 boys,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

But safety and radioactive waste handling have long been issues, and in recent years\u00a0abundant, inexpensive natural gas has disrupted the economics of energy production, making some nuclear plants unprofitable. A few plants have been closed and only five new plants are under construction.The Energy Department has worked to extend the operating lifetime of existing plants for 20 years beyond their original 40-year licenses. Even so, without further licensing extensions, many of the nation\u2019s 99 operating plants will have to shut down by 2030.The government has been helping to finance research on new reactor designs for years, but as yet no designs have reached the market. The department expects that a type called small modular reactors will be the first new designs to begin operating, in the mid-2020s.These reactors are smaller but use the same basic technologies as current plants. They can be built in factories, reducing costs, and although they produce far less power than large plants, units can be added as needed.X-energy is working on a so-called pebble bed reactor, in which the uranium fuel is contained in ceramic- and graphite-covered balls rather than long, thin rods, and is cooled by gas rather than water. In such a design, the fuel cannot melt down in an accident, so a reactor should be able to be safely located close to population centers.Southern is working with TerraPower and research groups on a design that uses molten chloride, which acts as both coolant and as the medium for the fuel. The material is designed to be self-cooling in an accident, without the need for emergency water cooling systems.Advertisement"}

He searched the Internet and found Reverb, an online marketplace for musical instruments, which had the bass guitar he wanted. But the price tag was $1,600.\u201cIt was way more than my credit card ever would have allowed me to spend,\u201d recalled Mr. Jimenez, a sales associate at a local retail store, whose bank credit card has a $500 limit.Yet that apparent hurdle soon fell away. Reverb offered an alternative, Affirm, a lending start-up that provides installment financing. Mr. Jimenez applied in a few minutes on his smartphone, his purchase was then approved almost instantly, and he got his guitar. He chose a 12-month plan, with monthly payments of $150.Why would Affirm, a San Francisco start-up, make the seemingly snap judgment that Mr. Jimenez was a solid credit risk for a purchase more than three times the limit on his MasterCard?\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know,\u201d replied Max Levchin, Affirm\u2019s chief executive. \u201cOur math model says he\u2019s O.K.

Affirm is one of the most ambitious new lenders, in terms of relying purely on algorithms and automation to make its lending decisions. Many of the other start-ups are very data-driven but people are used to ask applicants follow-up questions or to make the final call on loans. Not so at Affirm. A person taps in his or her name, cellphone number, birth date and the last four digits of the person\u2019s Social Security number. Affirm sends the applicant a text message of a short string of numbers, which the person types in to authenticate that he or she is the person at that cellphone number. Then, Affirm\u2019s algorithms approve or reject the loan and purchase within seconds.\u201cIt\u2019s not magic, it\u2019s math,\u201d said Mr. Levchin, a co-founder of PayPal.Affirm\u2019s task is made easier because, while it is a credit card alternative, it is not a general-purpose credit card. Affirm\u2019s installment financing is for the purchase of a particular good at a particular merchant. The more than 100 merchants using Affirm so far are heavily weighted to specialized retailers of home furnishings, clothing, jewelry, exercise equipment, bicycles and musical instruments. Their offerings tend to be pricey. And initially, Affirm has been most used by people in their 20s and 30s.All that raises the question of whether Affirm\u2019s credit-analyzing models are clever or whether borrowers with certain demographics buying certain goods are simply good bets? To paraphrase Mr. Levchin, It\u2019s not math, it\u2019s the market.As a start-up, Affirm does not publicly disclose its financial results. But its early performance and prospects have impressed investors. Affirm has raised $325 million in debt and equity financing. And Affirm\u2019s internal figures indicate its installment loans cost less than credit-card loans. For borrowers with prime credit ratings, Affirm\u2019s interest on a 12-month loan is 8 percent, compared with 16 percent in interest and fees on a credit card loan, according to the company\u2019s analysis. For subprime borrowers, the Affirm cost is 13 percent, compared with 19 percent for credit cards. For \u201centry\u201d borrowers with scant credit history, the Affirm rate is 16 percent, compared with 24 percent for credit cards. A separate analysis by Affirm shows that its loan approval rates are also substantially higher across all three groups of borrowers.Affirm, for one, acknowledges that fairness has to part of its model. Mr. Levchin is on an advisory committee to the government\u2019s Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and Affirm\u2019s general counsel is Manuel Alvarez, a former lawyer for the consumer protection bureau. The danger to avoid, Mr. Alvarez said, is \u201cyou seem to have a neutral tool, but its impact is not.\u201d FollowAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "China Deepens Its Footprint in Iran After Lifting of Sanctions", "Date": "2016-01-24", "News": "Supported byOn Saturday, both countries agreed to increase trade to $600 billion in the coming decade.\u201cWhere we had to stand on the sidelines, the Chinese have been filling the void,\u201d said a European diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss strategic considerations. \u201cThey are way ahead of all of us.\u201dThe deep Chinese footprint in Iran does not manifest itself only in the tens of thousands of inexpensive cars that have flooded the streets of Tehran in the past few years. Investors like Mr. Li, who has built two other factories here, as well as Chinese state companies, are active all over the country, building highways, digging mines and melting steel.In Tehran, the Chinese have been involved in the construction of a huge elevated expressway and the building of the Niayesh Tunnel, which at more than three and a half miles will be one of the longest urban tunnels in the world. The city\u2019s metro system was built from scratch, starting in 1995, with Chinese capital and Chinese engineers. The train cars that run on it are Chinese, too.\u201cWesterners visiting the capital often wonder how we managed to pull off such ambitious projects during the heaviest sanction regime in history,\u201d said Mohammad Reza Sabzalipour, Iran\u2019s World Trade Center representative. \u201cWell, we did it with the help of our Chinese friends.\u201d Thirst for cheap crude oil and enthusiasm for the Silk Road project, which incorporates the goal of unlocking China\u2019s isolated western provinces, brought the Chinese to Iran, the only country in the Middle East where the United States had no presence. Iran had long welcomed the relationship, but after sanctions started to squeeze the economy at the end of the last decade, the country gained a special status, and China\u2019s slow but steady advance here began.\u201cWe are Iran\u2019s biggest trading partner for six years in a row,\u201d Mr. Xi wrote in an open letter to the Iranian people, Xinhua, China\u2019s state news agency, reported on Thursday, a day before his arrival on a Middle East tour that will also take him to Saudi Arabia and Egypt.During the Iran-Iraq war, China sold weapons, including Silkworm missiles, to Iran.\u201cAfter the revolution we exchanged the Western frowns with the smiles from the East,\u201d said Asadollah Asgaroladi, one of Iran\u2019s wealthiest businessmen and the head of the Iran-China chamber of commerce. \u201cThey continue to smile at us.\u201dSo the two countries, which were connected by the old Silk Road, have embarked on building a new one.\u201cChina has considerable strength in capital, technologies, equipment and other areas,\u201d Mr. Xi wrote in his letter. \u201cIran has rich resources, ample labor force and huge market potential, and it is in the crucial stage of industrialization and modernization.\u201dIn the last decade, trade started gravitating toward China and away from Germany, Iran\u2019s traditional partner, with a business volume of more than $30 billion annually. Iran exported $19 billion in crude oil and petrochemical products and imported $17 billion in goods and services in 2013. Iran\u2019s other big petroleum customers, South Korea and Japan, were persuaded by the United States to halve their purchases of Iranian light crude.China did not play along.\u201cThey are an independent country,\u201d Mr. Asgaroladi said. \u201cThey don\u2019t allow the Americans to tell them what to do. So they buy our oil, now and in the future.\u201dIn order to ease Chinese oil payments to Iran, a bank was created, Mr. Asgaroladi said.Although that institution, the Bank of Kunlun, was formed to handle oil money, Reuters, quoting a Western intelligence report, said in 2014 that the elite Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps also used the bank for payments.The Chinese may have no qualms about buying Iranian oil, but they take care not to violate United States sanctions on banking transactions because of their extensive use of American banks, Mr. Asgaroladi said.\u201cThe Ministry of Oil\u2019s money is deposited in accounts in this bank,\u201d he said. \u201cWe use 30 to 40 percent to make cash payments for purchases elsewhere in Asia, and the rest is used to finance projects in Iran and buy Chinese items.\u201dDuring a visit last summer to Mr. Li\u2019s steel mill, near the village of Zarrinabad, Chinese laborers were sweeping in preparation for its opening.Speaking through an interpreter, Mr. Li said that he became interested in Iran after relatives told him that it was an interesting place to invest, and that he came here in 2010. While he refused to go into details of how the money for the project arrived, he said it involved a \u201cprivate transfer,\u201d essentially a money swap that was based on trust and that avoided traditional banking routes.Mr. Asgaroladi said Mr. Li had received financing through the Chinese government but did not say how that money made it to Iran. \u201cWe do a lot of bartering,\u201d he said.\u201cIf all goes well, we will have a yearly output of 600,000 tons of steel,\u201d an assistant to Mr. Li said. In August, the plant \u2014 which has a private train, 700 mostly Chinese employees and a huge exhaust tower \u2014 was officially opened in the presence of Iranian and Chinese officials.China took the opportunity the sanctions offered, said Mr. Sabzalipour, the Tehran World Trade Center representative. Of course, for outsiders, it seems as if the Chinese have ignored the economic cordon against Iran, he said.\u201cOn the other hand, I think it was never the intention to destroy our economy, just make us feel pain,\u201d he said. \u201cSo perhaps the Americans intentionally looked the other way when China threw us this lifeline.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Looming End of Tax-Break Program Could Harm Mayor\u2019s Housing Plan", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported byOn that day, an obscure tax-break program the city has used to create thousands of such apartments is set to expire unless construction unions and real estate developers agree on the wages to be paid on future projects receiving the subsidy.The odds of a deal coming together range from very unlikely to impossible, according to key officials on both sides of the bargaining table, although state and city officials were holding out hope for a last-minute compromise.\u201cThe two sides need to step back from the cliff and start focusing on how to solve the problems facing us,\u201d she said of Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio, \u201cand where best to apply resources.\u201dThat seems unlikely to happen.Under the 421-a program, developers have for more than 40 years received substantial tax breaks for including subsidized apartments in what were otherwise luxury buildings. The program has long been criticized by housing experts as a giveaway to real estate interests.\u201cThis can\u2019t be a city of just penthouses and luxury condos,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said at the time. \u201cWe are turning the page and making sure the same pressures that have pushed New Yorkers out of their neighborhoods are harnessed to build the next generation of affordable housing.\u201dThe mayor\u2019s proposal garnered praise from housing activists, but drew immediate criticism from the city\u2019s construction unions. They argued that any project receiving public subsidies should pay union wages, which have traditionally helped lift blue-collar workers into the middle class. While the construction unions work on most commercial and public works projects in the city, they have lost ground to nonunion contractors in the building of midrise residential towers.The real estate board argued that paying higher wages would increase construction costs by 20 percent to 30 percent, resulting in either fewer below-market units or bigger subsidies.In the end, the Legislature, at Mr. Cuomo\u2019s behest, passed a short-term extension of the subsidy program in June. In an odd twist, the legislation said the program would be renewed if two private entities \u2014 the unions and the real estate industry \u2014 agreed by Jan. 15 on a public policy: to institute union-level wages on 421-a projects.The parties, represented by John Banks, president of the real estate board, and Gary La Barbera, president of the Building and Construction Trades Council, struggled to forge a deal. Just before Christmas, they arrived at the outline of a compromise that union officials and real estate executives thought their constituents could support.They proposed establishing an unspecified minimum wage for workers on 421-a projects, letting union contractors bid on any job and expanding the 421-a program to include condominiums as well as rentals. Condos, which generally yield higher profits, would be required to include apartments earmarked for residents of modest means and to pay construction workers union-level wages.Mr. La Barbera relayed the idea to the governor\u2019s office, according to three executives briefed on the talks who were not authorized to discuss them publicly. Aides to the governor swiftly rejected the compromise, because of the inclusion of condos in the program. That would require going back to the Legislature for approval, something the Cuomo administration did not want. The governor called Rob Speyer, a friend and the chairman of the real estate board, to convey the same message, the executives said.Many developers and housing experts say any agreement between the unions and the real estate industry would probably need the Legislature\u2019s approval anyway.At a meeting on Jan. 7, Mr. Banks told members of his executive board that a deal with the unions was unlikely. Later that day, he and Mr. LaBarbera concluded that \u201ctime had run out.\u201dAs of Tuesday, no additional meetings were planned.Mr. Banks said on Tuesday, \u201cWe remain committed to working with stakeholders for a program that will allow much more affordable, or below-market, rental housing to be built, ensure construction workers are treated fairly and create job opportunities for residents of New York City.\u201dAsked on Monday about the possible death of the 421-a program, Mr. de Blasio said, \u201cThere\u2019s still time on the clock.\u201dPrivately, city officials are pessimistic. They have also been reluctant to show support for any potential compromise out of fear that Mr. Cuomo would oppose it.State officials, however, dismissed the idea that the program would simply expire. In time-honored fashion, one side or the other will blink at the last minute, these officials said, allowing for a compromise under which developers would accept smaller profits and unions would agree that only projects over a certain size would have to pay union wages.\u201cEveryone says the program is vitally important,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said in an interview on Tuesday. \u201cIf it is, they\u2019ll come to an agreement. If not, the program terminates, which would be their decision.\u201dIf the 421-a program expires, it could take at least a year for the full impact to be felt, because many projects are already underway by developers who hurried to qualify for the tax breaks before the landscape changed. On Monday, Mr. de Blasio said that the city had over the past two years financed projects that preserved or built a total of 40,204 apartments as part of his affordable-housing plan, 5,000 of them as part of the 421-a program.Still, officials worry about the future.\u201cWithout 421-a,\u201d Ms. Perrine of the Housing Council said, \u201cit\u2019ll cost the government more money to provide the affordable units they\u2019re promising. We have an overarching need to preserve the housing stock we have for future generations and to add to the supply of housing people can afford.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mexico Moves to Extradite Drug Kingpin Called El Chapo to the U.S.", "Date": "2016-01-09", "News": "Supported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 After long resisting requests from Washington, the Mexican government is moving toward extraditing Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Loera, the Mexican drug lord known as El Chapo, to the United States to face drug and murder charges there, Mexican officials said on Saturday.Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s lawyers are expected to fight extradition to the United States, where he faces at least seven indictments in federal courts on charges of drug trafficking and murder.Mr. Guzm\u00e1n, who escaped from prison last year, was captured on Friday after a gun battle near the coast in his home state, Sinaloa. His capture was the culmination of a monthslong manhunt in the mountains of the so-called Golden Triangle, a rugged area in the northwest of the country. After an intense gunfight in the coastal city of Los Mochis, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n was captured attempting to flee in a vehicle with one of his top lieutenants. By late Friday he was en route to the same prison he escaped from in July.Transferring Mr. Guzm\u00e1n to the United States would be an about-face for the government, which has in the past resisted efforts to extradite the drug lord as a matter of sovereignty. Mr. Guzm\u00e1n, the head of the Sinaloa Cartel, would first serve his time in Mexico before he was sent to the United States, officials had said.Almost exactly one year ago, Jesus Murillo Karam, the Mexican attorney general at the time, said: \u201cI can accept extradition, but when I say so. El Chapo has to stay here and do his time, then I\u2019ll extradite him. Some 300, 400 years later. That\u2019s a lot of time.\u201dEven as recently as three weeks before his escape from prison, through a mile-long tunnel connected to his shower stall, the United States made a formal extradition request for Mr. Guzm\u00e1n. But even if Mexico has come around to the idea of extradition, the legal process could take many months. Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s lawyers have already filed motions to block any extradition, dating from his last imprisonment in 2014, and the process must go through the judicial system. \u201cIt is not merely a matter of an executive decision,\u201d one of the officials said.For now, though, the attorney general\u2019s office appeared prepared to press on with the early steps leading to extradition. Noting the efforts by Mr. Guzman\u2019s lawyers to file injunctions, a statement from the office on Saturday said that none of them \u201cprevents the execution of these orders, much less the start of the extradition procedure.\u201d A spokesman for President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto declined to comment.In the past, experts say, the courts have generally sided with the government in extradition cases. But the idea that the process could be expedited is unlikely.\u201cThere is no fast-track extradition,\u201d said Agust\u00edn Acosta, a defense lawyer not involved in the case. \u201cThe process could take maybe as long as a year.\u201dThe United States has made several extradition requests for Mr. Guzm\u00e1n, and officials are hopeful he may be sent there as law-enforcement relations have improved, a Justice Department official said on Saturday. But the department has not received any definite commitment, the official said.\u201cIs it possible? Yes,\u201d said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in discussing international deliberations. \u201cBut I have not heard anything definitive.\u201d The official noted that Mexico had agreed to send several high-level fugitives, including Edgar \u201cLa Barbie\u201d Valdez, in September and said that relations between the two countries in law enforcement operations had improved drastically in recent months. Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch has now met twice with Ms. G\u00f3mez Gonz\u00e1lez.\u201cThere\u2019s a different mind-set,\u201d the official said.In the aftermath of Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s escape, relations between the Mexican and American governments were at a low. Offers of American assistance to Mexican law enforcement authorities, including drones and intelligence, were initially rebuffed.The decision mystified many on the United States side, and even led some within the Mexican government to grow impatient. Mr. Guzm\u00e1n, with the weight of Mexico\u2019s most powerful drug cartel behind him, was a particularly well-resourced fugitive.Here is what you need to know about the secret mountaintop meeting between Sean Penn and the drug lord Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Loera, also known as \u201cEl Chapo.\u201dBut the nature of the early relationship between the United States and Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s government was one of caution. When Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto came to office, he sought to break with the administration of his predecessor, Felipe Calder\u00f3n, who worked very closely with the Americans and devoted much of his time to prosecuting the American-led war on drugs.Individuals in the Calder\u00f3n administration said that toward the end of their time in office, there was a recognition that the Mexican government had done too much on behalf of the United States, to the point of even working against its own interests. They pursued the gangs with full force, breaking many of them apart while also creating an unpredictable group of organizations that were less disciplined and more violent.But the black eye of Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s escape, from the country\u2019s most secure prison, caused the government to begin rethinking its strategy. The reach of the drug baron, his ability to successfully bribe and threaten officials, bring incredible resources to bear and pull off the seemingly impossible have started to prompt a change of heart at the top.One of the officials said sending Mr. Guzm\u00e1n to the United States was simply the right thing to do, but denied that it was because Mexican institutions were not up to the task. But in both of his past escapes, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n has managed to involve prison officials, pointing once more to the challenges faced by Mexico.The manhunt for Mr. Guzm\u00e1n reached a finale in the early hours of Friday, when Mexican marines stormed a compound in Los Mochis where he had sought refuge with several others. During the ensuing firefight, which raged for more than an hour, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n escaped with a top lieutenant through a storm drain.The men emerged through a manhole, and then stole a car. But the authorities quickly tracked them down, capturing them along the highway from Los Mochis to Navojoa. Mr. Guzm\u00e1n was taken to Mexico City and, late on Friday night, paraded before media cameras in blue track pants and his signature mustache on his trip to the maximum security prison, Altiplano.With an estimated wealth of nearly $1 billion, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n was among the most well-financed fugitives in history. The hunt for Mr. Guzm\u00e1n may have been Mexico\u2019s most extensive manhunt ever. Investigators focused on the Triangle, along the borders of the states of Sinaloa, Durango and Chihuahua. They identified Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s logistics network, which included airplanes, runways and a range of property and vehicles.The search began with the investigation into his escape, as the police rounded up the people who built the tunnel and flew Mr. Guzm\u00e1n to a hiding place in the northwestern mountains. They tracked him to a ranch in the remote municipality of Pueblo Nuevo in Durango.By October, they were ready to act. Special forces units aboard a helicopter had him in their sights, but they could not shoot; Mr. Guzm\u00e1n was accompanied by two women and a girl, and the snipers held their fire.As he fled from the snipers, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n slipped and fell, injuring his leg and face, the authorities said at the time. Though he escaped, security forces were able to capture seven of his men, and those arrests led to more intelligence about his movements.Mr. Guzm\u00e1n retreated farther into the mountains, cut back his guard, and limited his communications, Ms. G\u00f3mez said. But by that time, Mexican intelligence was tracking his moves, helped in part by the feelers Mr. Guzm\u00e1n had put out to actresses and producers about making a movie about his life.By the end of December, the authorities became aware that Mr. Guzm\u00e1n would be traveling through a city. The government began tracking one of Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s chief tunnel architects, who was preparing different homes in the states of Sinaloa and Sonora for his boss\u2019s arrival.Among those homes being watched was the one in Los Mochis, a city of some 250,000 near the Sinaloan coast. After nearly a month of surveillance, on Wednesday, the authorities noticed unusual activity inside the house. At dawn on Thursday, a car appeared. Based on intelligence, the authorities said, they knew that Mr. Guzm\u00e1n was inside.At dawn on Friday, federal forces began a raid on the house. They were met with high-caliber gunfire. Mr. Guzm\u00e1n reverted to an old playbook: He fled.Hours later, the Mexican president, using his Twitter account, announced the news of his capture.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated, at one point, the year that Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Loera escaped from a Mexican prison. It was last year, not this year.An earlier version of the above correction omitted the source of the error.

It happened.\u201dIn many ways, though, the celebration for the National Iranian Tanker Company, known as N.I.T.C., was more of a reunion than a session to get acquainted, as the global shipping industry welcomed back a partner \u2014 not from bankruptcy, but from one of the strictest sets of sanctions ever.For decades, the company, which owns 69 oil tankers, shipped crude around the world. Its English-speaking staff was in daily contact with brokers in all of the major financial markets, proud of the company\u2019s high standards and excellent reputation in a highly competitive industry.\u201cWe really missed them on the market,\u201d said Edwin Remeeus, a team leader at Vopak, a shipping agent based in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, that also stores and handles crude oil and natural gas. Vopak was forced to sever ties with N.I.T.C. in 2012, after having been its agent for over 30 years.\u201cEvery year, they would send us Christmas cards,\u201d Mr. Remeeus said. \u201cYou\u2019d think they would be upset, but they understood it wasn\u2019t personal.\u201dIn 2012, the United States Treasury Department identified 58 of the company\u2019s vessels and 27 of its corporate affiliates as extensions of the Iranian state, and it threatened actions against Western companies that used any of those services.For N.I.T.C., business, long solid, unraveled in a couple of months. First, insurers started excusing themselves, saying that they could no longer work with the Iranian company. Major oil companies, including Royal Dutch Shell, Total of France and Repsol of Spain, all longtime clients, said they needed to clear payments before giving new orders, but they complained that banks were preventing them from doing so.At N.I.T.C. headquarters here, committees were formed to devise ways around the sanctions. First, they changed insurers, using local brokers instead, but their foreign clients refused to deal with them. Then Malta, one of the most accommodating flags to sail under, cut ties, and the company had trouble finding new partners. At first it worked with the microstate of Tuvalu, and it eventually reflagged the entire fleet under Tanzania, widely regarded as a substandard \u201cflag of convenience.\u201dThe ships\u2019 names were also changed, dropping references to their country of origin. The Iran Astaneh became Neptune, the Iran Damavand just Damavand. Before long, the pride of the Iranian fleet was sailing under names like Amber, Horizon and Success.Mr. Sardashti did not want to go into details, but he dismissed the whole period under sanctions as \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201cmean.\u201d\u201cWe had to change our standards; it was painful,\u201d he recalled, adding that he was grateful for the countries and companies that had been willing to help N.I.T.C. in those tough times. Even so, he acknowledged, \u201cgradually, we lost our biggest clients.\u201dThe government started meddling with the company, and many industry insiders were surprised when Hamid Behbahani, a former minister of roads and transportation, was appointed chief executive \u2014 even though he had been impeached for falsifying a university degree. He was replaced after a year by Ali-Akbar Safaei, who is still at the helm.In 2014, when the company was exclusively serving China and five other Asian nations still buying some Iranian oil \u2014 limited sales were allowed under the sanctions \u2014 it had a glimmer of success when a European Union court ruled that the sanctions against the company were illegal. Still, until the sanctions were lifted, N.I.T.C. gained no new customers.On Saturday, Iran made its first oil sale to a European company since the sanctions were lifted. But Mr. Sardashti said he had not yet received a call from the buyer, Hellenic Petroleum, to ship it to Greece. When he does, he says, he will have plenty of oil at hand. With the current global oil glut, several of his tankers are being used as floating storage, waiting for buyers.So far, though, not a single ship had set sail for Europe. \u201cWe are waiting for our first assignment,\u201d Mr. Sardashti said.\u201cWe all hoped that one day the sanctions would be gone,\u201d said Wictor Mansson of the shipping company Affinity in London. \u201cOther companies picked up their share, but in the end we have less tonnage to transport the oil, so their return might push prices down.\u201dSome obstacles remain, however. Despite sanctions being lifted, financing has been slowed by international banks\u2019 fears of penalties from the United States Treasury Department over sanctions it imposed decades ago for Iran\u2019s state sponsorship of terrorism.\u201cAll our crews have been updated, our standards are still high, we are ready for business,\u201d Mr. Sardashti said. \u201cNow, we hope the others are, too.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Supreme Court to Hear Case Involving Judgments Against Iran", "Date": "2016-01-12", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Iranian government has come under sharp criticism for not giving imprisoned Americans a fair and public court hearing. But on Wednesday at the Supreme Court, Iran will get just that.But the arguments are taking place at a critical juncture in relations between the United States and Iran, coming just months after the nuclear agreement signed by the two countries. Also, if the Supreme Court decision goes against Iran, the country will be forced to forfeit some $1.85 billion in assets, the largest single handover of funds to American plaintiffs who over the years have won dozens of terrorism-related court judgments against Iran.Along with the Beirut bombing, cases have involved the Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia in 1996, the Sept. 11 attacks, airplane hijackings and other incidents in which Iran has been accused of financing or facilitating the acts of terrorist organizations. But while plaintiffs have won tens of billions in dollars in judgments against Iran, which has declined to defend itself in those cases, the families of victims have seen neither financial rewards nor a sense of justice.\u201cIt has been a long, long road,\u201d said Lynn Derbyshire, the sister of Vincent Smith, a Marine captain who died in the Beirut attack.The federal government has put up barriers to the collection of those judgments because under diplomatic arrangements with Iran it has agreed to protect some of that country\u2019s assets here. And both the Iranian government and Iranian organizations have fought in court to block the enforcement of lawsuit-related judgments, by challenging efforts to seize property or bank accounts.At a November hearing in New York, for example, lawyers for the Alavi Foundation, the majority owner of a Manhattan office tower at 650 Fifth Avenue, asked a federal appeals court panel to block a move by the Justice Department to seize the building, originally built by the shah of Iran. Federal prosecutors had charged that Alavi and the building\u2019s other owner, the Assa Corporation, were fronts for the Iranian government and engaged in money laundering that violated United States economic sanctions.In 2014, Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, struck a deal with lawyers for 19 individual families or groups holding judgments against Iran that provided for a pro rata distribution of proceeds from the sale of 650 Fifth Avenue, estimated to be worth around $1 billion. But at the federal appeals court hearing, a lawyer for the Alavi Foundation, Daniel Ruzumna, argued that government\u2019s seizure of the building should be stopped because the group, which describes itself as a charitable organization, had not been given an adequate opportunity to prove that it was not involved in wrongdoing.\u201cThis is the death knell of a 40-year-old charity,\u201d Mr. Ruzumna said. The Alavi Foundation was devoted to the promotion and support of Persian and Islamic culture. The appeals court\u2019s decision is expected this year.The case before the Supreme Court on Wednesday started with a 2001 lawsuit filed against Iran by families of some of the 241 servicemen killed in the bombing of the United States Marine barracks in Beirut. In 2003, a federal judge found Iran liable for helping to finance the attack and, four years later, awarded $2.7 billion in compensatory damages against that country for its role in the bombing.Over the years, Congress has passed several laws aimed at helping the families of terrorism victims collect awards. In 2002, for example, lawmakers enacted the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, giving plaintiffs with judgments the ability to execute them against the blocked assets of a party deemed a terrorist.At the time, that law did not have a significant effect on recovering damages because plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers found few Iranian assets. But in 2008, officials at the Office of Foreign Assets, a unit of the Treasury Department, notified lawyers in the Beirut bombing case that they had found $1.75 billion in assets belonging to Iran\u2019s central bank, Bank Markazi, in a Citibank account.The plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers in the Beirut bombing case began a proceeding to seize those assets. The Iranian government fought the proceeding on several grounds, including that the funds were immune from seizure. Then, in 2012, Congress passed a law called the Iranian Threat Reduction and Syrian Human Rights Act, which made specific reference to the Beirut case and ordered the court to require the surrender of the Iranian assets to the victims\u2019 families.That law is the focus of the Supreme Court case. In their filings, lawyers for Bank Markazi have argued that the law violates the Constitution because, in effectively directing a result in a specific lawsuit, Congress is improperly encroaching on the role of the federal judiciary.\u201cThat legislative intrusion into a single pending case \u2014 changing the law so that plaintiffs\u2019 can collect more than $2 billion from their adversaries \u2014 clearly violates the separation of powers,\u201d the bank\u2019s lawyers stated in their brief.Lawyers for the families of the victims of the Beirut barracks bombing and their supporters have called Iran\u2019s argument a further attempt by Iran to avoid responsibility for state-sponsored terrorism. Jimmy Gurul\u00e9, a professor at Notre Dame Law School, said he was surprised that the Supreme Court decided to take the case because Iran\u2019s liability for the Beirut attacks had been assessed long before the 2012 law was passed.Ms. Derbyshire, the sister of the Marine captain who died, said she was eager for that day to arrive. \u201cIt would be great if the Supreme Court ruled in our favor,\u201d she said. \u201cFor me, this has been much more about getting justice than getting money.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Albany Ethics Commission Adopts New Fund-Raising and Disclosure Rules", "Date": "2016-01-26", "News": "Supported byBut on Tuesday, at least, the commission seemed to become a hotbed of action, adopting a pair of advisory opinions intended to tighten fund-raising restrictions for New York\u2019s highest-ranking elected officials, and widening disclosure requirements for public-relations consultants, including for activities like soliciting editorials from news organizations.The change had been publicly opposed by both current occupants of those offices: the state comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, and the attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, both Democrats.Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s office also cited a series of perceived practical problems, arguing that the opinion would effectively require government officials and campaigns to coordinate in a way that \u201cis likely to contribute to, not dispel, the appearance of improper influence,\u201d including asking governmental staff to review campaign contributions to see if their donors are being investigated.Perhaps with such concerns in mind, the opinion adopted by the commission on Tuesday was modified to ban contributions only from donors who were the subject of active investigations, in which \u201cthe elected official, or the official\u2019s immediate state staff, are personally and substantially involved\u201d in the inquiry.Both the attorney general\u2019s office and the comptroller\u2019s office declined to comment on the fund-raising decision, which passed unanimously.The idea of monitoring contacts with journalists, even in loose ways, prompted a furious reaction from public relations professionals, who said that such disclosure would have a chilling effect on both their First Amendment rights and journalists\u2019 ability to report the news.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s office \u2014 which names six of the commission\u2019s 14 members \u2014 noted that the opinion \u201craises some real questions.\u201dThe commission appeared willing to compromise, noting the fact that such disclosure would apply only to consultants who were seeking to influence editorials.The opinion was adopted with a disclaimer saying it was \u201cin no way intended to restrict a reporter\u2019s ability to gather information or to seek comment from representatives of advocacy groups as part of reporting the news.\u201d\u201cRather,\u201d the disclaimer continued, \u201cthis is intended to generate transparency in the activities of paid media consultants.\u201dAs modified, the rule passed 10 to 3. Still, its opponents said Jcope, so often faulted for not doing enough, had gone too far.\u201cIt makes no difference if we\u2019re talking about edit boards or newsrooms,\u201d said Jerry McKinstry, the managing director of the November Team, a firm that threatened not to abide by the new rule, calling it \u201cclassic government overreach\u201d and \u201ctotally misguided.\u201d\u201cLast I checked, editorial board members were journalists, too,\u201d Mr. McKinstry said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Poll on Medical Bills Was Conducted", "Date": "2016-01-05", "News": "Supported byPublic HealthQuestionnaires were administered both online and by telephone in both English and Spanish, including a longer questionnaire for 1,204 respondents who reported problems paying household medical bills in the previous 12 months and a shorter questionnaire for 1,371 respondents who did not report such problems.A total of 1,956 panel members with Internet access completed the survey online, while an additional 619 members without access were interviewed by telephone.For purposes of analysis, respondents who reported problems paying medical bills and respondents who reported no such problems were sampled at different rates. (Those with no problems were under-sampled.) The two groups were then weighted to their proper proportion of the population.The combined results have been weighted to adjust for variation in the sample of the United States population aged 18 to 64 relating to geographic region, gender, race/ethnicity, age, education and household income.In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, overall results based on such samples will differ by no more than 3 percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking to interview all adults from this population. This margin of sampling error takes into account that weighting procedures increase its size slightly.For smaller subgroups, the margin of sampling error is larger. For example, it is plus or minus 4 points for both the group with problems paying medical bills and the group reporting no such problems.In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of the public may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variation in the wording, order and translation of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.Complete questions and results are available at nytimes.com/polls.slide showAdvertisement"}

After all the campaigning, soon, Americans will have their say with the first votes of the 2016 campaign just 15 days away in Iowa.HOLT: And New Hampshire not far behind.Tonight will be the final opportunity to see these candidates face to face before the voting begins. Our purpose here tonight is to highlight and examine the differences among the three Democratic candidates. So let\u2019s get started.Please welcome Secretary Hillary Clinton, Senator Bernie Sanders and Governor Martin O\u2019Malley.(APPLAUSE)Well, welcome to all of you. Hope you\u2019re excited, we\u2019re excited. We want to thank our hosts, the Congressional Black Caucus Institute. I\u2019m joined by my colleague Andrea Mitchell tonight. The rules are simple. Sixty seconds for answers, 30 seconds for follow-ups or rebuttals. I know you\u2019ll all keep exactly to time, so our job should be pretty easy here tonight. We\u2019ll have questions from the Youtube community throughout the debate.This is a critical point in the race. You\u2019ve been defining your differences with each other especially vigorously in the last week on the campaign trail. We\u2019re here to facilitate this conversation on behalf of the voters so that they know exactly where you stand as you face off tonight. Let\u2019s have a great debate.We\u2019ll begin with 45 second opening statements from each candidate, starting with Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Well, good evening. And I want to thank the Congressional Black Caucus Institute and the people of Charleston for hosting us here on the eve of Martin Luther King Day tomorrow.You know, I remember well when my youth minister took me to hear Dr. King. I was a teenager. And his moral clarity, the message that he conveyed that evening really stayed with me and helped to set me on a path to service. I also remember that he spent the last day of his life in Memphis, fighting for dignity and higher pay for working people.And that is our fight still. We have to get the economy working and incomes rising for everyone, including those who have been left out and left behind. We have to keep our communities and our country safe. We need a president who can do all aspects of the job.I understand that this is the hardest job in the world. I\u2019m prepared and ready to take it on and I hope to earn your support to be the nominee of the Democratic Party and the next president of the United States.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Thank you. Senator Sanders, your opening statement, sir.SANDERS: Thank you. As we honor the extraordinary life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., it\u2019s important not only that we remember what he stood for, but that we pledge to continue his vision to transform our country. As we look out at our country today, what the American people understand is we have an economy that\u2019s rigged, that ordinary Americans are working longer hours for lower wages, 47 million people living in poverty, and almost all of the new income and wealth going to the top one percent.SANDERS: And then, to make a bad situation worse, we have a corrupt campaign finance system where millionaires and billionaires are spending extraordinary amounts of money to buy elections.This campaign is about a political revolution to not only elect the president, but to transform this country.HOLT: Senator, thank you.(APPLAUSE)And Governor O\u2019Malley, your opening statement, sir.O\u2019MALLEY: Thank you. My name is Martin O\u2019Malley, I was born the year Dr. King delivered his \u201cI Have A Dream\u201d speech.And I want to thank the people of South Carolina, not only for hosting our debate here tonight, but also for what you taught all of us in the aftermath of the tragic shooting at Mother Emanuel Church.You taught us, in fact, in keeping with Dr. King\u2019s teaching, that love would have the final word when you took down the Confederate flag from your state house; let go of the past and move forward.Eight years ago, you brought forward a new leader in Barack Obama to save our country from the second Great Depression. And that\u2019s what he\u2019s done. Our country\u2019s doing better, we\u2019re creating jobs again.But in order to make good on the promise of equal opportunity and equal justice under the law, and we have urgent work to do, and the voices of anger and fear and division that we\u2019ve heard coming off of the Republican presidential podiums are pretty loud.We need new leadership. We need to come together as a people and build on the good things that President Obama has done.That\u2019s why I\u2019m running for president. I need your help, I ask for your vote, and I look forward to moving our country forward once again.Thank you.HOLT: All right. And Governor, thank you.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: All right, to our first question, now. The first question, I\u2019ll be addressing to all of the candidates.President Obama came to office determined to swing for the fences on health care reform. Voters want to know how you would define your presidency? How would you think big? So complete this sentence: in my first 100 days in office, my top three priorities will be \u2014 fill in the blank.Senator Sanders.SANDERS: Well, that\u2019s what our campaign is about. It is thinking big. It is understanding that in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, we should have health care for every man, woman, and child as a right that we should raise the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour; that we have got to create millions of decent- paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure.So, what my first days are about is bringing America together, to end the decline of the middle class, to tell the wealthiest people in this country that yes, they are going to start paying their fair share of taxes, and that we are going to have a government that works for all of us, and not just big campaign contributors.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Secretary Clinton, same question, my first 100 days in office, my top three priorities will be.CLINTON: I would work quickly to present to the Congress my plans for creating more good jobs in manufacturing, infrastructure, clean and renewable energy, raising the minimum wage, and guaranteeing, finally, equal pay for women\u2019s work.I would also...(APPLAUSE)I would also be presenting my plans to build on the Affordable Care Act and to improve it by decreasing the out-of-pocket costs by putting a cap on prescription drug costs; by looking for ways that we can put the prescription drug business and the health insurance company business on a more stable platform that doesn\u2019t take too much money out of the pockets of hard-working Americans.And third, I would be working, in every way that I knew, to bring our country together. We do have too much division, too much mean- spiritedness. There\u2019s a lot we have to do on immigration reform, on voting rights, on campaign finance reform, but we need to do it together. That\u2019s how we\u2019ll have the kind of country for the 21st century that we know will guarantee our children and grandchildren the kind of future they deserve.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Governor O\u2019Malley, same question.O\u2019MALLEY: Thank you. First of all, I would lay out an agenda to make wages go up again for all Americans, rather than down. Equal pay for equal work, making it easier rather than harder for people to join labor unions and bargain collectively for better wages; getting 11 million of our neighbors out of the underground shadow economy by passing comprehensive immigration reform, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, however we can, wherever we can.Secondly, I believe the greatest business opportunity to come to the United States of America in 100 years is climate change. And I put forward a plan to move us to a 100 percent clean electric energy grid by 2050 and create 5 million jobs along the way.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Thank you. You\u2019ve all...O\u2019MALLEY: Finally \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, that was second, Lester.O\u2019MALLEY: And third and finally, we need a new agenda for America\u2019s cities. We have not had a new agenda for America\u2019s cities since Jimmy Carter. We need a new agenda for America cities that will invest in the talents and skills in our people, that will invest in CBVG transportation, infrastructure and transit options, and make our cities the leading edge in this move to a redesigned built clean green energy future that will employ our people.HOLT: All right governor thank you.We\u2019ve all laid out large visions and we\u2019re going to cover a lot of the ground you talked about as we continue in the evening. The last couple of weeks of this campaign have featured some of the sharpest exchanges in the race. Let\u2019s start with one of them, the issue of guns.Senator Sanders, last week Secretary Clinton called you quote, \u201ca pretty reliable vote for the gun lobby.\u201d Right before the debate you changed your position on immunity from lawsuits for gun manufacturers, can you tell us why?SANDERS: Well, I think Secretary Clinton knows that what she says is very disingenuous. I have a D-minus voting record from the NRA. I was in 1988, there were three candidates running for congress in the state of Vermont, I stood up to the gun lobby and came out and maintained the position that in this country we should not be selling military style assault weapons.I have supported from day one and instant background check to make certain that people who should have guns do not have guns. And that includes people of criminal backgrounds, people who are mentally unstable. I support what President Obama is doing in terms of trying to close the gun show loop holes and I think it should be a federal crime if people act as dormant (ph).We have seen in this city a horrendous tragedy of a crazed person praying with people in the coming up and shooting nine people. This should not be a political issue. What we should be doing is working together.And by the way, as a senator from a rural state that has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am in an excellent position to bring people together to fight the sensible...HOLT: Senator, but you didn\u2019t answer the question that you did change your position on immunity from gun manufacturers. So can you...SANDERS: What I have said, is that gun manufacturer\u2019s liability bill has some good provisions among other things, we\u2019ve prohibited ammunition that would\u2019ve killed cops who had protection on. We have child safety protection work on guns in that legislation. And what we also said, \u201cis a small mom and pop gun shop who sells a gun legally to somebody should not be held liable if somebody does something terrible with that gun.\u201dSo what I said is, \u201c I would re-look at it.\u201d We are going to re- look at it and I will support stronger provisions.HOLT: Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond to Senator Sanders.CLINTON: Yes look, I have made it clear based on Senator Sanders\u2019 own record that he has voted with the NRA, with the gun lobby numerous times. He voted against the Brady Bill five times. He voted for what we call, the Charleston Loophole. He voted for immunity from gunmakers and sellers which the NRA said, \u201cwas the most important piece of gun legislation in 20 years. \u201cHe voted to let guns go onto the Amtrak, guns go into National Parks. He voted against doing research to figure out how we can save lives. Let\u2019s not forget what this is about, 90 people a day die from gun violence in our country. That\u2019s 33,000 people a year.One of the most horrific examples not a block from here where we had nine people murdered. Now, I am pleased to hear that Senator Sanders has reversed his position on immunity and I look forward to him joining with those members of congress who have already introduced legislation. There is no other industry in America that was given the total pass that the gun makers and dealers were and that needs to be reversed.HOLT: All right, Governor O\u2019Malley, you signed tough gun control measures as governor of Maryland and there are a lot Democrats in the audience here in South Carolina who own guns. This conversation might be worrying many of them. They may be hearing, \u201cyou want to take my guns. What would you say to them?O\u2019MALLEY: This is what I would say Lester, look see, I\u2019ve listened to Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders go back and forth on which of them has the most inconsistent record on gun safety legislation and I would have to agree with both of them. They\u2019ve both been inconsistent when it comes to this issue.O\u2019MALLEY: I\u2019m the one candidate on this stage that actually brought people together to pass comprehensive gun safety legislation. This is very personal to me being from Baltimore. I will never forget one occasion visiting a little boy in Johns\u2019 Hopkins Hospital, he was getting a birthday haircut, the age of three when drug dealers turned that barbershop into a shooting gallery and that boy\u2019s head was pierced with a bullet. And I remember visiting him, it did not kill him - I remember visiting him and his mother in Johns Hopkins Hospital. He was getting a birthday haircut, the age of three when drug dealers turned that barbershop into a shooting gallery, and that boys head was pierced with a bullet.And, I remember visiting him, it did not kill him. I remember visiting him and his mother in Johns Hopkins Hospital. In his diapers (ph) with tubes running in and out of his head, same age as my little boy.So, after the slaughter of the kids in Connecticut last year, we brought people together. We did pass in our state comprehensive gun safety legislation. It did have a ban on combat assault weapons, universal background checks, and you know what? We did not interrupt a single person\u2019s hunting season.I\u2019ve never met a self respecting deer hunter that needed an AR-15 to down a deer. And, so...(APPLAUSE)... we\u2019re able to actually do these things.HOLT: Alright, Governor, thank you.Secretary Clinton, this is a community that has suffered a lot of heartache in the last year. Of course, as you mentioned, the church shootings. We won\u2019t forget the video of Walter Scott being shot in the back while running from police.We understand that a jury will decide whether that police officer was justified, but it plays straight to the fears of many African American men that their lives are cheap. Is that perception, or in your view, is it reality?CLINTON: Well, sadly it\u2019s reality, and it has been heartbreaking, and incredibly outraging to see the constant stories of young men like Walter Scott, as you said, who have been killed by police officers. Their needs to be a concerted effort to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.And, that requires a very clear, agenda for retraining police officers, looking at ways to end racial profiling, finding more ways to really bring the disparities that stalk our country into high relief.One out of three African American men may well end up going to prison. That\u2019s the statistic. I want people hear to think what we would be doing if it was one out of three white men, and very often, the black men are arrested, convicted and incarcerated ...(APPLAUSE)...for offensive that do not lead to the same results for white men.So, we have a very serious problem that we can no longer ignore.HOLT: You time is up.Senator Sanders, my next question is...SANDERS: ...Well, I \u2014 look...HOLT: ... It\u2019s actually \u2014 actually my next question is to you...SANDERS: ... Let me respond to what the secretary said. We have a criminal justice system which is broken. Who in America is satisfied that we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth, including China? Disproportionately African American, and Latino. Who is satisfied that 51% of African American young people are either unemployed, or underemployed? Who is satisfied that millions of people have police records for possessing marijuana when the CEO\u2019s of Wall Street companies who destroyed our economy have no police records.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Senator Sanders...SANDERS: ... We need to take a very hard look at our...HOLT: Senator. Senator Sanders...SANDERS: ... criminal justice system, investing in jobs, and education not in jails and incarceration .HOLT: ... Just over a week ago the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus endorsed Secretary Clinton, not you. He said that choosing her over you was not a hard decision. In fact, our polling shows she\u2019s beating you more than two to one among minority voters. How can you be the nominee if you don\u2019t have that support?SANDERS: Well, let me talk about polling.(LAUGHTER) SANDERS: As Secretary Clinton well knows, when this campaign began she was 50 points ahead of me. We were all of three percentage points. Guess what?In Iowa, New Hampshire, the race is very, very close. Maybe we\u2019re ahead New Hampshire.(CHEERING)SANDERS: In terms of polling, guess what? We are running ahead of Secretary Clinton. In terms of taking on my taking on my good friend, Donald Trump, beating him by 19 points in New Hampshire, 13 points in the last national poll that we saw.To answer your question. When the African American community becomes familiar with my Congressional record and with our agenda, and with our views on the economy, and criminal justice \u2014 just as the general population has become more supportive, so will the African American community, so will the Latino community. We have the momentum, we\u2019re on a path to a victory.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)O\u2019MALLEY: Lester, I (inaudible)HOLT: Governor, I\u2019m going to come to you in a second.Google searches for the words, \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d surpassed, \u201ccivil rights movement\u201d. And, here in South Carolina, \u201cblack lives matter\u201d was the number one trending political issue.HOLT: Governor O\u2019Malley, you\u2019ve campaigned on your record as governor of Maryland, and before that, the mayor of Baltimore. Last year, of course, Baltimore was rocked by violent unrest in the wake of the death of Freddie Gray.And right from the start of your campaign, you\u2019ve been dogged by those who blame your tough-on-crime, so-called zero tolerance policies as mayor for contributing to that unrest. What responsibility do you bear?O\u2019MALLEY: Yes, let\u2019s talk about this. When I ran for mayor in 1999, Lester, it was not because our city was doing well. It was because we were burying over 300 young, poor black men every single year.And that\u2019s why I ran, because, yes, black lives matter. And we did a number of things. We weren\u2019t able to make our city immune from setbacks as the Freddie Gray unrest and tragic death showed.But we were able to save a lot of lives doing things that actually worked to improve police and community relations. The truth of the matter is, we created a civilian review board. And many of these things are in the new agenda for criminal justice reform that I\u2019ve put forward.We created a civilian review board, gave them their own detectives. We required the reporting of discourtesy, use of excessive force, lethal force. I repealed the possession of marijuana as a crime in our state.I drove our incarceration rate down to 20-year lows, and drove violent crime down to 30-year lows, and became the first governor south of the Mason-Dixon line to repeal the death penalty.I feel a responsibility every day to find things that work...(APPLAUSE)HOLT: All right. Let\u2019s talk...O\u2019MALLEY: ... and to do more of them to reform our criminal justice system.HOLT: Let\u2019s talk more about policing and the criminal justice system. Senator Sanders, a few times tonight we\u2019re going to hear from some of the most prominent voices on YouTube, starting with Franchesca Ramsey, who tackles racial stereotypes through her videos. Let\u2019s watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FRANCHESCA RAMSEY: Hey, I\u2019m Franchesca Ramsey. I believe there\u2019s a huge conflict of interest when local prosecutors investigate cases of police violence within their own communities.For example, last month, the officers involved in the case of 12- year-old Tamir Rice weren\u2019t indicted. How would your presidency ensure that incidents of police violence are investigated and prosecuted fairly?(END VIDEO CLIP)HOLT: Senator Sanders.SANDERS: I apologize for not hearing all of that question.HOLT: Would you like me to read it back to you?SANDERS: Yes.HOLT: Prosecutors \u2014 \u201cI believe there\u2019s a huge conflict of interest when local prosecutors investigate cases of police violence within their communities. Most recently, we saw this with a non- indictment of the officers involved in the case of 12-year-old Tamir Rice. How would you presidency ensure incidents of police violence are investigated and prosecuted fairly?\u201dSANDERS: Absolutely. This is a responsibility for the U.S. Justice Department to get involved. Whenever anybody in this country is killed while in police custody, it should automatically trigger a U.S. attorney general\u2019s investigation.(APPLAUSE)Second of all, and I speak as a mayor who worked very closely and well with police officers, the vast majority of whom are honest, hard- working people trying to do a difficult job, but let us be clear.If a police officer breaks the law, like any public official, that officer must be held accountable.(APPLAUSE)And thirdly, we have got to de-militarize our police departments so they don\u2019t look like occupying armies. We\u2019ve got to move toward community policing.And fourthly, we have got to make our police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Secretary Clinton, this question is for you. Tonight parts of America are in the grip of a deadly heroin epidemic, spanning race and class, hitting small towns and cities alike. It has become a major issue in this race.In a lot of places where you\u2019ve been campaigning, despite an estimated trillion dollars spent, many say the war on drugs has failed. So what would you do?CLINTON: Well, Lester, you\u2019re right. Everywhere I go to campaign, I\u2019m meeting families who are affected by the drug problem that mostly is opioids and heroin now, and lives are being lost and children are being orphaned. And I\u2019ve met a lot of grandparents who are now taking care of grandchildren.So I have tried to come out with a comprehensive approach that, number one, does tell the states that we will work with you from the federal government putting more money, about a billion dollars a year, to help states have a different approach to dealing with this epidemic.The policing needs to change. Police officers must be equipped with the antidote to a heroin overdose or an opioid overdose, known as Narcan. They should be able to administer it. So should firefighters and others.We have to move away from treating the use of drugs as a crime and instead, move it to where it belongs, as a health issue. And we need to divert more people from the criminal justice system into drug courts, into treatment, and recovery.HOLT: And that\u2019s time. CLINTON: So this is the kind of approach that we should take in dealing with what is now...HOLT: Senator...CLINTON: ... a growing epidemic.HOLT: Senator Sanders, would you like to respond?SANDERS: Sure. I agree...(APPLAUSE)I agree with everything the Secretary said, but let me just add this, there is a responsibility on the part of the pharmaceutical industry and the drug companies who are producing all of these drugs and not looking at the consequence of it.And second of all, when we talk about addiction being a disease, the Secretary is right, what that means is we need a revolution in this country in terms of mental health treatment. People should be able to get the treatment that they need when they need it, not two months from now, which is why I believe in universal...HOLT: That\u2019s...SANDERS: ... healthcare with mental health...HOLT: ... time.SANDERS: ... a part of that.HOLT: We\u2019re going to get into all that coming up.O\u2019MALLEY (?): Lester, just ten seconds.HOLT: But we\u2019re going to take a break and we need to take a break...O\u2019MALLEY (?): Just 10 seconds. All of the things...HOLT: ... and when we come back, the anger brewing in America.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HOLT: Welcome back to Charleston. Let\u2019s turn to another area where there has been fierce disagreement \u2014 that would be health care.Senator Sanders and Secretary Clinton, you both mentioned it in your 100-day priorities.Let\u2019s turn to my colleague, Andrea Mitchell now to lead that questioning.MITCHELL: Thank you, Lester.Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders favors what he calls \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d Now, you said that what he is proposing would tear up Obamacare and replace it.Secretary Clinton, is it fair to say to say that Bernie Sanders wants to kill Obamacare?CLINTON: Well, Andrea, I am absolutely committed to universal health care. I have worked on this for a long time, people may remember that I took on the health insurance industry back in the \u201990s, and I didn\u2019t quit until we got the children\u2019s health insurance program that ensures eight million kids.And I certainly respect Senator Sanders\u2019 intentions, but when you\u2019re talking about health care, the details really matter. And therefore, we have been raising questions about the nine bills that he introduced over 20 years, as to how they would work and what would be the impact on people\u2019s health care?He didn\u2019t like that, his campaign didn\u2019t like it either. And tonight, he\u2019s come out with a new health care plan. And again, we need to get into the details. But here\u2019s what I believe, the Democratic Party and the United States worked since Harry Truman to get the Affordable Care Act passed.We finally have a path to universal health care. We have accomplished so much already. I do not to want see the Republicans repeal it, and I don\u2019t to want see us start over again with a contentious debate. I want us to defend and build on the Affordable Care Act and improve it.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: OK.MITCHELL: Senator Sanders?SANDERS: Secretary \u2014 Secretary Clinton didn\u2019t answer your question.(LAUGHTER)Because what her campaign was saying \u2014 Bernie Sanders, who has fought for universal health care for my entire life, he wants to end Medicare, end Medicaid, end the children\u2019s health insurance program. That is nonsense.What a Medicare-for-all program does is finally provide in this country health care for every man, woman and child as a right. Now, the truth is, that Frank Delano Roosevelt, Harry Truman, do you know what they believed in? They believed that health care should be available to all of our people.I\u2019m on the committee that wrote the Affordable Care Act. I made the Affordable Care Act along with Jim Clyburn a better piece of legislation. I voted for it, but right now, what we have to deal with is the fact that 29 million people still have no health insurance. We are paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, getting ripped off.And here\u2019s the important point, we are spending far more per person on health care than the people of any other country. My proposal, provide health care to all people, get private insurance out of health insurance, lower the cost of health care for middle class families by 5,000 bucks.That\u2019s the vision we need to take.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: But \u2014 Senator Sanders, if I can...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: You know, I have to say I\u2019m not sure whether we\u2019re talking about the plan you just introduced tonight, or we\u2019re talking about the plan you introduced nine times in the Congress. But the fact is, we have the Affordable Care Act. That is one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our country.(APPLAUSE)And we have already seen 19 million Americans get insurance. We have seen the end of pre-existing conditions keeping people from getting insurance.(APPLAUSE)We have seen women no longer paying more for our insurance than men. And we have seen young people, up to the age of 26, being able to stay on their parent\u2019s policy.SANDERS: But \u2014 what if we have...CLINTON: Now, there are things we can do to improve it, but to tear it up and start over again, pushing our country back into that kind of a contentious debate, I think is the wrong direction.SANDERS: It is \u2014 it is absolutely inaccurate.O\u2019MALLEY: I have to talk about something that\u2019s actually working in our state.MITCHELL: Governor \u2014 Governor Sanders...SANDERS: No one is tearing this up, we\u2019re going to go forward. But with the secretary neglected to mention, not just the 29 million still have no health insurance, that even more are underinsured with huge copayments and deductibles.Tell me why we are spending almost three times more than the British, who guarantee health care to all of their people? Fifty percent more than the French, more than the Canadians. The vision from FDR and Harry Truman was health care for all people as a right in a cost-effective way.We\u2019re not going to tear up the Affordable Care Act. I helped write it. But we are going to move on top of that to a Medicaid-for- all system.O\u2019MALLEY: Andrea \u2014 Andrea \u2014 Andrea.(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)O\u2019MALLEY: Instead of \u2014 Andrea, I think, instead of attacking one another on health care, we should be talking about the things that are actually working.In our state, we have moved to an all-payer system. With the Affordable Care Act, we now have moved all of our acute care hospitals, that driver of cost at the center, away from fee-for- service.And actually to pay, we pay them based on how well they keep patients out of the hospital. How well they keep their patients. That\u2019s the future. We need to build on the Affordable Care Act, do the things that work, and reduce costs and increase access.(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: And that\u2019s exactly what we are able to do based on the foundation of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 what Governor O\u2019Malley just said is one of the models that we will be looking at to make sure we do get costs down, we do limit a lot of the unnecessary costs that we still have in the system.But, with all due respect, to start over again with a whole new debate is something that I think would set us back. The Republicans just voted last week to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and thank goodness, President Obama vetoed it and saved Obamacare for the American people.(APPLAUSE)MITCHELL: Senator Sanders, let me ask you this, though...SANDERS: Yeah.MITCHELL: ... you\u2019ve talked about Medicare for all...SANDERS: Yes.MITCHELL: .. and tonight you\u2019ve released a very detailed plan, just two... SANDERS: Not all that detailed.MITCHELL: ... well, two hours before the debate, you did.SANDERS: Well.MITCHELL: But let me ask you about Vermont. Because in Vermont \u2014 you tried in the state of Vermont, and Vermont walked away from this kind of idea, of \u2014 of Medicare for all, single-payer, because they concluded it would require major tax increases...SANDERS: Well, that\u2019s \u2014 you might want to ask...MITCHELL: ... and by some estimates, it would double the budget. If you couldn\u2019t sell it in Vermont, Senator...SANDERS: Andrea, let me just say this.MITCHELL: ... how can you sell it to the country?SANDERS: Let me just say that you might want to ask the governor of the state of Vermont why he could not do it. I\u2019m not the governor. I\u2019m the senator from the state of Vermont.(LAUGHTER)But second of all \u2014 second of all...(APPLAUSE)... here is what the real point is, in terms of all of the issues you\u2019ve raised \u2014 the good questions you\u2019ve raised. You know what it all comes down to?Do you know why we can\u2019t do what every other country \u2014 major country on Earth is doing? It\u2019s because we have a campaign finance system that is corrupt, we have super PACs, we have the pharmaceutical industry pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into campaign contributions and lobbying, and the private insurance companies as well.What this is really about is not the rational way to go forward \u2014 it\u2019s Medicare for all \u2014 it is whether we have the guts to stand up to the private insurance companies and all of their money, and the pharmaceutical industry. That\u2019s what this debate should be about.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Well, as someone who \u2014 as someone who has a little bit of experience standing up to the health insurance industry, that spent, you know...(APPLAUSE)... many, many millions of dollars attacking me, and probably will so again, because of what I believe we can do building on the Affordable Care Act, I think it\u2019s important to point out that there are a lot of reasons we have the health care system we have today.I know how much money influences the political decision-making. That\u2019s why I\u2019m for huge campaign finance reform. However, we started a system that had private health insurance.And even during the Affordable Care Act debate, there was an opportunity to vote for what was called the public option. In other words, people could buy in to Medicare, and even when the Democrats were in charge of the Congress, we couldn\u2019t get the votes for that.So, what I\u2019m saying is really simple. This has been the fight of the Democratic Party for decades. We have the Affordable Care Act. Let\u2019s make it work.Let\u2019s take the models that states are doing. We now have driven costs down to the lowest they\u2019ve been in 50 years. Now we\u2019ve got to get individual costs down. That\u2019s what I\u2019m planning to do.HOLT: And that\u2019s time (ph). We\u2019re gonna take a turn now.Secretary Clinton, in his final State of the Union address, President Obama said his biggest regret was his inability to bring the country together. If President Obama couldn\u2019t do it, how will you?O\u2019MALLEY: Great question.CLINTON: Well, I think it\u2019s an important point the president made in his State of the Union. And here\u2019s what I would say. I will go anywhere, to meet with anyone, at any time to find common ground.That\u2019s what I did as a first lady, when I worked with both Democrats and Republicans to get the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, when I worked with Tom DeLay, one of the most partisan of Republicans, to reform the adoption and foster care system.What I did, working in the Senate, where I crossed the aisle often, working even with the senator from South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, to get Tricare for national guardsmen and women.And it\u2019s what I did as Secretary of State, on numerous occasions, and most particularly, rounding up two-thirds votes in order to pass a treaty that lowered the nuclear weapons in both Russia and the United States. CLINTON: So I know it\u2019s hard, but I also know you\u2019ve got to work at it every single day. I look out here, I see a lot of my friends from the Congress. And I know that they work at it every single day.Because maybe you can\u2019t only find a little sliver of common ground to cooperate with somebody from the other party, but who knows. If you\u2019re successful there, maybe you can build even more. That\u2019s what I would do.HOLT: That\u2019s time. Senator Sanders, response.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: A couple of years ago, when we understood that veterans were not getting the quality care they needed in the timely manner, I worked with folks like John McCain and others to pass the most comprehensive veteran\u2019s health care legislation in modern history.But let me rephrase your question because I think, in all do respect, you\u2019re expression. In all do respect, you\u2019re missing the main point. And the main point in the Congress, it\u2019s not the Republicans and Democrats hate each other.That\u2019s a mythology from the media. The real issue is that Congress is owned by big money and refuses to do what the American people want them to do.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: The real issue is that in area after area, raising the minimum wage to $15 bucks an hour. The American people want it. Rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, creating 13 million jobs, the American people want it. The pay equity for women, the American people want it. Demanding that the wealthy start paying their fair share of taxes. The American people want it.HOLT: That\u2019s time. But let me continue with the...SANDERS: The point is, we have to make Congress respond to the needs of the people, not big money.HOLT: Senator Sanders, let me continue, you call yourself a Democratic socialist...SANDERS: I do. HOLT: And throughout your career in politics, you\u2019ve been critical of the Democratic party, you\u2019ve been saying in a book you wrote, quote, \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a hell of a big difference between the the two major parties.\u201d How would you will a general election...SANDERS: Did I say that?HOLT: How will you win a general election labeling yourself a democratic socialist?SANDERS: Because of what I believe in what I was just saying. The Democratic party needs major reform. To those of you in South Carolina, you know what, in Mississippi, we need a 50-state strategy so that people in South Carolina and Mississippi can get the resources that they need.Instead of being dependent on super PACs, what we need is to be dependent on small, individual campaign contributors. We need an agenda that speaks to the needs of working families and low-income people. Not wealthy campaign contributors.HOLT: Yes, but senator, you can...SANDERS: We need to expand what the input into the Democratic party. I am very proud that in this campaign, we have seen an enormous amount of excitement from young people, from working people. We have received more individual contributions than any candidate in the history of this country up to this point.(APPLAUSE)O\u2019MALLEY: Yes, but senator you never came to campaign for Vincent Sheheen when he was running for governor. In fact, neither of you came to campaign for Vincent Sheheen when he was running for governor.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: We can talk all we want about wanting to build a stronger Democratic party, but Lester, the question you answered, it\u2019s no laughing matter.The most recurring question I get when I stand on the chair all across Iowa and talk with my neighbors is, how are you going to heal the divisions and the wounds in our country? This is the biggest challenge we face as a people.All my life, I brought people together over deep divides and very old wounds, and that\u2019s what we need now in a new leader. We cannot keep talking past each other, declaring all Republicans are our enemies or the war is all about being against millionaires or billionaires, or it\u2019s all against American Muslims, all against immigrants.Look, as Frederick Douglas said, we are one, our cause is one, and we must help each other if we are going to succeed. HOLT: And that is right.SANDERS: And I respectfully disagree.HOLT: Secretary Clinton, our next question is for you. Here\u2019s another quantitative problem.The New York Times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign.SANDERS: And I respectfully disagree with my friend over here. And that is, you are right. All of us have denounced Trump\u2019s attempts to divide this country: the anti-Latino rhetoric, the racist rhetoric, he anti-Muslim rhetoric.But where I disagree with you, Governor O\u2019Malley, is I do believe we have to deal with the fundamental issues of a handful of billionaires...O\u2019MALLEY: I agree with that.SANDERS: ... who control economic and political life of this country.O\u2019MALLEY: I agree.SANDERS: Nothing real will get happened. Unless we have a political revolution. Where millions of people finally stand up.HOLT: And we\u2019re going to get into that coming up. But Secretary Clinton, here\u2019s a question from YouTube. It\u2019s from a young video blogger who has over 5 million subscribers. He has a question about the importance of younger voters.FRANTA: Hi, I\u2019m Connor Franta, I\u2019m 23 and my audience is around the same age. Getting my generation to vote should be a priority for any presidential candidate.Now I know Senator Sanders is pretty popular among my peers, but what I want to know is, how are all of you planning on engaging us further in this election?HOLT: Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Well thanks for the question and congratulations on five million viewers on YouTube, that\u2019s quite an accomplishment. Look, this election is mostly about the future and therefore it is of greatest urgency for young people.I\u2019ve laid out my ideas about what we can do to make college affordable; how we can help people pay off their student debts and save thousands of dollars, how we can create more good jobs because a lot of the young people that I talk with are pretty disappointed the economic prospects they feel their facing. So making community college free, making it possible to attend a public college or university with debt free tuition, looking for ways to protect our rights especially from the concerted Republican assault; on voting rights, on women\u2019s rights, on gay rights, on civil rights, on workers rights.And I know how much young people value their independence, their autonomy, and their rights. So I think this is an election where we have to pull young people and older people together to have a strategy about how we\u2019re going to encourage even more American\u2019s to vote because it absolutely clear to me...HOLT: That\u2019s time...CLINTON: That turning over our White House to the Republicans would be bad for everybody especially young people.HOLT: A quick follow up \u2014 a thirty second follow up.Why is Senator Sanders beating you to 2 to 1 among younger votes?CLINTON: Look, I have the greatest respect for Senator Sanders and for his supports and I\u2019m going to keep working as hard as I can to reach as many people of all ages about what I will do, what the experience and the ideas that I have that I will bring to the White House and I hope to have their support when I\u2019m the Democratic nominee.HOLT: We\u2019re going to take...SANDERS: Is that your strategy...HOLT: We\u2019re going to take a break. When we come back; big banks, big business and big differences among the three candidates on the American Economy. We\u2019ll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HOLT: Welcome back from Charleston. Let\u2019s turn now to the economy.Senator Sanders, you released a tough new ad last week in which without mentioning Secretary Clinton by name, you talk about two Democratic visions for regulating Wall Street. \u201cOne says it\u2019s OK to take millions from big banks and tell them what to do. My plan, break up the big banks, close the tax loopholes and make them pay their fair share.\u201dWhat do you see as the difference between what you would do about the banks and what Secretary Clinton would do?SANDERS: Well, the first difference is I don\u2019t take money from big banks. I don\u2019t get personal speaking fees from Goldman Sachs. What I would do...(APPLAUSE)What I would do is understand that when you have three out of the four largest banks today, bigger than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have the six largest financial institutions having assets of 60 percent of the GDP of America, it is very clear to me what you have to do.You\u2019ve got to bring back the 21st century Glass-Steagall legislation and you\u2019ve got to break up these huge financial institutions. They have too much economic power and they have too much financial power over our entire economy. If Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, the old Republican trust buster, what he would say is these guys are too powerful. Break them up. I believe that\u2019s what the American people to want see. That\u2019s my view.HOLT: Secretary Clinton, help the voter understand the daylight between the two of you here.CLINTON: Well, there\u2019s no daylight on the basic premise that there should be no bank too big to fail and no individual too powerful to jail. We agree on that. But where we disagree is the comments that Senator Sanders has made that don\u2019t just affect me, I can take that, but he\u2019s criticized President Obama for taking donations from Wall Street, and President Obama has led our country out of the great recession. Senator Sanders called him weak, disappointing. He even, in 2011, publicly sought someone to run in a primary against President Obama. Now, I personally believe that President Obama\u2019s work to push through the Dodd-Frank...(LAUGHTER)The Dodd-Frank bill and then to sign it was one of the most important regulatory schemes we\u2019ve had since the 1930s. So I\u2019m going to defend Dodd-Frank and I\u2019m going to defend President Obama for taking on Wall Street, taking on the financial industry and getting results.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: OK. First of all...HOLT: Senator Sanders, your response.SANDERS: Set the record right. In 2006 when I ran for the Senate, Senator Barack Obama was kind enough to campaign for me, 2008, I did my best to see that he was elected and in 2012, I worked as hard as I could to see that he was reelected. He and I are friends. We\u2019ve worked together on many issues. We have some differences of opinion.But here is the issue, Secretary touched on it, can you really reform Wall Street when they are spending millions and millions of dollars on campaign contributions and when they are providing speaker fees to individuals? So it\u2019s easy to say, well, I\u2019m going to do this and do that, but I have doubts when people receive huge amounts of money from Wall Street. SANDERS: I am very proud, I do not have a super PAC. I do not want Wall Street\u2019s money. I\u2019ll rely on the middle class and working families...HOLT: That\u2019s time.Governor O\u2019Malley...(CROSSTALK)SANDERS: ... campaign contributions.HOLT: I have a question for you...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: You know, I think since \u2014 since Senator Standers followed up on this...HOLT: Thirty-second response.CLINTON: Your profusion of comments about your feelings towards President Obama are a little strange given what you said about him in 2011.But look, I have a plan that most commentators have said is tougher, more effective, and more comprehensive.O\u2019MALLEY: That\u2019s not true.CLINTON: It builds on the Dodd-Frank \u2014 yes, it is. It builds on the Dodd-Frank, regulatory scheme...O\u2019MALLEY: It\u2019s just not true.CLINTON: ... but it goes much further, because...O\u2019MALLEY: Oh, come on.CLINTON: ... both the governor and the senator have focused only on the big banks. Lehman Brothers, AIG, the shadow banking sector were as big a problem in what caused the Great Recession, I go after them.And I can tell you that the hedge fund billionaires who are running ads against me right now, and Karl Rove, who started running an ad against me right now, funded by money from the financial services sector, sure thing, I\u2019m the one they don\u2019t want to be up against.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Governor O\u2019Malley.O\u2019MALLEY: Yes, thank you. Yes, Lester, what Secretary Clinton just said is actually not true. What \u2014 I have put forward a plan that would actually put cops back on the beat of Wall Street. I have put forward a plan that was heralded as very comprehensive and realistic.Look, if a bank robber robs a bank and all you do is slap him on the wrist, he\u2019s just going to keep robbing banks again. The same thing is true with people in suits.Secretary Clinton, I have a tremendous amount of respect for you, but for you to say there\u2019s no daylight on this between the three of us is also not true. I support reinstituting a modern version of Glass- Steagall that would include going after the shadow banks, requiring capital requirements that would force them to no longer put us on the hook for these sorts of things.In prior debates I\u2019ve heard you even bring up \u2014 I mean, now you bring up President Obama here in South Carolina in defense of the fact of your cozy relationship with Wall Street.In an earlier debate, I heard you bring up even the 9/11 victims to defend it. The truth of the matter is, Secretary Clinton, you do not go as far as reining in Wall Street as I would.And the fact of the matter is, the people of America deserve to have a president that\u2019s on their side, protecting the main street economy from excesses on Wall Street. And we\u2019re just as vulnerable today.HOLT: Secretary Clinton, 30-second response.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Yes, well, first of all \u2014 first of all, Paul Krugman, Barney Frank, others have all endorsed my plan. Secondly, we have Dodd-Frank. It gives us the authority already to break up big banks that pose...O\u2019MALLEY: And we have never used it.CLINTON: That pose a risk to the financial sector. I want to go further and add to that.And, you know, Governor, you have raised money on Wall Street. You raised a lot of money on Wall Street when you were the head of the Democratic Governor\u2019s Association...O\u2019MALLEY: Yes, but I haven\u2019t gotten a penny this year... CLINTON: And you were...O\u2019MALLEY: ... so somebody please, go on to martinomalley.com...(LAUGHTER)O\u2019MALLEY: Go on to martinomalley.com, send me your checks. They\u2019re not giving me \u2014 zero.CLINTON: Yes, well, the point is that if we\u2019re going to be serious about this and not just try to score political points, we should know what\u2019s in Dodd-Frank, and what\u2019s in Dodd-Frank already gives the president the authority...(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: ... with his regulators to make those decisions.SANDERS: Let me give you an example of how corrupt \u2014 how corrupt this system is. Goldman Sachs recently fined $5 billion. Goldman Sachs has given this country two secretaries of treasury, one on the Republicans, one under Democrats.O\u2019MALLEY: Say it.SANDERS: The leader of Goldman Sachs is a billionaire who comes to Congress and tells us we should cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.Secretary Clinton \u2014 and you\u2019re not the only one, so I don\u2019t mean to just point the finger at you, you\u2019ve received over $600,000 in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs in one year.I find it very strange that a major financial institution that pays $5 billion in fines for breaking the law, not one of their executives is prosecuted, while kids who smoke marijuana get a jail sentence.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: That\u2019s time.Andrea.CLINTON: Well, the last point on this is, Senator Sanders, you\u2019re the only one on this stage that voted to deregulate the financial market in 2000, to take the cops off the street, to use Governor O\u2019Malley\u2019s phrase, to make the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission no longer able to regulate swaps and derivatives, which were one of the main cause of the collapse in \u201908.So there\u2019s plenty...SANDERS: If you want to...CLINTON: There\u2019s plenty of problems that we all have to face together.And the final thing I would say, we\u2019re at least having a vigorous debate about reining in Wall Street...HOLT: ... Senator...CLINTON: ... The Republicans want to give them more power, and repeal Dodd-Frank. That\u2019s what we need to stop...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Anyone who wants to check my record in taking on Wall Street, in fighting against the deregulation of Wall Street when Wall Street put billions of dollars in lobbying, in campaign contributions to get the government off their backs. They got the government off their backs.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.Turns out that they were crooks, and they destroyed our economy. I think it\u2019s time to put the government back on their backs.(APPLAUSE)MITCHELL: Senator Sanders \u2014 Senator Sanders, you\u2019ve talked a lot about things you want to do. You want free education for everyone, you want the Federal Minimum Wage raised to $15 an hour. You want to expand Social Security...SANDERS: ... Yeah...MITCHELL: ... benefits. You\u2019ve been specific about what you want, but let\u2019s talk about how to pay for all this. You now said that you would raise taxes today, two hours or so ago, you said you would raise taxes to pay for your health care plan. You haven\u2019t been specific about how to pay for the other things...SANDERS: ... That\u2019s true.MITCHELL: ... Will you tell us tonight?SANDERS: Good. You\u2019re right. I want to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, create 13 million jobs. We do that by doing away with the absurd loophole that now allows major profitable corporations to stash their money in the Cayman (ph) Islands, and not in some years, pay a nickel in taxes. Yes, I do. I plead guilty. I want every kid in this country who has the ability to be able to go to a public college, or university, tuition free. And, by the way, I want to substantially lower student debt interest rates in this country as well.How do I pay for it?(APPLAUSE)I pay for it through a tax on Wall Street speculation. This country, and the middle class, bailed out Wall Street. Now, it is Wall Street\u2019s time to help the middle class. In fact...O\u2019MALLEY: (inaudible)SANDERS: ... we have documented, unlike Secretary Clinton, I have documented exactly how I would pay for our ambitious agenda.O\u2019MALLEY: Andrea...MITCHELL: ... OK...O\u2019MALLEY: ... The only person on this stage who has...MITCHELL: ... Secretary Clinton, you mentioned earlier \u2014 Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?CLINTON: Well, I have actually documented every way that I\u2019m going to pay for what I\u2019m doing because I think the American public deserves to know. And, you can go to my website and actually see that.But, there are serious questions about how we\u2019re going to pay for what we want to see our country do. And, I\u2019m the only candidate standing here tonight who has said I will not raise taxes on the middle class. I want to raise incomes, not taxes, and I\u2019m going to do everything I can to make sure that the wealthy pay for debt free tuition, for child care, for paid family leave. To help us bring down student debt we\u2019re going to refinance that student debt, saving kids thousands of dollars.Yeah, and that will also come out of the \u2014 some of the pockets of people in the financial services industry...MITCHELL: OK, we\u2019re out of time. Senator Sanders,CLINTON: But I will tell you exactly how I pay for everything I\u2019ve proposed...(CROSSTALK)MITCHELL: Senator Sanders...SANDERS: ... Here is the main two points...MITCHELL: ... Senator Sanders, let me ask you a question about taxes. SANDERS: Yeah.MITCHELL: The most googled political issue...SANDERS: ... I got it.MITCHELL: In the last month was taxes. Now, in your healthcare plan, the plan you released tonight, you would not only raise taxes on the wealthy, but the details you released indicate you would raise taxes on the middle class also. Is that correct?SANDERS: What is correct, and I\u2019m disappointed that Secretary Clinton\u2019s campaign has made this criticism. It\u2019s a Republican criticism. Secretary Clinton does know a lot about healthcare, and she understands, I believe, that a medicare for all, single payer program will substantially lower the cost of healthcare for middle class families. So, what we have got to acknowledge, and I hope the Secretary does, is we are doing away with private health insurance premiums.So, instead of paying $10,000 dollars to Blue Cross, or Blue Shield, yes, some middle class families would be paying slightly more in taxes, but the result would be that that middle class family would be saving some $5,000 dollars in healthcare costs. A little bit more in taxes, do away with private health insurance premiums. It\u2019s a pretty good deal.(APPLAUSE)MITCHELL: Senator \u2014 Senator, let me just follow up on that.SANDERS: Yeah.MITCHELL: On Meet the Press on December 20th, you said that you would only raise taxes on the middle class to pay for family leave. And, having said that, now you say you\u2019re going to raise middle class taxes to pay for healthcare as well. Is that breaking your word?SANDERS: No, it is not breaking my word. When you are \u2014 it\u2019s one thing to say I\u2019m raising taxes, it\u2019s another thing to say that we are doing away with private health insurance premiums.SANDERS: So, if I save you $10,000 in private health insurance, and you pay a little bit more in taxes in total, there are huge savings in what your family is spending.O\u2019MALLEY: Senator, I\u2019m the only person on this stage that\u2019s actually balanced a budget every year for 15 years.SANDERS: I was mayor for eight years, I did that as well.(LAUGHTER)O\u2019MALLEY: OK. So, that was eight years. Yes. And Senator, but I actually did it during a budget down time \u2014 I mean, during a recession.And Andrea, the \u2014 I had to make more cuts than any governor in the history of Maryland, but we invested more in infrastructure, more in transportation. We made our public schools more in America more than five years in a row, and went four years in a row without a penny\u2019s increase to college tuition.The things that we need to do in our country, like debt-free college in the next five years, like making universal \u2014 like making national service a universal option in order to cut youth unemployment in half in the next three years, all these things can be done if we eliminate one entitlement we can no longer afford as a nation.And that is the wealthy among us, those making more than a million dollars, feel that they are entitled to paying a much lower marginal tax rate than was usual for the better part of these 80 years.And if we tax earnings from investments on money \u2014 namely capital gains \u2014 at the same rate as we tax sweat and hard work and toil, we can make the investments we need to make to make our country better.HOLT: We have got a lot to ground to cover here.Many Democratic voters are passionate about the need to do something to combat the threat of climate change, including the team of scientists from Youtube\u2019s MinuteEarth channel.Here\u2019s their take.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANNOUNCER: Hello from MinuteEarth. Fossil fuels have long kept our cars moving and our light bulbs lit.But we know that burning these fuels releases heat-trapping gases that are warming the planet, causing seas to rise and contributing to extreme weather events, like South Carolina\u2019s devastating flooding last year.Fighting human-caused climate change means giving up our global addiction to fossil fuels and shifting the bulk of the world\u2019s energy supply to alternative sources.Some countries have acted decisively to make this transition. But here at home, we still get a whooping 82 percent of our energy from coal, oil, and natural gas.In the U.S., political gridlock, pressure from industry lobbyists and insufficient R&D have made an already tough battle against climate change even tougher.(END VIDEO CLIP)HOLT: Senator Sanders, Americans love their SUVs, which spiked in sales last year as gas prices plummeted.How do you convince Americans that the problem of climate change is so urgent that they need to change their behavior?SANDERS: I think we already are. Younger generation understands it instinctively.I was home in Burlington, Vermont, on Christmas Eve, the temperature was 65 degrees. People in Vermont know what\u2019s going on. People who did ice fishing, where their ice is no longer there on the lake understand what\u2019s going on.I\u2019m on both the Environmental and Energy Committees. The debate is over. Climate change is real. It is already causing major problems. And if we do not act boldly and decisively, a bad situation will become worse.It is amazing to me, and I think we\u2019ll have agreement on this up here, that we have a major party, called the Republican Party that is so owned by the fossil fuel industry and their campaign contributions that they don\u2019t even have the courage, the decency to listen to the scientists.(APPLAUSE)It is beyond my comprehension how we can elect a president of the United States, somebody like Trump, who believes that climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese.(LAUGHTER)Bottom line is, we need to be bold and decisive, we can create millions of jobs. We must, for the sake of our kids and grandchildren, transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.I\u2019ve got the most comprehensive legislation in the Senate to do that. And as president, I will fight to make that happen.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Governor O\u2019Malley, 30 seconds.O\u2019MALLEY: Thank you.Lester, on this stage tonight, this Democratic stage, where we actually believe in science.(LAUGHTER)I would like to challenge and invite my colleagues here on this stage to join me in putting forward a plan to move us to a 100 percent clean, electric energy grid by 2050. It can be done.(APPLAUSE)With solar, with wind, with new technologies, with green buildings, this can happen, but in all \u2014 President Obama made us more energy independent, but in all of the above strategy didn\u2019t land us on the moon, we need American ingenuity and we need to reach by 2050 for the sake of our kids.HOLT: That\u2019s time. We\u2019re going to take a break.CLINTON: And let me...HOLT: When we return, the late-breaking developments regarding Iran. The threat of ISIS now more real than ever on U.S. soil. Americans in fear and hearing few good answers.We\u2019ll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)TODD: And we are back. I\u2019m Chuck Todd. We are just past the halfway mark in our NBC News YouTube Democratic Candidates Debate. Boy, this is one that has actually lived up to the billing.We\u2019ve seen some sharp exchanges on guns, health care and Wall Street \u2014 the debate, you could argue, that has been largely focused on all things Bernie Sanders.He was on the defensive early, Hillary Clinton getting, I think, some control on the gun issue. But on health care and on Wall Street reform, it was Hillary Clinton on the defensive, and was a very aggressive Bernie Sanders.One thing of note here: Bernie Sanders very much being the sort of revolutionary candidate, major change, and you\u2019ve heard a lot of Hillary Clinton saying things like she wants to build on the things that President Obama did, wrapping herself in President Obama.Let\u2019s go back downstairs and check in with our moderators, Lester and Andrea. So what\u2019s coming up next, guys?HOLT: Well, we\u2019ve covered a lot of ground already, but we\u2019re gonna be talking about ISIS. A threat to America, it\u2019s \u2014 always polls as one of the top concerns of Americans. And also some more late-breaking news.MITCHELL: We have all the news that has happened from Iran and the president\u2019s comments today, as well as what this means going forward for the War on Terror. What do we expect from Iran, and also what\u2019s happening in Syria? So a lot of foreign policy coming up.HOLT: A lot of debate to come. We\u2019ll be back in Charleston after this.TODD: You\u2019ve got it. Well, it\u2019s the commander-in-chief test \u2014 that\u2019s what\u2019s next. Stay with us \u2014 the debate resumes right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HOLT: Charleston, Andrea Mitchell has questions now starting with Iran.MITCHELL: Thank you Lester.Senator Sanders, the nuclear deal is now enforced. Iran is getting it\u2019s billions of dollars, several Americans who have been held are now going to be heading home. The president said today, \u201cit\u2019s a good day. It\u2019s a good day for diplomacy. It\u2019s a time now to restore diplomatic relations for the first time since 1979 and actually re- opened a U.S. Embassy in Tehran.\u201dSANDERS: I think what we\u2019ve got to do is move as aggressively as we can to normalize relations with Iran. Understanding that Iran\u2019s behavior in so many ways is something that we disagree with; their support terrorism, the anti-American rhetoric that we\u2019re hearing from of their leadership is something that is not acceptable.History suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.On the other hand, the fact that we\u2019ve managed to reach an agreement, something that I\u2019ve very strongly supported that prevents Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and we did that without going to war. And that I believe we\u2019re seeing a fall in our relationships with Iran is a very positive step. So if your question is, do I want to see that relationship become more positive in the future? Yes.Can I tell that we should open an embassy in Tehran tomorrow? No, I don\u2019t think we should. But I think the goal has go to be as we\u2019ve done with Cuba, to move in warm relations with a very powerful and important country in this world.MITCHELL: Your response Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, I\u2019m very proud of the Iran Nuclear Agreement. I was very pleased to be part of what the president put into action when he took office. I was responsible for getting those sanctions imposed which put the pressure on Iran. It brought them to the negotiating table which resulted in this agreement.And so, they have been so far, following their requirements under the agreement. But I think we still have to carefully watch them. We\u2019ve had one good day over 36 year and I think we need more good days before we move more rapidly toward any kind of normalization. And we have to be sure that they are truly going to implement the agreement. And then, we have to go after them on a lot of their other bad behavior in the region which is causing enormous problems in Syria, Yemen, Iraq and elsewhere.MITCHELL: You mentioned Syria. Let me ask you about Syria, all of you. Let\u2019s turn to Syria and the civil war that has been raging there. Are there any circumstances in which you could see deploying significant numbers of ground forces in Syria, not just specials forces but significant ground forces to combat ISIS in a direct combat role?Let me start with you Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Absolutely not.I have a three point plan that does not include American Ground forces. It includes the United States leading an air coalition which is what we\u2019re doing, supporting fighters on the ground; the Iraqi Army which is beginning to show more ability, the Sunni fighters that we are now helping to reconstitute and Kurdish on both sides of the border.I think we also have try to disrupt their supply chain of foreign fighters and foreign money and we do have to contest them in online space. So I\u2019m very committed to both going after ISIS but also supporting what Secretary Kerry is doing to try to move on a political diplomatic to try to begin to slow down and hopefully end the carnage in Syria which is the root of so many of the problems that we seen in the region and beyond.MITCHELL: Senator Sanders, ground forces yes or no? SANDERS: As everybody you know, this is incredibly complicated and difficult issue and I applaud. I know President Obama\u2019s been getting a lot of criticism on this. I think he is doing the right thing.What the nightmare is, which many of my Republican colleagues appear to want is to not have learned the lesson of Iraq. To get American young men and women involved in perpetual warfare in the quagmire of Syria and the Middle East would be an unmitigated disaster that as president, I will do everything in my power to avoid.O\u2019MALLEY: Andrea...MITCHELL: Governor O\u2019Malley?SANDERS: We should \u2014 we should learn \u2014 we should learn from King Abdullah of Jordan, one of the few heroes in a very unheroic place. And what Abdullah said is this is a war with a soul of Islam and that Muslim troops should be on the ground with our support and the support of other major countries. That is how we destroy ISIS, not with American troops in perpetual warfare.MITCHELL: Governor O\u2019Malley.O\u2019MALLEY: Thank you.(APPLAUSE)Andrea, governors have led us to victory in two world wars by doing what America does best, and that is by joining forces with others by acting in coalition. And I believe that President Obama is doing the right thing in this case.We need to learn the lessons from the past. We do need to provide the special \u2014 special ops advisers, we need \u2014 do need to provide the technical support, but over the long-term, we need to develop new alliances. We need a much more proactive national security strategy that reduces these threats before they rise to a level where it feels like we need to pull for a division of marines.And I also want to add one other thing here. I appreciate the fact that in our debate, we don\u2019t use the term you hear Republicans throwing around trying to look all vibrato (ph) and macho sending other kids \u2014 kids into combat, they keep using the term boots on the ground. A woman in Burlington, Iowa said to me, \u201cGovernor, when you\u2019re with your colleagues, please don\u2019t refer to my son who has served two tours of duty in Iraq as a pair of boots on the ground.\u201d Now, we need to be mindful of learning the lessons of the past.(APPLAUSE)MITCHELL: I have a question. I have a question for Senator Sanders. Did the policies of the Obama administration, in which Secretary Clinton of course was a part, create a vacuum in Iraq and Syria that helped ISIS grow?SANDERS: No. I think the vacuum was created by the disastrous war in Iraq, which I vigorously opposed. Not only did I vote against it, I helped lead the opposition. And what happened there is yes, it\u2019s easy to get rid of a two-bit dictator like Saddam Hussein, but there wasn\u2019t the kind of thought as to what happens the day after you get him and what kind of political vacuum occurs. And who rises up? Groups like ISIS.So I think that President Obama made a promise to the American people when he ran, and he said you know what, I\u2019m going to do my best to bring American troops home. And I supported what he did. Our job is to train and provide military support for Muslim countries in the area who are prepared to take on ISIS.And one point I want to make here that is not made very often, you have incredibly wealthy countries in that region, countries like Saudi Arabia, countries like Qatar. Qatar happens to be the largest \u2014 wealthiest country per capita in the world. They have got to start putting in some skin in the game and not just ask the United States to do it.(APPLAUSE)MITCHELL: Secretary Clinton, I want to talk to you about red lines, because former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said in a recent interview that President Obama\u2019s decision to stand down on planned missile strikes against Damascus after Assad had used chemical weapons hurt the president\u2019s credibility. Should the president have stuck to his red line once he drew it?CLINTON: Look, I think that the president\u2019s decision to go after the chemical weapons once there was a potential opportunity to build on when the Russians opened that door resulted in a very positive outcome. We were able to get the chemical weapons out.I know from my own experience as secretary of State that we were deeply worried about Assad\u2019s forces using chemical weapons because it would have had not only a horrific affect on people in Syria, but it could very well have affected the surrounding states, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, Turkey. So getting those chemical weapons out was a big deal, but...MITCHELL: But should he \u2014 should he have stuck to his...CLINTON: Well \u2014 but \u2014 but...MITCHELL: ... line? Did it hurt U.S. credibility? CLINTON: I think, as commander in chief, you\u2019ve got to constantly be evaluating the decisions you have to make. I know a little bit about this, having spent many hours in the situation room, advising President Obama.And I want to just add to something that Senator Sanders said, the United States had a very big interest in trying to help stabilize the region. If there is any blame to be spread around, it starts with the prime minister of Iraq, who sectarianized his military, setting Shia against Sunni.It is amplified by Assad, who has waged one of the bloodiest, most terrible attacks on his own people: 250,000-plus dead, millions fleeing. Causing this vacuum that has been filled unfortunately, by terrorist groups, including ISIS.So, I think we are in the midst of great turmoil in this region. We have a proxy conflict going on between Saudi Arabia and Iran. You know, one of the criticisms I\u2019ve had of Senator Sanders is his suggestion that, you know, Iranian troops be used to try to end the war in Syria...MITCHELL: Your time is up.CLINTON: ... and go after ISIS, which I don\u2019t think would be a good idea.SANDERS: Let me just...MITCHELL: Senator....CLINTON: But overall, a lot of the forces at work in the region are ones that we cannot directly influence, but we can...MITCHELL: You\u2019re out of time.SANDERS: OK. Let me suggest...(CROSSTALK)MITCHELL: Senator Sanders.SANDERS: Where Secretary Clinton and I think, I agree with most of what she said. But where I think we do have an honest disagreement, is that in the incredible quagmire of Syria, where it\u2019s hard to know who\u2019s fighting who and if you give arms to this guy, it may end up in ISIS\u2019 hand the next day. We all know that.And we all know, no argument, the secretary is absolutely right, Assad is a butcher of his own people, man using chemical weapons against his own people. This is beyond disgusting.But I think in terms of our priorities in the region, our first priority must be the destruction of ISIS. Our second priority must be getting rid of Assad, through some political settlement, working with Iran, working with Russia.But the immediate task is to bring all interests together who want to destroy ISIS, including Russia, including Iran, including our Muslim allies to make that the major priority.O\u2019MALLEY: But in all of that senator and secretary, I think we\u2019re leaving out something very important here. And that is that we still don\u2019t have the human intelligence: overt, in terms of diplomatic intelligence or covert, to understand even what the heck happens as the secondary and tertiary effects of some of these things.We are walking through this region, Andrea, without the human intelligence that we need. And we need to make a renewed investment as a country in bringing up a new generation of foreign service officers, and bringing up a new generation of business people and actually understanding and having relationships in these places.So we have a better sense of what the heck happens after a dictator topples and can take action to prevent another safe haven and another iteration of terror.MITCHELL: Your time is us. Lester.HOLT: Senator Sanders mentioned Russia a moment ago. Secretary Clinton, you famously handed Russia\u2019s foreign minister a reset button in 2009. Since then, Russia has annexed Crimea, fomented a war in Ukraine, provided weapons that downed an airliner and launched operations, as we just did discuss, to support Assad in Syria. As president, would you hand Vladimir Putin a reset button?CLINTON: Well, it would depend on what I got for it and I can tell you what we got in the first term, we got a new start treaty to reduce nuclear weapons between the United States and Russia. We got permission to resupply our troops in Afghanistan by traveling across Russia.We got Russia to sign on to our sanctions against Iran and other very important commitments. So look, in diplomacy, you are always trying to see how you can figure out the interest of the other to see if there isn\u2019t some way you can advance your security and your values.When Putin came back in the fall of 2011, it was very clear he came back with a mission. And I began speaking out as soon as that happened because there were some fraudulent elections held, and Russians poured out into the streets to demand their freedom, and he cracked down. And in fact, accused me of fomenting it. So we now know that he has a mixed record to say the least and we have to figure out how to deal with him.HOLT: What\u2019s your relationship with him?CLINTON: Well, my relationship with him, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s interesting.(LAUGHTER)It\u2019s one, I think, of respect. We\u2019ve had some very tough dealings with one another. And I know that he\u2019s someone that you have to continuingly stand up to because, like many bullies, he is somebody who will take as much as he possibly can unless you do.And we need to get the Europeans to be more willing to stand up, I was pleased they put sanctions on after Crimea and eastern Ukraine and the downing of the airliner, but we\u2019ve got to be more united in preventing Putin from taking a more aggressive stance in Europe and the Middle East.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: We to want turn right now to the issue of balancing national security concerns with the privacy rights of Americans. That brings us to YouTube and this question.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BROWNLEE: Hi, my name Marques Brownlee, and I\u2019ve been making YouTube videos about electronics and gadgets for the past seven years.I think America\u2019s future success is tied to getting all kinds of tech right. Tech companies are responsible for the encryption technology to protect personal data, but the government wants a back door into that information.So do you think it\u2019s possible to find common ground? And where do you stand on privacy versus security?(END VIDEO CLIP)HOLT: So, Governor O\u2019Malley.O\u2019MALLEY: Thank you.I believe whether it\u2019s a back door or a front door that the American principle of law should still hold that our federal government should have to get a warrant, whether they want to come through the back door or your front door.(APPLAUSE)And I also agree, Lester, with Benjamin Franklin, who said, no people should ever give up their privacy or their freedoms in a promise for security.So we\u2019re a collaborative people. We need collaborative leadership here with Silicon Valley and other bright people in my own state of Maryland and around the NSA that can actually figure this out.But there are certain immutable principles that will not become antique things in our country so long as we defend our country and its values and its freedoms. And one of those things is our right to be secure in our homes, and our right to expect that our federal government should have to get a warrant.I also want to the say that while we\u2019ve made some progress on the Patriot Act, I do believe that we need an adversarial court system there. We need a public advocate. We need to develop jurisprudence so that we can develop a body of law that protects the privacy of Americans in the information and digital age.HOLT: That\u2019s time.You have all talked about what you would do fighting ISIS over there, but we\u2019ve been hit in this country by home-grown terrorists, from Chattanooga to San Bernardino, the recent shooting of a police officer in Philadelphia. How are you going to fight the lone wolves here, Senator Sanders?O\u2019MALLEY: Yes, Lester, year in and year out I was the leader of the U.S. ...HOLT: That\u2019s a question to Senator Sanders. I wasn\u2019t clear, I apologize.SANDERS: OK. I just wanted to add, in the previous question, I voted against the USA Patriot Act for many of the reasons that Governor O\u2019Malley mentioned. But it is not only the government that we have to worry about, it is private corporations.You would all be amazed, or maybe not, about the amount of information private companies and the government has in terms of the Web sites that you access, the products that you buy, where you are this very moment.And it is very clear to me that public policy has not caught up with the explosion of technology. So yes, we have to work with Silicon Valley to make sure that we do not allow ISIS to transmit information...HOLT: But in terms of lone wolves, the threat, how would you do it?SANDERS: Right. What we have got to do there is, among other things, as I was just saying, have Silicon Valley help us to make sure that information being transmitted through the Internet or in other ways by ISIS is, in fact, discovered.But I do believe we can do that without violating the constitutional and privacy rights of the American people.(CROSSTALK)HOLT: We have to go to a \u2014 we have to go to a break, and when we come back, we\u2019re going to get to some of the burning questions these candidates have yet to answer and are totally eager to talk about.CLINTON: Oh, we\u2019re breaking? OK.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HOLT: And welcome back to Charleston.As we were going to a break, Secretary Clinton, I cut you off. I\u2019ll give you 30 seconds to respond on the issue of lone wolves.O\u2019MALLEY: Can I get 30 seconds, too?(LAUGHTER)SANDERS: Can I get 50 seconds?HOLT: Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Well, I wanted to say, and I\u2019ll do it quickly, I was very pleased that leaders of President Obama\u2019s administration went out to Silicon Valley last week and began exactly this conversation about what we can do, consistent with privacy and security.We need better intelligence cooperation, we need to be sure that we are getting the best intelligence that we can from friends and allies around the world. And then, we\u2019ve got to recognize our first line of defense against lone wolf attacks is among Muslim Americans.And it is not only shameful, it is dangerous for the kinds of comments you\u2019re hearing from the Republican side.We need to be reaching out and unifying our country against terrorist attacks and lone wolves, and working with Muslim Americans.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: And Andrea has a follow-up.O\u2019MALLEY: And Andrea \u2014 Andrea \u2014 Andrea...MITCHELL: Just a \u2014 just a quick follow-up, though, Secretary Clinton. Just a moment, Governor.O\u2019MALLEY: Andrea, when can I get my 30 seconds?MITCHELL: But \u2014 but \u2014 Secretary Clinton, you said that the leaders from the intelligence community went to Silicon Valley, they were flatly turned down. They got nowhere.CLINTON: That is not what I\u2019ve heard. Let me leave it at that.O\u2019MALLEY: Andrea, I need to talk about homeland security and preparedness.Ever since the attacks of September 11th \u2014 30 seconds.(LAUGHTER)Ever since the attacks of September 11th, my colleagues, Democratic and Republican mayors, Democratic and Republican governors, made me their leader on homeland security and preparedness.O\u2019MALLEY: Here in the homeland, unlike combating ISIL abroad, we\u2019re almost like it\u2019s \u2014 your body\u2019s immune system. It\u2019s able to protect your body against bad bugs, not necessarily because it outnumbers them, but it\u2019s better connected \u2014 the fusion centers, the biosurveillance systems, better prepared first responders.But there\u2019s another front in this battle, and it is this. That\u2019s the political front, and if Donald Trump wants to start a registry in our country of people by faith, he can start with me, and I will sign up as one who is totally opposed to his fascist appeals that wants to vilify American Muslims. That can do more damage to our democracy than any...(CROSSTALK)HOLT: All right, that\u2019s time, and \u2014 and we do...(APPLAUSE)... we do have to move on.Secretary Clinton, this is the first time...SANDERS: Can I get a \u2014 can I just get a very brief response? Very brief.HOLT: Thirty \u2014 30 \u2014 30 seconds, Senator.SANDERS: OK. One \u2014 and I agree with what the secretary said, and what Governor O\u2019Malley said. But here\u2019s an issue that we also should talk about. We have a $600 billion military budget. It is a budget larger than the next eight countries\u2019.Unfortunately, much of that budget continues to fight the old Cold War with the Soviet Union. Very little of that budget \u2014 less than 10 percent \u2014 actually goes into fighting ISIS and international terrorism. We need to be thinking hard about making fundamental changes in the priorities of the Defense Department.HOLT: All right. Secretary Clinton...(APPLAUSE)... this is the first time that a spouse of a former president could be elected president. You have said that President Clinton would advise you on economic issues, but be specific, if you can. Are you talking about a kitchen-table role on economics, or will he have a real policy role?CLINTON: Well, it\u2019ll start at the kitchen table, we\u2019ll see how it goes from there. And I...(APPLAUSE)... I\u2019m going to have the very best advisers that I can possibly have, and when it comes to the economy and what was accomplished under my husband\u2019s leadership and the \u201990s \u2014 especially when it came to raising incomes for everybody and lifting more people out of poverty than at any time in recent history \u2014 you bet.I\u2019m going to ask for his ideas, I\u2019m going ask for his advice, and I\u2019m going use him as a goodwill emissary to go around the country to find the best ideas we\u2019ve got, because I do believe, as he said, everything that\u2019s wrong with America has been solved somewhere in America.We just have to do more of it, and we have to reach out, especially into poor communities and communities of color, to give more people their own chance to get ahead.HOLT: Senator sanders, a 30 second response, sir.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Great ideas, Governor O\u2019Malley, Secretary Clinton, but here\u2019s the truth. If you have an administration stacked with Wall Street appointees, it ain\u2019t going to accomplish very much.So here\u2019s a promise that I make \u2014 and I mentioned a moment ago how corrupt the system is \u2014 Goldman Sachs, paying a $5 billion fine, gives this country, in recent history, a Republican secretary of treasury, a Democratic secretary of treasury.Here\u2019s a promise. If elected president, Goldman Sachs is not going to have \u2014 bring forth a secretary of treasury for a Sanders administration.(APPLAUSE)MILLER: Senator Sanders, let me ask you a question. You called Bill Clinton\u2019s past transgressions, quote, \u201ctotally, totally, totally disgraceful and unacceptable.\u201d Senator, do you regret saying that?SANDERS: I was asked a question. You know, one of the things, Andrea, and I \u2014 that question annoys me. I cannot walk down the street \u2014 Secretary Clinton knows this \u2014 without being told how much I have to attack secretary Clinton, want to get me on the front pages of the paper, I\u2019d make some vicious attack.I have avoided doing that. Trying to run an issue-oriented campaign.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: I was asked a question.MILLER: You didn\u2019t have to answer it that way, though. Why did you?SANDERS: Well \u2014 then if I don\u2019t answer it, then there\u2019s another front page, so it\u2019s yes (ph).(LAUGHTER)And I mean this seriously. You know that. We\u2019ve been through this. Yes, his behavior was deplorable. Have I ever once said a word about that issue? No, I have not. I\u2019m going to debate Secretary Clinton, Governor O\u2019Malley, on the issues facing the American people, not Bill Clinton\u2019s personal behavior.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: We will take a break. We\u2019ll continue from Charleston right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) HOLT: Welcome back everybody. Finally, before we go tonight, we set out here to understand points of differences between you. We believe we\u2019ve learned a lot here, but before we leave, is there anything that you really wanted to say tonight that you haven\u2019t gotten a chance to say.And, we\u2019ll start with Governor O\u2019Malley.(LAUGHTER)HOLT: Didn\u2019t see that coming, did you?O\u2019MALLEY: Yes, but we\u2019re going to have to get 20 minutes to do it, so.(LAUGHTER)MITCHELL: ...too long (ph).O\u2019MALLEY: I believe there are many issues. I have 60 seconds for this?HOLT: Sixty seconds, we\u2019d appreciate it.O\u2019MALLEY: There are so many issues that we haven\u2019t been able to discuss here. We have not fully discussed immigration reform, and the deplorable number of immigrant detention camps that our nation\u2019s now maintaining. We haven\u2019t discussed the shameful treatment that the people of Puerto Rico, our fellow Americans, are getting treated with by these hedge funds that are working them over.(APPLAUSE)O\u2019MALLEY: We haven\u2019t discussed the fact that in our hemisphere we have the danger of nation-state failures because of drug traffickers; and Honduras, and Guatemala and El Salvador.I guess the bottom line is this, look we are a great people the way we act at home and abroad based on the beliefs that unite us. Our belief in the dignity of every person, our belief in our own common good. There is now challenge that is too great for us to overcome provided we bring forward in these divided times, new leadership that can heal our divides here at home and bring our principles into alignment abroad.We\u2019re on the threshold of a new era of American progress and I believe we have only need to join forces together and cross that threshold into a new era of American prosperity.HOLT: And that\u2019s time.O\u2019MALLEY: Thanks a lot.HOLT: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well Lester, I spent a lot of time last week being outraged by what\u2019s happening in Flint, Michigan and I think every single American should be outraged. We\u2019ve had a city in the United States of America where the population which is poor in many ways and majority African American has been drinking and bathing in lead contaminated water. And the governor of that state acted as though he didn\u2019t really care.He had request for help and he had basically stone walled. I\u2019ll tell you what, if the kids in a rich suburb of Detroit had been drinking contaminated water and being bathed in it, there would\u2019ve been action.So I sent my top campaign aide down there to talk to the mayor of Flint to see what I could to help. I issued a statement about what we needed to do and then I went on a T.V. show and I said, \u201cit was outrageous that the governor hadn\u2019t acted and within two hours he had.\u201dHOLT: And that\u2019s time.CLINTON: I want to be a president who takes care of the big problems and the problems that are affecting the people of our country everyday.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Thank you.Senator Sanders?SANDERS: Well, Secretary Clinton was right and what I did which I think is also right, is demanded the resignation of governor. A man who acts that irresponsibly should not stay in power.Now, we are a great nation \u2014 and we\u2019ve heard a lot of great ideas here tonight. Let\u2019s be honest and let\u2019s be truthful. Very little is going to be done to transform our economy and to create the kind of middle class we need unless we end a corrupt campaign finance system which is undermining American democracy.We\u2019ve got to get rid of Super PACs, we\u2019ve got to get rid of Citizens\u2019 United and what we\u2019ve got to do is create a political revolution which revitalizes American democracy; which brings millions of young people and working people into the political process. To say loudly and clearly,\u201d that the government of the United States of America belongs to all of us and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.\u201dHOLT: All right. Well thank you and thanks to all of you for being here tonight shedding light on some of the differences as Americans get ready to vote.I also want to thank the Congressional Black Caucus Institute and certainly my friend and colleague, Andrea Mitchell. This has been great. It\u2019s been a great spirited conversation and American people appreciate it.Let me turn it over to my friend Chuck Todd now. Chuck?TODD: Lester thank you and a terrific job moderating this debate tonight, Andrea as well. What a lively substantive debate. We thought there were going to be fireworks, there certainly were.You heard sort of the sharp disagreements when it comes to guns, when it comes to Wall Street Reform, when it comes to health care and even a few things on foreign policy. We\u2019re going to break all of it down here in a few minutes but we\u2019re going to try to sneak in a short break.And when we come back, instant analysis. We\u2019ll see if we can find out what the campaigns are doing. We\u2019re live right here in the spin room in Charleston, South Carolina.ENDAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "African Economies, and Hopes for New Era, Are Shaken by China", "Date": "2016-01-25", "News": "Supported byJOHANNESBURG \u2014 Years of rapid economic growth across sub-Saharan Africa fueled hopes of a prosperous new era. To many, the world\u2019s poorest continent was finally emerging, with economies that were no longer dependent on the fickle global demand for Africa\u2019s raw resources.\u201cWe can see what drove the growth in Africa when demand goes away,\u201d said Greg Mills, the director of the Brenthurst Foundation, a Johannesburg-based economic research group. \u201cWell, demand has gone away, and it\u2019s not pretty.\u201dMany economists expect South Africa, the continent\u2019s most advanced and diversified economy, to slide into a recession this year, a projection disputed by the government. As Africa\u2019s biggest exporter of iron ore to China, South Africa is suffering from a slump in mining, as well as in other sectors like manufacturing and agriculture.Nigeria, Africa\u2019s biggest economy and oil producer, is reeling from the crash in crude prices, at the same time President Muhammadu Buhari tries to deal with Boko Haram, the Islamic extremist group that has long terrorized the nation. With oil accounting for 80 percent of government revenue, the government may also lack the resources to quell potential unrest in the Niger Delta, the source of the country\u2019s oil.Nigeria\u2019s currency, the naira, collapsed to record lows this month after Nigeria\u2019s central bank placed restrictions on the sale of American dollars to protect its shrinking foreign reserves. The currency fell to about 300 naira to the dollar in Nigeria\u2019s black market, down from about 240 early last month.Weakening currencies will make it harder for Nigeria \u2014 and many other African governments \u2014 to repay China for loans used to build large infrastructure projects. The tumbling naira and China\u2019s downturn are also reverberating across private businesses, large and small.Happiness Awonegbe, a businessman in Lagos, Nigeria, whose companies import paper, tires and other goods from China, said the restrictions on the dollar had made it difficult for him to place orders with Chinese suppliers. When he can place an order, his Chinese suppliers now take 50 days to fill it instead of 30, apparently because of reductions in their work force, Mr. Awonegbe said.\u201cWe are feeling so much this spillover effect,\u201d said Mr. Awonegbe, who employs 50 people. \u201cWhat happens in China affects Nigeria.\u201dBut experts also see bright spots on the map. While previously high-flying commodity exporters, like Angola and Zambia, have been hit hardest by China\u2019s slowdown, other countries are showing greater resilience.\u201cThe \u2018Africa rising\u2019 narrative wasn\u2019t true, but neither is the diametrically opposed argument that Africa is no longer rising,\u201d said Simon Freemantle, a senior political economist at Standard Bank, a South African bank. \u201cThe truth is obviously in between.\u201d\u201cWhat we\u2019re going to see going forward is far more fragmentation and divergence across the continent,\u201d Mr. Freemantle added. \u201cAnd what\u2019s going to determine that divergence is how prudent countries have been during the good times. Have they embedded macro reforms? Have they saved?\u201dMr. Freemantle said East African countries, including Kenya and Ethiopia, which have been forced to diversify their economies in part because of their dearth of commodities, will probably continue to enjoy robust growth.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.Critics say Zambia could have taken advantage of the boom by negotiating better terms with Chinese companies, including securing technology transfers or employment for infrastructure projects. Zambia used revenue from copper to increase the salaries of civil servants but did not invest in potential growth industries, like tourism and agriculture.Edith Nawakwi, a former finance minister in Zambia and now leader of an opposition party, said large infrastructure projects were often wasted opportunities that failed to lead to economic development. African leaders, Ms. Nawakwi said, could have asked the Chinese to build infrastructure that would have furthered regional integration, business and trade.\u201cWhat we need is a change in the way we approach China,\u201d Ms. Nawakwi said. \u201cYou get from China what you ask for.\u201dBut with the impact on Africa of China\u2019s downturn and a growing trade imbalance \u2014 China exported $102 billion to Africa last year but imported only $67 billion from the continent \u2014 skeptical voices are increasing.\u201cThe Chinese are not romantic anymore about their relations with Africa \u2014 far from it,\u201d said Ibbo Mandaza, a political analyst and businessman in Zimbabwe. \u201cFor them, it\u2019s purely economic.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Annuities as an Alternative to Shaky Markets? Not So Fast", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Supported byRetiringCHECKED your retirement savings plan lately? January\u2019s global stock market plunge is one of those moments that stoke fear among baby boomers that they might run out of money before they run out of years.Many economists have a favorite solution for those eager to get off the market\u2019s roller-coaster ride while also hedging against a long life: a single-premium immediate annuity or lifetime annuity, preferably one with protection against inflation.In exchange for a lump-sum investment, this type of annuity guarantees a steady income for the rest of your life. The payment stream depends on your age and the level of interest rates. But when you die, the value of the annuity typically goes to the insurer, not to your heirs.Despite all the support for annuities among economists, there are good reasons for consumers to be wary.Ross Rezac, 67, and her husband, Martin Skoro, 63, are intrigued. Ms. Rezac and Mr. Skoro are semiretired graphic designers in Minneapolis who are gradually winding down their firm, accepting business if it comes but no longer marketing their services. Their household portfolio is over $1 million.\u201cWhat attracts us to the annuity is the steady income,\u201d Ms. Rezac said. \u201cThe advice we\u2019ve had is that the stock market will implode over the next few years, and this is a way to solve that problem.\u201dStill, Ms. Rezac and Mr. Skoro are uncertain about taking the plunge. Do they really want to give up control over their savings in return for a monthly income? They worry that they don\u2019t understand the trade-offs.\u201cSome people hate them and others think they\u2019re great,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s confusing.\u201dBehavioral scholars have come up with reasons annuities aren\u2019t highly regarded. These include \u201cmoney illusion\u201d (lump sum investment is so much larger than the monthly income stream) and \u201cavailability errors\u201d (fear of dying right after signing the contract). Another reason is \u201csmell of death\u201d pessimism (buying an annuity means giving up hope of investing for gain).But the reluctance to buy annuities is not irrational. For one thing, a broad-based stock index fund is far more likely to outperform the return on an annuity over most time frames, particularly when interest rates are extremely low, as they are now.\u201cI don\u2019t have an annuity and don\u2019t plan to buy an annuity,\u201d said Meir Statman, a finance professor at Santa Clara University. \u201cI am sufficiently responsible and have enough self-control that I can moderate my consumption around my circumstances.\u201dWhile marketed as supersafe, annuities do carry some risks. No investor should buy an annuity without making sure the insurance company has a top credit rating and a sound balance sheet.\u201cMost Americans in our model should not annuitize,\u201d Professor Smetters said. He does recommend considering annuities if you have at least $500,000 set aside first, half for medical expenses and half to tap when needed. His financial rule of thumb eliminates most boomers.The median balance for people age 65 to 74 with retirement savings in 2010 was $138,000 for married households and $49,000 for single households, according to Professor Poterba of M.I.T. The comparable numbers for those age 55 to 64 is $130,000 married and $45,000 single. \u201cCertainly, there is the dynamic that people who can afford a significant allocation to annuities don\u2019t need to,\u201d says Michael Kitces, a certified financial planner and director of research at Pinnacle Advisory Group. \u201cThe rest can\u2019t really annuitize all their wealth.\u201dWhat are the alternatives? Social Security is an inflation-adjusted creditworthy annuity far superior to anything offered in the marketplace. Working longer, even earning a part-time income, makes it easier to delay filing for Social Security benefits until age 70. Waiting will produce real returns of 4 , 5 or even 6 percent a year for those living to age 90 and more. \u201cSocial Security is an awesome annuity,\u201d Professor Smetters said.Moreover, people heading into the traditional retirement years often underestimate how much they can reduce their financial risks by paying off their mortgage and reducing other fixed expenses.\u201cThis is a better way to reduce risk,\u201d says Ross Levin, a certified financial planner and co-founder of Accredited Investors Inc. in Edina, Minn. \u201cManage your expenses. Manage your cash flow. Pay attention to debt. Pay attention to taxes.\u201dWhat if you still think you would be safer putting a portion of your savings into an annuity?A starting place is comparison shopping at a website like Immediateannuities.com. Check the offerings of low-fee providers like Vanguard, TIAA-CREF and USAA. You should also work with a fee-only financial planner to evaluate the pluses and minuses and work through the costs and benefits of several policy enhancements.A policy that protects against inflation, for example, is increasingly valuable the longer you own the annuity. Married couples typically choose a joint and survivor policy, meaning the payments will continue to the widow or widower. You can buy an annuity that returns some money to heirs. The price for each policy enhancement is a lower monthly payout.Don\u2019t let a financial adviser or insurance broker talk you into wasting your money on variable annuities, an overly complex, high-fee product with mutual-fundlike accounts wrapped in a tax shelter. You can do better keeping it simple.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "My Take on the Republican Presidential Debate", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Republican candidates for president dueled in another televised debate, the modern version of gladiatorial combat. Instead of writing a column, I\u2019m collecting some of my tweets about the debate in this blog post, which I\u2019m updating until it ends. These are raw and rushed ruminations, journalism on the fly, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an attempt to hold politicians accountable instantaneously for their rhetorical stretches. I welcome your comments.Ted Cruz starts by saying Americans opened their papers this morning and were horrified by what they saw.I thought Cruz was referring to the article about his financing his campaign with a Goldman Sachs loan. But he meant photo of GI\u2019s in Iran.Christie says that if he were Pres, Iranians wouldn\u2019t seize US ships. More likely, Iran would have seized them, but we\u2019d now be at war.Republican candidates competing with each other to see who can denounce @HillaryClinton most vitriolically. Hm. Not the same as governing.I think @marcorubio just implied that in his administration we\u2019re back to torturing detainees.Donald Trump: \u201cOur country is a mess.\u201d This is so far from President Reagan\u2019s praise of America as the \u201cshining city on a hill.\u201dIf Ted Cruz is going to denounce the @nytimes, he should at least have the courtesy to drive traffic to our site by giving the web address.Trump says that Syrian refugees are almost all young men. It\u2019s true that 62% of refugees in Europe are male (of all ages).But 2/3 of Syrian refugees referred by the UN to the US for consideration are women or children under 12.Ted Cruz is right that the law is clear: A child of a US citizen born abroad is a \u201cnatural-born citizen\u201d eligible for the presidency.Donald Trump always strikes me as emotionally insecure, desperate for applause and compliments. Actually, lots of politicians like that.Ted Cruz says he won\u2019t take legal advice from Donald Trump. Then goes into tirade against Larry Tribe of Harvard.Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio are the best natural debaters in the group, both talented communicators. Cruz smarter, Rubio more likable.Trump: \u201cIllegal immigration is beyond belief.\u201d Not true. There\u2019s now net emigration to Mexico, not net immigration.Rubio says that under Obama the US military is underfinanced. But US military spending is greater than that of next 8 countries combined.Chris Christie is denouncing all his old positions (in which, for example, he embraced gun safety). I liked the old Christie better.Chris Christie now claims he never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood. But in 1994 he said he made a \u201cpersonal contribution\u201d to it.I thought \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d was entertaining but its politicians too bizarre to be real. Now I watch Trump & Cruz. So, Netflix, I apologizeCandidates have always spun the facts. Now they invent them. Check out the first item in NYT fact-checker, re Trump https://t.co/Q4sR1ZkmjDJeb Bush praises Gov @nikkihaley for her leadership after the church shooting. It\u2019s true and well-deserved.Bush says we need to make background checks work better. But now they\u2019re easy to evade: 40% of guns are bought without a background checkRubio seems to think that gun laws are irrelevant. But Connecticut tightened gun laws, and gun homicides fell 40%.Meanwhile, Missouri eased laws on handguns, and gun murders rose 25%. Gun laws aren\u2019t a panacea, but they do matter.Candidates are thundering about terrorism, which has killed 300 Americans over last decade. Guns have killed 330,000 in US in same period.Cruz is explaining \u201cNY values.\u201d And he\u2019s right. NY and cities generally are more secular and more socially liberal than rest of country.As an Oregon farm kid, i have some rural values. But urbanites were leaders on civil rights, on gay rights, on women\u2019s rights.Cruz may not like \u201cNew York values,\u201d but he evidently likes \u201cNew York financing\u201d from Goldman Sachs.Ben Carson doesn\u2019t understand collateral damage issue. Eg, an ISIS hq also had a jail. If we kill officials, we also kill hostages.Chris Christie is right to criticize Obama on Syria, which is Obama\u2019s biggest single failing. But not clear what Christie would do.Trump: \u201cWe can\u2019t be the stupid country any more. We\u2019re laughed at all over the world.\u201d Yes, we are. Partly because of Trump.Good for Bush for saying that Trump is \u201cunhinged\u201d for proposing to bar Muslims. An appeal to better angels\u2013who may not vote in GOP primary.I once asked Trump how he would ban Muslims. Ask people their religion? Or just ban all Arabs, including Christians? He didn\u2019t answer.As a son of a refugee whom the US admitted, it hurts to hear presidential candidates make scapegoats of the world\u2019s most vulnerable peopleJeb Bush notes that it may be a bit awkward to plan a coalition against iSiS if we don\u2019t admit Muslims. Lots of Skype calls, I guess.Trump denies that he told the NY Times that he urged a 45% tariff on Chinese goods. Hm. I was there. He said it.I\u2019ve met lots of politicians over the decades. Trump is charming\u2013and the most vapid and ill-informed and evasive of the lot.Rubio makes the important point that US consumers would pay a tariff on Chinese goods. EG no more iPhones.Trump\u2019s exact words to the @nytimes about the China tariff he proposes were: \u201cthe tax should be 45 percent.\u201d https://t.co/WQ2rU7lGB7Trump is referring to his proposed \u201cbusiness flat tax.\u201d Watchers may not realize it\u2019s a VAT, value-added tax, similar to a sales tax.Christie is talking, reasonably, about repairing infrastructure and bridges. But Christie talking about bridges with no irony?Ben Carson always comes across as very likable. If I were looking for a guy to drive across the country with, it would be Carson.Now Rubio is whacking Cruz on his tax as a VAT. There\u2019s a legitimate argument to be had about a VAT, with pluses and minuses.In her TV speech, Nikki Haley was a model of reasoned outreach to voters. Trump and Cruz strike me as the opposite.Tweeps are saying that if Ben Carson & I drove cross country, he\u2019d put me to sleep. Well, then he could give my brain a tune-up.Sad to see two smart politicians who are sons of immigrants, Rubio and Cruz, compete to see who can be more hostile to immigrants.I spend so much time hounding countries like China to be more democratic. Then I watch US democracy in action. And flinch.John Kasich is among the most experienced and reasonable of the candidates. And completely marginalized. But maybe as running mate?On the https://t.co/kuUCHg63PO betting site, Ted Cruz is seen as winning the debate (getting the biggest bump from the polls). I agree.Debate\u2019s over.Cruz, Trump, Rubio were really the only ones who mattered.

{"Headline": "Jane Bryant Quinn\u2019s Upper West Side Home", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "Supported byWhat I Love8 PhotosEvery marriage has its deal. Here, to give just one handy example, were the terms of the deal struck by the personal finance expert Jane Bryant Quinn and her second husband, David: Ms. Quinn would put up with the suburbs and Mr. Quinn would put up with her.The arrangement worked admirably. The couple lived first in Chappaqua, N.Y., where they built a small glass house in the woods, then in North Salem, N.Y., where they bought a hilltop property and built a large glass house with a two-story library, enough bedrooms to accommodate five children (his, hers and theirs) and a glorious eyeful no matter the direction. But there was no arguing that the location was less than ideal. \u201cWe were huge opera fans, and all of our friends were saying \u2018Taxi!\u2019 and going home, and we would have to drive back to North Salem,\u201d Ms. Quinn said. \u201cWe missed a lot of third acts and whatnot.\u201dAfter her husband died in 2004, Ms. Quinn was good and ready to clear out. \u201cA big place in North Salem is no place for a widow,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to come back to the city.\u201dShe had no interest in a similarly grand place in Manhattan. \u201cI wanted something that was my size, that fit me,\u201d Ms. Quinn said. But as in North Salem, she had to be able to look out the window and find nature. \u201cI told my real estate agent that I would go as far north on Central Park West as I had to go to get an apartment with a view of the park.\u201dThe dining room was a major selling point, because Ms. Quinn loves to have dinner parties. And the butler\u2019s pantry was a bonus, because Ms. Quinn doesn\u2019t cook \u2014 just ask Mr. Tucker \u2014 and wanted an alcove that could hold a caterer and several sets of dishes. She redid the kitchen and both of the bathrooms, and lined a wall of the dining room with bookcases. \u201cThe scale of the dining rooms in some of these West Side apartments is just a little big,\u201d Ms. Quinn said. \u201cSo now the scale of the room is right, and I have bookshelves.\u201d The air shaft that was once visible from the dining room window is concealed by the two pieces of stained glass she brought to New York from the library of her North Salem home.Mr. Tucker, 64, came to the union with several treasures, including a metamorphic library chair that opens to become steps, an antique dining table and a pair of Jacobean chairs, legacies from his paternal grandmother, which are \u201cwonderful, though quite uncomfortable to sit on,\u201d Ms. Quinn said.Surely you\u2019ll forgive her weakness for a bronze bust on one of the shelves in the living room. Years ago, she and Mr. Quinn owned a house on the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Their neighbors were a group of art students, among them a young woman named Amy Berger, who had won several prizes for her sculptures. \u201cSo I said, \u2018Amy, would you do one of me?\u2019 So she did, and I\u2019m extremely fond of it.\u201d There are many objects gathered over decades of travel \u2014 frankincense and myrrh from a shop in Petra, Jordan; large salt crystals from the Dead Sea (\u201cI finally had to put them in a corner, because people thought they were hors d\u2019oeuvres,\u201d Ms. Quinn said); a Buddha head from Bali that sits on a stand in the dining room \u201cand makes me feel good\u201d; and a pair of Dogon masks from Mali. \u201cYou can\u2019t go there anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cYou look at all the places you can\u2019t go to anymore, because they\u2019ve fallen apart, like Syria, and think, \u2018I\u2019m so grateful I went.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms. Quinn likes to say that everything in the apartment tells a story. The rugs in the living and dining rooms tell a particularly poignant one. \u201cI took a trip to Africa after David died, my first as a widow,\u201d she recalled. \u201cAnd, of course, the guide wants to push you into a rug store. I almost blew his mind when I said I actually did want to buy a rug. I saw a small one and asked them to make it for me in a 9-by-12 size, and they did and it was terrific,\u201d Ms. Quinn added, looking down at the geometric patterns in red, green and varying shades of blue.Across the hall, in the dining room, is a similarly patterned earth-toned rug from India. \u201cI bought it with David,\u201d she said. \u201cI look at the two rugs, and they\u2019re the before and after of the two halves of my life.\u201dWhen Ms. Quinn saw the apartment for the first time, it wasn\u2019t yet officially on the market. She had a budget and, rest assured, was sticking to it, but she had already seen enough of what was out there to know that the price was right. \u201cWas I going to kill myself to try to knock a little bit off and risk losing it?\u201d she said. \u201cNo, I was not.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Making Milton Babbitt\u2019s Legacy Less Fearsome", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported bySometime in the mid-1920s, a 10-year-old clarinetist in the Jackson Boys\u2019 Band in Mississippi had a small epiphany. The highest notes of his solo in an opera overture were, in fact, a transposition of the opening motif of the piece.\u201cThis recognition, if not a major revelation in the history of analytical theory, was yet sufficient to suggest to the clarinetist how one might do cognitive things with notes, which might prove deserving of his further attention,\u201d Milton Babbitt later recalled, having long before abandoned the clarinet for a life as a composer of dazzlingly complex music.Fortunately, the Juilliard School \u2014 where Babbitt taught for 37 years \u2014 will help rectify the imbalance with this year\u2019s Focus! festival, \u201cMilton Babbitt\u2019s World,\u201d a celebration that begins on Friday, Jan. 22. Organized by the Juilliard conductor and professor Joel Sachs, the festival\u2019s six concerts will feature rarely heard works by Babbitt; the premieres of pieces by his colleagues and students; and performances of music by composers he loved, from Johannes Brahms to Irving Berlin.\u201cHe was such an incredible spirit in the new-music world,\u201d Mr. Sachs said recently. \u201cHe really helped reinforce the infrastructure for composers in this country.\u201dAround the time of his clarinet solo insight, the preteen Babbitt had another revelation: He heard the pianist Paul Nordoff perform a piece by Arnold Schoenberg. \u201cThis other music was so different, such an absolutely different world, that I became very interested,\u201d Babbitt later said.Babbitt also continued to dabble in the popular domain, writing a film score and a musical, \u201cFabulous Voyage,\u201d that never made it to the stage. Even after he accepted a teaching position at Princeton, he remained a lifelong connoisseur of the American songbook. He claimed to know the lyrics to 4,000 songs; his best-known student is Stephen Sondheim. Mr. Sachs recalled a Christmas party several decades ago at which Babbitt sat down at a piano and played tune after tune.During World War II, Babbitt worked on secret research projects for the government, drawing on his training as a mathematician. At Princeton, he wrote a doctoral thesis, \u201cThe Function of Set Structure in the 12-Tone System,\u201d a theoretical exegesis on his compositional formulas. It was rejected by his department: No Ph.D. program in music composition yet existed, and his fellow professors couldn\u2019t make head or tail of it. When Babbitt published an article based on his dissertation nearly a decade later, it opened with a rant about the ignorance of concertgoers toward the contemporary: \u201cTwelve-tone music suffers only slightly more than other \u2018difficult,\u2019 \u2018advanced\u2019 music \u2014 to the extent that the label itself supplies a basis for automatic rejection.\u201dBabbitt, though, was less averse to a general listenership than skeptical of the need to compose for it. \u201cWhy should the layman be other than bored and puzzled by what he is unable to understand, music or anything else?\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is only the translation of this boredom and puzzlement into resentment and denunciation that seems to me indefensible.\u201d He advocated \u201ctotal, resolute and voluntary withdrawal from this public world to one of private performance.\u201dThe polemic was as much a signal to his colleagues at Princeton as it was to the public. Babbitt wrote that universities \u201cshould provide a home for the \u2018complex,\u2019 \u2018difficult\u2019 and \u2018problematical\u2019 in music.\u201d The Ph.D. program that he subsequently began at Princeton, in 1961, culminated in a dissertation project including both a musical composition and an analytical paper. Babbitt\u2019s timing was perfect: By reimagining music as a scientific discipline, he capitalized on the Sputnik era of the Cold War and a new wave of financing directed toward research.\u201cIt was not only his brain that was truly remarkable, but he was a musician through and through,\u201d she added. \u201cThat enabled him to take the clinical, the technical, theoretical apparatus and to turn that into this music that was so elegant and rigorous and vital, and personal and humorous.\u201dToday, the new-music infrastructure Babbitt fostered seems less a retreat from the public than a bulwark against the marketplace. \u201cTo consign us to the great world out there, however seriously or however viciously, is to consign us to oblivion,\u201d he once said. \u201cOutside the university, our music and our words are bound to fall on unheeding or, at least, uncomprehending ears.\u201dThat may not be wholly accurate in the 21st century, but the academy still plays a necessary role, as the young composer Matt McBane described in a recent interview. After a successful early career running a music festival and leading an ensemble, he wanted to carve out time to actually write music. He didn\u2019t desire an elite audience of specialists or the opportunity to investigate hexachordal combinatoriality, but a place that gave him the funding and space to hone his craft within a creative community.He chose to pursue a Ph.D. at Princeton.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who\u2019s Taking On Ethics in Albany? Not the Ethics Panels", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported byALBANY \u2014 On this, the leaders in New York\u2019s Capitol can all agree: Something must be done about ethics. Reforms must be passed, the public trust once again earned.What better place to start than the ethics panels of the State Assembly and the State Senate?Then again, this is Albany.Like other committees in the Legislature, the ethics panels have chairmen and several members each. Unlike the others, they have not considered a single bill on the subject of ethics \u2014 or anything else \u2014 that anyone can remember.\u201cIt is a body bent on self-protection,\u201d said Susan Lerner, executive director of Common Cause New York, a government watchdog group, referring to the Legislature. \u201cAnd so you have two different committees in two different houses bent on self-protection.\u201dFor the reform-minded, the ethics panels\u2019 paralysis is yet another symptom of a willful ignorance that allows the Capitol to make much of minor improvements while circumventing real change.The Assembly Ethics and Guidance Committee\u2019s chairman, Charles D. Lavine, a Democrat from the North Shore of Long Island, acknowledged that his panel did not deal with legislation. Assemblyman Lavine said its purpose was to handle policy violations, including complaints about sexual harassment and discrimination, a service apparently in enough demand to require the panel to meet at least once every other month.Michael Whyland, a spokesman for Speaker Carl E. Heastie, a Bronx Democrat, said, \u201cThe fact that the ethics committee does not report bills does not mean those issues are not being considered and reported.\u201d Mr. Whyland listed several reforms undertaken by the Assembly in recent years.In his testimony, he said he had been told the hearing needed to be rescheduled to accommodate budget negotiations. He was never given another date.\u201cI had expressed some consternation, like, what the heck?\u201d Mr. Avella said in the interview. \u201cYou\u2019d think the standing committee would have the ability to have bills referred to it. I think it would be important, for anything that has to do with ethics reform, that it should go to the Ethics Committee.\u201dBut Mr. Avella was careful to say that he could not pinpoint who had blocked his efforts. \u201cThere\u2019s no way for anybody to tell,\u201d he said.Given the Ethics Committee\u2019s unpromising record, government watchdogs were pleasantly surprised by Mr. Avella\u2019s initial enthusiasm. They were unpleasantly unsurprised when his efforts fizzled.If the senator had held a hearing on the subject of ethics reform, said Dick Dadey, executive director of Citizens Union, \u201cthat would have opened up a can of worms that the majority leader couldn\u2019t have controlled.\u201dMr. Avella\u2019s puzzlement has outlasted his tenure as committee chairman; late last year, he suddenly found himself with a new assignment as head of the Committee on Children and Families. (He was also unable to explain the logic behind the switch.)Occasional flickers of protest do occur. The Assembly minority leader, Brian M. Kolb, a Republican from the Finger Lakes region, used his first speech of the session to implore his colleagues to remake the Legislature with more power for rank-and-file members and less for leaders.State Senator Michael Gianaris, from Queens, one of two Democrats who serve on the Ethics Committee, was perturbed enough to send a confrontational letter to the current chairman, Senator Thomas Croci, insisting that he hold hearings on reform proposals and ask Republican leaders to refer bills to the committee.\u201cSurely, at least some of these ideas are worthy of a public discussion, yet there has been a complete unwillingness to address or even discuss any of these common-sense measures,\u201d Mr. Gianaris wrote. \u201cIt is no wonder New Yorkers have lost faith in their government.\u201dA press officer for the Republican majority leadership seemed perplexed by questions about the committee\u2019s listlessness, saying that it had never been intended to take up legislation, and that ethics reform proposals were simply routed to other relevant panels, as when campaign finance bills went to the Elections Committee.The Ethics Committee\u2019s intended function, the press officer explained, was to review internal complaints about policy violations. But Senator Gianaris said that in the two years since he joined the committee, it had never done so.Chris Meluso, a spokesman for Mr. Croci, a Long Island Republican, said earlier this month that the senator was not available for comment. Mr. Meluso did say the senator had recently introduced a bill that would amend the State Constitution to strip pensions from elected officials convicted of a felony.Since no bills were ever referred to the committee, Mr. Meluso said, Mr. Croci\u2019s proposal had been assigned to the Judiciary Committee.\u201cThis is the first thing he\u2019s doing as ethics chairman, and hopefully it\u2019s going to be indicative,\u201d Mr. Meluso said.Despite the committee\u2019s lack of hearings, meetings or bills, he said, \u201cI think it still provides a platform; there are lots of arenas where he can get his message out.\u201dAround the Capitol, the activities of the Assembly Ethics and Guidance Committee elicit something between a yawn and a look of befuddlement. Rachael Fauss, the public policy director for Citizens Union, recalled that when she was an Assembly staff member in the mid-2000s, the committee seemed to do little more than send attendance slips to other members, informing them that they had missed too many meetings.The surprise emanating from government watchdogs was palpable.\u201cWe all were stunned to see him take such a public position, because he\u2019d never articulated any of that before,\u201d Mr. Dadey said. \u201cWhile we welcomed his proposals, they would\u2019ve been more helpful last year.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated, in one instance, the title of Charles D. Lavine. He is an assemblyman, not a senator.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Late Reshuffling Clouds Vote on N.F.L. Moves", "Date": "2016-01-11", "News": "Supported byHOUSTON \u2014 With the N.F.L. hours away from convening a special two-day meeting among owners to decide on moving one or possibly two teams to Los Angeles, it seemed likely that the city would get a team, but which one and where they would play grew murkier Monday during a round of last-minute jockeying.The goal is to have a team in place to begin playing by the fall, and in the future, most likely in a stadium built in one of two Los Angeles suburbs.The return of football to Los Angeles, the nation\u2019s second-largest market, would come after more than a 20-year absence, after two teams left in 1995, the Rams to St. Louis and the Raiders back to Oakland. In contrast to previous discussions about putting a team in Los Angeles again, the moves this time are primarily driven by owners willing to build a stadium themselves, rather than by civic leaders pleading with residents to foot a substantial part of the bill.But what combination, if any, of the three teams vying to move \u2014 the Oakland Raiders, the San Diego Chargers and the St. Louis Rams \u2014 has grown uncertain as the vote nears. A committee of owners met in Houston on Monday, but it was unclear if they would make a recommendation to the full panel of owners.For months, the owners have weighed the pros and cons of a plan by the Rams\u2019 owner, E. Stanley Kroenke, to build a domed stadium in Inglewood that could accommodate his team and another. Separately, the Chargers and the Raiders have proposed an outdoor stadium that they would share in Carson.Only a handful of owners, who will formally weigh the proposals Tuesday and possibly vote Wednesday, have publicly supported either proposal. More than half of them appear to support the Carson proposal, while about 10 owners favor the plan for Inglewood, according to several people with knowledge of the owners\u2019 thinking. Any move requires the approval of three-quarters, or 24, of the owners.In recent days, though, the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, Jerry Jones, who has publicly supported the Rams\u2019 plan, proposed that the Chargers team up with the Rams in Inglewood.\u00a0\u201cIt has enough of the wow and pizazz of the sport, and having enough else to do,\u201d Jones said of the Inglewood proposal last month. \u201cThe key is relevance.\u201dThe Chargers have sent word they are not interested in that alternative. In fact, the Chargers are willing to dump the Raiders from their plan and build a stadium themselves, if it would make owners more amenable to their move.The Chargers have said that about a quarter of their fans come from Orange and Los Angeles counties, and they want to move to Carson, in part, to block the Rams from getting there first.It is also possible Kroenke gives up on Inglewood and moves to Carson with the Chargers as the cost of being allowed to move to Los Angeles. As compensation, the Raiders would get a promise of enhanced financing from the N.F.L. if they decide to build a new stadium in Oakland.Other details could gum up the decision. The Federal Aviation Administration, for instance, has voiced reservations about an Inglewood stadium\u2019s potential impact on planes landing and taking off at Los Angeles International Airport, several miles to the west of the proposed site.The stadium in Carson, which will would not need a roof and will be in a less densely populated area, is expected to cost about $1.8 billion. The Disney chairman, Robert A. Iger, who will speak to the owners on Tuesday, has agreed to work with the Chargers to get their stadium built in Carson, if it is approved.The owners also must agree on whether it is wise to allow two teams to enter the Los Angeles market at once. The Raiders and Rams both played there until the end of the 1994 season, but unable to secure public financing for new stadiums, they left for Oakland and St. Louis the next year.Some owners think it would be prudent to let one team return to the region first to ensure that sales of tickets and sponsorships are strong enough before adding a second team.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Year Chill on I.P.O.s", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "Supported byDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 The market for initial public offerings has been all but dead since late last year. Don\u2019t expect that freeze to lift anytime soon, according to two top officials for the United States\u2019 biggest stock exchanges.Executives at both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq stock market said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum here that they expect very few companies to try to make their market debuts.Elevate, an online lender, postponed its planned offering earlier this week, joining the likes of the Albertsons supermarket chain and the Caribbean telecommunications provider Digicel.\u201cThis has been one of the worst starts to a year,\u201d said Garvis Toler, the head of capital markets for the Big Board\u2019s parent, NYSE Euronext.The hesitation of companies to pursue I.P.O.s arises from a stew of circumstances, including the poor reception for companies that made their market debuts this year, the whipsawing stock markets and the continued availability of money in the private capital markets.Executives from both the N.Y.S.E. and Nasdaq said that their backlog \u2014 companies that have filed privately for an I.P.O. without publicly disclosing their intentions \u2014 remains strong. But Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq\u2019s chief executive, noted that prolonged market troubles simply meant that those would-be debutants would push back their plans.\u201cThe backlog is now less meaningful than at other times,\u201d he said.Still, Mr. Greifeld held out hopes that another Nasdaq offering would rise in popularity. Last fall, the exchange operator bought SecondMarket to bolster its options for companies to allow the sales of their stocks without going public.As companies stay private longer, he said, they will face more pressure to let shareholders and early investors cash out their holdings, in part as the number of \u201cdown rounds\u201d \u2014 financings that value a company at less than what it was worth in a previous round \u2014 multiply.Such a system will not eliminate I.P.O.s, Mr. Greifeld said. But he predicted that these private markets would become even more popular.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Report Faults E.C.B. in Irish Banking Collapse", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Supported byDUBLIN \u2014 The European Central Bank placed an \u201cinappropriate\u201d debt burden on Irish citizens in 2010 when it refused to force bond investors to share losses from troubled banks, a parliamentary committee report on the country\u2019s banking collapse said on Wednesday.The report supports the view, widely held in Ireland, that the E.C.B. dictated policy to the government in a way that punished taxpayers while sparing investors who owned bonds issued by Irish banks.The central bank, which is based in Frankfurt, routinely denies that it meddles in politics or tells eurozone governments what to do. But the report is likely to bolster critics who say that, in its zeal to protect the banking system, the bank has strong-armed political leaders not only in Ireland but also in other countries hit by crisis, like Greece and Cyprus.The E.C.B. said in a statement on Wednesday that it welcomed the report, which it said provided \u201ca valuable contribution to an understanding of the crisis.\u201d The central bank said it had been open about its role in Ireland but declined to comment in detail on the report.The 400-page report, published Wednesday afternoon, says that in November 2010 and again in March 2011, the central bank explicitly threatened to withhold emergency support to Irish banks if the government imposed losses on holders of bank bonds.The inquiry also found that the so-called troika of lenders \u2014 the central bank, the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission \u2014 would not have agreed to bail out Ireland had the government decided to burn so-called senior bondholders, the investors who own bonds that are supposed to be the last in line to suffer losses. The E.C.B. was determined that no bank in Europe would be allowed to fail.While the report finds significant fault with Ireland\u2019s oversight of its banking system, it is particularly scathing of the European Central Bank\u2019s role in managing the aftermath of the system\u2019s collapse from 2008 to 2010.The bailout initially cost Irish taxpayers \u20ac64 billion, or $69 billion at current exchange rates \u2014 the equivalent of 33 percent of Ireland\u2019s gross domestic product. This figure was subsequently lowered to around \u20ac40 billion after debt refinancing. According to the National Treasury Management Agency of Ireland, government debt peaked at 120 percent of G.D.P. in 2013 and is still hovering at just below 100 percent.\u201cThe E.C.B. simply gave advice on this issue,\u201d Mr. Trichet said. \u201cThe E.C.B. indeed doesn\u2019t have any authority to issue instructions to euro area governments or to ministers.\u201d Mr. Trichet left the central bank in October 2011 after his term expired.Over several months, the parliamentary committee, which included members of the major parties, interviewed senior and former senior bank officials, prime ministers, senior politicians, civil servants, central bank officials and property developers. However, the committee was criticized in many quarters because its powers were limited.Pearse Doherty, finance spokesman for the Sinn Fein party, was one of two members of the committee who refused to sign off on the report, which cost \u20ac5 million to create.\u201cWhile the report includes new information, it fails to fully answer the questions regarding how the crisis came about and who was responsible,\u201d Mr. Doherty said.Sean Barrett, an independent member of Parliament who did sign off on the report, was also critical of the process, and gloomy about a possible recurrence of financial crises.\u201cBusiness as usual has become the order of the day, reform fatigue has set in and the seeds of the next crisis are already being cultivated,\u201d Mr. Barrett wrote.The fallout from the banking crash is still apparent. Although Ireland has recorded the highest growth in Europe over the past two years, the country continues to suffer the effects of the crisis. Hospitals are postponing operations because of funding cuts, unemployment is around 9 percent, and the number of people leaving the country remains high.Douglas Dalby reported from Dublin, and Jack Ewing from London.Advertisement"}

She has spent months crisscrossing the country to attend fund-raising events that bring in up to $2,700, the maximum donation allowed for the nominating contest.

The person said the talks broke down because the creditors attempted to impose a new requirement in exchange for granting more time.The negotiations have been underway since 2014, when Prepa ran into trouble making its payments, and creditors agreed to refrain from enforcing their claims. As part of their forbearance agreement, they allowed Prepa to dip into prepaid reserves to make bond payments, something that could otherwise be considered an event of default.But before the deal could proceed, the Puerto Rico legislature had to approve it, and some lawmakers argued that Prepa and its creditors were rushing to close the deal before the island\u2019s new public utility commission had a chance to properly review it.The creditors had expected the legislature to approve the deal in a special session in December. When that did not happen, they said they would wait until Jan. 22, and they offered $115 million to help finance Prepa while the legislature considered an enabling bill.But with the deadline looming this week, lawmakers said they were still not ready to vote on the agreement. One person familiar with the legal requirements said the creditors were willing to wait until February, but the new public utility commission was more likely to need until May. The debt exchange would have required Prepa\u2019s first increase in its base rate for power since 1989. The public utility commission is so new it has never been through a rate-setting process before.The Prepa creditors\u2019 statement said, \u201cIt was our desire to be as supportive of the legislative process as possible,\u201d and added that the creditors found it \u201cextremely disappointing and perplexing that Prepa has chosen to take this stance.\u201dThey said they remained open to resuming negotiations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Dark Money,\u2019 by Jane Mayer", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Nineteen eighty was a year of hope for conservatives in America, but it was a hope diminished by decades of consistent failure at the grass roots. Republicans hadn\u2019t controlled either chamber of Congress, or a majority in state legislatures, for a quarter-century. Most governors were Democrats, as had been true since 1970. Not only was the Republican Party overmatched at winning elections, but those with the strongest ideological convictions \u2014 \u201cmovement conservatives,\u201d as they liked to call themselves \u2014 were a faint voice even within Republican ranks.But at the end of that year two things happened. One, as we all know, was the election of Ronald Reagan as president. The other was an utterly private event whose significance would not be noticed for years. Charles and David Koch, the enormously rich proprietors of an oil company based in Kansas, decided that they would spend huge amounts of money to elect conservatives at all levels of American government. David Koch ran for vice president on the Libertarian ticket in 1980, but when the campaign was over, he resolved never to seek public office again. That wouldn\u2019t be necessary, he and his brother concluded; they could invest in the campaigns of others, and essentially buy their way to political power.Thirty years later, the midterm elections of 2010 ushered in the political system that the Kochs had spent so many years plotting to bring about. After the voting that year, Republicans dominated state legislatures; they controlled a clear majority of the governorships; they had taken one chamber of Congress and were on their way to winning the other. Perhaps most important, a good many of the Republicans who had won these offices were not middle-of-the-road pragmatists. They were antigovernment libertarians of the Kochs\u2019 own political stripe. The brothers had spent or raised hundreds of millions of dollars to create majorities in their image. They had succeeded. And not merely at the polls: They had helped to finance and organize an interlocking network of think tanks, academic programs and news media outlets that far exceeded anything the liberal opposition could put together.It is this conservative ascendancy that Jane Mayer chronicles in \u201cDark Money.\u201d The book is written in straightforward and largely unemotional prose, but it reads as if conceived in quiet anger. Mayer believes that the Koch brothers and a small number of allied plutocrats have essentially hijacked American democracy, using their money not just to compete with their political adversaries, but to drown them out.A staff writer for The New Yorker, \u00adMayer spent five years working on \u201cDark Money,\u201d which originated with an article on the Koch family she published in the magazine in 2010. Neither Charles nor David Koch agreed to talk to her, and several of the most important figures in their political network were unavailable. But she reached hundreds of sources who did want to talk: longtime conservative campaign operatives, business associates, political opponents and political finance scholars. Some of these sources spoke on the record and some did not, but all in all \u201cDark Money\u201d emerges as an impressively reported and well-documented work.A great deal has already been written about the Koch brothers and the money their network has invested in American politics. The importance of \u201cDark Money\u201d does not flow from any explosive new revelation, but from its scope and perspective. Mayer writes of the early lives of the key players, the origin of their fortunes, their personal obsessions and quirks, and the role the operation was able to carve out. It is not easy to uncover the inner workings of an essentially secretive political establishment. Mayer has come as close to doing it as anyone is likely to come anytime soon.What the Kochs and their allies have created, in her view, is a private political bank capable of bestowing unlimited amounts of money on favored candidates, and doing it with virtually no disclosure of its source. They have established a Republican Party in which donors, not elected officials, are in charge. In 2011, when House Speaker John Boehner was desperate for Republican votes to prevent the government from defaulting on its debt, he went to see David Koch in Manhattan to plead for help. \u201cIt had taken years,\u201d Mayer writes, but the brothers \u201cwere becoming a rival center of power to the Republican establishment.\u201d\u201cDark Money\u201d relates the personal story of the Koch family in considerable detail \u2014 an engineer father who made a fortune building oil refineries, then spent the last years of his life as an angry member of the John Birch Society; an early conversion by Charles and David Koch to the radical libertarian economics of Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig von Mises; a web of sibling rivalry among all four of the family\u2019s brothers, ending in painful legal confrontations that dragged on for years.Mayer also sheds some useful light on the co-conspirators who helped the Kochs build a movement that spread far beyond electoral politics. Richard Mellon Scaife, heir to the Mellon banking fortune and to much of the wealth of Gulf Oil, was the financial presence behind the Heritage Foundation. John M. Olin, whose family chemical corporation was a major beneficiary of federal weapons procurement, focused on the creation of faculty positions for conservatives at prestigious university campuses. The Bradley brothers, Harry and Lynde, used proceeds from the merger of their family electronics firm with Rockwell International to underwrite a whole array of publishing and research ventures.But the main goal was to win elections, and in that crusade the Kochs and their allies had the benefit of federal laws that they played no part in promulgating. One was the section of the Internal Revenue Code that allows for 501(c)(4) organizations, ostensibly devoted to \u201csocial welfare\u201d but permitted to engage in electoral politics in an essentially unregulated way. A 501(c)(4) is not required to disclose the sources of its funding, and that provision alone has brought in huge amounts of money from donors eager to contribute but reluctant to identify themselves. The 501(c)(4) loophole has been around since the early 20th century, but it was given new vigor in 2010 by the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision, which removed virtually all limits on corporate campaign funding and fostered its anonymity.What were all these organizations and donors promoting, other than the election of Republican candidates to office? Free-market orthodoxy, to start with. \u201cMarket principles have changed my life,\u201d Charles Koch declared in the 1990s, \u201cand guide everything I do.\u201d That seems as true in 2016 as it was when he said it. Closely related to free-market faith is the hatred of regulation, federal, state or local. \u201cWe should not cave in the moment a regulator sets foot on our doorstep,\u201d Charles once wrote. \u201cDo not cooperate voluntarily; instead, resist wherever and to whatever extent you legally can.\u201dThis ideology helps to explain one of the most important Koch crusades of recent years: the fight to prevent action against climate change. The Koch-sponsored advocacy group Americans for Prosperity has been at the forefront of climate-change opposition over the past decade. When the Republicans took over the House of Representatives in 2011, Americans for Prosperity lobbied lawmakers to support a \u201cno climate tax\u201d pledge, and by the time Congress convened that year, 156 House and Senate members had signed on.As ferocious as they have been in defense of free-market ideas, the Koch brothers are also acting out of tangible self-interest, Mayer argues. The Kochs made their money in the carbon business; they have diversified far beyond it over the years, but a stiff tax on carbon could have a significant impact on their bottom line. Mayer reports that an E.P.A. database identified Koch Industries in 2012 as the single biggest producer of toxic waste in the United States. The company has been in and out of federal court over the years as defendants in cases alleging careless and sometimes lethal flouting of clean-air and clear-water requirements. Several have paid tens of millions in fines to settle these cases. It is plausible that the Kochs and some members of their network are participating in politics largely to keep their fortunes intact. \u201cThey said they were driven by principle,\u201d Mayer writes of the Koch-led network, \u201cbut their positions dovetailed seamlessly with their personal financial interests.\u201dShe makes a formidable argument, though it is a circumstantial one. As is always true with political money, there is no easy way to delineate where ideology ends and where self-interest and corruption begin. The founding fathers were accused by some historians of writing the Constitution to protect their landed wealth. Subsequent research largely disproved that allegation. Mark Hanna\u2019s close-knit network of manufacturers and railroad tycoons invested huge sums at the start of the 20th century to procure high tariffs and business-friendly Republican governments; they largely got what they paid for. When he was House speaker in the 1950s, Sam Rayburn \u2014 according to Tip O\u2019Neill \u2014 kept large bundles of oil company cash in his office desk and doled it out to secure the loyalty of favored Democrats. Loose and unregulated campaign cash from wealthy donors was the dark money that made \u00adWatergate possible.One is tempted to say that since plutocrats have been pulling political levers since the start of the American Republic, the current concentration of ideology, money and power is not a uniquely dangerous development. But that may be to dismiss Mayer\u2019s warnings too quickly. Hanna bought the votes of politicians, but he didn\u2019t have a collection of think tanks, a nationwide network of pressure groups or a collection of subsidized university programs to propagandize on his behalf. The business lobbies of the postwar years knew what they wanted and generally got it, but theirs was a limited agenda that stuck to a relatively narrow set of demands. And for parts of the past century, wealthy players were restrained, however imperfectly, by campaign finance laws aimed at keeping the process open and aboveboard. Sinister as much of the system was, one could entertain the idea that a new regulatory regime might someday bring it under greater public scrutiny and control. In the aftermath of the Citizens United decision, that no longer seems a realistic prospect. This alone may make the indignities that Mayer writes about a departure from the ones that have gone before.DARK MONEYThe Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind the Rise of the Radical Right By Jane Mayer449 pp. Doubleday. $29.95.Alan Ehrenhalt is a senior editor of Governing magazine and the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Great Inversion and the Future of the American City.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He\n                                        was educated at the Peck School, Berkshire School, Rice University, Texas A&M and graduated with an MBA from Wharton (University of Pennsylvania) in 1949. Prior to attending Wharton, Jerry served in the US Navy\n                                        as a Lieutenant JG on USS La Porte, and later served on the staff of Admiral Louis Denfeld (Chief of Naval Operations) in Washington, DC. Jerry began his investment career at Equitable Securities in Houston before\n                                        joining the New York brokerage firm of Cyrus J. Lawrence & Sons in 1952, where he became their youngest partner. In 1961 Jerry created Eppler & Company as a private, independent advisory and investment firm\n                                        focused on managing portfolio assets for a number of family groups including the Bass and Richardson families of Wichita Falls, the Harrington family of Amarillo, the Murchison family of Dallas, and the Vickers\n                                        family of Wichita and Denver. Eppler & Company advised its clients on both control and non-control investments in numerous public and private companies, including venture capital investments, leveraged buyouts\n                                        and proxy contests as an activist investor in an era when many of these investment strategies were not widely deployed. Through his work at Eppler & Company, Jerry was active in the management and governance\n                                        of some of America&aposs major companies. In the transportation sector, he played a role in the establishment of the New York Central Railroad and later served as a director of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul\n                                        and Pacific Railroad (1965-1969). In addition, Jerry helped to found US Airways through the acquisition of regional carriers including Mohawk Airlines and Lake Central Airlines. Jerry was a longstanding director\n                                        of Swift & Company and had an important role in the transformation of Swift into Esmark, Inc. between 1965 - 1990, creating one of America&aposs leading conglomerates with a business portfolio that included:\n                                        Swift Meats, International Playtex, Avis Rent a Car, Vickers Energy and Trans Ocean Oil.

{"Headline": "Robo-Advisers for Investors Are Not One-Size-Fits-All", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "Supported byYour MoneyThe robo-advisers have quickly attracted a growing number of investors. They have also caught the attention of established financial players. Digitally driven investment providers were estimated to hold $53 billion at the end of 2015, according to the Aite Group. That\u2019s up from $2 billion in 2013, though at least half of the growth is from existing firms like Vanguard. And it\u2019s still a small fraction of the $20 trillion in retail investors\u2019 total investable assets.But the services can vary greatly in their overall approach. Some view your financial life more holistically, taking into account money in, say, a 401(k) held elsewhere. And while the actual investment recommendations should be relatively easy, the suggested portfolios differ widely enough to warrant closer inspection.What really matters is whether investors are comfortable sticking with a particular recommendation when the markets sour. There could be a significant difference in how much risk the robots believe you can afford to take \u2014 and what your stomach can truly handle.These companies offer help picking and rebalancing index and exchange-traded funds or similar investments, and none charge more than about 0.5 percent of your assets each year for the privilege.Betterment, an automated advisory service introduced in 2010 that manages $3.2 billion, said less than half of 1 percent of its 135,000 customers made a change to their portfolios over the last two weeks.But upon closer inspection, some of the robo-advisers\u2019 portfolios appeared aggressive, at least from the perspective of one personal finance reporter. Some of the initial recommendations strayed far from the 65 percent in stocks that I\u2019m comfortably invested in now, an allocation decided upon after consulting with a certified financial planner who charged a flat fee for her advice.One robo-adviser initially suggested a 90 percent stock allocation, which, in theory, younger and midcareer investors may be able to handle because their portfolios still have many years to recover from a precipitous decline. But it could be a rocky ride.Here\u2019s a closer look inside two of the larger start-ups, as well as two other established players that introduced automated services over the last year:The service illustrates how likely you are to meet goals like achieving a certain annual income in retirement. The portfolios are what you\u2019d expect from Vanguard: broad diversification across all asset classes. It suggests that 50-year-olds with a moderate risk tolerance invest 70 percent of their money in stock funds and another 30 percent in well-diversified bond funds.Instead of focusing solely on performance, it shows how well investors are doing relative to their goals. The tool will alert investors when they fall off track, and suggest how to address the issue. Maybe, it\u2019s saving $30 more each month, or making a one-time contribution. \u201cI think that really helps people keep calm,\u201d said Naureen Hassan, an executive vice president of Schwab.For now, the tool is relatively one-dimensional: It enables investors to calculate how their portfolio is likely to grow in the future if they invest a lump sum or save a certain amount each month. Schwab plans to make its service more comprehensive by aggregating information on accounts held outside the firm.The portfolio of a 50-year-old with a moderate risk tolerance would have 8.5 percent in cash, and 21 percent in bonds. But that includes 8 percent in high-yield debt and 7 percent in an emerging markets bond fund.\u201cBottom line, while this portfolio will have a decent expected return,\u201d said Mr. Bernstein, who reviewed several of the robo-adviser portfolios, \u201ca lot of its owners are going to be surprised about how it lives up to \u2018moderate risk.\u2019\u201dThe investment gurus at Schwab argued that all investments had trade-offs and that these bonds, for example, were less sensitive to rising interest rates. Over the long run, they said, they were confident these bonds would be less volatile than stocks.Perhaps. But before selecting an investment mix at any of these services, investors should consider how a particular portfolio might feel if this latest downturn \u2014 or the next one \u2014 were to become a replay of 2008 and 2009.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated part of the name of Schwab\u2019s robo-adviser service.

Philanthropists and political donors who poured hundreds of millions of dollars into think tanks, political organizations and scholarships, they helped win acceptance for anti-government and anti-tax policies that would protect their businesses and personal fortunes, she writes, all under the guise of promoting the public interest.The Kochs, the Scaifes, the Bradleys and the DeVos family of Michigan \u201cwere among a small, rarefied group of hugely wealthy, archconservative families that for decades poured money, often with little public disclosure, into influencing how the Americans thought and voted,\u201d the book says.\u201cDark Money\u201d also contains revelations from a private history of the Kochs commissioned by David\u2019s twin brother, William, during a lengthy legal battle with Charles and David over control of Koch Industries.Ms. Mayer describes a sealed 1982 deposition in which William Koch recalled participating in an attempt by Charles and David to blackmail their fourth and eldest brother, Frederick, into relinquishing any claim to the family business by threatening to tell their father that he was gay.An earlier version of a capsule summary for this article misspelled the surname of the author of a new book about the history of the Koch family.

{"Headline": "Ted Cruz Didn\u2019t Report Goldman Sachs Loan in a Senate Race", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported by\u201cSweetheart, I\u2019d like us to liquidate our entire net worth, liquid net worth, and put it into the campaign,\u201d he says he told his wife, Heidi, who readily agreed.A review of personal financial disclosures that Mr. Cruz filed later with the Senate does not find a liquidation of assets that would have accounted for all the money he spent on his campaign. What it does show, however, is that in the first half of 2012, Ted and Heidi Cruz obtained the low-interest loan from Goldman Sachs, as well as another one from Citibank. The loans totaled as much as $750,000 and eventually increased to a maximum of $1 million before being paid down later that year. There is no explanation of their purpose.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.A spokeswoman for Mr. Cruz\u2019s presidential campaign, Catherine Frazier, acknowledged that the loan from Goldman Sachs, drawn against the value of the Cruzes\u2019 brokerage account, was a source of money for the Senate race. Ms. Frazier added that Mr. Cruz also sold stocks and liquidated savings, but she did not address whether the Citibank loan was used.The failure to report the Goldman Sachs loan, for as much as $500,000, was \u201cinadvertent,\u201d she said, adding that the campaign would file corrected reports as necessary. Ms. Frazier said there had been no attempt to hide anything.\u201cThese transactions have been reported in one way or another on his many public financial disclosures and the Senate campaign\u2019s F.E.C. filings,\u201d she said.Kenneth A. Gross, a former election commission lawyer who specializes in campaign finance law, said that listing a bank loan in an annual Senate ethics report \u2014 which deals only with personal finances \u2014 would not satisfy the requirement that it be promptly disclosed to election officials during a campaign.\u201cThey\u2019re two different reporting regimes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe law says if you get a loan for the purpose of funding a campaign, you have to show the original source of the loan, the terms of the loan and you even have to provide a copy of the loan document to the Federal Election Commission.\u201dThere would have been nothing improper about Mr. Cruz obtaining bank loans for his campaign, as long as they were disclosed. But such a disclosure might have conveyed the wrong impression for his candidacy.Mr. Cruz, a conservative former Texas solicitor general, was campaigning as a populist firebrand who criticized Wall Street bailouts and the influence of big banks in Washington. It is a theme he has carried into his bid for the Republican nomination for president.History suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.Earlier this year, when asked about the political clout of Goldman Sachs in particular, he replied, \u201cLike many other players on Wall Street and big business, they seek out and get special favors from government.\u201dIn recounting the decision to put all of their savings into the campaign, Mr. Cruz said in the 2013 Times interview that Mrs. Cruz immediately agreed to his proposal, even though he was trailing in the polls and still viewed as a long shot against Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, who spent $24 million of his own money on the race.\u201cWhat astonished me, then and now, was Heidi within 60 seconds said, \u2018Absolutely,\u2019 with no hesitation,\u201d Mr. Cruz said.Mrs. Cruz, who is on leave as a managing director at Goldman Sachs, later suggested that the reality was more complicated. She told Politico in 2014 that she thought they should apply \u201ccommon investment sense\u201d and not use their own money for the campaign \u201cunless it made the difference\u201d in winning. The article did not mention anything about loans from banks.The money from the Cruzes allowed his campaign to keep running television ads in the period preceding the primary election, including a $300,000 ad buy that highlighted the story of Mr. Cruz\u2019s father\u2019s flight from Cuba in the 1950s after opposing the Batista regime. Mr. Cruz earned enough votes in the primary to qualify for a runoff, where he defeated Mr. Dewhurst and went on to win the general election.The ethics reports that candidates file with the Senate require them to list all assets they held at the close of the year or that generated income during the year. Assets are reported in broad categories of value, such as $1,001 to $15,000 and $100,001 to $250,000.Mr. Cruz\u2019s filings show that at the close of 2011, he and his wife had cash and securities in bank, brokerage and retirement accounts worth $1.3 million to $3.4 million. They also had mortgages and a loan against Mr. Cruz\u2019s partnership equity in his law firm. During 2012, they sold securities worth $82,000 to $355,000, and the value of other holdings was reduced by, at most, $155,000.However, they also added a money-market account with $250,000 to $500,000 in it, and the value of other holdings increased by as much as $435,000. All told, the value of their cash and securities in 2012 saw a net increase of as much as $400,000 \u2014 even as the Cruzes were supposedly liquidating everything to finance Mr. Cruz\u2019s Senate campaign.The biggest change in the Cruzes\u2019 finances in 2012 was the addition of the two bank loans, each valued at $250,000 to $500,000, during the first half of the year. One was a margin loan from Goldman Sachs. Margin loans, which are secured by holdings in a brokerage account, are often used to buy more stocks, but can be obtained for almost any purpose.The other loan was a line of credit from Citibank. Even if the Citibank loan did not go directly into the Senate campaign, it could have freed up other assets for that purpose. While the Cruzes were well paid \u2014 he made more than $1 million a year as a law partner, and she earned a six-figure income as an executive in Goldman Sachs\u2019s Houston office \u2014 they also had big bills, including mortgage payments and full-time child care.Both loans had floating interest rates around 3 percent, according to Mr. Cruz\u2019s Senate disclosures, which appear to be generally in line with rates available to wealthy borrowers at that time.During the remainder of 2012, the Cruz campaign repaid Mr. Cruz for about half of the money he lent. His Senate disclosures show that he and his wife paid off the Citibank loan that same year. As for the Goldman Sachs loan, it remains outstanding, though the balance has been reduced to between $50,000 and $100,000.The federal guide to campaign finance reporting for congressional candidates makes it clear that if the original source of money for a candidate\u2019s personal loan was a margin loan or a line of credit, it must be disclosed.\u201cBank loans to candidates and loans derived from advances on a candidate\u2019s brokerage accounts, credit cards, home equity line of credit, or other lines of credit obtained for use in connection with his or her campaign must be reported by the committee,\u201d according to the guide.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hope for L.G.B.T. Rights in India", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorBENGALURU, India \u2014 The green benches of the lower house of India\u2019s Parliament were mostly empty on the afternoon of Dec. 18. It was late in the winter session. An earnest but unhurried debate was taking place between Nishikant Dubey, a member of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, and Shashi Tharoor, a writer, former diplomat and opposition M.P., who was introducing a bill.It wasn\u2019t until the vote was called, and a sudden clamor filled the hall, that the significance of the law became apparent: It proposed to decriminalize gay sex. Dozing M.P.s jumped to their feet and barked across the room. One voice was heard jeering, \u201cTharoor only needs this bill for himself!\u201dThe final tally was 24 votes in favor and 71 votes against, and the bill was sent back to Mr. Tharoor\u2019s drafting table. Yet the debate itself was a hopeful development: Two years after sexual minorities in India were dealt a terrible setback by the Supreme Court, more elected politicians are stepping up for L.G.B.T. rights.Unlike the courts, the politicians speak for constituents. Their statements come from and travel back to the hundreds of thousands of voters they represent \u2014 a national conversation that could do more than any learned court ruling to stop prejudice against L.G.B.T. Indians.Mr. Tharoor intends to change Section 377 of India\u2019s penal code, a Victorian-era provision that punishes \u201cwhoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal\u201d with life imprisonment. Convictions are rare, but the law is sometimes used to harass and blackmail gay men and transgenders.In a country where every kind of sexual preference permeates cultural heritage and lived reality, Section 377 is both antiquated and incongruous. Mr. Tharoor\u2019s bill proposed to rewrite the provision, penalizing only intercourse with minors and nonconsensual sex.For many years, the campaign against Section 377 focused on challenging the provision in court. And the strategy seemed to be succeeding: In 2009, an enlightened ruling from the Delhi High Court found that the clause violated the Constitution\u2019s promise of equality.But on Dec. 11, 2013, a panel of the Supreme Court reversed that decision, adopting an unusual position on judicial restraint. It was a bewildering abdication of the court\u2019s role as a guardian of civil rights, and devastating news for L.G.B.T. activists.A few days later, I joined an angry gathering on the steps of the town hall in Bengaluru, the city at the heart of India\u2019s technology industry. Just one year earlier, the local Pride March had ended on these stairs \u2014 an especially colorful and buoyant parade, with veteran participants and fearless trans-folk joined by giggling tech geeks hoisting banners branded by Google and Goldman Sachs. After the Supreme Court decision, however, the protesters wore black, and chanted, \u201cIf you\u2019re criminal and you know it, clap your hands!\u201d The occasion was called the Day of Rage.Soon, though, the insurgent anger mixed with astonishment at the outpouring of solidarity. On Twitter, even self-described \u201cHindu far/extreme-right-winger patriot-capitalist-conspicuous-consumers\u201d called for Section 377 to be revised by executive ordinance. The evening of the protest, the prime-time news shows were thundering against the Supreme Court decision, and inviting politicians to state their positions on it.Through the gloom there was a glimmer of consolation: The action had just shifted out of the courts and into popular politics.The first formal statement against the ruling came from the maverick Aam Aadmi Party, which had recently captivated the urban middle class with its campaign against corruption and politics-as-usual. It was followed by the Congress Party. Rahul Gandhi, the Congress\u2019s vice-president, said that sexual preferences \u201cshould be left to individuals\u201d \u2014 a mild but unprecedented statement from a leader of India\u2019s then-ruling party.That declaration pushed the Congress\u2019 main rival, the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party, to endorse the Supreme Court verdict. The B.J.P. won the 2014 general election, and today, after a year and a half in power, its leaders have softened their position on L.G.B.T. rights. At a literary festival in November, Arun Jaitley, the minister of finance conceded, \u201cWhen millions of people the world over have alternative sexual preferences, it is too late in the day to propound a view that they should be jailed.\u201dSection 377 remains for now, and as Mr. Tharoor learned, India\u2019s dysfunctional Parliament is still some way from changing it. But the gradual accretion of support for reform from politicians of various persuasions is creating what a wise judicial decision might well have pre-empted: a national conversation about accepting and respecting different sexual lifestyles.A progressive Supreme Court ruling would have revised the law all at once, but it would have done relatively little to change the social stigma and institutional hostility faced by sexual minorities. When major political parties affirm their support for L.G.B.T. Indians, it sends a different kind of writ to both their supporters and officials under their control.In the spring, Mr. Tharoor will reintroduce his bill. He hopes that a full discussion in Parliament will be an opportunity to broadcast that L.G.B.T. rights are \u201cnot about sex but about freedom.\u201d The chances of the bill\u2019s passing are still slim, at least until the B.J.P.\u2019s more liberal voices prevail over the bigoted ones. Indian politicians can be expected to prevaricate, pass the buck or pander to religious conservatives in their base.But some elected politicians have already begun to grapple with their responsibility toward sexual minorities, and thanks to the parallel efforts of activists, a small but growing legislative agenda for queer rights has become evident. A new bill protecting the rights of transgenders has passed in the upper house of Parliament and will be presented in the lower house this year. Last January, Madhu Bai Kinnar was elected mayor of Raigarh \u2014 the first transgender elected to run any Indian city.Unlike in the United States, where L.G.B.T. rights are an issue too hot for many politicians to touch, in India homophobia is diffuse, and hardly features in our culture wars. And so the prospect grows brighter that Section 377 will eventually be changed through legislation \u2014 through a process that appeals not just to India\u2019s Constitution, but to its society as well.Raghu Karnad is the author of \u201cFarthest Field: An Indian Story of the Second World War\u201d and a contributing editor at TheWire.in.Advertisement"}

There are practical considerations, as well. I have a query in to the Fish and Wildlife Service asking what operations and scientific research are being disrupted by this crime and will provide an update.Every one of us has a constitutional right to protest, to speak our minds. But we don\u2019t have a constitutional right to use force and violence and to threaten force and violence on others. And so it is our hope that the protesters there will stand down peaceably, that there will not be a violent confrontation.I would add one more thing to your list of solutions:We met many times over the course of three years and much to everybody\u2019s surprise emerged with a consensus, collaborative approach that includes major initiatives on both the refuge and surrounding ranch lands. It is a plan that tries to respect both the ecology and the economics of the region. The groups involved have remained actively engaged in implementing the plan. It includes one of the largest wetland restoration efforts ever undertaken.On a landscape rife with tremendous challenges, where consensus and collaboration are being accomplished, we need to double down.This should be a call to action for the community, non-governmental stakeholders, and local, state, and especially federal agencies to invest deeply in the Malheur effort. It is a critically important opportunity, but it is fragile and, as current events amply demonstrate, it needs to succeed.The real tragedy would be if these out-of-state self-declared militias were able to leave the impression that Malheur is a flashpoint for conflict, when in fact it should be seen as an incredible opportunity for collaboration for both the ecology and the economy of the region.My hope is that the legacy of this illegal occupation will be a renewed commitment to that collaboration.By NANCY LANGSTONThe West won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be won by ideologues brandishing guns and seizing government property.Updated, Jan. 7, 9:17 a.m. | I for one am a westerner sick to death of you welfare queens and cheats living off of BLM land, illegally gutting our wilderness and our wildlife.

{"Headline": "Mandatory Union Fees Getting Hard Look by Supreme Court", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "Supported byFRESNO, Calif. \u2014 Harlan Elrich is a high school teacher in California, and that means he must pay about $970 a year to a labor union. He teaches math, and he said the system did not add up.\u201cI get to choose what movie I want to go see,\u201d Mr. Elrich said. \u201cI get to choose what church I want to go to. I get to choose what gym I want to join.\u201dHe should have the same choice, he said, about whether to support a union.Mr. Elrich and nine other California teachers have sued the union, saying that they are being forced to pay to support positions with which they disagree, in violation of the First Amendment. Their lawsuit, if it is successful, will be the culmination of a decades-long legal campaign to undermine public unions.\u201cBecause a public-sector union takes many positions during collective bargaining that have powerful political and civic consequences, the compulsory fees constitute a form of compelled speech and association that imposes a significant impingement on First Amendment rights,\u201d Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote for the majority in 2012 in one of the cases. Inviting a new legal challenge, he wrote, \u201cWe do not revisit today whether the court\u2019s former cases have given adequate recognition to the critical First Amendment rights at stake.\u201dThe new case is that challenge. The court\u2019s decision, expected by June, will affect millions of government workers of all kinds and may deal a sharp financial and political blow to public unions. (The ruling is unlikely to have a direct impact on unionized employees of private businesses, as the First Amendment restricts government action and not private conduct.)\u201cIt\u2019s scary,\u201d said Steve Rosenthal, a former A.F.L.-C.I.O. political director, noting that \u201cmost of the growth in the labor movement over the last few decades has been in the public sector.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s part of a concerted effort trying to dismantle the labor movement and to weaken workers\u2019 rights in this country,\u201d he added. \u201cAt the same time that we are facing a near crisis in the elimination of the middle class, people are also trying to destroy one of the main vehicles to the middle class.\u201dLimiting the power of public unions has long been a goal of conservative groups, and some California teachers detected a political agenda in Mr. Elrich\u2019s suit, which was organized by the Center for Individual Rights, a libertarian group partly financed by conservative foundations.\u201cIt\u2019s corporate special interests that are backing this,\u201d said Reagan Duncan, a first-grade teacher in Vista, Calif. The core issue in the case is not free speech but basic fairness, she said, arguing that Mr. Elrich and the other plaintiffs sought to take a free ride on the union\u2019s work, which includes negotiating for higher wages and better benefits for all workers.\u201cIt\u2019s not right for some people to get union benefits for free while others have to pay,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I went to a grocery store, I wouldn\u2019t walk out with my groceries and not pay while the guy behind me had to pay for my groceries and his groceries.\u201dMr. Elrich said he could do fine without the union\u2019s help. \u201cI can negotiate for myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a good teacher, highly respected, and I can go anywhere.\u201dUnder California law, which is similar to ones in more than 20 other states, public employees who choose not to join unions must pay a \u201cfair-share service fee,\u201d also known as an agency fee, which is typically equivalent to members\u2019 dues. The fees, the law says, are meant to pay for collective bargaining activities, including \u201cthe cost of lobbying activities.\u201dWhat crossed a constitutional line, though, he added, was forcing objecting workers to pay for \u201cideological activities unrelated to collective bargaining.\u201dMr. Erlich said he got a refund of \u201cbetween $350 and $400 a year\u201d based on the union\u2019s determination of what part of its activities were political. But he and the other plaintiffs say that everything the union does in negotiating with the government is political and that the Abood decision should be overruled.\u201cYet California and more than 20 other states,\u201d the brief continued, \u201ccompel millions of public employees to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to fund a very specific viewpoint on these pressing public questions.\u201dKaren Cuen, an elementary school music teacher in Chino Hills, Calif., and a plaintiff in the suit, gave an example. \u201cI disagree with seniority-based layoffs, seniority-based school assignments,\u201d she said.Ms. Duncan, the first-grade teacher and union supporter, said the line between politics and collective bargaining was clear. \u201cI do absolutely understand not wanting your money going to actual political campaigning,\u201d she said.\u201cBut when you think of politics, you think of political campaigns like school board races and ballot propositions,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s political to care about working conditions as far as class size or your benefits.\u201d\u201cThe typical worker would surely perceive a significant difference between, on the one hand, contributing to a union\u2019s legal and research costs to develop a collective-bargaining proposal for his own unit, and, on the other hand, making a political contribution to a union-favored candidate for governor,\u201d Mr. Verrilli wrote.There is no serious dispute that allowing workers to choose to pay nothing to the unions representing them would cause at least some workers to opt out, weakening unions\u2019 financial clout.\u201cI am sure most will continue to pay their dues,\u201d said Vincent Variale, a lieutenant in the New York City Fire Department\u2019s emergency medical services division and a union official. \u201cBut we live paycheck to paycheck. It\u2019s human nature that if you can get something for free, you may take advantage of that. So there may be some people who do that.\u201dThe plaintiffs were more sanguine.\u201cThey might lose 10 percent, maybe 15 tops,\u201d Mr. Elrich said. \u201cBut I think there\u2019s enough people in the schools that are supportive of the unions that they would still be in the union.\u201dMs. Cuen said the unions might need to improve to keep their members.\u201cIf they\u2019re worried about not getting forced money from everyone, what does that say about their product?\u201d she asked. \u201cSo maybe if we win the case and they\u2019re worried about people leaving in droves, they might need to improve their product and make it a little more user-friendly.\u201dIn dissent in the 5-to-4 decision, which divided along ideological lines, Justice Elena Kagan suggested that her side had dodged a bullet. \u201cReaders of today\u2019s decision,\u201d she wrote, \u201cwill know that Abood does not rank on the majority\u2019s top-ten list of favorite precedents \u2014 and that the majority could not restrain itself from saying (and saying and saying) so.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Standout Year for Deals, in Volume and Complexity", "Date": "2016-01-03", "News": "Supported byOf all the ways to describe mergers and acquisitions in 2015, \u201cplain vanilla\u201d is not one of them.Last year was one for the record books, generating $4.7 trillion in announced deals, with the highest percentage ever derived from those valued at more than $5 billion, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters.Boardrooms were flooded with so much confidence that executives were willing to stretch beyond the textbook-style acquisition \u2014 Company A buys Company B \u2014 to get deals done. Financing was cheap because of low interest rates and growth was generally slow, so colossal companies sought purchases as a way to expand.That shift coincided with a transformation among activist investors, many of whom recommended sweeping transactions instead of the traditional stock buyback or board seat for themselves. Pressure from activists, or the potential to become the target of activists, encouraged companies to explore all their options and make moves.\u201cBoards have become much more educated and diligent. They understand the options that are available to them more than any point in my career,\u201d said Vito Sperduto, the head of United States mergers and acquisitions at RBC Capital Markets, who has been in the industry for about 25 years. \u201cAs a result, they\u2019re better able to consider complex transactions, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing more of them.\u201dInvestors also helped open the merger and acquisition floodgates, sending stock prices of the acquiring companies higher when deals were announced. On average, buyers\u2019 shares gained 0.5 percent for deals over $1 billion, according to Thomson Reuters. Traditionally, they have tended to decline.\u201cShareholders have been more receptive to M.&A. transactions because they have provided hope for growth,\u201d said Michael Carr, the global co-head of the mergers and acquisition group at Goldman Sachs. \u201cThis acceptance has given companies the opportunity to find creative ways to generate value.\u201dBut as deals became more complex in the second half of the year, investors became more discerning. In the first half of 2015, 68 percent of announcements lifted the acquirer\u2019s stock; that figure fell to 36 percent in the last six months, according to Thomson Reuters.\u201cThe earlier deals with large, positive investor reactions were some of the most obvious deals to get done, where the synergies were well understood and highly tangible,\u201d said Chris Ventresca, the global co-head of mergers and acquisitions at JPMorgan Chase. \u201cAs some buyers extended beyond their core business lines and/or premiums paid got too high relative to synergies, investors became less comfortable bidding that buyer\u2019s stock up.\u201dPrevious booms were met with more of a playbook. The uptick in 1999 was composed mostly of one sector: technology. In 2007, the surge was the result of enormous leveraged buyouts. Neither of those periods was met with large amounts of structure within deals, bankers and lawyers recall.The deal market surpassed records last year. The $4.7 trillion worth of mergers and acquisitions was a 42 percent increase from 2014, Thomson Reuters data showed. The number of deals conducted last year gained a mere 0.2 percent from 2014, according to the data. That showed how skewed the market was toward bigger deals.Investors started becoming more comfortable with complexity as tax-inversion deals surged over the last few years. Despite a legislative backlash over the tactic \u2014 by which an American company acquires a foreign one and reincorporates abroad to reduce its tax bill \u2014 many investors understood and applauded the strategy.In November, Pfizer agreed to a $152 billion deal with Allergan, the biggest transaction over the last 15 years. Because Allergan, the maker of Botox, is based in Dublin, the deal allowed Pfizer to shed its American citizenship, relocate its headquarters and pay a lower tax rate, especially on cash earned abroad. By all intents, the transaction achieves the same outcome as an inversion, even though Allergan was technically the buyer, despite being much smaller.To make matters more complex, the companies are already considering splitting into two businesses, one focused on faster-growing innovative drugs and another on more-mature treatments. Pfizer said it would decide on the separation by 2018.Some private equity firms opted for private investment in public equities, or PIPEs, in lieu of large leveraged buyouts. Most recently, the private equity firm Cerberus took Avon\u2019s North American unit private while infusing $435 million in equity into the parent company.But all of this complexity can be risky from an execution standpoint. DuPont and Dow have traded lower since news broke of their merger, as investors were concerned about potential pressure on the business from combining their companies and then splitting them up later.There\u2019s also the risk that some of the large deals will not be able to find the concessions necessary to appease regulators or will be thwarted by the Justice Department altogether.For the last several years, regulators have been willing to \u201cpush the envelope a bit more in terms of enforcement,\u201d but it has not slowed down deal activity, said Stephen F. Arcano, a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, who leads the firm\u2019s mergers and acquisitions group in New York.Amid such an abundant year in deal-making, many of the top few companies in each industry have combined. That could cause their competitors to continue to seek unique and creative methods for deals of their own to avoid any regulatory tangle.Most bankers and lawyers agree: 2016 will continue to be busy.\u201cPeople are being more thoughtful in trying to solve the objectives of both sides,\u201d said Robin Rankin, the global co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Credit Suisse. \u201cThey\u2019re willing to do so through structure or governance or other mechanisms, and I think that theme will continue.\u201dAn earlier version of this article included outdated data from Thomson Reuters that misstated how the number of deals in 2015 compared with those in 2014. The number of deals actually rose by 0.2 percent in 2015; they did not decline by 0.5 percent.Advertisement"}

Despite the creation of six million jobs in the last two years, wage growth has been anemic, inequality has worsened and too many Americans lack the agility to adapt to structural changes, including those driven by technological innovations.The success of the post-recession employment recovery and the uneven growth since then can be attributed to a single factor: After Congress\u2019s initial bailouts to stanch the bloodletting in 2008, the burden of economic policy making fell almost entirely on the Federal Reserve.Having succeeded in helping the United States and the rest of the world avert a multiyear depression in 2008-9, the Fed pivoted to using unconventional monetary measures to pursue broader objectives. It did so through a combination of zero interest rates and large-scale purchases of securities to repress market volatility and increase asset prices, hoping to encourage consumption and investment.This worked, to some extent. But it created a sizable wedge between artificially supported asset prices and rather sluggish fundamentals. And ultimately, these tools can buy time only until the political system delivers a broader policy response, which it hasn\u2019t.Now time is running out.Thanks to mounting internal contradictions and operational stress, central banks are increasingly unwilling (like the Federal Reserve) or unable (like the People\u2019s Bank of China, the Bank of Japan and, soon, the European Central Bank) to borrow financial returns from the future. As a result, financial volatility is rising.What follows is up to us. One road \u2014 where continued political dysfunction further sidelines a holistic policy response \u2014 could lead to recession. The other \u2014 a broadening policy response turbocharged by innovation and the productive deployment of corporate cash \u2014 could unleash high and inclusive growth.Assuming that the presidential season clarifies these choices, the campaign\u2019s winner will face another challenge next year: how to deal with a Congress that has failed to handle even its most basic economic functions. Given the outlook for both a shaky global economy and higher financial volatility, the new administration will need to find a way to get Congress to implement measures in four specific areas, some of which already command bipartisan support.The first covers long-overdue structural reforms. Guided by the administration, Congress needs to overhaul a tax system littered with anti-growth provisions, invest more in infrastructure, expand labor-market retraining and modernize our education system. The lack of such reforms, and the insecurity generated, is one main reason the private sector has held back from spending the enormous cash reserves on its balance sheets; encouraging that money to flow into productive activities, rather than share buybacks, would boost the economy.America also needs a more responsive fiscal policy. This means, above all, redirecting resources that essentially subsidize the better-off segments of society, including the excessively low taxation of carried interest and other budgetary measures to help reduce the economic drag that inequality creates through reduced consumer demand.Politicians must also act soon to avert the growing problem of student debt, a major obstacle for the incoming generation of workers. The government needs to increase the transparency of loan disclosures, enlarge steppingstone programs like community colleges, and make it easier for students to pay off their debt without sacrificing career opportunities.Finally, the United States needs to push for critical reforms in the global finance infrastructure. It took embarrassingly long for the world to agree on modest changes in the governance of the International Monetary Fund, largely because Congress was disengaged. The next steps should include further reallocation of voting power from Europe to developing economies, consistent with today\u2019s global economic realities.While I.M.F. reform might seem arcane, it could be vital to averting another global crisis \u2014 without changes, the fund\u2019s credibility will continue to be questioned, especially in the eyes of emerging economies, undermining global policy cooperation and increasing the risk of currency wars and other damaging coordination failures.There\u2019s little that is surprising about most of these items. What is surprising is that too few politicians, let alone presidential candidates, seem to grasp the need for them within the first year or so of the next administration. Even then, the risk of another recession will not be eliminated; that\u2019s the nature of business cycles. The point is to reduce the risk as much as possible, in the United States and abroad \u2014 and to lay the groundwork for high long-term and inclusive growth.Mohamed A.

{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump Voters Share Anger, but Direct It Differently", "Date": "2016-01-30", "News": "Supported byDES MOINES \u2014 They are angry at a political system they see as rigged. They feel squeezed by immigration, or the power of big banks. They sense that America is heading in the wrong direction, but emphatically believe only their candidate has the strength and vision to change things.The voters driving two of the more remarkable movements of this election cycle \u2014 for Donald J. Trump and Senator Bernie Sanders \u2014 share striking similarities. Both groups are heavily white, more male than female, and both are fueled partly by people who, in interviews, express distrust of their parties and the other candidates, especially Hillary Clinton.Yet there was also palpable enthusiasm for their candidate and hopefulness about the future he represented. They believe that only their candidate can fix a broken system because he is not beholden to it; neither has a \u201csuper PAC\u201d for big donors to pour money into.Many in both groups said they had never felt so strongly about a political figure before.\u201cHe stands for everything I believe in,\u201d said Alex Curtis, 19, who traveled six hours from Nebraska to hear Mr. Sanders speak last Sunday in Fayette, Iowa. \u201cHe\u2019s going to restore the American dream and bring class mobility.\u201dSaid Toby Richards, 50, a farmer from Knoxville, Iowa: \u201cIt\u2019s so refreshing to have someone who\u2019s not being bought, and Trump\u2019s not being bought. What he says now can\u2019t be swayed by money.\u201dThe two movements have significant differences: Mr. Trump attracts support across a wide spectrum of demographic groups, but is strongest among Americans without a college degree (eight of 10 Trump supporters do not have one) and those with lower incomes, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll in December.Mr. Sanders draws strong backing from younger voters and self-identified liberals, and 43 percent of Sanders backers are at least college graduates, the same survey showed.\u201cThey\u2019re younger, they\u2019re proud of being liberals, and they like Senator Sanders personally,\u201d said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll.Trump and Sanders voters are the likeliest among their parties to be \u201cangry\u201d at Washington, according to the Times/CBS News poll, with 52 percent of Trump backers and 30 percent of Sanders backers identifying that way.Anger has risen steadily since 2010 among both Democrats and Republicans, according to polling conducted by The Times and CBS News. Republicans are more likely than Democrats to say they are angry, and whites are more likely than African-Americans to say they are angry. But the rates for all are going up, and their anger appears to be one factor sweeping Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders from the relative margins to the top of many polls.About 85 miles away, Esther Toney, 71, a retired prison guard from Collins, returned from a Trump rally in Ames fired up. \u201cOh, I\u2019m very angry,\u201d said Ms. Toney, who comes from a family of Democrats. \u201cI\u2019m extremely angry. We\u2019ve got politicians that are just there for their own gain. They should be thinking about how they can make our lives better. And they don\u2019t. They vote on things to support their PACs or whoever gave them money.\u201dThe targets of their anger diverge. Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters directed their wrath toward career politicians, unlawful immigrants, terrorists and people who they said were taking advantage of welfare. Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters assailed big banks and economic inequality.Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters tended to blame the campaign finance system for Washington dysfunction; Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters blamed the politicians who they said cared only about donations.\u201cLook at our health care,\u201d said Sean Bolton, 42, of Norwalk, a Trump supporter who once voted for Barack Obama because of similar promises of independence. \u201cWho do you think wrote those laws? I guarantee it was the insurance companies and drug manufacturers of the world.\u201dAnd while people in both groups express criticism of Mrs. Clinton, it is for different reasons: Supporters of Mr. Sanders find her dishonest; fans of Mr. Trump worry she would continue the policies of President Obama, which they oppose.The two candidates have not shied from appeals to anger. Mr. Trump said recently that he \u201cwill gladly accept the mantle of anger.\u201dA look at the latest results for Iowa and New Hampshire, and how this year compares to previous election seasons.Even as he said he would compete to attract Trump voters, Mr. Sanders distinguished his message from Mr. Trump\u2019s, saying the Republican candidate was \u201cusing it to scapegoat minorities.\u201d Mr. Trump said he would cool his tone once the campaign battles were over.A big question for both parties is whether the energy generated by the Trump and Sanders movements will be enough to lift them over more traditional contenders, like Mrs. Clinton on the Democratic side or Senator Ted Cruz for the Republicans. And beyond that, will these voters, if Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump do not prevail, stay involved into the fall?In many ways the appeal that the two men have does not seem easily transferable. Supporters are drawn to what they see as their independence, and a lack of pandering.Brad Nelson, 50, who works the overnight shift as manager at a chain of convenience stores in Des Moines, said that he had last turned out for a caucus to support Ronald Reagan in 1980 but that he planned to do so this year, probably for Mr. Trump or Mr. Cruz.Mr. Nelson voiced a litany of irritations: people on welfare who don\u2019t want to work, immigrants taking jobs, the culture of complaint.\u201cIt makes me angry that this is how the country is,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter 200 years we have to be politically correct? We can\u2019t say the Pledge of Allegiance?\u201dBut his main grievance was against the system. \u201cI don\u2019t think you get voted into office \u2014 I think it\u2019s who\u2019s paying the bills that gets people into office,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been more involved or listened to the debates like this year.\u201dWhat drew him to Mr. Trump, he said, was his independence, which he summed up as: \u201cWhat I say is what I do. Nobody else tells me differently.\u201dEach side views its candidate as a little raw and, as a result, uniquely able to channel this election\u2019s frustrations and resentments toward real and productive change.Justin Holihan, 31, of Ames, a paramedic who supports Mr. Sanders, said he feared that growing economic inequality might pitch the country toward either revolution or a police state. \u201cI make $18.50 an hour, and I need to work 50 to 60 hours a week in order to pay my bills,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine how someone making minimum wage can.\u201dMr. Holihan, who previously voted for George W. Bush and Mr. Obama, walks with a limp from a ski injury; his insurance company cut off payments for physical therapy, he said, and he cannot afford more treatments until he pays the bills for the sessions he has already had.He did not want to see neighbors rising up with pitchforks, Mr. Holihan said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m hoping somebody like Bernie Sanders gets elected and can help solve some of these issues before we get pushed to that step,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause people are angry.\u201dMegan Thee-Brenan contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Gets Set for a Long Slog Against Bernie Sanders", "Date": "2016-01-18", "News": "Supported byFacing a tougher than expected challenge from Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign is preparing for a primary fight that could stretch into late April or early May and require a sprawling field operation in states and territories from Pennsylvania to Guam.With the Iowa caucuses in two weeks and Mr. Sanders\u2019s insurgent candidacy chipping away at Mrs. Clinton\u2019s once formidable lead there, Clinton aides are acknowledging that the road to the party\u2019s July convention could be an expensive slog. \u201cRemember, I campaigned all the way into June last time,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told CNN last week.Even though the Clinton team has sought to convey that it has built a national operation, the campaign has invested much of its resources in the Feb. 1 caucuses in Iowa, hoping that a victory there could marginalize Mr. Sanders and set Mrs. Clinton on the path to the nomination. As much as 90 percent of the campaign\u2019s resources are now split between Iowa and the Brooklyn headquarters, according to an estimate provided by a person with direct knowledge of the spending. The campaign denied that figure.The campaign boasted last June, when Mrs. Clinton held her kickoff event on Roosevelt Island in New York, that it had at least one paid staff member in all 50 states. But the effort did not last, and the staff members were soon let go or reassigned. (Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, Robby Mook, said they had been hired as temporary workers to sign up volunteers at the start of the campaign, an effort he said had paid off organizationally.)The focus on Iowa, which still haunts Mrs. Clinton after the stinging upset by Barack Obama there in 2008, has been so intense that even organizers in New Hampshire, which holds its primary on Feb. 9, have complained to the campaign\u2019s leadership that they feel neglected.On a call with supporters last week, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s aides laid out a scenario in which the race against Mr. Sanders stretched through April, a prospect that they said would require about $50 million for a national ground operation and other expenses.For all its institutional advantages, the Clinton campaign lags behind the Sanders operation in deploying paid staff members: For example, Mr. Sanders has campaign workers installed in all 11 of the states that vote on Super Tuesday. Mrs. Clinton does not, and is relying on union volunteers and members of supportive organizations such as Planned Parenthood to help her.\u201cIt would be good to have the momentum story the day after the caucus of \u2018Oh, Bernie won,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, said, \u201cbut it\u2019s really about grinding out the delegates, grind, grind, grind, grind, grind.\u201dAsked about the discrepancy between the campaigns and whether Mrs. Clinton\u2019s team planned to put staff in all of the Super Tuesday states, Marlon Marshall, her director of state campaigns and political engagement, declined to comment specifically, and instead repeated this line three times: \u201cWe\u2019ve had folks in states for a while.\u201dAccording to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.The scramble after the contests in Iowa and New Hampshire will be intense. If Mrs. Clinton fails to win either state and her campaign seems to be stumbling, her donations could dry up. But a loss could also motivate donors who had viewed her nomination as a foregone conclusion.Even if Mrs. Clinton wins in Iowa, where she maintains a slight lead in most polls, Mr. Sanders could receive an outpouring of small donations if the outcome is close that would help him compete in subsequent states. Mr. Sanders, a small-state senator who has never run for national office, has shown surprising fund-raising muscle. Many of his donors have yet to give him the maximum individual contribution of $2,700, meaning they could be tapped repeatedly if the contest remains close. His campaign raised $33 million in the final quarter of 2015, just $4 million less than Mrs. Clinton.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s aides say they expect to win Iowa and New Hampshire and are ready for the grind. A giant whiteboard on the wall of the campaign\u2019s headquarters maps out where staff members would be sent depending on the outcomes in the early states.\u201cWe just game out a bunch of different scenarios,\u201d Mr. Mook said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like \u2018choose your own adventure.\u2019\u00a0\u201dThis is not the adventure the Clinton team would have chosen.A prolonged primary campaign against an opponent widely popular with the party\u2019s liberal base could exhaust donors who will also be asked to contribute to an expensive campaign to defeat the Republican nominee. A contentious race against Mr. Sanders could also weaken Mrs. Clinton\u2019s standing among Democratic voters she would need in November.During the call with supporters last week, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s aides did not talk much about Iowa, instead emphasizing the possibility that the battle with Mr. Sanders could quickly become national.Mrs. Clinton has many strengths to exploit: In a Democratic primary, candidates are awarded delegates based on their vote totals, so Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders can get close to the roughly 2,200 needed to secure the nomination by racking up a combination of victories and solid second-place showings.Delegates, people active in politics chosen by party leaders to represent their states at the convention, typically take the lead from whichever candidate won their state\u2019s contest.The Democratic Party also has \u201csuperdelegates,\u201d or party leaders and elected officials who are free to support any candidate. Mrs. Clinton holds a large lead among these party leaders, with several hundred superdelegates signed on to support her campaign, compared with 16 or so for Mr. Sanders.Mrs. Clinton has deep support among blacks and Latinos. Mr. Sanders, by contrast, has struggled to connect with minorities and trails Mrs. Clinton by double digits in Nevada and South Carolina, which vote later next month.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign is counting on minority voters to help her win in the South. It has assembled \u201cleadership councils\u201d of elected officials, party leaders and activists who have endorsed Mrs. Clinton and has held campaign events in states beyond the early four, including the delegate-rich Texas, Tennessee, Georgia, Florida and Virginia.\u201cMany people feel she has a comfortable firewall built past the first two contests,\u201d said Anita Dunn, a Democratic strategist unaffiliated with either candidate. But, she added, if there is one thing \u201cwe\u2019ve seen in 2016, it\u2019s that politics is not playing by the rules it previously did.\u201dAt a fish fry hosted by Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, held at an outdoor pavilion in Charleston on the eve of the debate on Sunday, Mrs. Clinton received a raucous welcome and chants of \u201cHillary! Hillary!\u201d Mr. Sanders received a less enthusiastic response.\u201cOnce the campaign moves past those first two states, I think the dynamics and the playing field become much more favorable to Secretary Clinton,\u201d said Geoff Garin, a pollster who was a chief strategist on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign.Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign has also been crunching the delegate math. It says he can outperform Mrs. Clinton with white voters and voters under 45, who favor Mr. Sanders two to one, and pick up delegates in states that have caucuses rather than primaries.His campaign is optimistic in states like Colorado, Minnesota and Wyoming \u2014 which hold caucuses, a system that favors the party\u2019s most liberal voters \u2014 as well as in other states with relatively small and mostly white populations of Democrats. \u201cTo be a Democrat in Oklahoma, you\u2019ve got to be real liberal,\u201d said Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders.Advertisement"}

Sanders is still a long shot for the nomination, but is a serious enough contender that he deserves some real scrutiny. And it\u2019s important to be aware that there are bigger problems with his candidacy than lack of political realism.But here\u2019s the thing: we now have a clear view of Sanders\u2019 positions on two crucial issues, financial reform and health care. And in both cases his positioning is disturbing \u2014 not just because it\u2019s politically unrealistic to imagine that we can get the kind of radical overhaul he\u2019s proposing, but also because he takes his own version of cheap shots. Not at people \u2014 he really is a fundamentally decent guy \u2014 but by going for easy slogans and punting when the going gets tough.To be harsh but accurate: the Sanders health plan looks a little bit like a standard Republican tax-cut plan, which relies on fantasies about huge supply-side effects to make the numbers supposedly add up. Only a little bit: after all, this is a plan seeking to provide health care, not lavish windfalls on the rich \u2014 and single-payer really does save money, whereas there\u2019s no evidence that tax cuts deliver growth. Still, it\u2019s not the kind of brave truth-telling the Sanders campaign pitch might have led you to expect.And look: if the political theory behind supporting Sanders is that the American people will vote for radical change if you\u2019re honest about what\u2019s involved, the campaign\u2019s evident unwillingness to fully confront the issues, its reliance on magic asterisks, very much weakens that claim.Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Confronts Bernie Sanders as Polls Show Her Lead in Iowa Narrowing", "Date": "2016-01-11", "News": "WATERLOO, Iowa \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Facing new pressure from Senator Bernie Sanders in Iowa, Hillary Clinton confronted him in direct terms on Monday, warning Iowans that if elected president, he would put their health insurance in the hands of Republican governors and raise taxes on the middle class.Sharpening her tone as new polling suggested that Mr. Sanders was closing in on her in the state, Mrs. Clinton assailed Mr. Sanders by name, telling 300 people on a frigid and snowy day here, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time for us to have the kind of spirited debate that you deserve for us to have.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re so much better than the Republicans,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut we do have differences and you deserve to know what those differences are.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMrs. Clinton also looked to repel criticism from Mr. Sanders that she is a patron of the rich, unveiling a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfair share surcharge\u00e2\u0080\u009d that would impose a new tax on people who earn more than $5 million a year. Her campaign estimated that raising the income tax on the wealthy by 4 percentage points would generate $150 billion in revenues over 10 years.On health care, Mrs. Clinton said that she wanted to build upon the Affordable Care Act, while Mr. Sanders wanted to scrap it in favor of a universal health plan that would empower the states \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and potentially Republican governors, who she has said cannot be trusted. This, along with the other progressive policies of Mr. Sanders, who represents Vermont, would require raising taxes on more than just the rich, she argued.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no way, if you do the arithmetic, to pay for what he has proposed without raising taxes on the middle class,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where he and I part ways.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHer remarks came a day after a new poll showed Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lead in Iowa narrowing to three percentage points over Mr. Sanders. Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign is counting on a victory here in the caucuses on Feb. 1 because the next contest is eight days later in New Hampshire, where Mr. Sanders has held a durable lead in polls.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI feel really good about where we are, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not taking anything for granted,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton said. Her comments on Monday echoed the language she used in December 2007 when she told reporters in Cedar Rapids that \u00e2\u0080\u009cnow the fun part starts\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a promise to make clear to Iowans the deficiencies of Barack Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policies. She placed third in the Iowa caucuses, which Mr. Obama won.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re into the last month, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to start drawing the contrasts, because I want every Iowan to have accurate information when they make their decisions,\u201d she said at the time.Mr. Sanders also campaigned in Iowa on Monday, similarly pressing an economic argument in trying to coax voters out to support him on caucus day. Speaking to reporters in Pleasantville, he said that Mrs. Clinton was attacking him because of polls that showed he was gaining support \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and that she was realizing she could lose.\u00e2\u0080\u009cSecretary Clinton and her campaign now know that she is in serious trouble,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd, I think a candidate who was originally thought to be the anointed candidate, to be the inevitable candidate, is now locked in a very difficult race here in Iowa and in New Hampshire. Obviously, in that scenario, what people do is start attacking.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Sanders highlighted how he has called for increasing Social Security benefits, and would pay for it by raising the cap on income that is eligible for taxation to finance the program. That way, the wealthy would pay more into the system.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn 2008, as I recall, President Obama introduced very similar-type legislation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said of his Social Security bill. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat legislation was then opposed by Senator Clinton, who was running against him. I would hope that now in the year 2016, when so many of our seniors and disabled vets are struggling, that Secretary Clinton will join me in demanding that we raise the cap on taxable income, that we expand benefits for our seniors and our disabled vets, and that we extend the life of Social Security for 50 years.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe issue, he added, was \u201crelatively new for Hillary,\u201d but added that she had \u201ccome forward with some really thoughtful approaches.\u201dMrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pointed remarks \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the sparring between the candidates \u00e2\u0080\u0094 suggested that the Democratic presidential debate on Sunday could take a sharper tone than the previous ones, which were largely cordial affairs.Mrs. Clinton said legislation that Bernie Sanders supported in 2005 forbids all lawsuits against gun makers and sellers.But Mrs. Clinton is overstating the breadth of the law. Though its protections are quite expansive, the law specifies six exceptions to the prohibition on civil actions. For example, a victim can sue a dealer who has been convicted of selling a firearm knowing that it would be used to commit a violent crime.Suits are also allowed in matters involving injuries or property damage resulting from manufacturing or design defects, as long as the firearm in question was not used in a criminal act. Another exception allows lawsuits when a gun maker or seller \u00e2\u0080\u009cknowingly violated a state or federal statute applicable to the sale or marketing of the product.\u00e2\u0080\u009d These exceptions are narrow, and they do provide broad protections to the gun industry, as Mrs. Clinton suggests. Whether the exceptions would ultimately prove meaningful was a subject of debate when Congress passed the legislation in 2005. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe aim of this bill is clear: to allow legitimate lawsuits against a manufacturer when the legal principles to do so are present,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, said at the time.Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, took the opposite view: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese exceptions in the bill have been carefully crafted to prevent lawsuits, not to enable appropriate lawsuits to go forward.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Lytton, the law professor, said the law \"pretty much shut down attempts to use the court system in a broad way to try to push for greater industry self-regulation of marketing and distribution of firearms.\"But the exceptions have not put a complete halt to litigation.How courts interpret the exceptions is still unfolding, and lawyers have tried to craft lawsuits that could meet their criteria. As one example, families of some of the victims of the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., are suing Remington Outdoor, the maker of the Bushmaster rifle used in the shooting, among other defendants. The families are arguing that the gun maker knew, or should have known, that selling assault rifles to civilians \u00e2\u0080\u009cposed an unreasonable and egregious risk of physical injury,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that its conduct violated the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act.Remington Outdoor is seeking the suit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dismissal. The 2005 law, it said in court papers last month, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas enacted to protect firearm manufacturers against the very claims plaintiffs make in this case.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Thomas KaplanShe also used her visit to Waterloo to press a recurring theme of recent days, calling Mr. Sanders weak on gun control. She pointed to his vote in 2005, as a member of the House, for a bill limiting the liability of gun makers and sellers. She also embraced President Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent executive actions on guns. The crowd at the Electric Park Ballroom in Waterloo cheered Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arrival and gathered around her to take selfies after she spoke. However, many in the audience said that they remained undecided and that they were hoping that seeing her in person might help them choose.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no dislike for her or anything like that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Floyd Bumper, 32, of Waterloo. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my second choice.\u00e2\u0080\u009dYamiche Alcindor contributed reporting from Pleasantville, Iowa.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "At Republican Debate, Taunts and Quips as Rivals Battle", "Date": "2016-01-14", "News": "Supported byNORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014 Donald J. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas sharply attacked each other on Thursday night over the Canadian-born Mr. Cruz\u2019s eligibility to be president and Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cNew York values,\u201d shedding any semblance of cordiality as they dominated a Republican debate less than three weeks before the Iowa caucuses.Their exchanges showcased the intense and unpredictable new phase of the race as polls tighten and 11 candidates jockey for political advantage \u2014 not only over issues like imposing tariffs on Chinese goods and fighting the Islamic State, but also over matters of character and integrity that drew some of the hardest punches of the race so far.In many ways, it was the darkest debate of the campaign, as the Republicans tried to paint the grimmest possible portrait of an America in decline economically, despite rapid job growth, and militarily, though they praised service members. The ferocity onstage reflected the pressure in the race as it distills into a contest between the anti-establishment Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz, followed by other candidates like Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey.Mr. Rubio and Mr. Christie, along with Jeb Bush and John Kasich, are vying to emerge as the leading candidate of mainstream Republicans, yet they struggled to be heard on Thursday night.Mr. Cruz, who has gained ground against Mr. Trump recently and is now virtually tied with him in the polls in Iowa, charged that Mr. Trump was turning desperate because his standing as front-runner had turned shaky.After months as Mr. Trump\u2019s closest ally in the race, Mr. Cruz pointedly noted that Mr. Trump had dismissed questions in the fall about Mr. Cruz\u2019s constitutional eligibility given his birth to an American mother living in Calgary, Alberta.\u201cThe Constitution hasn\u2019t changed, but the poll numbers have,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cDonald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.\u201d Mr. Cruz added that the law was on his side, noting that Senator John McCain, while born in the Panama Canal Zone, was eligible to run for president. By Mr. Trump\u2019s standard, Mr. Cruz asserted, Mr. Trump himself might not be eligible to run for president because his mother was born in Scotland.\u201cBut I was born here \u2014 big difference,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Mr. Cruz gave his most aggressive performance so far as he sought to protect the support he has built among social conservatives and evangelical Christians. He was relentless in trying to put Mr. Trump in his place, in part to appeal to establishment Republicans who are deeply uncomfortable with Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy.The debate turned from a reality show into a comedy as Mr. Trump mused that if he chose Mr. Cruz as his running mate, Democrats would sue to challenge Mr. Cruz\u2019s eligibility \u2014 as they would, he said, if Mr. Cruz won the presidential primary.\u201cIf you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?\u201d Mr. Trump said.Mr. Cruz, a pugnacious, polished debater as a Princeton undergraduate, gave no quarter.\u201cI\u2019m not going to take legal advice from Donald Trump,\u201d he said to laughter. And he offered to make Mr. Trump his running mate, so he could assume the presidency if a theoretical legal challenge against Mr. Cruz\u2019s eligibility were successful.Mr. Rubio, seeing an opening to position himself above the spat, eventually interjected, mocking his rivals.\u201cI hate to interrupt this episode of \u2018Court TV,\u2019 \u201d he said, drawing laughs and applause. He then sought to refocus the conversation on President Obama\u2019s shortcomings and what he said was a need to revive the country, safe terrain for Republican primary voters.Neither Mr. Rubio, who spent most of the debate delivering rehearsed lines that seemed to come out of speeches, nor the other four Republicans on the debate stage left nearly as big an impression during the night as Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz.Mr. Cruz seemed more comfortably in command with his needling of Mr. Trump, who was booed frequently. But then he was asked to elaborate on his suggestion earlier in the week that Mr. Trump embodied \u201cNew York values.\u201dMr. Cruz stood by it, saying Americans outside New York City understood the reference.\u201cI think most people know exactly what New York values are: socially liberal, pro-gay marriage, pro-abortion, focused on money and the media,\u201d he said.But Mr. Trump, in an uncharacteristically calm and measured answer that built to a powerful conclusion, recalled the way that New Yorkers suffered, grieved and recovered from the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks \u2014 drawing applause even from Mr. Cruz.\u201cThe people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, even the smell of death \u2014 no one understood it,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everyone in the world watched and loved New York and New Yorkers. And I\u2019ll tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.\u201d\u201cThis would be devastating for our economy,\u201d said Mr. Bush, a former governor of Florida. He added, \u201cWe need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.\u201dMr. Trump shot back, \u201cAnd we don\u2019t need a weak person being president of the United States \u2014 and that\u2019s what we would get with Jeb.\u201d\u201cWhy didn\u2019t they call the police?\u201d Mr. Trump asked of the couple\u2019s neighbors and others.The New York Times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign.\u201cOn Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama, and it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing,\u201d Mr. Christie said, adding that American alliances were in bad need of repair and that adversaries needed to understand \u201cthe limits of our patience.\u201dThe candidates also sought to find provocative new ways to tar Mrs. Clinton.\u201cIf she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse,\u201d Mr. Bush said, drawing applause.Mr. Rubio sought to top that. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t just be a disaster,\u201d he said. \u201cHillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.\u201d Over applause, he continued, \u201cSomeone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief, and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.\u201dMr. Rubio also seized an opportunity to challenge Mr. Christie\u2019s conservative credentials on a host of issues important to party activists.\u201cI like Chris Christie, but we cannot afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core,\u201d he said, referring to the education standards. \u201cWe cannot afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.\u201dSaying Mr. Christie had also contributed to Planned Parenthood and backed Justice Sonia Sotomayor\u2019s appointment to the Supreme Court, Mr. Rubio added: \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country. It cannot be someone that agrees with his agenda.\u201dMr. Christie responded with ridicule, recalling that Mr. Rubio had repulsed an attack from Mr. Bush at an earlier debate by suggesting that Mr. Bush had been told to criticize him out of desperation.Though Mr. Christie ridiculed senators as all talk, no accountability, he largely avoided responding with specific critiques of Mr. Rubio\u2019s views \u2014 though he recalled that Mr. Rubio had once lauded him as a \u201cconservative reformer that New Jersey needed.\u201dAccording to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.\u201cThat is not consistent conservatism,\u201d Mr. Rubio said. \u201cThat is political calculation.\u201dMr. Cruz replied with mockery. \u201cI appreciate your dumping your oppo research folder on the debate stage,\u201d he said, referring to the compilation of vulnerabilities campaigns keep on their rivals. He said Mr. Rubio\u2019s accusations were \u201cflat-out false,\u201d drawing boos from a crowd friendly to Mr. Rubio, and then invoked a cast of politicians well-known to Republican primary voters.\u201cMarco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty,\u201d he said. \u201cI stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King,\u201d two immigration hard-liners in Congress.Mr. Cruz, faced with a question about his failure to disclose a large loan in his 2012 Senate race, attacked The New York Times and called the lack of disclosure \u201ca paperwork error.\u201d\u201cThe entire New York Times attack is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate that was a public filing, but it was not on a second filing with the F.E.C.,\u201d he said, referring to the Federal Election Commission. \u201cBoth of those filings were public.\u201dNear the end of the debate, the disputes took a turn toward the substantive as Mr. Rubio, unbidden, targeted a business tax proposal by Mr. Cruz, calling it a value-added tax. Mr. Cruz countered that Mr. Rubio\u2019s tax plan would leave the Internal Revenue Service in place.Mr. Rubio shot back, \u201cThere has to be some agency that\u2019s going to collect your VAT tax.\u201dAfter one exchange between Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio, Mr. Christie saw an opportunity.\u201cI\u2019d like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate,\u201d he said, pointing out that the original question had been about entitlements.Mr. Rubio sought to retake the floor, but Mr. Christie cut him off.\u201cYou already had your chance, Marco,\u201d Mr. Christie said. \u201cYou blew it.\u201dJonathan Martin reported from North Charleston, and Patrick Healy from New York.\u00a0Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "BTG Pactual Sells Distressed Debt Unit to Itau Unibanco", "Date": "2015-12-31", "News": "Supported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Brazil\u2019s largest private sector banking group said on Thursday that it had agreed to acquire the distressed debt unit of the troubled investment firm BTG Pactual for about 1.2 billion reais, or about $307 million.The banking group, Itau Unibanco, will acquire 82 percent of the distressed debt unit, Recovery do Brasil Consultoria, for 640 million reais and approximately 70 percent of the firm\u2019s nonperforming loan portfolio for 570 million reais. The portfolios have a face value of 38 billion reais, the bank said in a filing. Both stakes correspond to BTG\u2019s entire ownership of each.The International Finance Corporation, the World Bank\u2019s private investment arm, will retain its minority stakes in both the firm and the nonperforming loan portfolios.The price was less than the 1.7 billion reais than BTG had sought, according to multiple people with knowledge of the negotiations. Some in the market thought BTG could have fetched the higher price if it had been more patient. That suggests that BTG continues to face pressure to demonstrate liquidity and good financial health after the arrest of its founder and former chief executive, Andr\u00e9 Esteves, on Nov. 25.Mr. Esteves faces charges by Brazil\u2019s attorney general of obstruction of justice and interfering with the broad investigation into corruption involving the state-owned oil giant Petrobras. Although he was released from jail on Dec. 17, he remains under 24-hour house arrest awaiting trial and cannot return to work at BTG. He has resigned as its chief executive and chairman of the board.BTG\u2019s stock fell by about half in the weeks after his arrest and was still trading near its low at around $15 a share on Thursday.BTG continues to grapple with turning a corner. In a December research report, Goldman Sachs said that it expected the firm\u2019s cumulative funding gap \u2014 as measured by assets versus liabilities \u2014 to reach 1.6 billion reais by the end of this year and widen to 11 billon reais by the end of next year.In a respite, BTG obtained a line of credit of six billion reais this month from the private credit firm Fundo Garantidor de Cr\u00e9ditos, which is funded by Brazilian banks.Yet it continues to be on an aggressive campaign to sell assets, and Recovery was one of its most prized.\u201cThey were putting a lot of pressure to get it done quickly,\u201d one of the individuals with knowledge of the negotiations said of the speed of BTG\u2019s sale of Recovery. That turned off some potential buyers, he said, as BTG \u201cdid not want folks to be able to check under the hood\u201d before reaching an agreement.If BTG had been more patient, that person said, BTG may have fetched as much as two billion reais for Recovery. \u201cThere was no reason to push for a close by the end of the year,\u201d he said, other than demonstrating financial health in the calendar year.Initially, Itau Unibanco was neither BTG\u2019s preferred buyer nor the most likely candidate, according to several people who spoke on the condition of anonymity. BTG was close to reaching a deal this month with the American investment firm Lone Star Funds, according to two people.Lone Star was widely seen to be the favorite as it had been talking to BTG well before the arrest of Mr. Esteves.\u201cLone Star was the pretty obvious buyer from the beginning,\u201d said one of the people, adding that, \u201cI did not think anyone was ahead of them.\u201dRecovery was particularly attractive to foreign buyers because it allowed them a way to enter Brazil\u2019s lucrative distressed debt market without having to build their own operation here.Yet talks with Lone Star broke off last week for reasons BTG Pactual has yet to disclose. One individual said the two parties were apart on price by about approximately 300 million reais. Sam Loughlin, Lone Star Funds president of the Americas, did not respond to an email requesting comment.Before these negotiations, more than 20 firms had expressed interest in Recovery. BTG gave a deadline of Dec. 16 for submitting nonbinding final offers.Clint Kollar, a managing director with TPG Special Situations Partners, the dedicated credit platform of TPG Capital, met with BTG at its S\u00e3o Paulo headquarters this month, according to one person with knowledge of his plans.The Fortress Investment Group showed interest until Dec. 16, but was told its bid would be too low, so it backed out. Although Fortress recently closed its macro funds, having faced huge losses in Brazil, according to an article in The Wall Street Journal in October, its credit business, which includes distressed and special situations, continues to have interest in Brazil.Apollo Global Management had also taken interest in Recovery. Cerberus initially looked at it but balked at a price of more than one billion reais.The terms of the deal with Itau are subject to regulatory approval.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stock Markets Shudder After Chinese Stock Plunge Forces a Trading Halt", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 The market turmoil in China spread around the world on Thursday, as global investors grew more anxious about the country\u2019s currency and the health of its economy.Major market indexes in the United States ended the day down more than 2 percent.Earlier, Chinese stocks plunged by more than 7 percent, forcing officials for the second time this week to halt trading for the day \u2014 in this case, after just 29 minutes.After the market mess, the Chinese authorities made a stark reversal, suspending a market mechanism \u2014 known as a circuit breaker \u2014 that halted trading when losses reached a threshold. The measure, put into effect just this week and intended to help stabilize stocks, may have instead intensified investors\u2019 concerns.The big question now is how much of the turmoil reflects rule changes and other policies at the Chinese stock market, and how much is based on broader economic fundamentals that might have a further impact on global growth.The market aftershocks spread to Europe and the United States. The benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index closed down 2.4 percent, to its lowest level since the start of October. For the last four days, the S.&P. 500 is down 4.9 percent, producing the worst start to a year in the history of the index.The narrower Dow Jones industrial average ended down 2.3 percent, while the Nasdaq composite index finished down 3.03 percent. The selling was in shares in nearly all industries.Still, American investors appeared to be less panicked than during a similar sell-off in August, also set off by concerns about Chinese growth. Market indexes in the United States are still above the lows they reached during the summer and many strategists have been arguing this week that the current problems in China are unlikely to become a major issue for the American economy.\u201cWe don\u2019t see this as an issue for a major sell-off in the markets,\u201d said Timothy M. Ghriskey, chief investment officer at the Solaris Group. \u201cPeople are responding like there is nothing new here.\u201dChina\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.It has been a rocky start to the new year in global markets. The big fear is that China\u2019s economy, the world\u2019s second-largest after the United States, is slowing down and crimping growth in other countries.Markets \u201care in a panic over what\u2019s happening in China,\u201d said Derek Halpenny, European head of global markets research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in London. \u201cPeople are saying, \u2018Whoa, growth is way worse than we were expecting this year.\u2019\u201dA downbeat Chinese manufacturing report sent stocks spiraling on Monday, previously prompting the country\u2019s market to close early. It also set off a global rout, with stocks in Europe and the United States getting hit.China\u2019s currency, the renminbi, continued to be a sore spot on Thursday.The Chinese government, which closely controls the renminbi, has been allowing the value of the currency to decline steadily as a way to bolster the economy. A weaker renminbi helps exporters, a key engine of growth.But it is a difficult process to manage. A falling currency is pushing companies and individuals to send money out of the country at a rapid rate, putting additional pressure on the renminbi and unsettling investors.On Thursday morning before the stock market opened, China\u2019s central bank set the rate for the renminbi at 6.5646 to the dollar, its lowest point in almost six years. When stock trading started, investors dumped shares, once again shutting down the market.\u201cPeople are worried about whether they are using currency depreciation to stimulate growth,\u201d said Steven Sun, head of China strategy and Hong Kong and China equity research at HSBC. \u201cAt the end of the day, the question is, do they have control? Everyone is asking that question.\u201dThe currency problems risk setting off a chain reaction.As the renminbi, also known as the yuan, keeps sliding day after day, traders start to expect ever greater declines. The falling currency can then propel further stock losses in China.That, in turn, can ripple through to the global markets. A surprise currency devaluation in August helped prompt a sell-off around the world.\u201cIt\u2019s getting into a stage where it is self-fulfilling \u2014 the weaker the yuan gets, the more selling there will be,\u201d said Hao Hong, the chief market strategist at Bank of Communications International.The price of benchmark West Texas intermediate oil continued to fall on Thursday, dropping to $33.27 a barrel, down over 2 percent. As recently as May, oil was trading at nearly $65.The eurozone\u2019s blue-chip Euro Stoxx 50 index fell 1.7 percent on Thursday. The FTSE 100-stock index in London was off 2 percent for the day.The impulse when the stock market falls hard for a few days in a row is to do something but it probably doesn\u2019t make much sense to overhaul an investment strategy based on a blip of market activity.Asian stocks broadly stumbled. Japan\u2019s benchmark Nikkei 225 index fell 2.3 percent, and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong shed 3 percent.The renminbi \u2014 and the global repercussions \u2014 will provide a crucial test for the Chinese government in coming months.In theory, a weaker renminbi addresses two of China\u2019s problems: It makes China\u2019s exports more competitive in foreign markets, offsetting part of the surge in the country\u2019s blue-collar wages over the last decade; and it makes foreign companies, houses and other overseas investments seem more expensive.The trick is preventing a gradual decline from turning into a rout.Managing the currency is becoming harder for China. Investors, most of them domestic, are moving money out of the country before the buying power of the renminbi slides further.China\u2019s enormous overseas spending has helped it displace the United States and Europe as the leading financial power in large parts of the developing world.China\u2019s economy has also been steadily slowing, making it a less attractive place to invest. Fourth-quarter growth, which will be reported this month, is expected to be 6.9 percent, although some economists have expressed skepticism about the reliability of such figures.The clearest indication of investor sentiment about the renminbi lies in the currency\u2019s value in unrestricted trading here in Hong Kong. Traders have been selling renminbi in Hong Kong for a significantly lower price than the bottom of the government-authorized trading range in Shanghai.The falling value of the renminbi in Hong Kong undermines confidence in the mainland\u2019s currency. It then puts pressure on the central bank to keep pushing down the official trading range.Taken together, the currency weakness, the economic slowdown and the stock market turmoil could force the government to take action. When stocks sold off last summer, China organized large-scale purchases by government-linked brokerages and investment funds.Some of those measures may have added to this week\u2019s pain, though.Under the circuit-breaker rule suspended later Thursday, trading was stopped for 15 minutes when losses hit 5 percent.Both times the circuit breaker was activated this week, the losses continued once trading resumed, taking stocks down 7 percent and forcing a stop in trading. On Thursday, trading was suspended after just 14 minutes. When it resumed 15 minutes later, the indexes almost immediately fell to the daily limit. Trading was then halted for the day.On Thursday, economic policy makers in China issued two statements meant to indicate that officials were taking matters in hand. First, the foreign exchange markets unit of the central bank said that \u201ccurrent conditions are supportive of a relatively stable\u201d exchange rate. The comment was interpreted by some traders and economists as signaling that the central bank might intervene more heavily in currency markets to support the renminbi. There were indications that it had already begun to intervene more to prop up the renminbi in Hong Kong trading.Subsequently, the China Securities Regulatory Commission announced that it was extending for three months a ban on stock sales by large shareholders. A previous ban, imposed in early July during a steep plunge in share prices at the time, had been scheduled to expire on Friday.Erwin Sanft, the head of China strategy at Macquarie Group, based in Sydney, Australia, predicted further declines in Chinese stocks, but he said that the fall might not continue for long. \u201cChina is quite good at defensive measures,\u201d he said.The options for the government go far beyond the market.To shore up the economy, China could further reduce interest rates so as to help the real estate market. It could also further increase its already considerable stimulus spending on infrastructure.Still, while such measures might help in the short run, they would only add to one of China\u2019s biggest problems in the long run: a huge overhang of debt that was used to finance poorly judged investments. Many of those investments, like high-speed rail lines built in smaller provincial capitals for political reasons, may struggle to generate enough of an economic return to cover the interest on the money that was borrowed to finance them.\u201cThe more you try to alleviate, the worse it gets in the long term,\u201d said Viktor Shvets, the head of Asian strategy at Macquarie.As for the broader effects of China\u2019s problems, Mr. Halpenny, the London analyst, said, \u201cThere has to be a point when the market sensitivity to Chinese devaluations declines.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t expect this degree of volatility to continue,\u201d Mr. Halpenny said. \u201cBut it looks like it\u2019s going to be an interesting year.\u201dNathaniel Popper contributed reporting from New York, and David Jolly from Paris.Advertisement"}

Outside, the once-manicured grass lay vacant for the off-season, slowly spoiling in the January heat.\u201cIt\u2019s on par with a Coca-Cola, a Samsung or a Pepsi,\u201d he said of his team. \u201cIt\u2019s the strongest and most talked about brand in the country, and it generates headlines every day.\u201dFor most soccer fans around the globe, the name Barcelona is synonymous with the likes of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Su\u00e1rez; huge financial resources; and Champions League triumphs that have often made Spain the king of the sport. But in Ecuador, the name Barcelona is usually associated with the 90-year-old soccer club founded here in Guayaquil, the country\u2019s largest city.The two teams are very different, of course, but in at least a few ways they are alike.For one thing, Barcelona Sporting Club, which was founded by Catalans, has a team logo modeled on that of its Spanish counterpart. And at least within Ecuador, how the immensely popular Barcelona Sporting Club does on the field resonates around the country in the same manner that the achievements and occasional failures of Messi & Company touch all of Spain.\u201cFor all the people who say that in Spain exists the great Barcelona, the original Barcelona, here in Ecuador, the name Barcelona is something very sacred within our own football,\u201d said Carlos V\u00edctor Morales, a popular soccer commentator in Guayaquil.\u201cPeople love, hate, suffer, cry and celebrate according to Barcelona\u2019s results,\u201d he added.Ronald Ladines, who covers the Ecuadorean version of Barcelona for El Comercio, one of the country\u2019s largest newspapers, was succinct in his appraisal of the team\u2019s significance, saying, \u201cBarcelona is football in Ecuador.\u201dHe added, for good measure, and maybe with a little exaggeration, \u201cA championship game without Barcelona isn\u2019t a championship.\u201dBy most accounts, Barcelona Sporting Club first rose to prominence in 1949, when the soccer landscape in Ecuador was largely dominated by amateur provincial clubs. In August of that year, Barcelona Sporting Club faced off against the Colombian team Millonarios, then considered to be one of the world\u2019s premier professional clubs, in a charity match to support the victims of an earthquake in the Andean city Ambato.Barcelona, which at the time featured only Ecuadorean players, upset Millonarios, 3-2, drawing national attention.\u201cThis was a time when Ecuadorean football was more accustomed to landslide defeats,\u201d said Ricardo Castellano, a soccer historian who is affiliated with the Barcelona Sporting Club museum here. The victory over Millonarios, he said, marked the beginning of something new.The top Ecuadorean league (later known as the Serie A) took shape in the late 1950s. As Barcelona Sporting Club began to recruit foreign players regularly in the early 1960s, it solidified itself as the top force in the league, and, to date, it has won a league-leading 14 championships, although only one in the last 18 years.Other international matches also contributed to Barcelona\u2019s rising popularity in Ecuador, including a 1962 game against Pel\u00e9 and his Brazilian club Santos, and multiple appearances in the Copa Libertadores, the Latin American club championship.Over the years, the two Barcelonas have occasionally crossed paths on and off the field. In late 2012, Spain\u2019s Barcelona tried to register its brand in Ecuador for marketing and other purposes, throwing into question Barcelona Sporting Club\u2019s rights to its own name and logo. But an agreement was reached between the teams in 2014 that allowed for the brands to coexist in Ecuador. The clubs have also played each other three times, though not since 1988. Each team has a victory and a draw.But as F.C. Barcelona has emerged as one of the most successful clubs in the world over the past decade, Barcelona Sporting Club \u2014 which is run as a nonprofit \u2014 has found itself struggling through a litany of financial problems and poor performances on the field that would be unimaginable for its Spanish counterpart.The heart of the Ecuadorean team\u2019s problems is a significant debt burden accrued by successive management groups since the early 2000s. Barcelona\u2019s financial woes turned into a crisis in the 2015 season (in Ecuador, the season runs within a calendar year, currently February to December) when management, then led by Antonio Noboa, a member of one of Ecuador\u2019s most prominent business families, failed to make several months\u2019 worth of salary payments to its current players. That prompted the Ecuadorean Football Federation to dock the team points.Morale among the players ran low, and Barcelona sputtered to a distant fourth-place finish in the Serie A. To make matters worse, the team\u2019s chief rival, Emelec, won its third straight championship and 13th over all, pulling one back of Barcelona.\u201cThe difficult economic situation reflected itself in the team\u2019s performance on the field last season,\u201d Guillermo Almada, Barcelona\u2019s manager, said in an interview in R\u00edo Verde, on the northern coast of Ecuador, where the team is holding its preseason training camp. \u201cI have no doubt.\u201dIn October, the club\u2019s nearly 4,000 members \u2014 they pay a monthly fee to maintain that status \u2014 voted for a change in leadership, electing Jos\u00e9 Francisco Cevallos as its president. A highly regarded former player nicknamed the Hands of Ecuador for his goalkeeping success with Barcelona during the 1990s and for his play in the World Cup and Copa Libertadores, Cevallos had previously served as the country\u2019s minister of sport.Cevallos\u2019s first major step was to pay salaries owed to the players and staff for July, August and September, restoring a modicum of confidence in the team\u2019s leadership.\u201cHe understands the world of football from the perspective of the players,\u201d said Iv\u00e1n Hurtado, who heads the country\u2019s players\u2019 union \u2014 la Asociaci\u00f3n de Futbolistas del Ecuador \u2014 and is a former teammate of Cevallos\u2019s on the national team. \u201cWe have faith that he can restore Barcelona as a model for others.\u201dPutting the team on a path to financial stability is likely to be a long-term project.In an interview with Ecuadorean media in December, Cevallos cautioned that the team\u2019s finances remained \u201cin intensive therapy.\u201dCuentas, the new vice president for finance, said the debt currently stood between $15 million and $20 million, equivalent to about one and a half times the club\u2019s annual revenue. Servicing the debt is expected to account for as much as 20 percent of the team\u2019s 2016 budget, he added. In addition, low oil prices are threatening Ecuador\u2019s economy, which could, in turn, hold down attendance and diminish team revenue.With all this in mind, Barcelona has hired two outside firms to begin reviewing financial documents and putting together a multiyear payment plan. The club also plans to vastly expand its membership base, hoping to add 10,000 members per year over the next four years to generate additional revenue.The new management demonstrated its commitment to frugality this off-season, passing up splashy signings in favor of more modest tinkering with the roster. And in an attempt, perhaps, to compensate for the lack of a high-profile international signing, Barcelona is trying to add some sizzle to its preseason festivities. The club has arranged for the fading Brazilian star Ronaldinho, who was once a beloved player at F.C. Barcelona in Spain, to play for Barcelona Sporting Club in an exhibition game.For the team\u2019s management, getting Ronaldinho into a Barcelona S.C. jersey, if only for one game, is a publicity coup and a chance to demonstrate success in an area in which prior club administrations failed. In 1997, for instance, an effort to attract another global star nearing the end of his career \u2014 Diego Maradona \u2014 never panned out.Ronaldinho would be the second player to play for both Barcelonas. The first was Carlos Medrano, an Argentine who played for Barcelona Sporting Club in the early 1970s after an earlier stint with the Spanish club.In R\u00edo Verde, the team\u2019s struggles did little to deter hundreds of fans from attending a recent practice. Manuel Espinosa, 47, sat on concrete bleachers coated with dust and swatted away flies as he watched his favorite team settle into the rhythms of its third practice of the day. Dressed in the team\u2019s neon yellow jersey, Espinosa expressed optimism that Cevallos could help return Barcelona to its past glory, and professed his loyalty through the current down period.\u201cFor me, Barcelona is my idol, my life passion,\u201d he said. \u201cIt runs in my blood.\u201dBack at the team\u2019s headquarters, Cuentas said the new management was setting its own high expectations.\u201cOur goal is to restore the name of Barcelona, nationally and internationally, to the status that it always was,\u201d he said, arms folded on his desk. \u201cAs the best team in Ecuador.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about the Barcelona Sporting Club soccer team in Ecuador misspelled, in two instances, the name of a Brazilian soccer player who played for F.C. Barcelona in Spain and is expected to play in an exhibition for Barcelona Sporting Club. As the article correctly noted elsewhere, he is Ronaldinho, not Ronaldhino.Advertisement"}

That\u2019s right, I won\u2019t be calling to ask you to donate to my congressional campaign. As I announced on Tuesday, I\u2019ll be leaving Congress at the end of this term \u2014 sentimental about many things, but liberated from a fund-raising regime that\u2019s never been more dangerous to our democracy.In the days after my first election to Congress, in 2000, I attended several orientation sessions in Washington, eager to absorb the lessons of history. I wanted to learn what Congressman Abraham Lincoln had learned, to hear the wisdom of predecessors like John Quincy Adams, Daniel Webster and Joseph Gurney Cannon. The romance was crushed by lesson No. 1: Get re-elected. A fund-raising consultant advised that if I didn\u2019t raise at least $10,000 a week (in pre-Citizens United dollars), I wouldn\u2019t be back.The money race began, and I attended political action committee fund-raisers, which are like panhandling with hors d\u2019oeuvres. There were hours of \u201ccall time\u201d \u2014 huddled in a cubicle, dialing donors. Sometimes double dialing and triple dialing. Whispering sweet nothings and other small talk into the phone in hopes of receiving large somethings. I\u2019d sit next to an assistant who collated \u201ccall sheets\u201d with donor\u2019s names, contribution histories and other useful information. (\u201cHow\u2019s Sheila? Your wife. Oh, Shelly? Sorry.\u201d)Since then, I\u2019ve spent roughly 4,200 hours in call time, attended more than 1,600 fund-raisers just for my own campaign and raised nearly $20 million in increments of $1,000, $2,500 and $5,000 per election cycle. And things have only become worse in the five years since the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision, which ignited an explosion of money in politics by ruling that the government may not ban political spending by corporations in elections.I saw the consequences firsthand.As chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, I was invited to glamorous Washington galas, the ones where thousands of eyes make no eye contact, where pupils constantly rove in search of someone more powerful. At one dinner, in 2012, I was chatting with a powerful Republican congressional colleague. Despite the fact that the Democrats were in the minority, our campaign committee had in recent years equaled or surpassed the G.O.P. in fund-raising. My colleague amiably congratulated me and then added, \u201cBut in the end our guys will have more super PAC money than your guys.\u201dHe was right. Early one morning, as I was headed from New York to California to stump for Democrats, I received a staff member\u2019s urgent call. G.O.P. groups, she told me, had bought $2 million of TV time against one of our incumbents the previous night. We needed to match them to maintain parity on the air. We juggled dollars, shuffled resources and sent panicked email appeals to our donors that read, \u201cIT\u2019S OVER!!!\u201d and \u201cALL IS LOST!!!\u201d Luckily, we managed to cover the gap.Hours later, I landed in Los Angeles. My phone rang. The same staff member repeated the same crisis. Annoyed, I said, \u201cWe handled this already!\u201d She responded: \u201cNo, Mr. Chairman. The Republicans dumped in another $2 million when they saw our $2 million.\u201dThis isn\u2019t \u201cShark Tank.\u201d This is your democracy. But as the bidding grows higher, your voice gets lower. You\u2019re simply priced out of the marketplace of ideas. That is, unless you are one of the ultra wealthy.Democrats in Congress and all of the party\u2019s presidential candidates strongly support campaign finance reforms. In 2010, when our party was in the majority in the House under Speaker Nancy Pelosi, we passed the Disclose Act, a bill designed to help counter the effects of Citizens United, but Senate Republicans stymied it. Representative John Sarbanes, a Democrat from Maryland, has worked tirelessly with colleagues to pass viable campaign finance measures. As a 16-year veteran of Congress, I\u2019d calculate the probability that the current Republican majority schedules a vote on that bill at: LOL.There are some small steps we can take. Next week I will attend my final State of the Union speech. I hope that the president will announce an executive order requiring that federal contractors disclose their political spending.Ultimately, however, the only solution is across-the-board changes in campaign finance. We need \u201cwho-gives-what\u201d transparency in real time (not after the damage has been done), shareholder disclosure of all corporate political expenditures and public financing of congressional elections.But here\u2019s a political fact of life: Not one of these things will be passed by the current crowd in charge. The only hope for reform is to replace the majority that is stopping reform at every turn.I\u2019ll miss Congress: the history, colleagues on both sides of the aisle, the ability to help my constituents. But on hallowed ground where Lincoln inspired us to oppose slavery, where F.D.R. summoned us after Pearl Harbor, where L.B.J. demanded voting rights for African-Americans, I won\u2019t miss leaving phone messages asking PACs to \u201cmax out before the end of the quarter.\u201dMy new \u201ccall time\u201d will be spent waiting for a customer service agent to help me decipher a cable bill. Even that will be more pleasant.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Beach City Enlists Private Partner to Rejuvenate Pier", "Date": "2016-01-12", "News": "Supported bySquare Feet6 PhotosREDONDO BEACH, Calif. \u2014 The Redondo Beach pier juts into Santa Monica Bay, at the southern end of a string of beach cities loosely connected by a bike path and teeming with visitors. But Redondo doesn\u2019t get the same bustling foot traffic or the destination status as neighboring Manhattan Beach and Hermosa Beach.\u201cWhen people come out here to visit, our citizens are bringing them somewhere else for dinner,\u201d said Steve Aspel, the mayor of Redondo Beach.To change that, the pier and the waterfront require critical infrastructure repairs with estimated costs running as high as $108 million.The company, based in El Segundo, Calif., promises a face-lift for every element of the waterfront. It is proposing 11 acres of public open space, an improved beach and swimming area, a public market, a 700-seat specialty theater, a boutique hotel, retail space and a wider boardwalk.The project would provide a $70 million investment in infrastructure repair, $3.25 million in tax revenue, and 2,500 jobs, according to CenterCal. With about 300,000 square feet of new development, Waterfront Redondo represents a substantial undertaking in public redevelopment by a private investor. CenterCal\u2019s proposal will go to the City Council for approval in March, then to the harbor commission, and then to the state coastal commission for additional approvals.Larry J. Kosmont, the chief executive of Kosmont Company, a real estate advisory services firm, was the city\u2019s real estate and public finance consultant on the deal. He started working with the city eight years ago to identify deficiencies at the waterfront. These included a crumbling parking structure and a pier badly in need of repair.\u201cPublic agencies aren\u2019t the best at maintaining properties,\u201d Mr. Kosmont said. \u201cThey can get distracted by other issues, understandably. This is a complicated property.\u201dIn entering into this agreement with CenterCal, Redondo Beach is taking advantage of what Mr. Kosmont calls a \u201cclassic example of public-private partnership,\u201d or P3.\u201cThe public sector\u2019s realizing the private sector brings more than just cash to the table; they bring redevelopment expertise, technological expertise, new kinds of innovation,\u201d said Robert Puentes, director of the Metropolitan Infrastructure Initiative at the Brookings Institution.\u201cThe state hasn\u2019t given the city many chances to improve services without engaging in a real estate transaction,\u201d Mr. Kosmont said. That\u2019s partly a function of California law, which mandates a municipality cannot raise taxes without going to a vote.\u201cNot a politician\u2019s favorite,\u201d Mr. Kosmont added.Mr. Kosmont has represented over 40 public agencies in California engaging in this kind of P3 transaction.\u201cThe pier and harbor area is in desperate need of revitalization,\u201d said Mayor Aspel, who characterized the whole harbor area as \u201cworn out.\u201dFred Bruning, the chief executive of CenterCal and a longtime Redondo Beach resident, says he sees the potential in the project, which is in an area with a rich history.The waterfront originally served as the Port of Los Angeles, starting in 1892, when Redondo Beach was incorporated. By 1910, it was a major tourist attraction, with its railway connection to downtown Los Angeles, the Fox Theater and the Plunge \u2014 once the largest indoor saltwater pool in the world but since torn down.\u201cRedondo means \u2018round,\u2019 in Spanish,\u201d Mr. Bruning said, and Redondo Beach used to be laid out like the spokes of half a wheel, with all roads leading to the waterfront.\u201cThe history has always been one of commerce and activity,\u201d Mr. Bruning said.Development in the 1960s and 1970s cut off direct public access from the inland part of the city to the waterfront and replaced the business district with condominiums and a small commercial strip and marina called the International Boardwalk.That rearrangement of the city plan disrupted the community\u2019s connection to what had been a very vibrant waterfront, Mr. Bruning said.Today, a handful of local businesses cling to the water\u2019s edge there, fortified with sandbags against regular flooding.\u201cThe International Boardwalk was designed as storage for boats. It was never meant to be permanent,\u201d said Pat Aust, a former city councilman and lifelong Redondo Beach resident. He also was the city\u2019s fire chief in 1988, when the already storm-battered pier was decimated by a blaze.One small feature of CenterCal\u2019s proposal points to Mr. Bruning\u2019s ideas for recreating the waterfront. He is planning to install an intelligent fountain, similar to the one at the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas, that offers performances with synchronized jets and lights.\u201cWhy would you bring a water feature to the ocean?\u201d Mr. Bruning asked. \u201cIt gets dark.\u201dMr. Bruning said that the space needed to stay vital in the evening. A lighted park with a water element would make for a usable outdoor space at night.The proposed project has met with some opposition from a small but vocal minority in the community.At a public comment session after the release of the project\u2019s draft environmental impact report, some expressed concerns about impediments to views, the threat posed by an exploding sea lion population and a generalized resistance to a mall by the sea.He said the plan incorporates best practices in so-called placemaking, as defined by the nonprofit Project for Public Spaces. Those include points like limiting residential development \u2014 the proposal has none \u2014 and incorporating adaptive and flexible design that showcases local identity. And the proposal includes less than 20 percent retailing.Mr. Bruning envisions round-the-clock activity throughout the site\u2019s myriad attractions.Natural tidal flow would feed the improved seaside lagoon, eliminating the need for chemical treatment of the water. The revitalization would open the lagoon year round and include improvements to water conservation efforts and storm water management.The current seaside lagoon, open seasonally and for a fee, uses chlorinated water that first serves as the cooling agent for the nearby steam generation plant.Aaron Jones, Redondo Beach\u2019s community development director, said the draft environmental impact report anticipated that CenterCal\u2019s proposal for the site would improve water quality in the harbor. Currently, storm water runs directly from impermeable surfaces into the harbor. CenterCal\u2019s design includes on-site collection, infiltration and bioretention of that storm water runoff.CenterCal hired BCV Architects, the firm that handled the Ferry Building in San Francisco, to design the public market. It would be a vast shopping hall with fresh seafood and organic produce, and familiar faces; legacy tenants would be relocated into the new facilities. Many of them have been fixtures for decades.Chris Bredesen, the managing member of Captain Kidd\u2019s Fish Market and Restaurant, which opened in 1976, said he would have to close for the two-year construction period before he is able to relocate, but it\u2019s a risk he\u2019s willing to take.\u201cThe harbor\u2019s due for rejuvenation,\u201d Mr. Bredesen said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it change immensely over the years. Now it\u2019s dangerous. It\u2019s time for some sort of an upgrade, and this is a major upgrade.\u201dPeter E. Dragich Jr. owns Quality Seafood, which opened on the pier in 1953 and moved to the International Boardwalk in 1968. His business could remain open during the proposed construction.\u201cI\u2019m a little apprehensive because it\u2019s like rolling the dice. You\u2019re going to someplace new, is everyone going to follow you?\u201d Mr. Dragich asked. \u201cI think it\u2019ll work.\u201dRedondo\u2019s partnership with CenterCal on the waterfront may signal a trend toward this new direction for problem solving in public redevelopment. Mr. Puentes of Brookings said the P3 approach could be attractive \u201cparticularly for large-scale infrastructure investment like this, where cities are looking for new models, new innovations and new partnerships.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Failed Talks Raise Specter of Biggest Default in Puerto Rico Crisis", "Date": "2016-01-23", "News": "Supported byThe creditors blamed the utility, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, or Prepa, for scuttling the talks, saying Prepa officials had decided to let a critical expiration date pass without taking action. But Prepa said it was the creditors\u2019 fault for trying to impose a requirement that Prepa had already rejected.\u201cThey had no incentives whatsoever to be efficient,\u201d the president of Puerto Rico\u2019s Senate, Eduardo Bhatia, said of Prepa in a recent interview. \u201cThis is incredible. Our power plants look like the cars in Cuba.\u201dThey run like old cars, too, and one goal of the restructuring was to provide money for a long-awaited modernization.The creditors released a statement at midnight on Friday, as soon as the expiration date had passed, saying the hard-won deal was off. They did not say whether they would now declare Prepa in default. Doing so could have major repercussions.In August, Puerto Rico missed a $58 million payment on what it called \"moral obligation bonds,\" saying it did not have any legal obligation to make the scheduled payment on that type of debt. On Jan. 1, it defaulted on $163 million worth of payments to a low-ranking type of bond, in order to save cash to pay its highest ranking general obligation bonds. Insurers of the affected bonds have filed lawsuits, which in turn prompted Puerto Rico to intensify its pleas to take shelter in bankruptcy court, which would require an act of Congress.Prepa does not take in enough cash to cover its costs, and it has a debt payment of about $400 million due to bondholders on July 1. It also owes about $700 million to two institutions that finance the shipments of fuel that Prepa burns to produce energy. The utility does not have the resources to make those payments.Prepa issued its own statement early Saturday, saying that even though its restructuring deal had \u201cterminated,\u201d it remained willing to pick up the pieces and try to get a new deal. It said the talks broke down because the creditors had said they were willing to roll back the expiration date from Friday to Feb. 12, but tried to impose new requirements in exchange. \u201cPrepa had rejected these same conditions in December 2015,\u201d the utility said in its statement.The negotiations have been underway since 2014, when Prepa ran out of cash, precipitating a crisis, and creditors agreed to refrain from enforcing their claims. As part of their forbearance agreement, they allowed Prepa to dip into prepaid reserves to make bond payments, something that could otherwise be considered an event of default.The Puerto Rico Legislature also needed to approve the deal. Some lawmakers said Prepa and its creditors were rushing to close the deal before the island\u2019s new public utility commission \u2014 the first independent regulator in Prepa\u2019s 75-year history \u2014 could properly review it.The creditors expected the Legislature to approve the deal in December. When that did not happen, they said they would wait until Jan. 22. The creditors also offered to buy an additional $115 million of bonds from Prepa to help cover the cost of a debt-service payment that the utility made on Jan. 1.But as the deadline loomed this week, lawmakers said they were still not ready to approve the agreement. One person familiar with the negotiations said the creditors were willing to wait until Feb. 12 for the enabling law, but tried to make the $115 million financing mechanism contingent on the new public-utility commission signing off on the increase in the base rate by then. The person, who spoke anonymously, said the commission could not work that quickly because it had not been set rates before and would probably need until May.The Prepa creditors said they could not wait that long because, among other things, the Federal Reserve was nudging up interest rates, and the deal had a fixed interest rate that would soon fall behind. Their statement said, \u201cIt was our desire to be as supportive of the legislative process as possible,\u201d and added that they found it \u201cextremely disappointing and perplexing that Prepa has chosen to take this stance.\u201dThe creditors said that they remained open to resuming talks.Prepa\u2019s statement quoted Ms. Donahue as being disappointed as well. \u201cPrepa remains willing to continue discussions,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ted Cruz Failed to Report a Second Campaign Loan in 2012", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byThe one-page letter said that the \u201cunderlying source\u201d of money for a series of personal loans Mr. Cruz made to his Senate campaign in Texas included both bank loans, which totaled as much as $1 million. Both loans were \u201cinadvertently omitted\u201d from the required filings, the letter said. Previously, Mr. Cruz had acknowledged only using the loan from Goldman for his campaign.History suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.The latest disclosure casts further doubt on his oft-stated story of having liquidated his entire family savings of slightly more than $1 million to fuel a come-from-behind win in the Republican primary. The tale has become part of a campaign narrative of a populist, scrappy Mr. Cruz putting everything on the line to overcome a wealthy establishment opponent.His letter to the Federal Election Commission came after The New York Times reported that at least some of the \u201cpersonal funds\u201d Mr. Cruz and his wife, Heidi, put into his campaign actually came from a large loan from Goldman Sachs, where Mrs. Cruz works. The loan, for up to $500,000, was secured by holdings in a brokerage account at Goldman Sachs. The Cruz campaign called the failure to disclose the loan an honest mistake and said it would contact the election commission for guidance on how to amend its filings.The Citibank loan, also for as much as $500,000, was a line of credit, and it is not clear from Mr. Cruz\u2019s letter what collateral, if any, was used to obtain it. Mr. Cruz\u2019s presidential campaign has declined to answer questions from The Times about the Citibank loan.Kent Cooper, a former election commission official, said the letter from the Cruz campaign was still \u201clacking critical information\u201d that candidates must report, including the exact amount of the loans and whether there were any co-signers. Federal law required that those details, and more, were to be reported during the primary and general election campaigns.\u201cThis failure to disclose to the public,\u201d Mr. Cooper said, \u201cmeant voters in Texas did not have the required information.\u201dThe Times report about the Goldman Sachs loan surfaced in the Republican presidential debate Thursday night, when Mr. Cruz was asked how he could have overlooked disclosing it. Mr. Cruz suggested that the issue was overblown, dismissing it as a \u201cpaperwork error\u201d and saying he had disclosed the loans in another public filing.That filing is the annual personal disclosure, where members of Congress list their assets and income. On those reports, he listed the bank loans \u2014 without indicating that they were used for his campaign.It is the other type of report, which campaigns must file with the Federal Election Commission, that is at issue. On those reports, Mr. Cruz failed to disclose any bank loans he obtained to finance his Senate race. So, while it is true that Mr. Cruz listed the loans in his Senate reports, he has never disclosed in any report that they were used for his campaign.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Bitcoin Believer\u2019s Crisis of Faith", "Date": "2016-01-14", "News": "Supported byMike Hearn, a British computer programmer, holed up in his two-bedroom apartment in Zurich over several days and nights last week, writing a cri de coeur.Two years ago, Mr. Hearn quit a cushy programming job at Google\u2019s Swiss headquarters to devote himself full time to what was his great passion: the virtual currency Bitcoin. He was one of a handful of developers around the world dedicated to maintaining the basic software that governs both the creation of new Bitcoins and the network on which the financial transactions take place.But a nasty fight has torn apart the small brotherhood of Bitcoin developers and raised questions about the survival of the virtual currency. Mr. Hearn, until recently one of the most prominent leaders of the Bitcoin project, became so disillusioned that in December he sold the few hundred Bitcoins he had left and quietly took a job at a new start-up.The dispute \u2014 which grew out of a question about the number of transactions the Bitcoin network can handle \u2014 may sound like something of interest only to the most die-hard techies. But it has exposed fundamental differences about the basic aims of the Bitcoin project, and how online communities should be governed. The two camps have broadly painted each other as, on one side, populists who are focused on expanding Bitcoin\u2019s commercial potential and, on the other side, elitists who are more concerned with protecting its status as a radical challenger to existing currencies.The divide has led over the last six months to death threats against Bitcoin developers and hacking attacks that have taken down Internet providers. The sense of betrayal is strong on both sides. One of Mr. Hearn\u2019s primary antagonists, a bearded California-based programmer named Gregory Maxwell, also appears to have pulled back from his work on Bitcoin after receiving anonymous death threats.These internal struggles have surfaced at the same time that the Bitcoin technology is gaining credibility on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley. Throughout the various controversies that have plagued the virtual currency \u2014 including many instances of theft and fraud \u2014 the basic software has continued working as expected. That consistency has pushed the value of all outstanding Bitcoins above $6 billion and led many venture capitalists to imagine the technology as the future of finance, a cheaper and faster way to carry out financial transactions of all sorts.The current dispute, though, is a reminder that the Bitcoin software \u2014 like all computer code \u2014 is an evolving product of the human mind, and its deployment is vulnerable to human frailties and divergent ideals.There may yet be a middle ground on the question that began the fight, but for the moment the sides are deadlocked, and that has left the Bitcoin software \u2014 and the virtual currency itself \u2014 in a state of limbo. Mr. Hearn is convinced that the stalemate will soon make it hard to complete even simple transactions and will eventually drive away users and lead to a price collapse. Mr. Hearn\u2019s concerns about this impasse have been echoed, often in less strident tones, by a growing number of other developers, as well as by start-ups that buy, sell and hold Bitcoins.But Mr. Hearn is convinced it is already too late. During nighttime walks in the woods near his apartment in Zurich, he has been trying to figure out where Bitcoin went wrong and what it means for the idealistic beliefs that led him to the project in the first place.\u201cIt never occurred to me that the thing could just fall apart because of people getting crazy and having fundamental political disagreements over the goals of the project,\u201d Mr. Hearn said in a Skype interview from his apartment. \u201cIt\u2019s really shaken my faith in humanity.\u201dAt the time, Mr. Hearn was working on mapping software at Google, a job he\u2019d had since graduating from Durham University, in England. He had no professional involvement with finance or currencies, but the financial crisis convinced him that national currencies were vulnerable to politics and bad decision-making. When a web search led him to the primitive website for Bitcoin, he immediately emailed Satoshi, as the founder had become known.\u201cSo many questions,\u201d Mr. Hearn wrote. \u201cBut it\u2019s rare that I encounter truly revolutionary ideas.\u201dLike many of the programmers who took an early interest, Mr. Hearn admired the rule-bound nature of the system. Only 21 million Bitcoins would ever be created. And the distribution of new Bitcoins was clearly laid out, relying on mathematical algorithms that left no room for human meddling.Satoshi had written the software containing these rules, but after it was released, anyone could see the code and make changes. The people downloading this open-source software essentially voted on which changes to accept based on which version of the software they chose to use. If Satoshi proposed changes that they didn\u2019t like, they didn\u2019t have to download and run it, and anyone could offer an alternative. Bitcoin, like many other open-source projects, was a sort of leaderless democracy \u2014 a new way of governing human behavior online. One computer, one vote, with anyone able to propose new laws.It took a while for Bitcoin to catch on, but by late 2010, when Mr. Hearn started contributing to the code, the currency had begun developing a passionate following. The apparently leaderless structure and seamless functioning of the software won Bitcoin renown among libertarians and anarchists, and soon enough, among entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, drawn to the transparent, mathematical foundations of the project.Mr. Hearn was always a bit different from the rest of the core developers. Whereas most of them were classic techies, with patchy facial hair and ill-fitting clothes, the clean-cut Mr. Hearn had a taste for fashionable jeans and skateboard shoes \u2014 as well as an easy sociability. Within Google, Mr. Hearn became an informal spokesman for Bitcoin, answering queries from the Google co-founder Sergey Brin and leading an in-house email list discussion group that had attracted 400 employees by the time Mr. Hearn left.Mr. Hearn was also, along with Mr. Andresen, of a practical mind-set, most interested in improving the basic experience of holding and using Bitcoins. He was not given to making the big pronouncements common to the more ideological members of the community, about the currency displacing the dollar or euro. He was more focused on the immediate challenges that could trip it up.When tension cropped up among the developers, Mr. Andresen kept the peace by brokering compromises.The bonhomie began to fall apart last year because of what appeared to be a positive development: the continuing growth in the number of Bitcoin users and transactions.The problem was that, early on, Satoshi established a limit on the number of transactions that could be processed by the network every 10 minutes. The cap was meant to ensure that the computers supporting the network, and processing the transactions, would not be overwhelmed by an enormous quantity of data. But Satoshi had suggested that the limit should be temporary, and as the number of transactions coursing through the network inched closer to the cap, delays started to occur and transactions were not going through.For Mr. Maxwell, slower transactions seemed to be a secondary issue to protecting Bitcoin from centralized sources of authority.Mr. Hearn retorted that the technical issue wasn\u2019t such a big deal; ordinary computers could mostly process the larger blocks of transaction data. More important, he argued, was that Bitcoin needed to succeed first as a cheaper, faster payment network, like PayPal or Visa. If Bitcoin wanted to ever compete with mainstream payment systems, which could process tens of thousands of transactions a second, it would have to do away with Bitcoin\u2019s existing limit of fewer than seven transactions a second.The debate was complicated by the financial interests of the people involved. Mr. Maxwell and several of his supporters were then working for a Bitcoin start-up called Blockstream, with $21 million in funding from venture capitalists. Mr. Maxwell\u2019s start-up was trying to make it possible to break off some transactions from the Bitcoin network, making the number of transactions the network could handle less important.After leaving Google, Mr. Hearn had begun taking a salary for his Bitcoin work from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, one of the most prominent supporters of Bitcoin start-ups in Silicon Valley.As the debate grew increasingly fractious, friendships among the core developers fell apart.\u201cI cannot be the decider for network-level issues,\u201d Mr. van der Laan said via email this week. \u201cNo one \u2018owns\u2019 Bitcoin. No one can decide over Bitcoin as if it\u2019s some kind of company.\u201dMr. Hearn and Mr. Andresen ultimately decided late in the summer that the only way forward was to give the vote to the people actually using the Bitcoin software. They put together their own version of the core software \u2014 largely the same as the current software, but with an allowance for more transactions \u2014 which they called Bitcoin XT. If a clear majority of the system\u2019s users downloaded the software, it would become the new law of the land \u2014 what is known in open-source terminology as a fork.Forks are part of the open-source process and had been used to make small, agreed-upon fixes to Bitcoin. But no one had tried the sort of divisive fork that Mr. Hearn and Mr. Andresen devised, largely because of the risk that it could result in two incompatible Bitcoin networks and create questions about the legitimacy and value of existing Bitcoins.The release of Bitcoin XT was viewed by Mr. van der Laan and Mr. Maxwell as an act of betrayal. Yes, it was democratic, but they said that decisions about the core software should be made by technical experts \u2014 not by populist campaigns.The fight took on a new dimension when a powerful hacker distributed Bitkiller, malicious software that sought out computers that downloaded the Bitcoin XT software and overwhelmed them with traffic. One Internet provider on Long Island said the Bitkiller attacks brought down service for part of southern Long Island for several hours. The biggest American Bitcoin company, Coinbase, was taken entirely off-line for brief periods after declaring support for XT. Not surprisingly, this scared away many Bitcoin users from downloading the new software or even declaring support for it.The hacker responsible for the attack, who appeared to be based in Russia, told Mr. Hearn in an online exchange that someone \u201cpayed me for killing XT\u201d \u2014 though he declined to say who was responsible.In the late fall, Mr. Maxwell and his supporters tried to engineer a compromise. They organized meetings in Montreal and Hong Kong where the leading developers met to discuss alternative ways to scale the Bitcoin system. Mr. Andresen went to the first of these, where Mr. Maxwell\u2019s allies announced their own, more gradual plan for increasing the network\u2019s capacity. But Mr. Andresen and Mr. Hearn both felt that the recommendations didn\u2019t go far enough. Mr. Andresen, who is not normally given to sniping, began to harden his position.\u201cIt\u2019s likely that the current developers will get fired, and some other team will replace them because they are not listening to their customers,\u201d he said in an interview last week.Mr. Maxwell was equally dismissive of Mr. Hearn\u2019s camp \u2014 saying that they had politicized what should have been a technical decision. Then he suddenly dropped out of the conversation in mid-December. He has not explained his absence, but colleagues say he was tired of the rancor.Mr. Andresen said a number of large Bitcoin companies had been asking him to come back in and lead a new version of the Bitcoin software. But if he did return to his old role, he said, he would insist on clear rules about decision-making.Mr. Hearn says he thinks that getting the opposing camps together will now be very difficult. He believes that the dangers of the current impasse have not been reflected in the price of Bitcoin because the full debate has been censored in many of the online forums where Bitcoin is discussed.Despite the discord, Mr. Hearn has not lost faith in all of the ideas behind Bitcoin. The start-up in New York where he has taken a job, R3, is developing Bitcoin-like networks for banks to enable cheaper and faster ways to trade assets of all sorts. The start-up aims to take advantage of the less-centralized record-keeping methods of Bitcoin, but still allow for someone to be in charge, to handle the software and to manage access to the system.This work lacks the purity of Bitcoin, but after months of sleepless nights, fretting about betrayed promises, he said, \u201cI want to be in a professional environment again where people are grounded in some sort of business reality.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Walking the Walk in Hamilton\u2019s Old Stomping Grounds", "Date": "2016-01-21", "News": "Supported byJimmy Napoli is not throwing away his shot.\u201cA lot of us have been preaching about Hamilton for a very long time,\u201d said Mr. Napoli, 51, an owner of Outside In Tours who has written, lectured and been interviewed in a PBS documentary about the man whose face graces the $10 bill. \u201cHe\u2019s finally getting his due.\u201dStarting on Saturday, Mr. Napoli will be running a three-hour tour through Hamilton Heights and Washington Heights in Manhattan, filling in the blanks \u2014 and then some \u2014 for both newbies and groupies of the musical \u201cHamilton,\u201d those who are as obsessed as he is with the first secretary of the Treasury.On a dry run last weekend, Mr. Napoli met a reporter on the steps of the Morris-Jumel Mansion in Washington Heights, where the $50 tour begins. Mr. Napoli, like the man he so admires, is a force of nature, with the energy of an entire cast of actors. He\u2019s six feet tall \u2014 \u201cshorter than Washington, though taller than Hamilton\u201d \u2014 with long brown hair that he sometimes pulls back into a ponytail.Dressed in a black \u201cHamilton\u201d musical T-shirt (he has seen it twice), with an American flag scarf wrapped around his neck, Mr. Napoli looks more like a rock musician than a history buff. (He grew up in Queens and was once a roadie for the Ramones.)The mansion, tucked into a quiet corner near West 160th Street, was George Washington\u2019s headquarters in the fall of 1776 during the Battle of Harlem Heights, with strategic views of the city and the Harlem and Hudson Rivers. This is also where Aaron Burr, the former vice president who killed Hamilton in a duel, later lived. Walls are decorated with portraits of Burr and his second wife, Eliza Jumel.Mr. Napoli segues into Hamilton\u2019s humble beginnings on the Caribbean island of Nevis, born the illegitimate son of a Scotsman in 1755 or 1757 (scholars debate the date), though, he said, the musical\u2019s creator, Lin-Manuel Miranda, \u201csplits the difference and says 1756 in the play.\u201dHamilton\u2019s mother, of French Huguenot descent, died of yellow fever in 1768, leaving the boy an orphan. He inherited her book collection, \u201cconsuming every one of them,\u201d Mr. Napoli said.When he was a teenager, Hamilton\u2019s account of a hurricane\u2019s damage to the island, published in The Royal Danish American Gazette, impressed local businessmen, who collected money to send him to the American colonies to study. He ended up at King\u2019s College (now Columbia University), but after a year he joined the American Revolution.\u201cHe wanted to serve in the military,\u201d Mr. Napoli said, \u201cbecause in war, a man could advance beyond his social status.\u201d During the Battle of Brooklyn in August 1776, Hamilton stole British guns and cannons. Pacing around the mansion\u2019s first floor, Mr. Napoli gives a colorful description of the battle.It wasn\u2019t until the Battle of Harlem Heights that General Washington and Hamilton had their first encounter. \u201cHe realizes that this kid\u2019s got it together,\u201d Mr. Napoli explained. \u201cAnd for the next 22 years, Hamilton and Washington work side by side.\u201dOn cue, Mr. Napoli heads for a tour of the second floor, including the bedroom, which was Washington\u2019s war room. It\u2019s here where Mr. Miranda wrote part of his musical, using the room for inspiration.Mr. Napoli moves on to the dining room, where Washington, as president, held one of his first cabinet meetings with Hamilton, War Secretary Henry Knox, Vice President John Adams and Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson.As Washington\u2019s aide-de-camp, Hamilton essentially managed the war for the general, Mr. Napoli said. \u201cHe reprimanded other generals for him, set up his spy networks.\u201d He describes the victorious Battle of Yorktown, led by Hamilton, then moves on to the Constitutional Convention of 1787 and eventually the Federalist Papers, articles and essays that called for ratification of the United States Constitution.Hamilton wrote 51 of those 85 documents, \u201cwriting five or six essays a week while working as a lawyer at the same time, defending British loyalists who had had their land taken away,\u201d Mr. Napoli said.After the Constitution\u2019s passage, Hamilton set up the State Department, organized the War Department, created the United States Customs Service, the Coast Guard and the Treasury Department.\u201cHamilton was the man,\u201d Mr. Napoli said.Hamilton\u2019s role in creating a strong central government is covered, as well as the Reynolds Pamphlet from 1797, in which Hamilton admitted to an affair and the extortion by the woman\u2019s husband that followed. \u201cHe essentially says: \u2018I\u2019m not a crook. I\u2019m an adulterer,\u2019\u201d Mr. Napoli said.Around this time, Mr. Napoli leads the tour outside and down Edgecombe Avenue, along Highbridge Park, describing the neighborhood that has grown up around the mansion. He points out the so-called Triple Nickel building, at 555 Edgecombe, where Count Basie and Lena Horne both lived; Yankee Stadium rising in the distance; and Rucker Park, where Julius Erving played basketball. Up 150th Street and onto St. Nicholas Avenue, we pass Tsion Cafe, where his group can stop for coffee.The mile-long walking tour wends past the corner at 143rd Street and Convent Avenue, where Hamilton built his Federal-style house, now the Hamilton Grange National Memorial, moving uptown to the quiet country from Wall Street in 1802. That large yellow three-story home is where he lived after his eldest son, Philip, died in a duel, defending his father\u2019s honor over the sex scandal. It\u2019s also where Hamilton spent the last two years of his life.To make room for development, the home was moved a block from its original site in 1889, its balconies removed and the house squeezed next to St. Luke\u2019s Episcopal Church, where a large statue of Hamilton now stands out front. In 2008, the house was moved once more to West 141st Street and Hamilton Terrace, where it seems to have found its permanent spot.Inside the restored home, Mr. Napoli tells about the country\u2019s first national debt \u2014 to pay its soldiers and the countries that helped finance the Revolutionary War. He recounts Washington\u2019s death and eventually Hamilton\u2019s duel with Burr in Weehawken, N.J. Short of taking us in a rowboat across the Hudson to the scene of the duel, Mr. Napoli paints a vivid portrait of that 1804 showdown, using his own torso to show where Hamilton was fatally wounded.Finally, he tells us how for 50 years after Hamilton\u2019s death, his wife, Eliza, would collect his writings and tell his story, the one that Mr. Napoli has now passed on to us. We view the period rooms, decorated with Eliza\u2019s actual mirrored serving tray and re-creations of Hamilton\u2019s writing table, quill pens in place.And then it\u2019s off once again, this time around the corner to the Grange, a hip new bar and restaurant where his followers can have a convivial drink and maybe brunch. They can even continue the conversation and ask questions of Mr. Napoli, who\u2019s only just getting started.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the location of the Morris-Jumel Mansion. It is in Washington Heights, not Hamilton Heights.Jimmy Napoli leads two Hamilton tours, one in Harlem and the other around Wall Street, mostly on Saturdays and Tuesdays starting at 11 a.m. They are held rain or shine and can be booked online; hamiltonsnewyork\u00ad.com.Advertisement"}

For the next hour, three of the candidates will be answering the questions voters want answered.REGAN: So let\u2019s introduce them. Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: And former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: This debate will last one hour. Each candidate will have up to 90 seconds to respond to each question, one minute for each follow-up.REGAN: When your time is up, you are going to hear this bell.(BELL RINGS)REGAN: All right. So let\u2019s begin.In Tuesday\u2019s State of the Union Address, the president said that our economy is strong. He cited the significant decline we\u2019ve seen in unemployment rate and the millions of jobs that have been created.What is your assessment of the economy right now? And I would like to hear from all of you on this one, beginning with Ms. Fiorina.CARLY FIORINA (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, thank you. Good evening. If I may begin by saying how honored I am to be standing here with two former Iowa Caucus winners.Governor, Senator.And how honored I am to be talking with all of you. You know, I\u2019m not a political insider. I haven\u2019t spent my lifetime running for office. The truth is I have had and been blessed by a lot of opportunities to do a lot of things in my life.And unlike another woman in this race, I actually love spending time with my husband.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)FIORINA: I\u2019m standing here because I think we have to restore a citizen government in this country. I think we have to end crony capitalism. The crony capitalism that starts with both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.You know, Hillary Clinton sits inside government and rakes in millions, handing out access and favors. And Donald Trump sits outside government and rakes in billions buying people like Hillary Clinton.The state of our economy is not strong. We have record numbers of men out of work. We have record numbers of women living in poverty. We have young people who no longer believe that the American dream applies to them.We have working families whose wages have stagnated for decades, all while the rich get richer, the powerful get more powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected get more connected.Citizens, it\u2019s time to take our country back.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Governor Huckabee, same question to you. Where do you see the country right now?MIKE HUCKABEE (R), FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I wish I saw the country in the same place that the president presented it to be the other night in the State of the Union. He talked about how great the economy was doing. And I guess for the people he hangs out with, it\u2019s probably doing great.But the president should\u2019ve stood in the line at the layaway counter at Walmart just before Christmas. He would have heard a very different story about the economy of America.HUCKABEE: I wish I could introduce him the lady who cleans the building where our campaign headquarters is located in Little Rock. Her name is Kathleen (ph). She works all day at a local hospital cleaning, and then she goes to the building where a bank, and our headquarters, and other offices are she spends another seven hours. She works 15 hours a day.I guarantee you she\u2019s not working 15 hours a day because she loves scrubbing toilets, and sweeping floors. She\u2019s working that many hours because that\u2019s what it takes for her to make it work.And, she\u2019s not alone. There are people all over this country who are working like that. Many of them working two jobs \u2014 and they used to have one job, and that would take care of them. But, because of wage stagnation, which we\u2019ve had for 40 years, because the fact that they\u2019re punished for working harder if they work that many hours. The government gets more of their second shift than they do.And, as a result there are a lot of people who are hurting today. I wish the President knew more of them. He might make a change in the economy and the way he\u2019s managing it.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Thank you Governor Huckabee. Senator Santorum?SANTORUM: Well, all he has to do is listen to the Democratic debate and find out how bad the economy is. All they do is complain about the hollowing out of the middle of America, and how America is struggling so badly, and have to make these radical changes in Washington.But they\u2019ve been in control for the last seven years, and what have we seen? The most important jobs, I believe, in this country are the ones that fill the middle. For the 74% of Americans who don\u2019t have a college degree between the age of 25 and 65 are manufacturing jobs. Your governor, and your legislature, and your team here have done an amazing job of bringing manufacturing jobs back to South Carolina.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)SANTORUM: Right here. Right here in Charleston, right down in the street in Boeing (ph). You\u2019ve done a great job, and what\u2019s happened? You\u2019ve grown this economy, you\u2019ve strengthened the center of your state, the middle. That\u2019s because you know that if you\u2019re really going to create wealth and opportunity, you got to get jobs, and good paying jobs for everybody.And, so what\u2019s happened? Two million jobs, manufacturing jobs, have left this country because of Barack Obama. Regulations, EPA, workplace regulations, things driving people off-shore all because of his number one priority, global climate change.Well, let me tell you this, Mr. President. For every dollar of GDP, China creates five times as much pollution as we do here. You want to \u2014 lower global climate change, bring those jobs back to America and let American workers do that job with less pollution.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Thank you, Senator Santorum. Thank you, candidates.Moving to the world stage. The middle east is on the brink of chaos. Iran continues to provoke the United States, North Korea claims it\u2019s tested a hydrogen bomb, and Afghanistan is in danger of falling back into Taliban hands. Critics of the administration say it\u2019s all due to lack of U.S. leadership.To you, Mrs. Fiorina, how do you see America\u2019s role in the world today?FIORINA: America must lead because when we do not lead, when this exceptional nation does not lead, the world is more dangerous and a more tragic place.Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, they all refuse to lead. Worse, they refuse to respond when this nation is provoked. Hillary Clinton famously asked what difference does it make how four Americans died in Benghazi?Mrs. Clinton, here\u2019s what difference it makes. When you do not stand up and say the truth, that this was a purposeful terrorist attack, when you do not say the United States of America will retaliate for that attack, terrorists assume it\u2019s open season.We have refused to respond to every provocation. The President wouldn\u2019t even mention the fact that Iran had taken two Navy boats and our sailors \u2014 hostage. He didn\u2019t mention the fact that they violated the Geneva convention. He didn\u2019t respond to the fact that Iran launched two ballistic missile just a short time ago, in direct violation of a deal they had just signed. We didn\u2019t respond to the fact that North Korea attacked Sony Pictures.When we refuse to respond over, and over to provocation and bad behavior, we will get more provocation and bad behavior. I know most of our allies personally. I have met many of our adversaries. I know our military and our intelligence capability, and I know this. When we will not stand with our allies, when we will not respond to our adversaries, when we do not lead in the world the world is a dangerous and tragic place. I will be a Commander in Chief who will lead.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Thank you.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Well, since we\u2019ve been talking about the Middle East, Senator Santorum, conflicts between Saudi Arabia and Iran have certainly escalated, amid accusations that Saudi Arabia bombed the Iranian Embassy in Yemen after the Saudi Embassy in Tehran was attacked.As we confront an increasingly unstable Middle East, how will you, as president, navigate this administration\u2019s promises to Iran while standing by our historic allies in the region?RICK SANTORUM (R-PA), FORMER SENATOR, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, the historic promises that we have made to \u2014 to Iran in this agreement need to be torn up on the first day in office of the next president.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: And let me tell you why, because Iran has already torn it up. Iran has not approved the agreement that President Obama has said that they have approved. They have approved a different agreement in their parliament.The fact of the matter is they have violated this agreement. Carly just mentioned some of those violations.They have launched ballistic missiles, tested them, in clear violation.And here\u2019s the pathetic part. The president announced that they were going to impose sanctions. And then President Rouhani went on Twitter and said there would be retaliation.And what did we do?We backed down.Ladies and gentlemen, there are 50 some Citadel cadets in this audience tonight.(APPLAUSE) SANTORUM: I would ask them to stand up if they will. And here\u2019s what I want to tell each and every one of them, as you stand. Here\u2019s what I want to tell them.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: Whether it\u2019s you\u2019re watching that movie this weekend that just came out when we abandoned our men and women in Benghazi, or whether it\u2019s we treat Iran, that gave courtesies to our sailors, as they made them record a hostage video, let me tell you this, if you choose to serve this country, I will have your back. I will not let America be trampled upon anymore by these radical jihadists.REGAN: Thank you, Senator Santorum.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Governor Huckabee, in Afghanistan, the Taliban is strengthening. Attacks are on the rise and thousands more civilians have been wounded or killed. Much of the Taliban surge can be attributed to the withdrawal of U.S. forces there.You have expressed skepticism with the war there, saying you see no end game in sight.What, then, is your solution to the growing conflict there?MIKE HUCKABEE (R-AK), FORMER GOVERNOR, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Let me put that in context. When I went to Afghanistan, I saw a land that looked like the land of the Flintstones. It was desolate. It was barren. It was primitive.And it\u2019s been that way for thousands of years. They want to take the world back to be just like that.We don\u2019t.We need to make a clear goal as to why we want to be anywhere in the Middle East, and I\u2019ll tell you why we want to be and need to be, is to destroy radical Islam and everything that threatens civilization. It\u2019s not just a threat...(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: \u2014 to Israel or to America, it\u2019s a threat to every civilized person on this Earth. And we need to be equipping not only the Kurds in Iraq, we need to be making sure that those who are willing to fight radical Muslims will do it, but we need to never ever spend a drop of American blood unless there is a clearly defined goal and we can\u2019t make sure we win unless we have a military that\u2019s the strongest in the history of mankind.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.We\u2019ve got to rebuild our navy. It\u2019s the smallest navy we\u2019ve had since 1915, when my grandfather got on a destroyer in World War I when he was in the U.S. Navy. We\u2019ve got young men in Air Force B-52s, one in particular, he\u2019s flying a B-52 that his father flew in the \u201980s and his grandfather flew in the \u201950s. Those planes are older than me.We\u2019ve got to have a military that the world is afraid of, use it sparingly, but when we do, the whole world will know that America is on their tail and they will be on their tail on the ground, never ever to rise up again.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Governor Huckabee, if I could just follow-up with that.Do we need to be in Afghanistan?HUCKABEE: Only if there is a concerted effort to destroy the advance of radical Islamists who are against us. As far as what are we going to make it look like. Frankly, I don\u2019t know what we can make it look like. You can\u2019t create for other people a desire for freedom and democracy.And frankly, that is not the role of the United States. The role of the United States military is not to build schools, it is not to build bridges, it is not to go around and pass out food packets.It is to kill and destroy our enemy and make America safe and that is the purpose we should be there if we\u2019re going to be there.REGAN: Thank you Governor Huckabee.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Ms. Fiorina, nearly 600 women say they were attacked in a German city on New Year\u2019s Eve by men of Arab or North African descent and 45 percent of those alleged attacks were sexual assaults. Twenty-two of those 32 men arrested so far are asylum-seekers. Are you worried about similar problems in the United States?FIORINA: Of course I\u2019m worried about similar problems in the United States. We can not allow refugees to enter this country unless we can adequately vet them and we know we can\u2019t. Therefore we should stop allowing refugees into this country.(APPLAUSE)FIORINA: And by the way, we do not need to be lectured about why we\u2019re angry and frustrated and fearful because we\u2019ve had an illegal immigration problem in this country for 25 years.(APPLAUSE)FIORINA: And we have every right to be frustrated about the fact that politicians stand up in election after election after election and promise us to fix the problem and yet, it has never been fixed.I offer leadership that understands that actions speak louder than words, that results count. We must secure our border. We must fix our broken immigration system. We must enforce a pro-American immigration system that serves our interests, not the rest of the world. I understand what it takes to translate goals into results and that is what I will do as president of the United States. Of course, we should be worried, for heavens sakes.This administration has now told us they don\u2019t know who has overstayed a visa. This administration has told us they don\u2019t even bother to check Facebook or Twitter to find out who\u2019s pledging allegiance to jihadis. We can do better than this, citizens. We need to take our country back.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: I want to stay with you on this. The world shares a common enemy right now in the way of ISIS. Russia, the European Union, Saudi Arabia, Iran, China, we all agree ISIS is a threat and it must be stopped.During World War II, the world partnered with Joseph Stalin, who was arguably one of the most formidable \u2014 despicable figures of the 20th century. But they partnered with him to fight the Nazis.Today, everyone seems to agree we need some kind of coalition to fight ISIS. Do you agree with that? And if so, would your coalition include possibly, Russia and Iran?FIORINA: We need to be very clear-eyed now about who are our allies and who are our adversaries. In the fight against ISIS, Saudi Arabia is our ally. Iran is our adversary. And despite Donald trump\u2019s bromance with Vladmir Putin, Vladmir Putin and Russia are our adversary. We can not...(APPLAUSE)FIORINA: We can not outsource leadership in the Middle East to Iran and Russia. We must stand and lead. The Kuwaitis, the Jordanians, the Saudis, Egyptians, Bahrainis (sic), the Emirates, the Kurds. I know virtually all of these nations and their leaders. And they have asked us for very specific kinds of support: bombs, material, arms, intelligence.We are not providing any of it today. I will provide all of it. We have allies who will stand up and help us deny ISIS territory, which is what we must do to defeat them. We must deny them territory. They will help us do this. And yes, we need a coalition.But only in the United States of America can lead such a coalition. I will lead it. But we must be clear-eyed through this fight. Iran is our adversary. Russia is our adversary. We can never outsource our leadership. Only the United States of America can lead to defeat ISIS. I will.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Ms. Fiorina, thank you.SMITH: All right, thank you, candidates. We\u2019re just getting started. Jobs, Homeland Security, gun rights, all those issues are coming up straight ahead. We\u2019re live from North Charleston and the Republican Presidential Debate. We\u2019ll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Welcome back, everyone, to the Republican presidential debate. On to the next round of questions \u2014 Sandra.SMITH: All right, let\u2019s get started. Senator Santorum, to you first. President Obama has urged technology leaders to make it hard for terrorists to use technology to escape from justice. Hillary Clinton says social media companies can help by swiftly shutting down terrorist accounts.The companies say that they\u2019re already working with law enforcement and any proposed legislation would do more harm than good. Should companies like Facebook and Twitter be required by law to more actively \u2014 be more actively engaged in fighting terror?SANTORUM: I would just say that if we were doing a better job within the government, we wouldn\u2019t need the private sector to do the things that we\u2019re asking them to do.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: I\u2019ve had a little experience in this in the private sector myself. And what I found was a government with layers and layers of bureaucracy, of people who had some technical expertise but they had no authority, number one.And one of the things I found out about in the bureaucracy is if a lot of people have authority, nobody has authority, number one. And number two, that if you don\u2019t do anything, you don\u2019t get fired.It\u2019s only when you do something and something goes wrong, you get fired. So they do nothing. And that\u2019s what is happening in our Defense Department right now. We have a capability that they\u2019re trying to develop to play defense.We have a lot of technologists that are very skilled. And they\u2019re trying to figure out how to play defense. But what we don\u2019t have is we don\u2019t have folks who are thinking about offense.We don\u2019t have war-fighters. We have technologists. Technologists are not war-fighters. Technologists are thinking, how do I protect cyber-security, how do I secure, how do I protect?SANTORUM: And we need to have a much more dynamic, how do we \u2014 how do we go after them?How do we respond?And we need leadership that\u2019s willing to make sure that when someone attacks us \u2014 and ladies and gentlemen, they\u2019re attacking us as we speak. They\u2019re attacking us all day every day, not just the government, but they\u2019re attacking private sector companies all day every day.They have to learn that we\u2019re going to pay \u2014 they\u2019re going to pay a price when they do so.And then right now, just like in every other aspect of our national security, people who attack us are not paying a price. We need a leader who will make sure that they know when they mess with America, they\u2019re going to pay a price.SMITH: Senator, would you \u2014 would you require anything of those companies like Facebook and Twitter if you were president?SANTORUM: Look, Facebook and Twitter can teach us things. We can cooperate with them. We can share ideas and information. But this is a \u2014 and this is a very dicey area for the government to go in and require the industry to do its job.It needs to develop that capability. We need to be \u2014 have responsible dialogue, but I don\u2019t think requirements are the order of the day.SMITH: Thank you, Senator.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Ms. Fiorina, the president has just issued an executive order to expand the gun laws and background checks. And none of you on stage agree with this.But recent polls show the majority of Americans are in favor of universal background checks.(BOOS)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not in this room.REGAN: It\u2019s the poll data.(CROSSTALK)FIORINA: And we all believe the polling data all the time, don\u2019t we?REGAN: So tell me...(APPLAUSE)REGAN: \u2014 why, in your view, is the president\u2019s proposal a problem?FIORINA: Oh, it\u2019s a problem for so many reasons.First of all, it is yet another lawless executive order. You see, he doesn\u2019t like the fact that Congress has rejected his ideas twice on a bipartisan basis, so he\u2019s decided he just gets to override them.Sorry, Mr. President, not the way \u201cThe Constitution\u201d works.Secondly...(APPLAUSE)FIORINA: \u2014 secondly, he basically admitted in that speech that he hasn\u2019t been paying much attention to enforcing the laws we have. He said, gee, we need a few more FBI agents. That would have helped, perhaps, stop a tragedy here in South Carolina with Dylann Roof, a guy who clearly never should have been sold a gun.In other words, Mr. President, you\u2019re right, we need to enforce the laws we have. Let\u2019s enforce the laws we have. There are criminals running around with guns who shouldn\u2019t have them. We don\u2019t prosecute any of them. Less than 1 percent.But I want to go back to the technology issue for a moment, if I may, as well, because in this regard, I disagree with Senator Santorum. Look, I come from the technology industry and I can tell you there is one thing that bureaucracies don\u2019t know how to do. They do not know how to innovate.We have come seven generations of technology since 2011. We have bureaucracies that are incapable of bringing in that innovation.So, yes, there are some very specific things that we should ask the private sector to help us with, including making sure we have the latest and greatest in algorithms to search through all these databases so that we find terrorists before they attack us, not after it\u2019s too late.And, finally, when a president who understands technology in the Oval Office. Mrs. Clinton, actually, you cannot wipe a server with a towel.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Ms. Fiorina, you\u2019ve said that was when you were CEO of HP, you actually worked with the government.FIORINA: Yes, and see...REGAN: \u2014 to try and combat some of these terrorist threats.FIORINA: As CEO of Hewlett Packard...REGAN: What did you do?FIORINA: As CEO of Hewlett Packard, I was asked very specifically for some very real help. The help I was asked to provide, this is now public information. So I am not revealing what \u2014 something that was \u2014 was classified.We had a very large shipment of equipment, software and hardware, headed to a retail outlet. And I was called by the head of the NSA, who had an urgent need for that capability, to begin laying out a program to track terrorists.History suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.We turned that truck around on a highway and it was escorted to the headquarters in San Jose.In World War II, our government went to the private sector and said, help us do things that we cannot do.The private sector has capabilities that the government does not have. There are some legal authorities that are required.The Sony attack could have been detected and repelled, had legal authorities been passed in Congress allowing private networks and public networks to work together.Those legal authorities have not yet been passed.Yes, I was asked to help.(RINGS BELL)FIORINA: I know the technology industry. They will help again. But they must be asked by a president who understands what they have.REGAN: Ms. Fiorina, thank you.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: All right, Governor Huckabee, you called President Obama\u2019s executive orders on gun control unconstitutional and completely insane.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: (LAUGHING) Yes, I did.SMITH: You even told gun store owners to ignore the President\u2019s orders.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Yet, innocent people are dying from gun violence in cities like Detroit, Chicago, and Charleston everyday. Is there anything that can be done at the federal level to prevent guns from falling into the hands of criminals?HUCKABEE: Well, why don\u2019t we start by making sure the Justice Department never does an idiotic program like Fast and Furious where the U.S. Government put guns...(CHEERING)HUCKABEE: ...in the hands of Mexican drug lords...(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: ...and end up killing one of our border agents. You know, they want to talk about law abiding citizens, I just find it amazing the President keeps saying the gun show loophole. There is no gun show loophole. I promise you I\u2019ve been to more gun shows than President Obama.SMITH: (LAUGHING)HUCKABEE: And, I\u2019ve bought more weapons at them, and you fill out forms. The President also says things that it\u2019s easier to get a gun now than it is to grow trees. Again, I purchase guns, and I can assure you that it is much more difficult to purchase a firearm than it is to get the ingredients of a salad at the supermarket.What the President keeps pushing are ideas that have never worked. Ideas that would not have stopped San Bernadino, Sandy Hook, Aurora, and at some point you wonder if you keep retrying things that don\u2019t work, maybe we should just see if we could resell all those used lottery tickets that didn\u2019t work real well because that\u2019s the logic of just keep doing the same thing, but something that has failed. Of course, we want to stop gun violence, but the one common thing that has happened in most mass shootings is that they happened in gun- free zones where people who would have been law abiding citizens, who could have stood up and at least tried to stop it and we\u2019re not allowed to under the law.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Thank you, Governor Huckabee.REGAN: Governor Huckabee, an American in San Bernardino murdered 14 people while terrorists with Belgian and French passports murdered 130 people. Were facing a threat within our borders, and from outside the United States. Those European terrorists, they could have come here at any time given that we have a visa waiver program that enables people to travel back and forth. It exists within those countries, and 36 others.In countries around the world, including many in Europe, cannot ensure that their citizens are not jihadists, why are we waiving the visa requirement at all?HUCKABEE: Well, we shouldn\u2019t be and that\u2019s one of the reasons that I think there a lot of voices in our country who are saying it\u2019s time to relook (ph) at the visa program. The European Union is a failure, it\u2019s not allowed for even the economic goals that they were trying to achieve.But, what we\u2019re not seeing is that it\u2019s making Europe less safe, and it\u2019s proven not to be exactly what they all thought it was going to be.Our first and foremost responsibility in this country, and the first responsibility of the President of the United States is protect America, and protect Americans. We have a President who seems to be more interested in protecting the reputation and image of Islam than he is protecting us. And, I want to be very clear...(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: ...that this President.(CHEERING)HUCKABEE: Makes comments like he did the other night, that we have to be so careful because we don\u2019t want to offend Muslims. He needs to read his own FBI crime stats from last year which would show him that of the hate crimes in the country, over 5,500, about 1,100 were religious hate crimes. And, of those, 58% were directed toward Jews. Only 16% directed toward Muslims.Maybe what the President should have talked about the other night is how we ought to be more careful in the anti-semitic comments that are going toward American Jews than toward Muslims because by three times as many...(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: ...they\u2019re being targeted for religious hate crime.REGAN: If you get the visa waiver program, does that shut down international commerce?HUCKABEE: It does not shut down international commerce, but it may slow it down. And, you don\u2019t want to slowdown commerce that is making us safer. It\u2019s worth it. This lady who came and joined with the San Bernardino killer had passed three background checks, and that\u2019s why a lot of Americans didn\u2019t buy it when the President said we\u2019ll bring in Syrian refugees, but don\u2019t worry we\u2019ll check them out.We have a lot of confidence in a president who told us that we could keep our doctor, we could keep our health insurance, and cost us less, and now the latest is if you like your gun you can keep it too, and frankly, we don\u2019t buy it. We don\u2019t believe it. He\u2019s lost his credibility, and his inept...(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: ...inability to work with Congress and pass legislation has led him to do what I never even imagined doing as a governor, and that\u2019s just going and doing it my own way.MOREHUCKABEE: That\u2019s why we elect a president, is to lead, is to be able to shepherd things through. And if I can do it with a 90 percent Democrat legislature in Arkansas, there is no excuse for any president not being able to lead in Washington if he knows what the heck he is doing when he gets there.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Thank you, Governor Huckabee.SMITH: Senator Santorum, many of our military leaders believe America\u2019s critical infrastructure is vulnerable to a terrorist attack. This is the power in our homes, the water we drink, the Internet and phone systems by which we stay connected.If attacked, these essential services that underpin American society could come to a grinding halt. Do you have a specific plan to protect us from this type of attack?SANTORUM: Well, the most devastating attack that could occur is an electromagnetic pulse attack, and that would be an attack that would be triggered by a nuclear explosion in the upper atmosphere of our country.The best way to stop that from happening is to make sure that those who contemplating and actually war-gaming and talking about using it, Iran, doesn\u2019t get a nuclear weapon so they can\u2019t explode that device.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: And the president of the United States has put Iran on a path to a nuclear weapon. And we have done nothing to do anything to harden our grid. There is actually a bill in Congress that would put money forward to try to put redundancy and harden our electric grid so it could actually survive an EMP.An EMP is a devastating explosion that sends a pulse that knocks out all electric, everything, everything that is connected to any kind \u2014 that is wired, that has a circuit board gets fried out. Everything is gone. Cars stop. Planes fall out of the sky.This is a devastating attack. And this president has done nothing, number one, to take the most probable person to \u2014 probable country to launch an attack and stop them, and has done nothing to try to defend us, particularly our electric grid. The bottom line is, I put the original sanctions on the Iranian nuclear program when I was in the United States Senate. I\u2019ve been fighting for 12 years with one thing in mind, that we must stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. And...(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: Because they\u2019re different than every other country. They do not want a nuclear weapon to defend themselves. They want a nuclear weapon to have theological ends to bring about their mahdi so they can control the world. And that is the most serious threat facing this country right now.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Senator Santorum, I want to stay with you on this, moving to jobs and the economy. In his State of the Union Address the other night, President Obama touted his record on jobs, citing more than 14 million new jobs and boasted of nearly 900,000 manufacturing jobs added in the past six years.Do you dispute his track record of creating jobs?SANTORUM: Well, the numbers just don\u2019t add up. I mean, they have not added manufacturing jobs. Manufacturing jobs have been lost in this country, 2 million of them. The bottom line is that this president has done more to take jobs away from the hard-working people who are struggling the most.And that\u2019s folks who are, as I said, the 74 percent of Americans who don\u2019t have a college degree. And they\u2019re out there talking about, well, we\u2019re going to provide free college for everybody. Well, who is going to pay for it? The 74 percent that don\u2019t have a college degree.They\u2019re not \u2014 nobody is focused. Let\u2019s just be honest, nobody is focused on the people who are struggling the most in America today. We talk about immigration. Talk about the president\u2019s immigration plan. He wants to bring in more and more people into this country. Let people who are here illegally stay in this country.Almost all of the people who are here illegally, and most of the people who came here legally over the last 20 years, they\u2019re working in wage-earning jobs. That is why wages have flat-lined.And we have unfortunately two political parties with most of the candidates in this field for some form of amnesty, some form of allowing people to stay here even though they\u2019re here illegally and for increasing levels of legal immigration.I\u2019m someone who believes that we need to be the party that stands for the American worker. And when we say we need to send people back, I mean we send people back.And let me just make one point. I was in Storm Lake, Iowa, the other day, near a Tyson\u2019s plant, 91 percent of the kids that go to the elementary school there are minority kids. And they said, well, what are you going to do with all of these people, their families, they\u2019ve lived here for a long time?I said, I\u2019m going to give them a gift. I\u2019m going to give them a gift of being able to help the country they were born in.Merge adds XXX were born in.SANTORUM: And I\u2019m going to export America, the education they were able to see. They learned English language. They learned about capitalism. They learned about democracy. You want to stop flow of immigrants?Let\u2019s send six million Mexicans, Hondurans, Guatemalans, El Savadorians...(BELL RINGS)... back into their country, so they can start a renaissance in their country so they won\u2019t be coming over here anymore.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Senator Santorum, thank you.SMITH: Governor Huckabee, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Admiral Mike Mullen, has said the greatest threat to our security is our national debt.Our national debt is now on pace to top $19 trillion. Yet, you as well as Ms. Fiorina have laid forward no plan to reform entitlements. How can you say you\u2019re going to pay down our country\u2019s debt without cutting Social Security or Medicare?HUCKABEE: Well, first of all, let\u2019s just remember that Social Security is not the government\u2019s money, it belongs to the people who had it taken out of their checks involuntarily their entire working lives.(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: For the government to say, well it is fault of working people that we have a Social Security problem, no. It is the fault of a government that used those people\u2019s money for something other than protecting those people\u2019s accounts. So let\u2019s not blame them and punish them.(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: But here is a fact, and I sometimes hear Republicans say well, we\u2019re going to have to cut this and extend the age. You know what I think a lot of times when I hear people say, well, let\u2019s make people work to their 70. That sounds great for white-collar people who sat at a desk most of their lives. You ever talk to somebody that stood on concrete floor for the first 40 years of their working life? Do you think they can stand another five years or 10 years, many of them will retired virtually crippled because they worked hard. And we\u2019re going to punish them some more? I don\u2019t think so. Here\u2019s the fact.(APPLAUSE)HUCAKBEE: Four percent economic growth, we fully fund Social Security and Medicare. Our problem is not that Social Security is just too generous to seniors. It isn\u2019t. Our problem is that our politicians have not created the kind of policies that would bring economic growth.And I still support strongly that we get rid of the 77,000 pages of the monstrous tax code...(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: ... pass the fair tax, supercharge this economy with the rocket fuel that happens with the consumption tax and we don\u2019t have to cut Social Security to any senior who has worked their lifetime for it.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Thank you, Governor Huckabee.SMITH: OK. We\u2019re going to continue this conversation. We\u2019re taking a quick break and then coming up, the candidates\u2019 plans for strengthening the middle class. We\u2019re live in North Charleston with the Republican Presidential Debate. We\u2019ll be right back.MORE(APPLAUSE)(COMMERICAL BREAK)REGAN: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate live from North Charleston.We want to jump right back in.Sandra is kicking it off.SMITH: All right, thanks, Trish.Well, let\u2019s get started with Ms. Fiorina.Today, the middle class represents about 50 percent of the U.S. population, down from about 61 percent back in 1971. That\u2019s according to Pew Research. The same research revealed a widening income gap in America. The rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer.What will you do to strengthen a middle class that is no longer the majority?FIORINA: For decades, the professional political class in both parties has been talking about the middle class. For decades, Republicans in particular have been talking about reducing the size and scope of government, spending less money, reducing the complexity.And yet, for 40 years, the government has gotten bigger and more expensive.We now have a 75,000 plus page tax code, although politicians have run for office for decades promising reform. And all the while, middle class incomes have stagnated.You see, when government gets bigger and bigger, more powerful, the rich get richer, the poor get poorer and the middle class gets squeezed.We need to understand who the job creators are in this country, because we need more jobs to grow the middle class and to grow the wages of the middle class.Who creates jobs?Small businesses, new businesses, family-owned businesses. (APPLAUSE)FIORINA: They create two thirds of the new jobs in this country and they employ half the people.I started out typing for a nine person real estate firm. My husband Frank started out driving a tow truck for a family-owned auto body shop. And we are crushing small businesses and destroying the middle class.So here\u2019s my blueprint to take back America. Let us first actually reform the tax code from 73,000 pages down to three. There\u2019s a 20-year-old plan to do exactly that.And then let us begin piece by piece to focus on every single dollar the government spends, so that we will spend less overall and still have enough for our priorities. And that requires the government to budget the way you do at home \u2014 examine every dollar, cut any dollar, move any dollar. The fancy term for that is zero- based budgeting, but I call it common sense.Citizens, we\u2019ve got to take our country back.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Thank you, Ms. Fiorina.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Governor Huckabee, you know it used to be you could graduate from high school and get a pretty good job at the local factory, enough to take care of your family and yourself. Those days seem to be gone. It\u2019s pretty hard to do that nowadays.Businesses are increasingly turning to automation to increase their productivity levels. It\u2019s happening right here, in fact, at the Boeing factory in North Charleston.The president says automation threatens workers\u2019 ability to get higher wages.Do you agree with that?And if so, do you have a solution?HUCKABEE: Let me go back to the reason so many people are having a hard time getting ahead. The tax system punishes them.Think about this. If you work really hard and you start moving up the economic ladder, you get bumped into a different tax bracket. So the government thinks it deserves more of your hard work than you do.And it\u2019s one of the reasons that no matter how many different reforms you have to a tax on people\u2019s productivity, you\u2019re still taxing their work, their savings. You\u2019re taxing their capital gains, inheritance, dividends, you\u2019re taxing everything that produces something.And it\u2019s way I really believe it\u2019s time to do something bold, not something minute. This is no time for a tap of the hammer, a twist of the screwdriver. It\u2019s time for something big. That\u2019s why the fair tax transforms our economy.(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: And we don\u2019t punish workers. It\u2019s the only way we\u2019re going to get middle class people moving ahead again, because the harder they work, the more they keep. No payroll tax deducted from their checks. They get their entire paycheck.(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: And, one of the most important parts, it\u2019s built on the common sense with which we raised our kids, and trained dogs. You reward behavior you want more of. And, you punish behavior you want less of. That\u2019s how I raise kids, it\u2019s how I trained our dogs, and folks, it\u2019s not that difficult.We now punish the behavior we say we want more of by taxing it, and we reward the behavior that we say we want less of, so if you make a good investment, we punish you with a tax. If you make a bad investment you can write that off and the rest of the taxpayers will help subsidize you, and bail you out.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Thank you very much, Governor Huckabee.Senator Santorum, 40% of babies born today are born to single moms. That\u2019s twice as high as reported back in 1980, and it\u2019s 11 times as high as in 1940. Studies show that children are always better off economically, most often \u2014 and emotionally, with two parents in a household. From a policy perspective, should the government be doing anything to encourage family formation?SANTORUM: You know, we\u2019ve had this debate about the economy, and we haven\u2019t talked the one issue now increasingly even the right, and even the are coming to agreement. I\u2019ve run around doing 300 town hall meetings talking about a book written by a liberal Harvard sociologist, not a normal thing for me to be talking about, but I now name Robert Putnam who wrote a book called, \u201cOur Kids\u201d.And, he wrote this book, I think, ostensibly to support the Democratic argument that the middle of America\u2019s hollowing out, and income gap is widening, and rich are getting richer. When he studied all the information as to what was going on, he realized that the biggest reason that we\u2019re seeing the hollowing out of the middle of America is the breakdown of the American family.The reality is that if you\u2019re a single parent \u2014 a child of a single parent, and you grew up in a single parent family neighborhood, you went to that single parent family school, the chance of you ever, ever reaching the top 20% of income earners is 3% in America. At least \u2014 I don\u2019t know about you, but that\u2019s not good enough. And, we have been too politically correct in this country because we don\u2019t want to offend anybody to fight for the lives of our children. (APPLAUSE)You want \u2014 You want to be shocked? You read the first few chapters of Mr. \u2014 Dr. Putnam\u2019 book. He talks about Port Clinton, Ohio and growing up there in the 1950\u2019s, and how poor kids actually survived and did well, even though they were poor and disadvantaged. But, then he goes to the towns today and these kids are failing, and failing miserably. They don\u2019t even have a shot, and we won\u2019t even have the courage to have leadership at the federal level \u2014 not with legislation, but the most powerful tool a president have, the bully pulpit to encourage each and everyone of you, churches and businesses, and educators, and community leaders to let\u2019s have a national campaign to rebuild the American family, and give every child its birthright which is a Mom and a Dad who loves them.That will change this economy.(CHEERING & APPLAUSE)REGAN: Thank you.SMITH: Thank you, Senator.We\u2019re not finished yet. More Republican Presidential Debate in North Charleston after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)SMITH: Welcome back, it\u2019s time for the closing statements. Candidates will each get one minute, starting with Senator Santorum.Thank you very much, I want to thank the people of Charleston, which has become a little bit of a second home to me, because I am very privileged to have two young men who go to the Citadel here and they\u2019re here tonight, my son John and my son Daniel.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: Ladies and gentlemen, America is frustrated and angry and looking for someone who\u2019s a fighter, but I also think they\u2019re looking for someone who\u2019s a winner. Somebody who can go out there and take on the establishment and make a difference. And take on someone who\u2019s going to be the person who\u2019s going to be between a Republican holding the presidency and that\u2019s Hillary Clinton.And there\u2019s one person on this stage, one person in the race who\u2019s done it and done it repeatedly. I\u2019ve taken on Hillary Clinton on the issues you care about. Partial-birth abortion.Go and google Rick Santorum and Hillary Clinton and there you\u2019ll see a five-minute debate. I\u2019ll let you decide who won the debate. I\u2019ll tell you who won, because we passed the bill and I know I\u2019m out of time but I\u2019m going to take some of Rand Paul\u2019s time here for a second.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: If you\u2019re looking for someone who fought Hillary Clinton on Iran\u2019s sanctions, she was one of four who voted \u2014 who\u2019s deciding vote who voted against Iran\u2019s sanctions, so we didn\u2019t get it in place as earlier as we should have.I\u2019ve fought battles against her. In 1994, I ran against the Clinton machine. James Carville and Paul Begala, ran the race against me when I took on the author of Hillary care.And each one of those battles, I won. You want a fighter, you want a winner, I\u2019d appreciate your vote. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Thank you, Senator Santorum. Governor Mike Huckabee.HUCAKBEE: Well, Rick, I\u2019m pretty sure I did also fight the Clinton machine because every election I was ever in in Arkansas, I assure you, they were behind it, helping finance and campaign for every opponent.And I share with you the understanding that it\u2019s going to be a tough battle. But I spent the first half of my adult life in the private and nonprofit sector, raising a family, understanding how tough it is for people to make it.And that first half of my life is what led me to believe that America needs a different kind of leadership, not people who spent their whole life running from one office to the next, and living off the government dime. And I got involved because I got sick of what I saw.I also believe that there\u2019s got to be some leadership that not only addresses the monetary and military issues of this country, but the moral issues of this country. At the end of every political speech, most of us say, God bless America.But how can he do that when we continue to slaughter 4,000 babies a day?(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: And I want to be the president that treats every person, including the unborn, as a person. And protect them under the 5th and 14th amendments of the constitution. I close with this word from a gentleman in East Texas named Butel Lucre (ph). He\u2019s 100 years old and I met him down in East Texas.HUCKABEE: And he said this to me. \u201cI sure wish, Mike, we had the days when The Ten Commandments were in all of our capitals and in every school, and we prayed again.You know, he may be 100 years old, but I believe some of those old ideas to get this country back where we unapologetically get on our knees before we get on our feet might be the best solutions we\u2019ve ever sought as a country.(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: And I ask for your support and your vote.Thank you.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Thank you, Governor.REGAN: Carly Fiorina?FIORINA: My husband Frank, that I mentioned, I love spending time with. He\u2019s down there. He was real excited the other day because in New Hampshire, he was introduced as my eye candy.(LAUGHTER)FIORINA: You know, everybody out there watching knows this. You cannot wait to see the debate between me and Hillary Clinton. You would pay to see that fight.(APPLAUSE)FIORINA: And that\u2019s because you know I will win. And that\u2019s important. We\u2019ve got to start by beating Hillary Clinton.All of my life, I have been told to sit down and be quiet. Settle. Settle. Don\u2019t challenge the system.That\u2019s what the American people are being told now and we have been told that for way too long \u2014 sit down and be quiet about our God, about our guns, about the abortion industry, settle for illegal immigration that\u2019s been a problem for decades, as so many of our problems have festered for decades. Accept a system of government and politics that no longer works for us.I will not sit down and be quiet. And neither will you.So I ask you to stand with me, fight with me, vote for me, citizens. It is time to take our future back, time to take our politics back. It is time to take our government back. Citizens, it is time. We must take our country back.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Thank you to all the candidates.(CROSSTALK)REGAN: That does it, everyone for the first debate right here in North Charleston.In just about two hours from now, at 9:00 p.m. Eastern seven more candidates are going to be taking to this stage.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ex-Red Army Faction Members Sought in Robbery in Germany", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 The German police have intensified their decades-long search for three members of the Red Army Faction, believed to be on the run since their far-left guerrilla group disbanded in 1998, after prosecutors said on Tuesday that they had linked them to at least one botched robbery last year.For more than two decades, federal prosecutors have had an arrest warrant out for Ernst-Volker Staub, 61, Burkhard Garweg, 47, and Daniela Marie-Luise Klette, 57, on suspicion of involvement in actions by the Red Army Faction, or R.A.F. These include the 1993 bombing of a prison in Weiterstadt, near Frankfurt.The group emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s when its members terrorized West Germany through a series of kidnappings, bombings and killings. Its members killed 34 people in an attempt to overthrow the capitalist government and fight what they saw as American imperialism. The last convicted R.A.F. member to have served time in jail, Birgit Hogefeld, was released in 2011 after serving 18 years of a life sentence for murder.Marie-Louise Tartz, a spokeswoman for state prosecutors in Verden, said the group had been identified by analyzing DNA traces secured from two vehicles in the crime. Ms. Tartz said the forensic research could take several months in many cases, based on the quality of the evidence available.Federal and state prosecutors said that they did not believe the three suspects had been driven by terrorist motives, and that it appeared they had sought to carry out the robberies for purely financial reasons. \u201cIt is to be presumed that the crime was intended to finance a life lived underground,\u201d state prosecutors in Verden said in a statement.The police used helicopters to search for the fugitives after they fled the scene of the attempted robbery in June, but found nothing. According to witnesses, the suspects, armed with automatic rifles, used a white Volkswagen van to block the armored carrier and opened fire, but failed to open the doors of the vehicle. No one was injured.The Red Army Faction, originally called the Baader-Meinhof gang, followed a Marxist-Leninist ideology and initially targeted American interests in West Germany. These included the United States Embassy in Bad Godesberg in 1991 and a bomb attack on an administrative building of the Deutsche Bank in 1990. Ms. Klette has been sought in both of those crimes.In 1999, more than a year after the group disbanded, Ms. Klette, Mr. Staub and Mr. Garweg threatened the driver of an armored vehicle with an automatic rifle and a rocket-propelled grenade. That time they made off with more than one million German marks.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Church Puts 5 Banks From Israel on a Blacklist", "Date": "2016-01-12", "News": "Supported byThe pension board of the United Methodist Church \u2014 one of the largest Protestant denominations in the United States, with more than seven million members \u2014 has placed five Israeli banks on a list of companies that it will not invest in for human rights reasons, the board said in a statement on Tuesday.It appeared to be the first time that a pension fund of a large American church had taken such a step regarding the Israeli banks, which help finance settlement construction in occupied Palestinian territories. Most of the world considers those settlements illegal.Palestinian advocates, both in and outside the church, described the step as an important advance in the Boycott, Divest and Sanction campaign, or B.D.S., an international effort to pressure Israel economically over the Palestinian issue. Others within the church, however, called those claims misleading, noting that the church remains invested in other Israeli companies and that members had overwhelmingly opposed divestment resolutions.There was no immediate comment from Israeli officials.Nonetheless, the inclusion of Israeli banks on what is essentially a blacklist compiled by the pension board of a large American church, appears bound to upset the Israeli government, which devotes considerable effort to combating resolutions by academic institutions, businesses and church organizations to divest from Israeli companies over the issue of Israeli settlements and the occupation of Palestinian lands held since the 1967 war.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has described the divestment movement as a campaign to destroy Israel.The Israeli banks on the United Methodist Church\u2019s list \u2014 Bank Hapoalim, Bank Leumi, First International Bank of Israel, Israel Discount Bank and Bank Mizrahi-Tefahot \u2014 were among 39 companies from several countries that have been excluded from the pension board\u2019s portfolio for not meeting its Human Rights Investment Policy guideline.M. Colette Nies, a spokeswoman for the pension board, based in Glenview, Ill., said that the guideline, approved by the board in 2014 and carried out last year, applied to 14 different regions around the world, including the Middle East.The list also includes an Israeli construction concern, Shikun & Binui, which Palestinian advocates say is heavily involved in settlement building.Ms. Nies said in the statement that the pension fund remained invested in \u201capproximately 18 Israeli companies that meet our investment criteria.\u201dSusanne Hoder, a spokeswoman for United Methodist Kairos Response, a group within the church that has been aggressively advocating for divestment over the Palestinian issue, said the inclusion of the banks was important because it widened the range of Israeli businesses that are now considered vulnerable to divestment pressure over their ties to settlement construction.\u201cTo our knowledge, this is the first time\u201d that Israeli banks have been considered off-limits for investing by the pension fund of an American church, she said.Other members of the Kairos group said they would push for more divestment at the church\u2019s next general convention, in Portland, Ore., in May.But it was clear that the issue of divestment from Israeli companies remains contentious among Methodists. Another advocacy group within the church, United Methodists for Constructive Peacemaking in Israel and Palestine, sharply criticized the United Methodist Kairos Response group in a statement, calling its position misleading.Bonnie Marden, a spokeswoman for that group, said that while it was correct that a group of Israeli companies had been disqualified by the pension fund\u2019s criteria, \u201cthe process and protocol had nothing to do with the goals of U.M. Kairos as they are attempting to convey.\u201dIn July the United Church of Christ, with about one million members, voted overwhelmingly at its general synod for a resolution calling for divestment from companies that profit from the occupation and a boycott of products from Israeli settlements. While the vote had no practical economic effect, the Israeli government called the church\u2019s position distorted and historically biased.An article on Jan. 13 about a divestment action against Israeli banks by the United Methodist Church pension board referred incorrectly to the Palestinian territories, where, the board said, the banks help finance Israeli settlement construction. While most of the world officially considers the territories to be occupied, and the settlements illegal, there is no consensus that the occupation itself is illegal. The error was brought to the attention of editors only this week.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tyco Merger Will Shift Johnson Controls\u2019 Tax Liability Overseas", "Date": "2016-01-25", "News": "Supported byOne of the first big mergers of the new year resembles a number of other deals in recent years in one crucial respect: It will allow an American corporation to move its headquarters to a country where corporate taxes are lower.The move, known as an inversion, will enable the combined entity to save at least $150 million in annual tax payments, the companies said in announcing the deal on Monday.Inversions were supposed to become harder to do after the Treasury Department issued new rules in September 2014 and even tougher ones in November. Presidential candidates on the campaign trail pilloried Pfizer in November, when it announced a $152 billion deal with Allergan that involved an inversion.But the combination between Johnson Controls and Tyco is the 13th such deal to be announced in the last 16 months, according to data compiled by Dealogic.It attracted some heat on Monday. \u201cThese efforts to shirk U.S. tax obligations leave American taxpayers holding the bag while corporations juice more revenues and profits,\u201d said Hillary Clinton, a Democratic candidate for president. She said she had a plan to \u201cblock deals like Johnson Controls and Tyco, and place an exit tax on corporations that leave the country to lower their tax bill.\u201dA Democratic challenger, Senator Bernie Sanders, called the two companies \u201ccorporate deserters.\u201d \u201cIf you want the advantages of being an American company then you can\u2019t run away from America to avoid paying taxes,\u201d he said.Representative Gwen Moore, a Democrat whose district includes Milwaukee, said she was \u201cgreatly disappointed\u201d by the merger. \u201cAs long as House Republicans continue to block Democratic efforts to end corporate inversions, we can expect more U.S.-based companies to head overseas,\u201d she said.Shareholders in the American company are required to own less than 60 percent of the joint entity to pass muster for an inversion. Johnson Controls will own 56 percent of the new company, while Tyco shareholders will get the remaining 44 percent.\u201cWe\u2019re well within the guidelines that the I.R.S. has established, so we feel really good on it,\u201d Mr. Olson said. \u201cI know there have been some other deals about tax synergies, but this is really about the operating potential of the two companies.\u201dAlex Molinaroli, the chairman and chief executive of Johnson Controls, also said that the real impetus of the deal was the ability to better serve customers and share technological advances.\u201cThe conversations we had were 100 percent centered around finding ways to grow in the building products market and take advantage of the technology innovation,\u201d Mr. Molinaroli said in a phone interview.Both companies have recently been working toward streamlining their businesses. Johnson Controls still plans to spin off its automotive seating and interior unit, to be named Adient, in the beginning of its fiscal year in 2017. Shares of Adient will be distributed to both Johnson Controls and Tyco shareholders after the deal.Right before the merger, Tyco will conduct a reverse stock split, whereby Tyco shareholders will receive a ratio of 0.955 shares for each of their existing Tyco shares. Johnson Controls shareholders could choose to receive one share in the combined company for every share of Johnson Controls that they own or receive $34.88 in cash.The deal represents a premium of just 11 percent from Tyco\u2019s close on Friday. Such a low premium has generated some speculation that another buyer, like Siemens or Schneider Electric, could make a competing bid for Tyco, according to Chris Pultz, who manages Kellner Capital\u2019s merger-arbitrage fund.But Mr. Pultz said that most traders expect Johnson Controls\u2019 deal for Tyco to get done, adding that it was unlikely that the Treasury would come out with new guidelines on inversions before the election in November. The merger is expected to close by September \u2014 the end of the two companies\u2019 fiscal years.Shares of Tyco surged nearly 12 percent on Monday, its biggest one-day gain in nearly seven years. Shares of Johnson Controls fell 3.9 percent.Tyco itself has changed its headquarters several times. The company first did an inversion in 1997 by acquiring ADT Ltd., and moving its headquarters to Bermuda. In 2009, shareholders voted to shift Tyco\u2019s headquarters to Switzerland, and then five years later to Cork, Ireland.What remained of Tyco was a business focused on fire safety and security products with a market valuation of $13 billion last week. Those products will complement Johnson Controls, which makes a range of products, like air-conditioning units and industrial refrigeration, in serving commercial and residential buildings.In addition to the tax benefits, the companies expect to create $500 million in savings by eliminating duplications in the business and exploiting the scale with their buildings business.As a percentage of revenue, the benefits proposed in the deal have raised eyebrows among some analysts. The $650 million in total savings represents a mere 1.5 percent of the pro forma revenue of the combined company, which is below normal, said Nick Heymann, an analyst with William Blair & Company.Adjusting for the separation of Adient, Johnson Controls will have an estimated $32 billion in revenue during the 2016 fiscal year, according to the statement. Tyco is projected to report $9.7 billion in revenue in 2016, estimates provided by Standard & Poor\u2019s Capital IQ show.Mr. Molinaroli will be chairman and chief executive of the combined company for 18 months after the deal closes. George R. Oliver, Tyco\u2019s chief executive, will succeed Mr. Molinaroli as chief executive of the combined company.Johnson Controls will receive about $3.9 billion in cash from the transaction, for which Tyco has secured about $4 billion in financing. The deal is still subject to approvals by regulators and shareholders of both Johnson Controls and Tyco.Centerview Partners served as the lead financial adviser to Johnson Controls, while Lazard served as the lead financial adviser to Tyco.

{"Headline": "Giorgio Gomelsky, Impresario Who Gave the Rolling Stones Their Start, Dies at 81", "Date": "2016-01-14", "News": "Supported byGiorgio Gomelsky, a rock impresario and record producer who gave the Rolling Stones their first exposure, managed the Yardbirds and went on to champion an eclectic batch of progressive rock groups in the United States, died on Wednesday in the Bronx. He was 81.The cause was complications of colon cancer, his longtime girlfriend, Janice Daley, said.Later in the decade, his Marmalade label recorded innovative artists like the keyboardist Brian Auger, whose group the Trinity, with the singer Julie Driscoll, had a Top 10 hit in Britain with \u201cThis Wheel\u2019s on Fire,\u201d a song written by Bob Dylan and Rick Danko, in 1968. He also produced the guitarist John McLaughlin\u2019s first album, \u201cExtrapolation,\u201d and recorded the first demonstration records by the rock band Soft Machine.In the 1970s he continued to seek out artists at the fringes of rock, like Gong, Henry Cow and the French group Magma, whose lyrics were written in an invented language spoken on the imaginary planet Kobaia.For years after relocating to New York in 1978, he operated his townhouse in Chelsea as a creative center and performance space for musicians like John Zorn, Richard Hell and the Bad Brains.\u201cMy mission was to innovate, to push envelopes, to get a new thing established, to allow the underdog, the underground, to come forward and up,\u201d he told Richie Unterberger, the author of \u201cUrban Spacemen and Wayfaring Strangers: Overlooked Innovators and Eccentric Visionaries of \u201960s Rock\u201d (2000).Giorgio Sergio Alessandro Gomelsky was born on Feb. 28, 1934, on a ship traveling from Odessa, Ukraine, to Genoa, Italy. He grew up in Switzerland, where his father, originally from Odessa, practiced medicine.He was a jazz fan from an early age and a devoted listener of the Voice of America\u2019s jazz broadcasts. While attending the School of Humanity, a progressive private school in Hasliberg Goldern, he bicycled around Europe with friends, listening to jazz in French and German nightclubs.His mother, the former Eliane Wust, from Monte Carlo, was a hat designer for Claude Saint-Cyr in Paris and was sent to run the company\u2019s shop in London. She sent her son copies of the newspaper Melody Maker, which clued him in to the British jazz scene. With a group of friends, he founded a jazz appreciation society in Locarno and formed a trio in which he played drums.After completing his military service in the Swiss Air Force, he decided to make a film record of the bubbling British jazz scene. He wangled the financing from an Italian television station, left for London in 1955 and began filming performances by the jazz traditionalist Chris Barber at the Royal Festival Hall. Through his work with the National Jazz Federation, he was given the rights to film the second National Jazz Festival in 1960.\u201cI felt that we needed young people to play this music, in order for it to get to young people and their need to identify with a musical style,\u201d Mr. Gomelsky told Mr. Unterberger. \u201cThe Rolling Stones became the breakthrough.\u201dAfter Andrew Loog Oldham, a young press agent, snatched the Stones from under Mr. Gomelsky\u2019s nose and began managing them, he booked the Yardbirds. Mr. Gomelsky managed the group and produced their records, through the 1966 hit \u201cShapes of Things.\u201d It was his idea to record the Yardbirds live for their first album, \u201cFive Live Yardbirds.\u201dMr. Gomelsky also gave Eric Clapton, the group\u2019s original lead guitarist, his nickname. Mr. Clapton told The Daily Mail in 2013: \u201cI used light-gauge strings, with a very thin first string, which made it easier to bend the notes, and it was not uncommon, during frenetic bits of playing, for me to break at least one string, While I was changing my strings, the audience would often break into a slow hand clap, inspiring Giorgio to dream up the nickname of Slowhand Clapton.\u201dMr. Gomelsky arranged for the Yardbirds to tour Newcastle and, in exchange, brought in the Animals to play what was now a circuit of Crawdaddy clubs, giving that group its first London exposure. He also organized one of Britain\u2019s first blues festivals, in Birmingham, with a list of acts that included the Yardbirds, the Spencer Davis Group and Long John Baldry\u2019s Hoochie Coochie Men, with Rod Stewart.By the late 1960s, after his Marmalade label went out of business, Mr. Gomelsky grew restless and disillusioned. \u201cBy then the Brits had blown it,\u201d he told The New York Times in 2013. \u201cThey had been seduced by the American dream of making a lot of money playing music in incredibly bad conditions like stadiums.\u201dHe pursued his dream of ever more experimental music, played in small clubs, in Paris and then in New York, where, in 1978, he organized the Zu Manifestival, a showcase for emerging progressive artists. At Tramps in the 1980s, he produced \u201cTonka Wonka Mondays,\u201d where unknowns performed jazz, rock and world music for professional critics, and a house band headed by David Soldier backed up invited jazz avant-gardists.Mr. Gomelsky\u2019s first marriage ended in divorce. In addition to Ms. Daley, his survivors include two daughters, Alexandra and Donatella; and a son, Sergio.\u201cI had no presumption, assumption or desire to have a career in the music business,\u201d he told Mr. Unterberger. He added: \u201cI just wanted to prove a point. I was passionately interested in change, and change was needed.\u201dA picture caption on Friday with an obituary about the rock impresario and record producer Giorgio Gomelsky referred incorrectly to the photograph of him at his rehearsal and performance space in Manhattan.

{"Headline": "Manchu, Former Empire\u2019s Language, Hangs On at China\u2019s Edge", "Date": "2016-01-11", "News": "Supported byQapqal County JournalIt was an arduous, 18-month journey, but there was one consolation: After completing their mission of pacifying the western frontier, the troops would be allowed to take their families home.\u201cThey were terribly homesick here and dreamed of one day going back east,\u201d said Tong Hao, 56, a descendant of the settlers, from the Xibe branch of the Manchus, who arrived here emaciated and exhausted. \u201cBut sadly, it was not to be.\u201dTwo and a half centuries later, the roughly 30,000 people in this rural county who consider themselves Xibe have proved to be an ethnographic curiosity and a linguistic bonanza. As the last handful of Manchu speakers in northeast China have died, the Xibe have become the sole inheritors of what was once the official tongue of one of the world\u2019s most powerful empires, a domain that stretched from India to Russia and formed the geographic foundation for modern China.In the decades after the revolution in 1911 that drove the Qing from power after nearly 300 years, Mandarin Chinese vanquished the Manchu language, even in its former stronghold in the forested northeast. But the isolation of the Xibe in this parched, far-flung region near the Kazakh border helped keep the language alive, even if its existence was largely forgotten until the 1940s.For scholars of Manchu, especially those eager to translate the mounds of Qing dynasty documents that fill archives across China, the discovery of so many living Manchu speakers has been a godsend.\u201cImagine if you studied the classics and went to Rome, spoke Latin and found that people there understood you,\u201d said Mark C. Elliott, a Manchu expert at Harvard University who said he remembered his first encounter, in 2009, with an older Xibe man on the streets of Qapqal County. \u201cI asked the guy in Manchu where the old city wall was, and he didn\u2019t blink. It was a wonderful encounter, one that I\u2019ll never forget.\u201dDespite the local government\u2019s best efforts, which include language instruction in primary schools and the financing of a newspaper, what is known here as Xibe is facing the common fate of many of the world\u2019s languages: declining numbers of speakers and the prospect of extinction.\u201cLanguage is not only a tool for communication, but it ties us to who we are and makes us feel close to one another,\u201d said Mr. He, who has spent decades translating imperial Qing documents into Chinese. \u201cI wonder how much longer our mother tongue can survive.\u201dEven as intermarriage and migration to other parts of the country dilute their identity, the Xibe remain proud of their history and especially their role helping to secure the lands that greatly expanded China\u2019s borders. It was the Manchu emperor Qianlong who tapped the Xibe to settle the Ili Valley here after Qing soldiers massacred or exiled the nomads who had long menaced the empire\u2019s western borderlands.Until the 1970s, the Xibe remained isolated from the ethnic Kazakhs and Uighurs who settled Ghulja, a city that sits on the far side of the Ili River. The Xibe also ate pork and practiced a blend of shamanism and Buddhism, making intermarriage with the Muslim Kazakhs and Uighurs relatively rare.\u201cWe happily lived in our own world and rarely took boats to the other side of the river,\u201d said Tong Zhixian, 61, a retired forestry official who sings and performs traditional Xibe dances at the county\u2019s new history museum.The Xibe language has gradually evolved from Manchu as it absorbed vocabulary from the Uighurs, Kazakhs, Mongolians and even the Russians who passed through Xinjiang. Unlike Mandarin, which has few borrowed words, Xibe is flecked with adopted nouns like pomodoro (tomato), mashina (sewing machine) and alma (the Uighur word for apple). Scholars say that the phonetic diversity of Xibe, a language thought to be related to Turkish, Mongolian and Korean, allows speakers to easily produce the sounds of other tongues.\u201cWe fought with the other groups, but there were so few of us here and no one else spoke our language, so we had to learn theirs to survive,\u201d said Mr. Tong, an engineer at the county power company who is vice president of the Xibe Westward March Culture Study Association, a local group that promotes Xibe language and history. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are so good at learning foreign languages.\u201dThose linguistic talents have long been an asset to China\u2019s leaders. In the 1940s, young Xibe were sent north to study Russian, and they later served as interpreters for the newly victorious Communists. In recent years, the government has brought Xibe speakers to Beijing to help decipher the sprawling Qing archives, many of them of imperial correspondence that few scholars could read.\u201cIf you know Xibe, it takes no time for you to crack the Qing documents,\u201d said Zhao Zhiqiang, 58, one of six students from Qapqal County sent to the capital in 1975, and who now heads the Manchu study department at the Beijing Academy of Social Sciences. \u201cIt\u2019s like a golden key that opens the door to the Qing dynasty.\u201dBut generous government funding might not be enough to save the language of the Manchus. At the county museum here, a sprawling collection of dioramas depicting the westward exodus, Mr. Tong spends most days performing to an empty room. After one recent performance, an ensemble piece that featured Xibe matrons twirling with very large knives, he wondered aloud whether he might be the last of his generation to keep such traditions alive.\u201cYoung people just aren\u2019t interested in this kind of thing,\u201d he said, wiping the sweat from his brow. \u201cSure, they might study some Xibe in school, but once they leave the classroom, they plunge right back into Mandarin.\u201dThe Qapqal County Journal article on Jan. 12, about the Xibe people of China, who are thought to be the sole inheritors of the Manchu language \u2014 once the official tongue of one of the world\u2019s most powerful empires \u2014 misstated the publication schedule of The Qapqal News, a newspaper published in Xibe, a language that evolved from Manchu. It is published irregularly, not biweekly.Yufan Huang contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

A double front door opens onto the living room. The dining room is to the right, beyond arches defined by twin sets of marble columns.Sliding glass doors topped with arched windows stretch across the back of the house. \u201cWherever you are in the house, you have beautiful views of the Caribbean Sea,\u201d said Patricia Herrera, an agent at Riviera Maya Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, which has the listing.Across the back of the house is an ipe-wood deck with a thatched palapa-style awning. Plants screen the deck from the beach, which is public. A palapa umbrella provides shade close to the water\u2019s edge.The kitchen, open to the dining room, has a vaulted red brick ceiling, a U-shape granite countertop, handcrafted hardwood cabinets, Teka gas oven, LG refrigerator, Bosch gas cooktop and dishwasher, a microwave and a pantry. A powder room off the kitchen has an onyx sink on a Ticul stone counter. A gas/electric barbecue grill is on the deck.To the left of the living room, the master bedroom suite has a vaulted red brick ceiling. The suite opens to a private terrace on the front of the house, and to the deck in back. A dressing room includes a washer and dryer. The marble-walled master bath has a dark green Guatemalan Verde Tikal marble countertop, double Mexican Talavera ceramic sinks, a jetted tub and a separate shower, a toilet and a bidet.Beyond the dining room, two additional bedrooms have private balconies and en-suite marble baths with double vanities and a shower. One also includes a jetted tub.Porcelain tile floors are throughout the house, which is being sold furnished. Also included are a two-person glass-bottom kayak, a motorized one-person kayak and a motorized fishing boat.A Jacuzzi and gazebo are on the 1,500-square-foot rooftop terrace. Rooftop rain catchers feed a 70,000-liter cistern; a filtering system provides water. The bedrooms and living and dining rooms have air-conditioning units. A gravel driveway leads to an attached one-car garage.The house is three miles south of Tulum\u2019s hotel area and a 90-minute drive from Cancun International Airport. Snorkeling and scuba diving in the Caribbean, visits to Mayan ruins, bird watching, fishing and kayaking in the Sian Ka\u2019an Lagoon are popular. Spas, yoga classes and wellness centers abound in Tulum, which has a population of around 28,000. Restaurants offer international and Mexican cuisines.MARKET OVERVIEWTulum has been one of the fastest-growing vacation home markets in the Riviera Maya, stretching south from Cancun, in the last five years, Ms. Herrera said. It is less expensive than the area\u2019s hottest market, Playa del Carmen, she said. In Playa del Carmen, for instance, Ms. Herrera said, $180,000 buys a 646-square-foot one-bedroom apartment seven blocks from the sea; in Tulum, the same distance from the water, it buys a 1,292-square-foot two-bedroom apartment.Recovery from the 2008 global downturn was slow, but markets for both resale and presale (new development) have rebounded in the last two years. Tulum has been \u201cthe focus of developers,\u201d said Charles Tibshirani, a lawyer based in the area. \u201cFor the last two years, they have been gobbling up property.\u201dEighty percent of sales are new construction in downtown Tulum; in the residential neighborhood of La Veleta; in the master planned community of Aldea Zama; and in the resort community of Bahia Principe Riviera Maya Residences and Golf, said Thomas Lloyd, an owner and president of Top Mexico Real Estate.Twenty new developments are underway, with 520 of 789 condos and houses in these developments sold as of November 2015. Eighty percent are units in multifamily dwellings, with an average price of $235,419, according to Top Mexico\u2019s Riviera Maya Market Preconstruction Report for November and December.Tulum\u2019s focus is on low-density, eco-chic properties no more than three stories high. Boutique hotels dominate the beach. The few single-family oceanfront homes start at around $2.5 million, Ms. Herrera said. In the Sian Ka\u2019an Biosphere Reserve, only 1 percent of property is privately held, she said. Single-family homes start at $1.8 million; beachfront lots, which are scarce, start at $800,000, she said.WHO BUYS IN TULUMNorth Americans are \u201cinvesting heavily\u201d in real estate on the Riviera Maya, particularly in Playa del Carmen and Tulum, said Mr. Tibshirani, the lawyer. Condominiums used as vacation homes or for rental income are particularly popular with New Yorkers. Retirees prefer houses, he said. Additionally, \u201ca Hollywood crowd is buying up Tulum at breakneck speed,\u201d with the wealthy favoring beachfront property, Mr. Tibshirani said.\u201cArtists, painters and chefs\u201d are drawn by Tulum\u2019s \u201cart feel and vibe\u201d and \u201cbeautiful untouched beaches,\u201d Mr. Lloyd said. Young families make up the bulk of buyers. Traditionally, American buyers hail from the Northeast, with a recent uptick from the West Coast and Miami, Mr. Tibshirani said. Europeans, mostly from France or Italy, are also buying in Tulum, agents said.BUYING BASICSForeigners can use a Mexican bank trust called a fideicomiso to acquire property, bypassing a Mexican law that prohibits their owning property within 31 miles of the coastline or 62 miles of the border, Ms. Herrera said. The bank holds legal title to the property, with an initial renewable term of 50 years, but the buyers retain all the \u201crights and privileges of ownership.\u201d To have direct control of the property, Mr. Tibshirani said, buyers are increasingly forming corporations.Cash is king. Mortgages have been unavailable to Americans since 2008, Mr. Lloyd said, though a few developers might offer financing plans.A government-appointed notary does the real estate transaction. Separately, a lawyer is recommended to set up trusts, run title searches and provide title insurance, Mr. Tibshirani said. \u201cIt is important to have a professional real estate person and a lawyer.\u201dWEBSITESLANGUAGE AND CURRENCYSpanish; Mexican peso (1 Mexican peso = $0.056)TAXES AND FEESSetting up a trust or a corporation costs $2,000 to $4,000, Mr. Tibshirani said. The upfront costs of acquiring a property range from 6 percent to 8 percent of the purchase price, including the trust, legal fees, transfer taxes and notary and foreign registry fees. Property taxes and the cost of maintaining a property add up to about 1 percent a year, Mr. Tibshirani said. Maintaining a trust costs about $500 a year, according to Ms. Herrera.CONTACTAdvertisement"}

That designation carries requirements to set aside more capital as a cushion against a substantial decline in the nation\u2019s financial markets as occurred in 2008, potentially limiting its earnings.MetLife is considering several options, including an initial public offering to create a company that would, presumably, be better able to compete with smaller life insurance and annuity providers who are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions.MetLife is the largest life insurance company in the United States, with $880 billion in assets, including $240 billion of retail assets that would be part of the new company.American International Group, Prudential Financial and General Electric Capital Corporation, the financing arm of General Electric, have also received the designation, which was largely bestowed on companies deemed so large that their failure would damage the American economy.In a statement on Tuesday, Steven A. Kandarian, MetLife\u2019s chairman, president and chief executive, said the risk of increased capital requirements contributed to the decision to explore breaking up the business, although exact plans have not been completed.\u201cAn independent company would benefit from greater focus, more flexibility in products and operations, and a reduced capital and compliance burden,\u201d he said.The announcement, a result of a strategic review, was made weeks before oral arguments in Federal District Court in Washington in MetLife\u2019s year-old case to eliminate the council\u2019s designation.\u201cEven though we are appealing our SiFi designation in court and do not believe any part of MetLife is systemic, this risk of increased capital requirements contributed to our decision,\u201d Mr. Kandarian said.General Electric made a similar calculation last year, when it announced plans to dismantle G.E. Capital, which had grown into one of the biggest lenders in the United States.Last fall G.E. Capital agreed to sell a large part of its commercial leasing business in the United States to Wells Fargo. G.E. had already been selling pieces of its financing arm, spinning off its private-label credit card operation in a $2.9 billion initial public offering in 2014 to create Synchrony Financial.MetLife shareholders greeted the after-markets news favorably, pushing MetLife shares up 6.6 percent Tuesday evening.The stock had declined 22 percent from January 2015 through Monday.\u201cThis is just the first step in the process,\u201d Mr. Kandarian said.Jay Gelb, an analyst at Barclays, said the relatively large size of the new company being created made an I.P.O. more likely than a sale to another insurer. He added that the plan put pressure on Prudential and A.I.G. \u201cto take steps to minimize the anticipated impact of Fed regulation by potentially separating their businesses.\u201dA.I.G. is already under pressure by the activist shareholder Carl C. Icahn to split apart, and it plans to present its strategic vision this month.MetLife\u2019s remaining business after the separation would be corporate-oriented, such as its work with large corporate benefits plans. \u201cIn the U.S., it would allow us to focus even more intently on our group business, where we have long been the market leader,\u201d Mr. Kandarian said.Remaining with MetLife would be its group, voluntary and work site benefits, corporate benefit funding, and business in Asia, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. MetLife would also keep some of the life and annuity business sold through its agents, although it would not write new life or annuity policies after the split, it said.The proposed new company would be run by the MetLife executive vice president Eric Steigerwalt, and would have about a quarter of the current company\u2019s 28,000 employees and 20 percent of its operating earnings.Businesses that would be under it include MetLife Insurance Company USA, General American Life Insurance Company, Metropolitan Tower Life Insurance Company and other subsidiaries.MetLife would move 75 percent of its book of variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the new company, one of the businesses that would be hardest hit by the higher capital requirements. It would also move 85 percent of its universal life with secondary guarantees business.As a company, the new entity would be smaller than some rival insurance providers, such as Lincoln Financial, that do not have the council\u2019s designation, and presumably would not have the same capital-intensive burdens.Likewise, the remaining MetLife would not have the capital requirements of the variable annuity business it would move off its books. The remaining company would have about $640 billion of assets, making it smaller than Prudential but larger than A.I.G.To proceed with the plan, Metlife would need approval from its board and would have to file documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Advertisement"}

As part of the investment, G.M. and Lyft will work on developing an on-demand network of self-driving cars, an area of research that companies like Google, Tesla and Uber have all devoted enormous resources to in recent years.G.M. will also work with Lyft to set up a series of short-term car rental hubs across the United States, places where people who do not own cars can pick up a vehicle and drive for Lyft to earn money. Daniel Ammann, president of G.M., will join the board of Lyft, which is based in San Francisco.\u201cWe strongly believe that autonomous vehicle go-to-market strategy is through a network, not through individual car ownership,\u201d John Zimmer, president of Lyft, said in an interview.G.M.\u2019s $500 million interest in Lyft is the single largest direct investment by an auto manufacturer into a ride-hailing company in the United States, according to data from PitchBook, an alliance that pairs an auto stalwart with the kind of start-up trying to disrupt it. The investment reflects how much consumer automotive habits have been changed by technology over the last decade. With the rise of ride-sharing companies, car manufacturers have raced to adapt to how people can now use each other\u2019s vehicles for rides, which could potentially lead to a decline in car ownership.In an interview, Mr. Ammann said G.M. wanted to be part of the changing business models in transportation. \u201cWe think there\u2019s going to be more change in the world of mobility in the next five years than there has been in the last 50,\u201d he said.Mr. Ammann added that the core profit from G.M.\u2019s business comes from cars sold outside the urban environments where Lyft primarily operates, especially sales of sport utility vehicles in suburban areas.\u201cFrom a G.M. perspective, we view this as much more of an opportunity than a threat,\u201d he said.G.M.\u2019s investment is also a vote of confidence in Lyft, which faces a competitive ride-hailing field. Founded in 2012, Lyft helped promote the ride-sharing craze in the United States, positioning itself as a superior alternative to owning a car or using public transportation. Lyft users can summon a private or shared car with a few taps of an app.Lyft and G.M. did not give a specific timeline for when they expected their autonomous vehicle network to become publicly available, nor did the companies offer details on how the network is expected to function.A mix of Lyft\u2019s existing investors, including the Asian e-commerce giants Rakuten and Alibaba, also contributed to the most recent financing round, as did the Chinese ride-hailing start-up Didi Kuaidi.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of countries in which Uber operates.

{"Headline": "Currency Devaluations by Asian Tigers Could Hinder Global Growth", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "Supported byChina\u2019s decision to push the value of its currency lower has opened a new front of worry for global investors: a potential wave of currency devaluations among the so-called Asian tigers \u2014 South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan.Such an outcome, a number of foreign exchange specialists say, would put a further damper on global growth expectations, which already are being revised downward as China\u2019s once-booming economy retrenches.The dollar\u2019s strong run recently \u2014 together with the plunge in the price of oil and other commodities \u2014 has damaged fragile emerging-market economies like Brazil, Turkey and South Africa; the dollar has risen 130 percent against the Brazilian real and the South African rand since mid-2011.The currencies of fast-growing Asian countries, including India, have largely been insulated, thanks to their better-performing economies and their ability to stockpile large foreign currency reserve positions.But having a strong currency at a time when manufacturing competitors like Japan and China have weaker currencies leads to a sharp fall in exports, which have been the economic lifeblood of these countries for decades.\u201cThese countries have some of the most overvalued exchange rates on the planet,\u201d said Julian Brigden of Macro Intelligence 2 Partners, an independent research firm based in Vail, Colo., that advises large money management firms on global investment themes.When economies have high exchange rates, their exports tend to lose market share compared with countries with cheaper currencies. And when that happens, countries that depend on foreign trade will frequently take steps to push their currencies lower.Echoing these fears, the finance minister of Mexico, Luis Videgaray, warned on Thursday that the Chinese currency actions could lead to a new round of competitive devaluations.The fear is that a currency war in Southeast Asia \u2014 where the Asian financial crisis erupted in 1997 \u2014 could result in lower growth and add to the already substantial concerns about the global economy this year and next.Earlier this week, the World Bank lowered its estimate for global growth to 2.9 percent from 3.3 percent, with expectations for just about all major economies being revised downward.Already, global money managers have begun to pull money out of some of these Asian markets.The Korean won and the Singapore dollar are down 5 percent, while the Taiwan dollar has lost 7 percent over the last six months. Even in India, perhaps the most popular emerging market among global investors, the currency has given ground, about 7 percent, against the United States dollar.Underpinning the fears about a currency war have been the disappointing export figures from the region.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.In Taiwan, government officials say they expect exports for last year to have fallen 10 percent; and in Singapore, the manufacturing sector at the heart of the country\u2019s export-based model slumped 6 percent in the most recent quarter.These export figures are disturbing because they reflect that something deeper is ailing the global economy than simply a slowing China that is buying less oil from Nigeria, iron ore from Brazil or copper from Chile.Strong currencies in the Asian tiger countries have made their high-end electronic products, like Samsung phones from South Korea and computer parts from Taiwan, more expensive in Europe and the United States, their biggest markets.And with China, their main export competitor, expected to to let the renminbi weaken further, these countries will face further pressure to let their currencies fall.The sudden export drop-off for manufacturing powerhouses like South Korea and Singapore troubles analysts who see it as a sign that the slowdown in the global economy is worse than people expect.\u201cI expect these currencies to fall by another 20 or 30 percent,\u201d said Raoul Pal, an independent financial analyst and the founder of Real Vision TV, a media venture where sophisticated investors discuss their views on the market. \u201cThese export figures are a big deal \u2014 it\u2019s a huge shrinkage in the dollar-based economy, as not enough people are buying goods.\u201dFor quite some time, Mr. Pal has been promoting an investment thesis that the relentless rise of the dollar \u2014 since mid-2011, the dollar is up 35 percent against a broad basket of currencies \u2014 will have a deflationary effect on the global economy as export-driven economies enter into a series of competitive devaluations to protect crucial export sectors.\u201cThis is not just a commodity story,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a global trade story.\u201dExchange-rate volatility in this part of the world will not take the heat off other weak currencies. In addition to usual examples like Turkey, Brazil and South Africa, investors expect commodity exporters like Indonesia, Chile and Colombia to take a big hit, as the prices for their products continue to fall.The final frontier in this respect would be the pegged currencies in the Middle East, especially the Saudi Arabian riyal, which is tightly linked to the dollar.Although Saudi Arabia has been running budget deficits of close to 20 percent of gross domestic product because of the fall in oil prices, it still has a war chest of $635 billion in foreign exchange reserves that it can tap to defend the riyal.The other problem with downward trending currencies in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore is that these countries, like just about all emerging market economies, have taken advantage of a rock-bottom interest rate environment to issue billions of dollars in dollar-denominated corporate debt to finance capital investments.Foreign investors were attracted to the high yields and especially the stable currencies and bought them in huge quantities. Now, with the currencies starting to wobble, dollar-based investors have less incentive to hold on to them, and they will do what they have been doing with their Brazilian, Turkish and South African bonds \u2014 get rid of them as quickly as possible.\u201cThere is a lot of underlying investor exposure in these markets,\u201d said Mr. Brigden, the independent research analyst. \u201cI think if things continue to get worse, we are going to move to liquidation stage.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the change in the exchange rate between the United States dollar and the Brazilian real and the South African rand. The dollar has increased 130 percent compared with the real and the rand since mid-2011; the real and the rand have not weakened 130 percent against the dollar in that time.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "On the Stockholm Waterfront, \u2018Renewing a New City\u2019", "Date": "2016-01-18", "News": "Supported byHeads UpThe waterfront district of Hammarby Sjostad, on the southern edge of Stockholm, has been heralded as a model of sustainable urban development, a place where one can already glimpse the future of city living. And the area\u2019s growth, coupled with the steadily rising popularity of the island of Sodermalm to its immediate north, is pulling the inhabitable boundaries \u2014 if not the heart \u2014 of Stockholm southward.Located along the Hammarby waterway, this newly built, eco-conscious neighborhood had previously been home to landfills and industry, dense with factories and office buildings. But then a plan was conceived to build housing for athletes as part of an ultimately unsuccessful Olympic bid in the 1990s, and the area was soon transforming.\u201cWe had started this with great ambitions, and we just kept going with the project,\u201d said Martin Skillback, the project manager for the city\u2019s development administration office, of the planned residential district.Today, about 10,000 apartments have been built, and over 30,000 Stockholmers will call Hammarby Sjostad home by the project\u2019s estimated completion date, in about five years. Thanks to bike lanes and convenient ferry, bus and tram links, 80 percent of residents commute without the use of cars, a figure that\u2019s slightly higher than average in a city already full of energy-efficient construction.But statistics alone do not a neighborhood make.Seven years ago, Allan Larsson, a retired journalist, former finance minister and past president of Lund University in southern Sweden, moved with his wife from central Stockholm to Hammarby Sjostad, only minutes away by car, bike or rapid transit, drawn by the public transportation options, nearby nature and conscientious environmental aims. Shortly thereafter, he started a citizens\u2019 initiative, HS2020, to further improve the area for residents, who are in some ways living in an urban experiment.\u201cWe\u2019ve used the phrase \u2018renewing a new city\u2019 to highlight the fact that you can\u2019t just build a new residential area or a town and then leave it,\u201d Mr. Larsson explained. \u201cIt has to be updated. You have to have innovation. You have to test new things.\u201dAmong the many projects of HS2020 are the creation of a foundation for widespread use of electric cars in the area, and a plan for year-round use of the ski slope at Hammarbybacken.HS2020 has also supported cultural events, most notably SjostadsOperan, in which filmed opera performances from the Metropolitan Opera House in New York were streamed inside an old factory building that also houses Delight Studios, one of the city\u2019s top photography and film production studios. For the past three years, Delight Studios has been the area\u2019s primary \u2014 but temporary \u2014 home for cultural events, when it\u2019s not being used to produce campaigns for companies like H&M, or stills for movies like David Fincher\u2019s \u201cGirl with the Dragon Tattoo.\u201dBefore opening Delight Studios here in 2004, the photographer Guido Hildebrand said that he had often worked on location in the area, which stood out because of its stark, desolate atmosphere. Concerned that the neighborhood is losing its soul as apartments fill one old structure after another, he\u2019s now working with Helios13, a nonprofit group that aims to turn the entire studio building into a permanent cultural center \u2014 something he said he believes the area desperately needs.\u201cWhat are people doing in Hammarby?\u201d he asked earnestly. \u201cWhat is there to do?\u201dFor now, one can stroll along new waterfront walkways, explore a handful of boutiques stocked with antiques and secondhand wares, and have fika (a Swedish coffee break) at cafes like Magnus Johansson Bageri & Konditori, where the prinsesstarta, a cream-filled cake draped with green marzipan, is alone worth a visit to the area.But the biggest draw is Nya Carnegiebryggeriet, a brewery housed in a former light bulb factory. It opened in 2014 in a collaboration between Carlsberg and Brooklyn Brewery.\u201cIt\u2019s a very new part of the city, and in that sense it\u2019s kind of like a blank slate,\u201d Steve Dippel, the brewery ambassador, said. \u201cThe sky\u2019s the limit as to what we can do.\u201dOnto that slate the brewery has introduced a large outdoor terrace overlooking the water and a restaurant serving ambitious menus \u2014 think of an entree of red deer followed by a selection of Neal\u2019s Yard cheeses \u2014 to match the craft beers brewed on-site. The brewery also seeks to root itself in this emerging neighborhood.\u201cOur ambition is to try to shape the community in the same way Brooklyn Brewery helped to shape that area of Williamsburg,\u201d Mr. Dippel said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the city that\u2019s still developing its identity, so there\u2019s a lot of potential.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Along with so many of my patients and colleagues, I am convinced that single-payer is right for us, right now.JIM RECHTCambridge, Mass.The writer is an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.To the Editor:Paul Krugman seems convinced that \u201cif we could start from scratch,\u201d the best way to achieve universal health care would be through a single-payer, improved Medicare-for-all approach advocated by Bernie Sanders. Mr. Krugman argues against pursuing single-payer because he sees it as politically unfeasible. As a physician, for reasons too numerous to elaborate here, I strongly disagree.However, one crucial point that Mr. Krugman doesn\u2019t make is that the single-payer solution \u2014 which many health care economists and a majority of Americans believe is the only way to achieve universal health care that is cost-effective \u2014 can be piloted as an option at the state level.The Affordable Care Act allows individual states to implement this option beginning in 2017. It could serve Hillary Clinton well to promote this state option. And it could serve Mr. Sanders well to challenge her to do so.ROBERT VINETZLos AngelesThe writer is a pediatrician.To the Editor:I would like to thank Paul Krugman for clarifying his position on Hillary Clinton\u2019s health care proposal. When, in the last debate, Mrs. Clinton stated that Mr. Krugman preferred her health care plan to Bernie Sanders\u2019s, I thought I had to clean out my ears.Now all is clear \u2014 as a Nobel Prize-winning economist, Mr. Krugman thinks that Mr. Sanders\u2019s plan is superior to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s. In his role as a political pundit, however, Mr. Krugman thinks that Mr. Sanders\u2019s plan would not be feasible to get through Congress. So the best we can do is improve on the current law.As an economist, Mr. Krugman has year after year been right in his judgments, and I put a lot of trust in them. But as a political pundit, his view has no more authority than that of any other talking head. Mrs. Clinton was disingenuous to cite Mr. Krugman\u2019s support without making it clear that he was not offering an economic opinion.BRETT L. GOLDNew YorkAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Economists Take Aim at Wealth Inequality", "Date": "2016-01-03", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When pundits and presidential candidates talk about inequality and the tiny sliver of the population whose fortunes have soared, they often drop names like Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Sheldon Adelson and Mark Zuckerberg.But those are just the most visible members of a larger but less-talked-about cadre of the big winners in today\u2019s economy. This group consists of roughly 250,000 Americans who mainly populate the executive offices and managerial suites of major companies and financial institutions, along with a smattering of top law firms, hedge funds and other elite aeries.These people \u2014 the top one-quarter of 1 percent of the country\u2019s employed population \u2014 have enjoyed explosive gains in income and wealth in recent decades, even as salaries and wages stagnated for the typical American worker.\u201cYou hear about C.E.O.s, entertainers, athletes and hedge funders, but that\u2019s the tip of the iceberg,\u201d said Nicholas A. Bloom, a professor of economics at Stanford who is finishing a paper examining the underlying dynamics of income inequality. \u201cIt\u2019s a much, much bigger group and they are outpacing everyone else.\u201dLike those of many of his peers who are presenting new research at the annual meeting of the American Economic Association, which began here on Sunday and ends on Tuesday, Mr. Bloom\u2019s findings are bringing to light fresh perspectives on why income inequality is growing and how it is reshaping the national and global economy.While the much-talked-about 1 percent is doing just fine, the supersize gains are taking place even further up the income ladder, according to what Mr. Bloom and four colleagues found by examining 35 years of data from the Social Security Administration.The phenomenon is not limited to Wall Street or the big banks \u2014 manufacturers rewarded their top executives every bit as generously as did firms in the finance, insurance and real estate sectors. And this pattern is being repeated in countries where the political landscape is quite different from that of the United States, like Sweden, Germany and Britain.\u201cThis is a truly global phenomenon, and I don\u2019t know any serious economist who would deny inequality has gone up,\u201d said Mr. Bloom, a native of Britain whose politics veer toward a laissez-faire approach and the Conservative Party there. \u201cThe debate is over the magnitude, not the direction.\u201dThe economic association\u2019s meeting is something of a barometer of what concerns economists most, drawing more than 13,000 attendees from the ranks of academia, as well as research groups and the private sector. And in panels, research presentations and speeches, what was once mainly a preoccupation of ivory tower Marxists and other players on the margins of the profession is taking center stage.\u201cIn the last few years, there\u2019s been a huge change in the mainstream of the profession,\u201d said Steven Fazzari, an economics professor at Washington University in St. Louis who first came to the conference as a job-hunting graduate student in 1982. \u201cThe issue of income inequality was a backwater in the economics field, and it was largely ignored.\u201dAt the same time, there\u2019s a growing consensus among economists of all ideological stripes that inequality is growing \u2014 in the United States and abroad \u2014 even if the usual political fault lines appear when the discussion turns to the consequences of the trend and whether new public policies are needed to address it.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty much indisputable that the percentage of income being earned by the top 1 percent, or the top quarter of 1 percent, is going up,\u201d said Richard H. Thaler, the association\u2019s president.\u201cIt was true five years ago, but it was not as widely recognized,\u201d said Mr. Thaler, a behavioral economist who teaches at the University of Chicago. \u201cAs with climate change, scientific consensus takes a while to build.\u201dAnd, to borrow language from an economic seminar, there\u2019s also a striking correlation between the emergence of income inequality as an issue here and the near-rock-star status accorded a handful of once-obscure experts on the subject inside and outside academia.The best known of these is Thomas Piketty, whose 700-page tome, \u201cCapital in the Twenty-First Century,\u201d became an improbable best-seller in 2014 and made the French academic a media superstar.Emmanuel Saez, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, who has collaborated with Mr. Piketty, won a MacArthur \u201cgenius\u201d grant in 2010. Raj Chetty of Stanford, who has looked closely at economic mobility, also received a MacArthur grant and has presented findings to Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush and Obama administration officials.\u201cThere are definitely fashions in the field,\u201d said Dean Baker, co-director of the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. \u201cAs much as most economists might hate to acknowledge it, there\u2019s no way you can\u2019t respond to Piketty\u2019s success.\u201dAnticipated presentations at the economic association meeting include new findings from David Autor, an influential M.I.T. economist, on the links between college performance and increased financial aid as well as research by Enrico Moretti of Berkeley into how state tax increases prompt the highest earners to move to lower-tax locations.For all the intense focus on the roots and extent of income inequality today, most academics are leery of any easy solution. At the same time, they acknowledge that their traditional tools are inadequate for the task.\u201cThere\u2019s no reason the free market will solve this,\u201d Mr. Bloom said.He believes inequality is being magnified by technological change and what\u2019s known as skills bias, where workers with a particular expertise reap the biggest reward. Neither is amenable to quick fixes.In Professor Bloom\u2019s new paper, which he wrote with David J. Price, a Stanford graduate student, and three other economists \u2014 Jae Song, Fatih Guvenen and Till von Wachter \u2014 the top quarter of 1 percent of Americans appears to be pulling away from the rest.For workers at this threshold, who earn at least $640,000 annually, their salaries rose 96 percent from 1981 to 2013, after taking account of inflation. The trend was especially pronounced among the most successful enterprises in the American economy, creating a divergence between the highest-paid people at companies that employ more than 10,000 people and the rest of the work force. In this rarefied circle, overall pay jumped 140 percent versus a 5 percent drop for the typical employee at these corporate behemoths.The split in compensation between executives and everyone else was much less pronounced at smaller companies, according to the research by Mr. Bloom and his colleagues. At these firms, between 1981 and 2013, top salaries rose 49 percent, while median pay rose 30 percent.In addition, Mr. Bloom and his team also found a sharp divergence between pay at the most successful companies and also-rans in the same field \u2014 think Apple versus BlackBerry. The highest-paid workers cluster at the winners, heightening income disparities in the overall work force.Mr. Bloom traces the outsize gains to large grants of stock and options to top workers at big companies, with their fortunes rising in line with the performance of the stock market.\u201cThere used to be a premium for working at a big company, even in a lower-level job,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not true anymore. The people who have really suffered are lower-level employees at big companies.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Still, the consultant raised a number of troubling issues that could cost the retirement system money, like the inability to properly identify portfolio risk.When Scott M. Stringer, the New York City comptroller who has statutory oversight of the pension funds, took office in early 2014, he said it was apparent then that aspects of the retirement system were \u201changing by a thread.\u201dHe ordered an independent review of the Bureau of Asset Management, and in April 2015, Funston was chosen to conduct the review. Its report cost New York City $1.4 million, Mr. Stringer said.On Monday, the comptroller presented the report to the trustees of the city\u2019s five funds, which oversee retirement money for roughly 715,000 current and former police officers, firefighters, teachers and others. The comptroller hopes the findings will help spur change.\u201cOthers have tried it but we are going to do it,\u201d Mr. Stringer said. \u201cThere is no reason why New York City can\u2019t lead the nation on fundamental best-practice reform.\u201dAn independent report commissioned by the city comptroller\u2019s office found the city\u2019s retirement system needed additional resources, staffing and the basic tools required to understand the complicated risk embedded in its investments.Many of their ideas, however, never came to be. One obstacle: The five funds are governed by different boards, and getting consensus has proved difficult in the past.Mr. Stringer estimated that about 90 percent of the changes Funston recommended could be made without the approval of the trustees. But trustee support is important, and would be required if Mr. Stringer needed money from the five funds to finance any changes.All in all, the Funston review made more than 200 recommendations, many underscoring the fact that the retirement system has not kept up with the times.For example, the report noted that the complexity of the system\u2019s assets has exploded in recent years, as more money has been invested in hedge funds and private equity.But the report found that there were just two people monitoring the $10 billion that the system has invested in private equity. \u201cIt is not possible for two individuals to monitor nearly 200 partnerships from 115 managers in a manner so as to properly fulfill fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d the report concluded.Mr. Stringer estimated it would take five to 10 years to get the Bureau of Asset Management to where it needs to be. The report concluded the bureau currently \u201chas little or no capacity to implement many of the recommendations of this report.\u201dStill, Mr. Stringer said he believed many of the changes could be made within the system\u2019s existing budget, saying in many cases the Bureau of Asset Management simply needs to redeploy resources and re-engineer certain processes.Advertisement"}

If all the other shareholders choose to sell, the investment could rise to $3.4 billion.Colombia\u2019s government announced the privatization of Isagen in 2013 to raise funds to invest in highways. At the time, the finance minister, Mauricio C\u00e1rdenas, said the government expected about $2.4 billion from the sale.By 2014, the government was hoping to raise closer to $3 billion after receiving preliminary proposals from seven companies, including Duke Energy in the United States, Huadian of China and Engie of France, formerly GDF Suez.But the government decided to postpone the sale to give potential buyers more time to study the company. Then, in May 2015, a court blocked the privatization.Legal challenges were overcome last September, but the Colombian peso had fallen sharply along with prices for the country\u2019s commodity exports, and one bidder after another had dropped out of the running.After Colbun of Chile withdrew from the auction on Monday, Brookfield was left as the only bidder. The sale took place at the minimum price: 6.486 trillion Colombian pesos, or $2 billion.Still, given the devaluation in the peso, the government is actually receiving significantly more in local currency than it would have if the deal had gone through in 2014.\u201cIt\u2019s a good deal for the government,\u201d Jaime Pedroza, utilities analyst with Credicorp Capital in Bogot\u00e1, said on Wednesday. \u201cBrookfield is paying a premium compared to prices for peers in the region and our estimate of fair value, but they probably see room for synergies and improvements in productivity.\u201dBrookfield\u2019s new investment in Colombia comes after several recent acquisitions in Brazil. Its chief executive, Bruce Flatt, reaffirmed the firm\u2019s interest in emerging markets in November, saying that he saw \u201cvalue opportunities which are not available in scale in many other places in the world today\u201d and that Brazil and China were merely suffering \u201cgrowing pains in otherwise solid markets.\u201dOver the last 18 months, Brookfield spent about $900 million to buy a 26.5 percent stake in the logistics company VLI from the mining giant Vale, $600 million to buy real estate from BR Properties of Brazil and $120 million to buy hydroelectric plants in Brazil.Brookfield is also negotiating to buy a stake in the Brazilian logistics company Invepar for about $350 million and to take private a Brazilian toll road company, Arteris.Credit Suisse advised the Colombian government on the auction.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders Clash on Issues and Vie for Votes of Iowa Women", "Date": "2016-01-24", "News": "Supported byNORTH LIBERTY, Iowa \u2014 From universal health care and paid family leave to college costs and the Keystone XL oil pipeline, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders challenged each other\u2019s priorities and courted female voters on Sunday as they began the final week of their increasingly hard-fought campaign to win the Iowa caucuses next Monday.As hundreds of volunteers for Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders fanned out across the state to knock on doors and to hold mini-rallies with supporters, the Democratic candidates campaigned in vote-rich counties in eastern Iowa where Barack Obama performed well in his victorious campaign in the 2008 caucuses. Of the two, Mr. Sanders made the sharper and steadier attacks on his rival, while Mrs. Clinton mixed praise for President Obama with criticism of Mr. Sanders.Mr. Sanders took repeated shots at a core part of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s political message: that she would be the strongest advocate for the needs of women and families. At a rally with 2,270 people in Decorah, Mr. Sanders noted that he, unlike Mrs. Clinton, supports proposed Senate legislation that would ensure three months of paid family leave for Americans, financed by a small increase in payroll taxes.\u201cA dollar and 61 cents a week to make sure when you have a baby, you can stay home with that baby and not be forced back to work,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cI think that makes sense. I think that is a good investment.\u201dMrs. Clinton supports guaranteeing 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave, but, as she said at a rally with about 650 people here, she would pay for such a policy with a tax increase on people earning at least $5 million. (Several supporters of the family leave legislation have endorsed Mrs. Clinton\u2019s presidential bid.)The candidates\u2019 focus on female voters on Sunday reflected the views of both campaigns that the caucus votes of many women are still up for grabs, based on the campaigns\u2019 polling analyses and canvassing efforts.Public opinion polls show that the Iowa race is extremely close, with Mr. Sanders gaining some ground recently as he tries to leverage liberal support to score a surprise victory. Mrs. Clinton, meanwhile, received a coveted endorsement from The Des Moines Register on Saturday night, an achievement that some of her volunteers were mentioning in their door-knocking visits on Sunday.To underscore her long history of championing women\u2019s rights, Mrs. Clinton campaigned on Sunday afternoon with Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood, who introduced Mrs. Clinton at a rally here as a \u201cfighter\u201d for health care and education programs.\u201cNo candidate has done more for women and families,\u201d Ms. Richards said.Mrs. Clinton, at rallies here and in Marion, recalled recently meeting women in Iowa who were working two or three jobs and worried about keeping their health insurance.A look at the latest results for Iowa and New Hampshire, and how this year compares to previous election seasons.\u201cThe fastest two ways to raise incomes are increasing the minimum wage, and finally guaranteeing equal pay for women\u2019s work, which will raise income for families and boost our economy,\u201d she said.Even as they drew policy differences with each other, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders did not launch the sort of harshly negative and personal attacks that several Republican presidential candidates have made.Mrs. Clinton has been increasingly pointing out inconsistencies in Mr. Sanders\u2019s positions, but she has not repeated her toughest language from last week, when she said Mr. Sanders had \u201cflip-flopped\u201d by now opposing legal immunity for gun manufacturers and dealers.The Clinton campaign used a sly tactic on Sunday by bringing to Iowa Ms. Richards and Chad Griffin, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights organization.The two served as a pointed reminder of some political trouble for Mr. Sanders last week when he described their two organizations as part of the political establishment.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.Mr. Sanders has since said he was referring to those groups\u2019 leaders. During a small rally at Grinnell College on Sunday, Ms. Richards called Mr. Sanders\u2019s characterization \u201cunfortunate,\u201d but otherwise focused on highlighting Mrs. Clinton\u2019s record. (Mr. Griffin, at a rally with Mrs. Clinton in West Des Moines on Sunday night, held back from attacking Mr. Sanders.)Mr. Sanders is drawing strong support on campuses like Grinnell with his array of liberal positions over the decades, including his opposition to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which Mrs. Clinton supported \u2014 a vote he brought up again on Sunday.\u201cThat is a difference in judgment in what turns out to be the most important foreign policy moment in the modern history of the United States,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in Decorah.He also accused Mrs. Clinton of being slow to oppose the Keystone XL pipeline while Mr. Sanders opposed it early on, and touted his legislation to break up commercial banks and to avoid a federal bailout of financial institutions again.\u201cThe time is now to break them up,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is not the position of Secretary Clinton.\u201dBut Mrs. Clinton, at her rally here, said current legislation included the power to break up banks. She criticized Mr. Sanders for not supporting other regulations for Wall Street firms.\u201cNo bank is too big to fail, and no executive too powerful to jail,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. (Mr. Sanders has taken to calling these executives \u201cbanksters.\u201d)For her part, Mrs. Clinton highlighted her plans to help college students avoid steep education loan debt or refinance their loans, and then picked apart Mr. Sanders\u2019s plan to make college tuition free, arguing that it wouldn\u2019t do anything to control college spending.\u201cI think that would be a big burden that wouldn\u2019t necessarily produce the results,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said in Marion. \u201cIf you say free college for everybody, that would encompass millionaires and billionaires, and they can afford it.\u201dMrs. Clinton did acknowledge the impatience for liberal reforms among Democrats, including many Sanders supporters who believe that she is insufficiently liberal and committed to fundamental changes in the nation.\u201cWe have been moving in our nation, thankfully, in a positive, progressive direction \u2014 maybe not as fast as some hope, but we keep moving forward,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cSometimes trying to stave off bad things and make good things happen doesn\u2019t occur as fast as you would hope.\u201dPatrick Healy reported from North Liberty and Marion, Iowa, and Yamiche Alcindor from Grinnell, Iowa.

Uber is perhaps the seminal harbinger of that change; take one well-entrenched industry (taxi and livery service) with a corner on the market and no need for innovation. Add one start-up with a clever, convenient approach and a willingness to flout laws. Pour millions of dollars on idea. Repeat.So while things like food delivery or on-demand office cleaning or whatever are certainly not as world-changing and attractive as robot monkey butlers, it is pretty much par for what Silicon Valley stands for: the destruction of the old in the name of efficiency and expediency.And that, my basic friend, is what is interesting to me: those being marginalized while the death and rebirth of new industries are widely celebrated by a handful of people in a small enclave of California. (I also like the technologies themselves, some of the time, at least.)But I am curious as to what would not bore you right now. What sort of start-ups are you looking for? What more do you want than on-demand booze and cookies?What I do think is pretty basic right now is the start-up financing scene. A year ago, the market looked crazy. Venture capitalists were funding anything that moved, and unicorns were everywhere. Then, in the fall, a gloom fell over the market, and it seemed we were headed for some kind of bust.That is to say, there will certainly be spectacular flameouts to come.

Sometimes he cannot help but remember his days in grade school in Mahopac, N.Y., when his teachers prodded him to brave an Outward Bound-type climbing program.\u201cI was terrified of heights,\u201d he confessed, with a grin that betrayed both embarrassment and retroactive amusement. \u201cBut you kind of adapt, and as time went on it kind of grew on me.\u201dWith high winds gusting across the Hudson, rain and snow turning steel beams slick as a frozen pond, dozens of cranes dangling 37-ton concrete road-deck panels from above, and heavy machinery churning all around, it can be exceedingly dangerous work. Three workers were killed putting up the Verrazano.Yet the Tappan Zee workers seem to feel a verve that goes beyond what they might experience on more workaday projects, an esprit de corps that comes from knowing they are erecting a mammoth specimen of infrastructure that they can point to and say they helped bring into the world.\u201cIt\u2019s seeing that you were part of something special,\u201d said Mr. D\u2019Ippolito, who grew up in a family that ran an Italian restaurant but whose profession was inspired by cousins and an uncle who were engineers. \u201dI can tell my kids and grandkids about it.\u201dThe bridge is expected to cost $3.9 billion. Plans for financing it include federal loans, state funds and construction bonds that would be paid off through tolls. But, with an eye to the costs of daily commuting from Rockland, Mr. Cuomo now proposes to freeze tolls on the Tappan Zee at $5 until 2020, paying for the freeze with a $700 million earmark that would also lock in tolls on the entire Thruway.Already more than a mile of the blue-steel horizontal framework that will undergird the concrete deck of the new bridge\u2019s southern span stretches boldly from the Rockland County bank across the Hudson, ending abruptly in midriver, and part of a second northern span is already projecting a half-mile from Rockland as well. With a schedule pitched aggressively so the first span of the bridge can open by the spring of 2017 and the full bridge by the following year, many of the workers put in 60 hours a week.Tappan Zee Constructors, the consortium that is building the new bridge for the Thruway Authority, said it does not discuss salary information. But many of the workers installing steel and concrete are members of various locals of the International Association of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental and Reinforcing Iron Workers. Bob Walsh, business manager of Local 40, said workers are paid by the hour only for the hours they work, and that a typical ironworker earns $48.75 in wages and an additional $70.35 an hour in health insurance and other benefits. In bad weather, they do not work and do not get paid.So far no one has died on the project, which began more than two years ago with the sinking of cylindrical piles into the river bottom. Safety for workers has been emphasized in a way that it was not 60 years ago, when reckless bravado was especially valued by an almost entirely male work force. There were at least five casualties then: A tugboat captain drowned after his vessel caught fire, and four workers were injured when a boom snapped and they fell 40 feet to a concrete structure on the waterline, newspaper articles at the time reported.Men and women who work on heights or narrow beams must wear safety harnesses that wrap around the thighs, shoulder and waist and are attached to lanyards, or cables, that are fitted with shock absorbers to gently break any falls. If Mr. D\u2019Ippolito were to slip \u2014 and fairly soon he will be working at a height of 12 stories \u2014 the lanyard and straps would let him drop six feet, then catch him as if he were a rock climber bouncing casually off the face of a cliff, but fairly gradually, thanks to the springlike action of the shock absorber. Old-fashioned harnesses could result in a broken back, workers say.Despite the safety precautions, spouses back home fret. Mr. D\u2019Ippolito\u2019s wife, Melissa, a lawyer, needs daily reassurance.Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York has been busily announcing big projects, but he hasn\u2019t exactly said where the money will come from to pay for them.\u201cShe says, \u2018Be careful!\u2019 every morning when I leave,\u201d he said.Her specialty is building in, and for, frigid weather; knowing, for example, how much concrete is needed to offset the powerful forces of expanding ice.Victoria Graney, a 30-year-old engineer from Virginia, has been surprised at how many of the engineers on the project are female. She attributes that shift to the increasing number of elementary schools and high schools offering science, technology, engineering and mathematics programs equally, to boys and girls.Unlike Mr. D\u2019Ippolito, Ms. Graney is what the trade calls a boomer, traveling far from home to projects made possible by booming local economies. In her case, that means renting an apartment in nearby Sleepy Hollow and trading weekend commutes to and from the Washington area with her husband of one year.She supervises eight other engineers who work on the Rockland and Westchester landings: the shoreline portions of the bridge, or what Ms. Graney calls \u201cthe bookends of the project,\u201d that connect the bridge to the highway and contain the toll lanes.\u201cI think landings are the coolest part of the project,\u201d she said.What makes them cool? She has to coordinate construction of new landings that overlap with the current ones, meaning that she and other workers do their assignments while automobiles and truck traffic speed by at 45 miles per hour. She also has to coordinate operations with the Metro-North Railroad, which runs below the landing, and with the utilities that own the electrical and gas lines that cross the bridge.Architectural blueprints for the landings might as well be sketches; much of the engineering has to be improvised as the construction proceeds. Ramps, for example, have to be engineered as to the peculiarities of a landscape.She and other landings workers are safeguarded not only by concrete barriers and safety harnesses, but also by luminous clothing.\u201cWe look like big glow sticks, and that\u2019s on purpose,\u201d Ms. Graney said. \u201cWe want our guys to be as visible as possible.\u201dMs. Graney grew up in Yorktown, Va., and credits \u201ca bossy mother\u201d for prodding her to take up engineering, which she studied at Virginia Tech, graduating in 2007, a month after a student there shot and killed 32 fellow students.\u201cMy husband ribs me because I call the bridge \u2018my bridge,\u2019 she said. \u201cI think about all the swag that says \u2018TZ\u2019 on it and people see it and are excited to meet you. They want to take a picture with you.\u201dFor Michael Shields, a 38-year-old member of Iron Workers Local 399, the daily work involves safely rigging and balancing the loads of concrete slabs on a crane, swinging them over to the steel framework and setting the slabs at the required elevation using leveling bolts, so the slabs are properly banked to adjust to the road\u2019s curvature.\u201cSo it all lines up together nice,\u201d he said.He has injured a shoulder on previous jobs and considers safety paramount, so that \u201ceverybody goes home at night.\u201d He said, \u201cThings can happen like this,\u201d snapping his fingers to indicate the swiftness. \u201cSo you never want to be under the piece.\u201dWhile slippery steel worries him, heights, he said, \u201chave never been an issue for me.\u201d\u201cI enjoy working high,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s an adrenaline rush to it. I mean you have to respect it also. You have to follow the rules.\u201dBack home in Mickleton, N.J., his 4-year-old daughter, Addison, is clearly awed. She calls every bridge she sees \u201cDaddy\u2019s bridge.\u201dLike Ms. Graney, Rick Pitner is also a boomer, but not, technically, on this project: He sleeps at home. He and his wife and two daughters live in East Stroudsburg, Pa., near the Delaware Water Gap, 91 miles away. He leaves the house shortly after 3 a.m. to drive the breadth of New Jersey to get to the Tappan Zee by 5.He helms a crew of eight that welds the concrete deck panels that crews like Mr. D\u2019Ippolito\u2019s and Mr. Shields\u2019s have fitted into the steel undergirding of the bridge\u2019s roadway. By Christmas, 576 of 2,000 panels had been installed.Mr. Pitner and his crew use 1,800\u2013amp heating guns that melt 9-inch-long studs, used to bond the concrete decks to the steel girders. They can weld 2,000 studs a day. This work, too, is hazardous. A crane overhead sometimes dangles loads of 12,000 studs. And the gun\u2019s heat produces flash burns, so he armors himself with a flame-resistant coat.Mr. Pitner, 57, grew up in Ohio with a father who \u201cwas good with his hands, and I\u2019m good with my hands.\u201d He said he preferred welding to other crafts, and liked working outdoors.\u201cWhen you work outdoors you see that you\u2019re making something, instead of making something indoors and never seeing it again,\u201d he said.He ticks off bridges, like the James River Bridge in Virginia, the Sunshine Skyway Bridge in Florida, and the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge over the Cooper River in South Carolina, that he has helped weld together since 1979.\u201cI\u2019m strictly a bridge man,\u201d he declares. \u201cI get called to work on projects by someone who knew me on a previous project. \u2018Don\u2019t burn your bridges\u2019 is what I say. There\u2019s always someone who remembers you did a good job.\u201dWhen the Tappan Zee\u2019s workers finish their day, they find various ways to unwind. Mr. D\u2019Ippolito relaxes with his wife, his 9-month-old baby, Isabella, and a glass of wine, and Mr. Shields frolics with Addison and his other daughter, Samantha, 7, or settles in to play Fantasy Football.All four look forward to taking their children one day to see the completed bridge.\u201cYou see a piece of history. Mr. Pitner said. \u201cYou can tell your kids you worked on this.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Electrifying India, With the Sun and Small Loans", "Date": "2016-01-02", "News": "Supported by7 PhotosA few years ago, the hundred or so residents of Paradeshappanamatha, a secluded hamlet in the southern Indian state of Karnataka, gathered along the central pathway between their 22 densely clustered homes, and watched as government workers hoisted a solar-powered streetlamp. As the first display of electricity in the town, it was an object of mild interest, but, being outside, the light didn\u2019t help anyone cook or study, and only attracted moths.Still, when B. Prasad arrived two years later to encourage people here to abandon kerosene lighting for solar-powered home systems, people had some idea what he was talking about. What sounded preposterous to the village residents was the price. Mr. Prasad, an agent for Solar Electric Light Company, or Selco, was selling a panel and battery that would power three lights and an attached socket for phone charging for approximately 12,800 rupees, or $192.\u201cThere was no way we could afford that,\u201d P. C. Kalayya remembers thinking. He and his neighbors rise early in the morning to walk miles along a nearly impassable dirt road to work on coffee, pepper and betel nut plantations. Mr. Kalayya earns $3 a day \u2014 he\u2019d been earning $2.25 until a raise came through this year \u2014 and half his wage is withheld by his employer as repayment for various loans.And yet, despite what seemed on its face an impossibly high cost, Selco agents succeeded in persuading Mr. Kalayya and 10 other village households to make the switch. Now, his wife can better see how much spice she is putting in as she cooks, and Pratima, their 18-year-old daughter, can study long after dark.The idea behind Selco, and other companies like it, is to create a business model that will help some of the 1.2 billion people in the world who don\u2019t have electricity to leapfrog the coal-dependent grid straight to renewable energy sources.Solar power accounts for just 1 percent of India\u2019s current electricity production, mostly through large plants that contribute power to the grid, but a generation of Indian energy entrepreneurs is out to prove that a faster, cleaner and ultimately more economical route to universal electrification is through solar home systems.\u201cWhy is it always about a grid?\u201d asked Harish Hande, a co-founder of Selco India. It was one of the first of more than 40 companies now offering solar home systems in India.Selco systems typically include a small panel connected to a battery that stores enough power to run one or more lights, phone chargers and, with higher wattage options, some small appliances. Since its inception in 1995, Selco India has sold 318,400 solar home systems, and has provided power systems to almost 10,000 schools, hospitals and other institutions, almost all in Karnataka.\u201cSolar home systems have been around for a long time by now, and they are a successful model,\u201d said Robert Stoner, the director of the Tata Center for Technology and Design at M.I.T., which works directly with Selco and others, including the Indian government, on renewable technology development. \u201cTheir challenge is that they cost a lot \u2014 far more than the average person has, even a relatively well-off person.\u201dSo if it is difficult to persuade a middle-class family in an industrialized country to invest in solar, how do you persuade a family that lives on a couple dollars a day?Mr. Prasad is a consummate salesman who talks a mile a minute, wears his hair in a side-part and keeps three pens in his breast pocket. On his home turf in the villages of the Chikkamagaluru district in Karnataka, his salesmanship is put to the test. If he can manage to interest people in what is often an unfamiliar technology, he then pitches his potential customers on the more mysterious, but crucial idea of financing.For two decades, Selco has worked to persuade a network of banks to provide financing options to poor people who were typically seen as too risky. As Mohan Hegde, the company\u2019s operations manager, noted, \u201cThe idea behind Selco is to take a poor man to the bank and see if what he can afford to pay per month is acceptable to the lenders.\u201dThe sales presentation, once it includes assurance of financing from a bank, is much more palatable to potential customers: Pay the bank monthly installments of roughly the same price you\u2019d spend on kerosene, and in a few short years, you\u2019ll own the system and your basic energy needs will be fulfilled by the sun free.\u201cWhen we say free, their ears prick up,\u201d Mr. Prasad said.Without financing, decentralized renewable energy could never compete in India with kerosene, which is cheap because the government subsidizes its sale at a cost of more than $5 billion a year. Use of kerosene contributes to carbon emissions, but also to more personal and immediate hazards like skin irritation, respiratory problems and a significant fire risk. Ultimately, it provides only dim, flickering lighting.For many of Selco\u2019s customers, financing the solar home system is their first interaction with a bank. The experience is often new for the bankers, too.\u201cHonestly, I had never even heard of Paradeshappanamatha, and beyond that I\u2019ve never dealt with financing such small sums,\u201d said Shahanaz Ali, the manager of a branch of the Kaveri Grameena Bank, where Mr. Kalayya and his neighbors eventually opened accounts. \u201cI\u2019m very new to this job, so taking risks with these kinds of people is worrisome. They have no collateral, so I have no security in giving individual loans.\u201dMs. Ali telephoned a superior based in a nearby town who had interacted with Selco customers before, and he reassured her that very few defaulted. He offered her an idea for financing that Selco had used for other remote villages.\u201cI created what\u2019s called a \u2018Joint Liability Group,\u2019 \u201d said Ms. Ali. \u201cIn the J.L.G., we give a loan to a group, and each member acts as another\u2019s guarantor, so therefore if one defaults, the whole group does, too.\u201dThrough the cooperation of hundreds of banks like Ms. Ali\u2019s, Selco effectively shifts financial risk away from the customer, and away from its own investors. By and large, the risk to the banks has been worth it \u2014 7.4 percent of Selco\u2019s hundreds of thousands of customers have defaulted. But each new bank needs to be persuaded to participate, and so salesmen like Mr. Prasad can\u2019t promise customers financing from the get-go.\u201cThe banks are only with us because we are relentless about our business model, and the only reason we can be that way is because we have wonderfully patient investors,\u201d said Mr. Hande.Selco\u2019s three investors are foundations, two European and one American, that function like venture capital firms, but emphasize social impact rather than profitability. Selco\u2019s margins are only around 3 to 4 percent; net profit was just $62,500 in the 2013-14 financial year.Other solar home system providers in India, as well as in Africa, have steered clear of the arduous bank-centric model and opted for pay-as-you-go plans, similar to prepaid cellphones. The user pays a shopkeeper for a certain amount of electricity and essentially rents the system.\u201cIn the pay-as-you-go model, the company is forced to own all the capital, so they end up with this incredibly large balance sheet and take on a lot of investor risk,\u201d said Mr. Stoner, the director of the M.I.T. research institute. \u201cOn the other hand, it does allow individuals to get the benefits without having to take on loans.\u201dMr. Kalayya\u2019s family hopes that their solar home system, with its lights and phone charger, is only the beginning. Pratima, who is one of four people in the village to have attended school, said that getting bank accounts and understanding loans had broadened her family\u2019s sense of possibility.\u201cThe faster we pay off this loan, the more likely we are to get another one,\u201d she said.Ms. Ali, the banker, had offered families in Paradeshappanamatha a minimum monthly payment of 350 rupees, or about $5.30, but after a group discussion, the families decided to make spending sacrifices so as to pay 500 rupees per month. They had seen electric appliances in town that could improve their lives.\u201cWe still have to do manual grinding of grains and spices,\u201d Mr. Kalayya said. \u201cIt takes up a lot of time. The next loan can be for a machine that will do this.\u201dThe solar home system, or S.H.S., model has steadily grown as the technology becomes more affordable. A report released in early 2015 by the Climate Group, an international nonprofit working toward a low-carbon economy, together with Goldman Sachs, estimated that the 40 to 50 S.H.S. providers in India were on track to sell at least five million solar home systems in India between 2014 and 2018. The report added that \u201cbetter models for consumer finance alongside large demand and rising incomes,\u201d along with projected growth in per-capita income, could expand that number to around 7.2 million households, or more than 30 million people, by 2018.If true, solar home systems would still account for only a minuscule proportion of India\u2019s electricity supply, and profit margins for providers would remain in the low single digits.The scale of the S.H.S. business model depends on its adaptability to dense, urban areas, where homes are often makeshift and temporary, and where almost all of the net growth in India\u2019s population is projected to occur. Many urban migrants have no legal rights to live where they do, which leaves them vulnerable in countless ways, including the inability to demand electricity from the public grid, or, for that matter, to have access to the kerosene subsidy.In a cluster of around 70 hovels made of scrap metal and plastic about an hour\u2019s drive through bumper-to-bumper traffic from Selco\u2019s headquarters in Bangalore, the company is trying out a model specialized for urban, landless people.The ramshackle settlement doesn\u2019t have an official name, and the Bengali-speaking migrants who live there refer to the place as \u201cnear Hebbal flyover,\u201d referring to a nearby overpass.Mosidul Haque says he came to the settlement three years ago from a town in the state of West Bengal, 1,500 miles away. He now roams Bangalore for recyclable material, which he puts into giant burlap sacks tied to a bicycle that he uses as a cart. He makes an average of 300 rupees a day from a middleman who buys the scrap.Mr. Haque used his savings to open a small stall selling cigarettes and tea, and when Selco scouted the settlement, they identified him as a possible operator who could run a pay-as-you-go-style business for area residents.Based on the number of people living in Mr. Haque\u2019s vicinity, Selco provided him with two large solar panels to put on the roof, 32 power storage batteries and an equal number of single-bulb lamps to rent out. Mr. Haque now sells electricity from the batteries by the hour. He also fully charges phones for 5 rupees, or about 8 cents, saving his customers trips to distant charge shops whose owners they don\u2019t trust, where they would have to stand guard for the duration of the charging.He gets paid 1,000 rupees a month, or about $15, by Selco to serve as an operator, and also earns on the batteries and phone charging. But each month, he must pay 4,000 rupees as an installment toward the 80,000-rupee price, or $1,200, of the entire system, which is owned by Selco until the payments are complete. Very few banks would lend to itinerant workers like Mr. Haque, whose assets and livelihoods are so vulnerable, so this model shifts risk back onto Selco and its investors.The risk is not just that Mr. Haque will come up short. This November, he returned from visiting his home in West Bengal to find that one of the solar panels had been stolen. He\u2019d rather not inform the police; he says they already see the migrants as thieves, and look for excuses to evict them. Selco\u2019s investors will cover the cost of the panel, and the replacement is going to be installed on a higher pole.Running a solar business in an informal settlement like \u201cnear Hebbal flyover\u201d involves a thicket of problems. Mr. Haque worries about whether his home will be razed or if he\u2019ll be able to generate electricity during the long weeks of monsoon rains, or dense winter fog, when lighting is more important than ever. And when your customers are living hand-to-mouth, just collecting payment is a daily frustration.\u201cPeople take mobile charges and light payments from me on credit, and then they never pay,\u201d Mr. Haque said. \u201cWhen you go and ask them for the money, it always turns into a fight. People here get a chance to loot and before you know it, your money is gone.\u201dWhile Mr. Hande, Mr. Stoner and others try to iron out problems like these, they acknowledge that solar home systems don\u2019t represent a complete solution to energy poverty, if only because it is so intertwined with the precariousness of the lives of his customers.\u201cWith S.H.S.\u2019s, at the end of the day, you are just replacing an existing cost with a better technology,\u201d Mr. Stoner said. \u201cHaving electric lighting at home might allow a child to study for longer hours, so you are introducing an indirect productivity benefit, but it doesn\u2019t help you pay next month\u2019s loan.\u201d\u201cStill,\u201d he said, \u201cthat first kilowatt of electricity someone gets is worth an awful lot because they go from darkness to light, with a very small amount of energy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cuomo\u2019s Plan for Financing Affordable Housing Worries City Officials", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Supported byGov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s budget this year calls for more state control over the financing of affordable housing, a move that New York City officials and affordable housing representatives say would slow and undermine efforts to build and maintain such units for low-income New Yorkers.City officials and builders of affordable housing argue that the state would be adding uncertainty, delays and politics to the production of affordable units while infringing on the city\u2019s ability to shape residential development and implement its housing plan.\u201cThis recalls the famous phrase, \u2018If it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it,\u2019 \u201d Mayor Bill de Blasio said during testimony on the budget before the State Legislature this week.\u201cWe think adding these additional layers will only slow down the process at a point where thousands and thousands of people are waiting for housing that will allow them and their families to be able to make ends meet,\u201d he said.But as with many initial budget provisions, the proposal is subject to negotiation. In an interview on Friday, Mr. Cuomo said that he would be open to focusing on the real target of the heightened scrutiny \u2014 counties that use the tax-exempt financing to lure companies from other counties. He referred to the practice as \u201cpiracy,\u201d and said he wanted the local governments to use the bonds to bring in new jobs from outside the state rather than hurt one another.The governor said the proposal would not make \u201ca hill of beans\u201d difference to New York City, which uses the bonds exclusively to finance the construction or rehabilitation of affordable housing.\u201cI\u2019d be open to discussing focusing on economic development programs, because that\u2019s where the questions lie,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said.On why he did not propose this from the outset, he said, \u201cI\u2019d never get it passed because now it looks like you\u2019re targeting the Republican areas and not the Democratic areas.\u201d Still, he said the new state oversight would not delay approvals of projects.Among those who build and rehabilitate affordable housing, most of those interviewed were careful not to ascribe motives to the proposal, given the acrimony between the mayor and the governor. But many had questioned the need for state involvement in a process widely regarded as a well-run engine that produces thousands of affordable units a year.\u201cI\u2019ve never heard that the city is not accountable,\u201d said Jolie A. Milstein, president and chief executive of the New York State Association for Affordable Housing, which represents developers, lenders and others in affordable housing.New York City has been its own gatekeeper in marshaling federal, state and city financing to decide which affordable housing projects are built or preserved, and where. The federal tax-exempt bonds, which reduce borrowing costs and leverage other funding sources, pay for nearly half of the affordable units built and preserved in the city, officials said.The bonds provide $650 million to $900 million worth of financing a year and in the last two years funded the creation or preservation of 16,700 units, said Gary D. Rodney, president of the New York City Housing Development Corporation, which issues the bonds for housing projects in the city. The agency\u2019s board has two members appointed by the governor, but its majority consists of the mayor\u2019s appointees and members of his administration.Alicia Glen, the deputy mayor for housing and economic development, called the tax-exempt financing \u201ca critical component of delivering affordable housing at a pace that\u2019s greater than it\u2019s been in the last couple of decades.\u201d\u201cAny additional approvals, in our view, could impact our ability to deliver projects effectively to the market,\u201d she said.Affordable housing has been a signature issue for Mr. de Blasio, who has promised to build 80,000 new affordable units and preserve an additional 120,000 among the existing rent-regulated stock over 10 years. Earlier this month, Mr. Cuomo unveiled a $20 billion housing plan that includes adding 100,000 affordable units over five years.But Jerilyn Perine, the group\u2019s executive director, said the report called for more conversations among officials and more information to be made available on housing agency websites.\u201cWe were not talking at all about additional government bureaucracy,\u201d she said.Government watchdog groups saw the state\u2019s move as an intrusion that would subject housing applications to horse trading among the governor and legislative leaders.Nonprofit housing organizations were concerned that small developers would be at a disadvantage in Albany, saying that they lacked the resources to lobby for their projects.\u201cDevelopers and financial institutions rely on clarity and predictability,\u201d John H. Banks III, the president of the board, said in a statement. \u201cThe more layers of government, the less clarity and predictability and the greater our concerns.\u201dAdvertisement"}

We have 30 buildings in Manhattan, one in Brooklyn and one in Queens. We have something in Long Island, 15 buildings in Jersey City. I would say about 60 percent are rent-regulated.

{"Headline": "Denmark Moves to Make Refugees Hand Over Valuables", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Denmark is poised to pass a law requiring newly arrived refugees to hand over valuables, including gold or jewelry, to help pay for the costs of lodging them. Under the proposal, asylum seekers who enter the country with more than 10,000 kroner, or about $1,450, in assets would have to help finance their stay.Critics say the latest measure evokes Europe\u2019s darkest hours, when the Nazis seized valuables from Jews during the Holocaust. The government has amended the bill to exempt from confiscation \u201cobjects with sentimental value,\u201d like wedding and engagement rings and family portraits. A vote is scheduled for Jan. 26, and approval with wide cross-party support is expected.Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen defended the bill this week. \u201cThis is probably the most misunderstood proposal in the history of Denmark,\u201d he was quoted as saying by Politiken, a Danish daily newspaper. \u201cLooking at the debate, you almost get the impression that we are going to turn people upside down to see if we can shake the last coin out of their pockets. That is completely distorted and wrong.\u201dMr. Rasmussen said the bill would merely make the same requirement of refugees that Danish law already does for the country\u2019s citizens \u2014 that they must use their own resources before they can qualify for welfare benefits.In Denmark, as in countries like France and Sweden, a far-right populist party, the Danish People\u2019s Party, has been attracting voters by railing against immigration. Mr. Rasmussen\u2019s governing center-right party, which does not have a majority in Parliament, often needs the Danish People\u2019s Party\u2019s support to pass legislation.Analysts said the recent moves by Denmark reflected a concerted effort to make the country less attractive for refugees. Among the new bill\u2019s provisions is a three-year waiting period before asylum seekers can apply to bring their families to Denmark, which human rights activists have criticized as unusually cruel.\u201cEven with the latest changes to the bill, the legislation still paints a bad image of Denmark in the international community, and I don\u2019t recognize myself or the Danish people in this bill,\u201d Mr. Rohde said. \u201cThe bill is less horrible than before, but still undignified.\u201dJakob Nielsen, the editor of Politiken\u2019s online edition, said it was paradoxical that Denmark was trying to make the country less attractive for immigrants. \u201cDanes are known for being some of the happiest people on earth, with one of the most generous welfare states, and now the government is trying to worsen our image to give the message: Refugees, don\u2019t come here.\u201d\u00a0Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "G.E. Is Moving Headquarters to Boston and Itself Into the Digital Era", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported byYet Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chief executive, predicted last September that G.E. would be a \u201ctop 10 software company\u201d by 2020. In recent years, the company has steadily built up its software business, and its industrial products are increasingly loaded with digital sensors, all part of an effort to be a leader in the \u201cindustrial Internet.\u201dNow, in its latest step to remake itself \u2014 and its public image \u2014 as an industrial company for the digital era, G.E. said it was moving its headquarters from its longtime sprawling suburban home in Fairfield, Conn., to the high-tech environs of Boston.The relocation by G.E., long a bellwether of the American economy, illustrates how much old-line companies in nearly every industry have been forced to rethink their businesses for a digital age. It is an opportunity, but also a threat. So Walmart is investing heavily in online commerce to meet the challenge from Amazon, and Ford and General Motors are retooling to keep up with innovators like Tesla and Google.The Boston region, Mr. Immelt said, is \u201can ecosystem that shares our aspirations.\u201dThe area is crowded with 55 colleges and universities, including research centers like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard and Northeastern University. G.E. said it was also attracted by the area\u2019s thriving venture capital and start-up community, and pro-business state and local government.In Fairfield, G.E. has about 800 employees, a tiny percentage of its 360,000 employees worldwide. In Boston, G.E. will also have 800 people, but it will have a different kind of headquarters setting, the company said.Only about 200 will be corporate staff, G.E. said, while the remaining 600 will be mainly \u201cdigital industrial product managers, designers and developers\u201d in a variety of disciplines including data analysis, life sciences and robotics.The new headquarters will be leaner, faster and more open with a constant flow of industry partners, customers and innovators, G.E. executives say. The intent, they say, is that it will be more like walking into a start-up in an urban setting than the remote suburban headquarters of the past.The move fits the recent pattern at G.E., analysts say. \u201cIt affirms G.E.\u2019s digital technology orientation and that strategic commitment for decades ahead,\u201d said Steven Winoker, an analyst at Bernstein Research.For years already, G.E. has been at the forefront of industrial companies seeking to use sensor data and clever software to make its machines smarter, using less fuel and predicting when they need maintenance before breakdowns occur. Executives routinely call it \u201can industrial digital business.\u201dG.E.\u2019s digital push is part of the company\u2019s evolution, as it has focused its investment on the industrial side of its business while sharply cutting its once-huge finance arm in the wake of the financial crisis. In 2011, G.E. opened a separate software unit in San Ramon, Calif., which employs 2,000.The company moved to Fairfield in 1974, when many major companies were leaving New York City for suburbia with its lower taxes and living costs, and good public schools. G.E. first said it was weighing moving its headquarters last June, after Connecticut proposed raising taxes on businesses to close the state budget gap.That prompted G.E. to address the issue with urgency but, in its statement on Wednesday, G.E. said its senior management had been considering the appropriate role and location of its headquarters for more than three years.G.E. has not identified the address of its new headquarters, but the company said it would be in the Seaport District in South Boston, which is becoming a hub for investment by technology, biomedical and pharmaceutical companies.Massachusetts and Boston are offering an ample package of incentives. In news releases welcoming G.E., Gov. Charlie Baker and Mayor Martin J. Walsh said the state offered incentives of as much as $120 million through grants and other programs, and the city offered as much as $25 million in property tax relief.The city and state also agreed to make transportation improvements in the Seaport District and to build an innovation center where G.E. and university researchers can collaborate.Employees will move to a temporary location in Boston starting this summer, G.E. said, with the permanent move completed by 2018.G.E. said that the financial incentives from state and city governments vying for its headquarters were competitive. In the financial negotiations, G.E. wanted incentives and grants to make the move itself essentially cost-free for the company, said a person involved in the talks who was not authorized to speak publicly. But G.E. did not seek tax deals that would continue year after year, he said.In its statement, G.E. said it began its search with an initial list of 40 locations. San Francisco was ruled out partly because of its high living costs, and the longer time difference \u2014 by three hours, compared with the East Coast \u2014 in communicating with G.E.\u2019s units in Europe, where the company has a sizable business. Other cities, including New York, made strong bids, but in the end it was Boston, the person involved in the talks said. G.E. did not estimate the extent of the job losses in Connecticut as a result of the move. The company employs 5,000 people in the state, including the 800 at its headquarters.Jess Bidgood contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New Engineering Firm Called Upon to Fix Squibb Park Bridge", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Supported byThe Brooklyn Bridge Park Corporation has finally acknowledged what everyone else has known for months: The $4.1 million Squibb Park Bridge, closed for 17 months, is not reopening anytime soon.At a meeting of its board on Friday, park corporation officials said they were suing the firm of the bridge\u2019s designer \u2014 a MacArthur \u201cgenius grant\u201d winner \u2014 and removing his company from the repairwork, with plans to replace it with an international engineering firm. The lawsuit, filed in State Supreme Court, alleges breach of contract and professional malpractice.Squibb Park Bridge, a 400-foot wooden pedestrian bridge that is supposed to connect Brooklyn Heights to the 1.3-mile-long Brooklyn Bridge Park, opened in 2013. But a year later, its gentle up-and-down movements \u2014 part of the its allure \u2014 became too pronounced, and the bridge began to sway and tilt. In August 2014, it was abruptly closed by the park corporation, which operates Brooklyn Bridge Park.While the closing of the footbridge certainly did not affect the economy or traffic patterns, it was nonetheless an embarrassment for a park that has garnered much attention for its high-design touches. It has also been the subject of debate over its financing model \u2014 relying on private, luxury housing to pay for the park\u2019s maintenance.State Senator Daniel L. Squadron, a Democrat whose district includes the park, has been critical of the way the corporation has handled the closing. \u201cFrom the beginning, there was a distinct lack of communication and transparency on the bridge\u2019s closure,\u201d he said at the board meeting, noting that he had been told multiple times that the bridge would soon reopen, only to see it remain closed.He said Brooklyn Bridge Park Corporation officials had never offered anything more than \u201cvague assurances\u201d about the bridge, and had not been forthcoming about what was wrong with it. \u201cThis is a public amenity, in which the community and its representatives have an interest,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pattern of scant information sharing and collaboration are unacceptable.\u201dRegina Myer, president of the park corporation, rejected assertions that the organization was being evasive last summer when it said the bridge was fixed and just needed city approval to reopen.\u201cThat was our understanding at the time,\u201d Belinda Cape, a spokeswoman, said in an email.But Ms. Myer, speaking of HNTB, said in a statement, \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s now clear that the firm was either unwilling or unable to provide a workable solution to fix the bridge, and that its design was inherently flawed \u2014 that\u2019s why we\u2019re bringing them to court.\u201dThe lawsuit seeks $3 million in damages. Park corporation officials said Arup, the international engineering firm, would design and oversee a plan to stabilize the bridge. That will involve a retrofit that modifies the original design and is focused on safety, which could mean sacrificing the original bounce. It was unclear why HNTB was unable to design such a retrofit itself. Messages left for Mr. Zoli and an HNTB spokesman were not answered.In a statement, Ms. Cape said Arup would work with the New York City Transportation Department\u2019s Division of Bridges on the design of the retrofit. The park corporation, she said, would also work to \u201crecoup costs related to HNTB\u2019s professional failures.\u201dThe park corporation said it expected to pay Arup about $516,000 for its services. That is on top of $955,000 already spent on the unsuccessful repairs. Arup was asked in 2014 to conduct a \u201cpeer review\u201d of HNTB\u2019s efforts to solve the problem with the bridge.But residents will continue to wait for the bridge to reopen: Park corporation officials say that once Arup completes its proposal, which will take about six months, the corporation will put the repair work out to bid.Arup has its own history with problematic bridges. It was one of three designers chosen for the Millennium Bridge in London, a steel-suspension footbridge that crosses the River Thames. The bridge closed two days after it opened in 2000, because it began to sway underfoot, and Arup worked on the repairs. It was closed for two years.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Setting Up Fund for Its Electronics Industry", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 A Chinese technology regulator said on Friday that it would cooperate with a bank to set up a $30 billion fund to support the country\u2019s huge electronics supply chain.Official accounts of the fund did not make clear precisely how the money would be spent. But given the recent weakness in Chinese manufacturing and lower-end electronics manufacturers, it may be intended as a form of stimulus to the tech industry. The terminology used in media accounts signals China\u2019s bold technology ambitions. Reports about the new fund said it would be used to build a \u201cstrong manufacturing country\u201d and an \u201cInternet power.\u201dLocal shares have been hit hard this week by concerns about a depreciating currency and slowing growth. That volatility is most likely worsening an already difficult situation for lower-end electronics makers and component suppliers in China.While China\u2019s largest hardware brands and booming Internet companies tend to attract media attention, the country also has huge numbers of companies that support the electronics supply chain. With low margins and inconsistent orders, many are highly exposed to slowdowns in the worldwide demand for electronics.The headwinds were highlighted again on Friday, when the Taiwanese electronics manufacturing giant Foxconn said that December revenue was 20 percent lower than it was last December. The company operates a number of city-size production facilities in China.Still, Mr. Zhou said that the financing would be used to develop advanced technologies and support companies that are facing financing difficulties, an indication that it might not ultimately lead to a reduction in China\u2019s huge number of low-cost electronics manufacturers.Over the last year, the semiconductor fund has been used to finance a number of strategic investments and acquisitions in foreign chip companies. Foreign trade groups have said it gives unfair advantage to Chinese companies and is a tool of Beijing\u2019s industrial policies. It is unclear whether the new fund will be used to support acquisitions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lessons, and Parallels, in Jeb Bush\u2019s Failed Run for Governor", "Date": "2016-01-11", "News": "Supported byFirst CampaignsThen a 39-year-old real estate developer, Mr. Bush was hardly new to politics. He was a president\u2019s son, a onetime Dade County Republican chairman and a former state secretary of commerce. He had just overseen his father\u2019s victorious campaign effort in Florida. But he had never run for office. And he was talking about challenging one of the most popular Democrats in the state\u2019s history, Lawton Chiles.Bill McInturff, one of his lunch companions, suggested that Mr. Bush lower his sights to lieutenant governor, a powerless office. But Mr. Bush, who had been waiting for his father\u2019s political career to end to begin his own, flatly refused.\u201cOh, yeah, he was decisive,\u201d Mr. McInturff said. Mr. Bush, he recalled, wanted to transform Florida, \u201cand it wasn\u2019t worth spending two years on the road unless you were able to make those changes.\u201dFrom that day on, Mr. Bush plunged into what would prove to be a sometimes painful learning curve of a first campaign, winning a crowded Republican primary but losing narrowly to Mr. Chiles. He became one of only two Republicans in the nation defeated in high-profile statewide elections in 1994, one of the biggest Republican sweeps in history. In 1994, like today, Mr. Bush was in a crowded primary of conservatives and struggled to win without moving so far to the right as to undercut his general election prospects. Then as now, he sought to distinguish himself from a president with the same last name without alienating the many Republican voters and donors who admired his family. Once again, he is trying to repair his family\u2019s legacy: In 1994, it was after his father\u2019s defeat; today it is after his brother\u2019s exit from the White House under a cloud of disapproval. And in that race, as in this one, he made the occasional sloppy statement that could prove damaging \u2014 though in 1994, such flubs could be dismissed as rookie mistakes. When asked back then what he would do to help blacks, Mr. Bush responded, \u201cProbably nothing,\u201d shorthand intended to convey his view that government should not tailor programs to specific groups. Democrats hammered him.\u201cHe was confident enough of his intellect and his positions on policy issues, but sometimes his filter wouldn\u2019t function properly,\u201d said Mac Stipanovich, who ran the campaign. \u201cHe didn\u2019t think about how something would sound, because he knew what he wanted to say.\u201dWithout doubt, as Mr. Bush said in an interview, he learned lessons that made him a better candidate four years later, when he was elected governor. By his own account, he had been too lost in the details of white papers, unsteady as he made the transition from political operative to a candidate and too strident and provocative in his policy. It hurt him with moderates and blacks, and provided an opening for the more affable Mr. Chiles.\u201cI could have won had I shared who I was, given people a sense that I was there to serve,\u201d Mr. Bush said. \u201cYou can\u2019t offer up a five-point plan \u2014 as I did in 1994 \u2014 when not enough people can say: \u2018I know this guy. He\u2019s a good guy. He cares about me.\u2019\u201dBuddy MacKay, a Democrat who was Mr. Chiles\u2019s running mate and whom Mr. Bush defeated for governor in 1998, said Mr. Bush today was a markedly improved candidate. \u201cHe\u2019s a much different campaigner now,\u201d Mr. MacKay said. \u201cTo me he comes across as a person. He talks about the joy of the campaign.\u201d\u201cIt was a Republican year: Contract With America, Newt Gingrich. Nobody who was anybody lost that year except Jeb and Arianna Huffington\u2019s husband in California,\u201d Mr. Stipanovich said, referring to Michael Huffington\u2019s campaign for United States Senate. \u201cIt was definitely a learning experience.\u201dFrom the start, Mr. Bush\u2019s candidacy was a textbook example of a first campaign, but with the added advantages and disadvantages of being a president\u2019s son: heightened expectations, a ready-made fund-raising network, a sometimes polarizing legacy. Mr. Chiles was viewed as vulnerable. Crime was up; the state was reeling from a series of attacks on tourists. Taxes were high. Seven Republicans ran in the primary.Mr. Bush\u2019s opponents were quickly reminded that he was a different kind of Floridian as he spent $4 million, a huge sum at the time. \u201cThey really ran the governor\u2019s race much like the presidential race,\u201d said James C. Smith, a former Florida secretary of state and one of Mr. Bush\u2019s opponents. \u201cI remember going to a debate somewhere, and Jeb had a press setup and he had food for the media. We couldn\u2019t afford to buy them a Vienna sausage.\u201dMr. Bush also proved something of an oddity, at least to the experts he hired. He took an almost academic interest in policy, particularly on public education. He issued long policy papers. \u201cIt became a one-year seminar in public policy,\u201d said Mr. McInturff, the Republican pollster. \u201cWe did not do any of the traditional candidate-vulnerability surveys, or name IDs. It was devoted to Jeb creating and building a public-policy network.\u201dMr. Stipanovich said that Mr. Bush was \u201cvery smart; he was very oriented to policy.\u201d\u201cBut he was not a good public speaker,\u201d he said. \u201cUnlike Marco Rubio,\u201d he added, referring to one of Mr. Bush\u2019s opponents in the presidential primary, \u201cwho can find 50 different ways to tell you that his dad was a bartender, Jeb didn\u2019t possess that skill.\u201dMr. Bush paid little attention to the day-to-day mechanics of winning a statewide race. \u201cHis job was to be the candidate,\u201d said Alex Castellanos, a Republican consultant who advised him that year. \u201cHe was not at all involved in the politics. The politics didn\u2019t interest him much.\u201dMr. Bush soon learned the difference between being an adviser on the sidelines and being the person in the spotlight. At one fund-raiser, he waited to shake the hands of a long line of people eager to meet him. Mr. Castellanos videotaped Mr. Bush and showed him the result: a candidate looking over the shoulder of the person he was supposed to be greeting and instead peering at the crowd stretching to the door.\u201cI was more worried in making sure that people waiting in line would get to see me,\u201d Mr. Bush said. \u201cSo I was looking beyond the person I should be talking to.\u201d He added, \u201cIt was painful to watch.\u201dMr. Bush worked to distinguish himself in a crowded primary in which each candidate focused on Mr. Chiles. He ended up talking more about what he was against than about what he wanted to do as governor. These were not uncommon problems for a candidate emerging from a primary. But the Sept. 8 primary in Florida gave him little time to reposition himself for a broader electorate. And under the provisions of a law Mr. Chiles had signed, Mr. Bush\u2019s decision to bypass the state\u2019s campaign-finance system entitled Mr. Chiles, who participated in it, to a large infusion of public campaign funds. That would give him a key advantage in the weeks ahead.Mr. Bush won about 46 percent of the primary vote, forcing him into a runoff, until Mr. Smith, who came in second place, dropped out. Turning his attention to Mr. Chiles, Mr. Bush tried to link the governor, an old-school conservative Democrat, with liberal Democrats across the country.Mr. Chiles might not have been as strong as he once was, but he was a powerful figure in Florida politics, as Mr. Bush observed when asked if he took any lessons from 1994.\u201cLots of lessons,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cOne was a lesson for any young budding politician: Don\u2019t run against someone who never lost. Find bad candidates.\u201dMr. Bush made it harder on himself. Many of his attacks backfired, permitting Mr. Chiles to present Mr. Bush as a rash, opportunistic interloper \u2014 as when Mr. Bush advocated strict welfare restrictions, suggesting that women \u201cfind a husband\u201d if they lose their benefits.Mr. Bush today does not dispute this. \u201cThe tone was probably too sharp,\u201d he said.To portray Mr. Chiles as weak on crime, Mr. Bush\u2019s campaign released a searing advertisement featuring the mother of a 10-year-old girl who had been kidnapped and murdered, and questioning why Mr. Chiles had not signed the attacker\u2019s death warrant. As it turned out, the accusation against Mr. Chiles, a death penalty advocate, was inaccurate.\u201cOops,\u201d Mr. McInturff said. \u201cIt turned out that death warrant had never come to Lawton Chiles\u2019s desk. We lost about 10 days because of that ad.\u201d\u201cLet me tell you one other thing about the old liberal,\u201d he said. \u201cThe he-coon walks just before the light of day.\u201d Mr. Bush looked baffled. But many in the Tampa crowd burst into applause at the old Florida reference to the elder, wiser leader of a pack of raccoons that knows when to pick its moment. A week later, Mr. Bush lost his first election to public office.By the time he ran again in 1998, Mr. Bush had moved beyond the long policy papers, sharp attacks and dogmatic ideological positions. \u201cI told stories instead of making a provocative statement to make a point,\u201d he said, recalling his rebound race. \u201cI learned how to put it in human context. I\u2019m a wonky guy \u2014 I love policy. I learned through the \u201994 experience, not everybody is wonky.\u201dThe loss, by any measure, was a humbling experience, the more so because Mr. Bush\u2019s brother won the same day. \u201cAt the moment that my brother was celebrating an impressive victory and my mom and dad were there, my loss was kind of a wet blanket on them,\u201d Mr. Bush said. A few weeks later, he was riding in a nearly empty Metrorail car in Miami and noticed a rider staring at him. \u201cIt was one of those looks, like he sort of knew who I was and couldn\u2019t figure it out,\u201d Mr. Bush said. \u201cAnd finally, he busted out \u2014 he goes, \u2018Yeah, you used to be Jeb Bush, right?\u2019\u201d\u201cIt was a groin kick,\u201d Mr. Bush said. \u201cA good reminder that all this stuff is fleeting.\u201dAn earlier version of this article described incorrectly George W. Bush\u2019s campaign for governor of Texas in 1994. It was his first successful run for public office, not his first run overall. (He lost a race for Congress in 1978.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Taxi Drivers and Air Traffic Controllers Go on Strike in France", "Date": "2016-01-26", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 Taxi drivers and air traffic controllers in France went on separate but simultaneous strikes on Tuesday, blocking traffic in major cities and disrupting flights at several airports.The strikes were part of a wider day of protests in the public sector, including hospitals and schools, to call attention to staff reductions, low salaries and education overhauls. More than 100 demonstrations were planned around the country, and CGT, one of the unions that organized the strike, said that 130,000 to 150,000 people participated nationwide.The police in Paris said that about 2,000 taxis had blocked or delayed traffic around Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports, as well as Porte Maillot, a major intersection in western Paris, and near the Ministry of Economy and Finance.Some taxi drivers set fire to tires and tried to block the highway that circles the French capital, but the police pushed the demonstrators back with tear gas.Twenty-four people were arrested, including the driver of an airport shuttle who had tried to force his way through a taxi roadblock near Orly, injuring two people, the French news media reported.Hundreds of taxi drivers also blocked traffic around airports and train stations in Lille and Toulouse on Tuesday, and they paralyzed traffic in central Marseille.Prime Minister Manuel Valls held an emergency meeting with taxi union representatives, the interior minister and representatives from the Transportation Ministry on Tuesday.Mr. Valls\u2019s office said in a statement after the meeting that the government would increase enforcement of the 2014 law that regulates the activity of ride-booking companies, to \u201cput an end to unfair behavior and guarantee the conditions of loyal competition.\u201dThe statement said that Mr. Valls was ready to consult industry and government representatives \u201con the economic equilibrium of the individual transportation sector and on the potential regulatory evolutions that might follow.\u201dThe consultations will begin in February and will last about three months, the statement said, adding that a \u201cqualified person\u201d would be appointed in the coming days to lead the process.The statement also said that the government would provide support to individual drivers, but it did not provide any details. Some taxi unions have asked that drivers receive financial compensation from the state for their loss of business and the drop in the value of taxi licenses.Ahmed Senbel, president of the National Federation of Independent Taxis, said after the meeting that he felt Mr. Valls was fully aware of the problem, but he warned that the announcements might not placate the taxi drivers.\u201cWe\u2019ve been containing it for seven years, but today we can\u2019t contain it anymore,\u201d Mr. Senbel said. Mr. Valls said earlier that the right to demonstrate should be respected but that violence was \u201cunacceptable.\u201dOne in five flights was canceled at the two main Paris airports, and other flights were delayed as air traffic controllers protested job cuts and changes to how their salaries are calculated. Public transportation was not disrupted.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the number of taxis blocking traffic around Paris airports. It was 2,000, not 2,000,500.Advertisement"}

His overnight guests are primarily friends of friends and business associates. He leased the space with two friends, Daniel McRorie and Kyle Mosholder, who now use part of the factory for their own projects. \u201cWe have 8,000 square feet and rent out work space to like-minded people to help with the overhead.\u201d About 25 percent of the space is leased to others.Now he\u2019s using his experience as a landlord to organize booth rentals to furniture and home accessories vendors at the Liberty Fairs men\u2019s wear trade show Jan. 26 to 28 at Pier 94 on Manhattan\u2019s West Side. \u201cI\u2019m the curator of a new section they\u2019re calling \u2018The Living Room,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Mr. Livingston, who convinced the fair\u2019s organizers to expand into home design because he believes the coolest fashion retailers are selling a \u201clifestyle \u2014 although I hate that word.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re both ways we showcase our identity,\u201d said Mr. Livingston, who has tattooed arms, thick-rimmed glasses and slicked-back, precision-cut hair. \u201cWhen you walk into my shop or home you clearly know where my interests lie.\u201d\u201cThis is my favorite photo,\u201d he continued, pointing to a faded color picture of a huddle of anonymous men in formal attire and top hats. \u201cI love that they are all wearing the same thing. I would say they are at a racetrack taking bets.\u201dAnother local haunt is Stella Dallas Living, where he bought a World War II-era white wool blanket woven with the words \u201cU.S. Navy Medical Department\u201d and the old red Pendleton blanket with a cowboy riding a bucking bronco that covers his bed. \u201cBut it\u2019s tough to find great vintage things you can afford in New York,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause everybody knows what\u2019s cool.\u201d Mr. Livingston appreciates well-made reproductions like the vintage-style iron bed and tailor\u2019s rack in the guest room and the letterpress cabinet in his living room. \u201cI got them at the Restoration Hardware Outlet sale,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty cool.

{"Headline": "Living Under the Sword of ISIS in Syria", "Date": "2016-01-14", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorRaqqa, Syria \u2014 A FEW weeks ago, my friend Saeed tried to get his family out of Raqqa, the city in eastern Syria that since 2014 has been the de facto capital of the self-declared Islamic State. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming very hard to get any kind of work in Raqqa,\u201d he told me. He was depressed that he\u2019d failed in his attempt to smuggle his family over the Turkish border to the north.I talk to Saeed almost every time he has a phone connection. He was one of the thousands who\u2019d fled the fighting around Aleppo in northwestern Syria in 2012. I met him when he was searching for a house to rent in Raqqa.Although the city was besieged by rebels from the Free Syrian Army, as well as from Islamist groups like the Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, back then it was a safe haven compared with embattled cities like Aleppo, Homs and Deir Ezzor. Raqqa was soon crowded with refugees. But in 2013, as the rebel groups closed in and the Syrian Air Force of President Bashar al-Assad started bombing the city, those who could afford to started to leave.For me, Raqqa was my hometown and leaving was out of the question. Even under bombardment, people managed to keep their businesses running. I worked two jobs.By then, most government operations were closed. Those lucky enough to work in departments that were still functioning, like electricity and health, risked their lives to pick up their salaries, traveling nearly 100 miles to a government-held part of Deir Ezzor. Others lost their livelihood.Some traders grew relatively rich, as did workers in Raqqa\u2019s primitive oil refineries. But many people turned to subsistence farming to support their families, even educated people like Abdulrahman, an engineer and family friend.Abdulrahman didn\u2019t invite the Islamic State to his town. He used to work for the Department of Finance, had his own apartment and a nice car. Now he makes a meager living growing vegetables, as his father once did.Many Raqqa residents face an additional problem: keeping their sons from being sucked into the fighting. I\u2019ve seen first hand that for Raqqa\u2019s teenagers, the Islamic State\u2019s ideology has zero appeal. What they want is its money and its guns.Not counting bonuses, a fighter starts out earning about $200 a month \u2014 more than a family needs to live (a civilian like Saeed struggles to make $150). He gets additional money for wives, children, slaves and provisions, raising his potential monthly income to more than $500. If he applies for a house, the Islamic State will hand him the keys within two months.These young men want to be listened to when they speak, and feared. These motives \u2014 \u201crespect,\u201d cash and guns \u2014 are turning ordinary young people into murderers.There were rumors last year that the Islamic State was going to start drafting Raqqans. They soon came true. Near the front line where the Islamic State is fighting the Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units, or Y.P.G., the jihadists have already conscripted one man from every family. They claim it\u2019s so they can \u201cdefend their villages.\u201dIn Raqqa, news that the Y.P.G. and its Free Syrian Army allies are preparing for an assault on the city is causing trepidation. It would be the third battle for Raqqa in two years. And the more the Islamic State is pushed out of other territories and back toward Raqqa, the more it leans on the locals here. In addition to conscription, the Islamists are confiscating houses and levying new taxes.Meanwhile, the aerial bombardment continues practically every night. When the American-led coalition airstrikes targeted the Islamic State\u2019s headquarters for the first time, in 2014, people were excited. Now it\u2019s different. Every so often, we hear that a drone strike has killed an Islamic State commander, but there\u2019s no sign that the group has been significantly weakened.The Islamic State is still here, and the bombs just bring fear and misery to civilians. Indeed, the very people being victimized by the Islamic State are also being bombed by its enemies.No one believes aerial bombing alone can bring a solution. Not Russian airstrikes, anyway. The Russians, just like the Assad forces, do not distinguish between civilians and jihadist fighters.Until the Islamic State is rooted out, the local community will remain tied to the jihadist group in one way or another, because it is the power on the ground. Raqqa is seen by many as the Islamic State\u2019s stronghold and a recruiting base. But those people living under Islamic State rule are the ones suffering the most from its brutality.Most of all, don\u2019t dismiss as terrorists the citizens of occupied cities just because they were too poor to leave when the Islamic State took over. The people under this occupation present the best hope for destroying the jihadists. Without their support, the Islamic State can hardly be defeated.Marwan Hisham is the pen name of a writer and journalist based in Raqqa, Syria.Advertisement"}

Davidson, a Success in Microscopes and Neckwear, Dies at 65", "Date": "2016-01-12", "News": "Supported byMost scientists rely on grants from the federal government and private foundations to finance their work. Michael W. Davidson turned to neckties.\u201cWhen I saw Michael\u2019s work, I started to think I couldn\u2019t get a designer more talented,\u201d Mr. Sternberg said in an interview.Stonehenge released a line of \u201cvitamin ties\u201d in September 1993. A year later, neckties with Mr. Davidson\u2019s images of moon rocks were released on the 25th anniversary of Apollo 11, the first manned lunar mission. Ties with images of cocktails, beer and wine followed. Millions of ties were sold, and a slice of the profits \u2014 millions of dollars \u2014 went to charity. Mr. Davidson\u2019s share went to his laboratory work at Florida State University in Tallahassee.He died of lung cancer at his home there, his wife, Pamela, said.Over the last decade, Mr. Davidson\u2019s research team, housed at Florida State\u2019s National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, or MagLab, helped revolutionize optical microscopy. By fusing proteins with fluorescent tags, they have enabled scientists using optical microscopes to track the biological processes inside living cells.Working as a microscopist, Mr. Davidson developed an interest in emerging technologies involving fluorescent proteins. He was particularly intrigued by the work of Roger Tsien, a biochemist at the University of California at San Diego, who was able to mutate a green fluorescent protein from a jellyfish into a rainbow of colors.\u201cMike would collect them all and do quantitative comparisons of them,\u201d said Clare Waterman, a scientist at the National Institutes of Health, who collaborated with Mr. Davidson. \u201cLike if you wanted a red one, what was the best mutant that gave you the brightest and most photo-stable red?\u201dThe website was so authoritative that the microscope manufacturers Nikon, Olympus and Zeiss licensed it, adding another revenue source for Mr. Davidson\u2019s laboratory. The companies also donated microscopes worth hundreds of thousands of dollars each.In 2005, Dr. Betzig and Harald Hess, former Bell Laboratories physicists, were interested in exploring novel microscopy techniques for biology. The director of MagLab, Gregory Boebinger, a colleague from their Bell Labs days, suggested that they talk to Mr. Davidson.Mr. Davidson told them about an advance in fluorescent proteins developed by a researcher at the National Institutes of Health. These proteins not only glowed but also could be turned on and off by shining light on them. With that nugget of information, Dr. Betzig and Dr. Hess came up with the idea for what they called photoactivated localization microscopy.Mr. Davidson helped them by producing DNA snippets that Dr. Betzig and Dr. Hess then used to show that their idea worked. \u201cHe had a very big role in sparking the whole thing and enabling us to bring it to fruition,\u201d Dr. Betzig said of Mr. Davidson.When Dr. Betzig and Dr. Hess published the cornerstone description of photoactivated localization microscopy in the journal Science in 2006, Mr. Davidson was a co-author. The work led to Dr. Betzig\u2019s sharing the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2014 for his work in fluorescent microscopy.Mr. Davidson was a co-author of more than 100 other papers. His molecular biology team at MagLab churned out the DNA snippets for the production of 3,300 fluorescent proteins.In addition to his wife, Mr. Davidson is survived by a daughter, Misty Burch; three stepsons, David, Kaleb and Jared Homan; a brother, James; and two grandchildren. Two previous marriages ended in divorce.Michael Wesley Davidson was born on Nov. 14, 1950, in Fort Lewis, Wash., outside Tacoma. His father was a soldier and his mother a nurse, and the family moved frequently before settling in El Paso.Mr. Davidson started college at Georgia Southern University, then attended Oglethorpe University in Georgia before earning a chemistry degree at Georgia State.He arrived at Florida State in the early 1980s as a graduate student. He quit to start a business chrome-plating auto parts.A few years later, Mr. Davidson returned to Florida State as a microscopy technician for a materials research laboratory. \u201cHe just came in and said, \u2018I think there are things we can do,\u2019 and he got hired,\u201d said Kirby Kemper, a retired Florida State physics professor who was then associate chairman of the physics department.To produce his work, Mr. Davidson hired an army of assistants. Some were undergraduates. Others were out of school with no credentials in the field. But the work helped propel many of them to successful jobs in academia and industry.Eric Clark had been a nurse when Mr. Davidson hired him as an assistant in 1999. Now, as an application developer, he is continuing Mr. Davidson\u2019s educational website and scientific illustration operations. (The molecular biology laboratory was disbanded.)Mr. Davidson worked seven days a week, and he expected the same of the people who worked with him. On his door was a large metal sign that said, \u201cHey you, get busy.\u201d MagLab officials told him to take it down. Mr. Davidson bolted it in place, and it is still there.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Belgium\u2019s Tax Break to Multinational Companies Is Ruled Illegal", "Date": "2016-01-11", "News": "Supported byAnheuser-Busch also uses a range of other tax benefits in Belgium, where the parent company has its headquarters, and paid a tiny fraction of 1 percent on its reported profit there of $1.93 billion in 2014. The European Commission said on Monday that the Belgian government would be required to recover the unpaid taxes from the companies involved, which the commission said it might identify at a later date. Although the financial amounts are unlikely to pose a hardship to the companies that would be forced to pay back taxes, Monday\u2019s decision would put big companies and European governments on further notice that the European Commission means to crack down on special tax arrangements with companies.Other international companies that took advantage of the Belgian tax break included the British oil giant BP and the German chemicals group BASF, according to a person with direct knowledge of the investigation who spoke only on the condition of anonymity. Others, this person said, included Atlas Copco, a Swedish tool and equipment company, and Wabco, an American maker of vehicle parts.The ruling, part of a series of investigations led by the European Union\u2019s competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, found that Belgium had given unfair tax advantages to certain companies \u2014 advantages that were not available to other companies doing business in Belgium.Ms. Vestager\u2019s effort is part of the commission\u2019s response to the economic problems in Europe that have left many governments struggling to balance their budgets \u2014 leaning on small taxpayers impatient with what they perceive as loopholes given to big businesses. Other governments in the 28-nation European Union have accused smaller players like Belgium of dangling tax deals to attract big multinational companies in ways they say end up driving down tax revenue throughout the bloc.And in some cases, United States tax officials and lawmakers have criticized some European countries\u2019 tax arrangements as enabling multinationals to illegally shield profit on which the companies should be paying American taxes.The ruling on Monday leaves Belgium in an awkward position.Johan Van Overtveldt, the Belgian finance minister, said he would take careful account of the decision even as he told investors that he would defend their interests. He also cited \u201cthe possibility of an appeal against the decision.\u201d\u201cWhile we are disappointed by this decision, we remain confident that our tax rulings are in full compliance with the E.U. jurisprudence on state aid and that we have always complied with Belgian and international tax provisions,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe will consider our options, taking into account the reactions by the Belgian authorities.\u201dThe commission opened a formal investigation into the Belgian arrangements in February 2014. At issue is a so-called excess profits tax break given to multinational companies that move businesses to Belgium. The idea, according to the Belgian authorities, is to ensure that companies do not end up paying taxes on the same profits more than once.Belgium set up the system about a decade ago, partly to persuade companies to relocate a substantial part of their activities there or to make significant investments in the country. The deductions were based on reducing the amount of taxable profits of the companies involved, usually by 50 to 90 percent. The tax break was marketed by the Belgian tax authority under the logo \u201cOnly in Belgium,\u201d according to the European Commission.\u201cThe scheme does not even require companies to demonstrate any evidence or even risk of double taxation,\u201d the commission said in a statement on Monday. \u201cInstead of preventing double taxation, in reality the scheme gives a \u2018carte blanche\u2019 to double nontaxation.\u201dMs. Vestager said at a news conference on Monday, \u201cI must say, when I see the material used to promote the scheme, that it is understandable that a company would like to use the scheme.\u201dShe urged Belgium to change its tax treatment so that multinationals are taxed like \u201cthe rest of companies being taxed in Belgium.\u201dMr. Van Overtveldt said the government had already suspended the system by granting no more excess-profit tax breaks since February last year. If the company does not appeal the ruling, he said the next stage would be a period of \u201cfurther negotiations with Europe regarding the possible reimbursements.\u201dIf such payments are necessary, \u201cthe consequences for the companies concerned would be considerable and the reimbursement itself would be particularly complex,\u201d Mr. Van Overtveldt said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Andr\u00e9 Courr\u00e8ges, Fashion Designer Who Redefined Couture, Dies at 92", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "Supported byAndr\u00e9 Courr\u00e8ges, the French designer who brought the space age to the catwalk and into the closets of women like Catherine Deneuve and Jacqueline Kennedy, died on Thursday at his home in Neuilly-sur-Seine outside Paris. He was 92.Courr\u00e8ges, the fashion house he founded, confirmed the death.\u201cIf the words \u2018modern\u2019 and \u2018future\u2019 exist in fashion, it is because of Courr\u00e8ges,\u201d said Carla Sozzani, the proprietor of the influential Milanese boutique 10 Corso Como. \u201cIt changed the concept of couture, marking the turn of fashion into a new era.\u201dAndr\u00e9 Courr\u00e8ges made his name in the early 1960s, at the dawn of the space age, and it quickly became synonymous with a certain style and attitude that gained momentum during that decade. As old norms were rejected, elaborate draping and decoration were left behind in favor of a celebration of freedom in the form of flat go-go boots, truncated A-line dresses, a palette of astronaut-friendly white and silver with an occasional shot of lime and tangerine, and, above all, a miniskirt.Mr. Courr\u00e8ges was interested in knees. He believed in trousers for women \u2014 the neater and more body-conscious the better \u2014 and worshiped the modernist architect and designer Le Corbusier. Mr. Courr\u00e8ges thought the designer, not the client, knew best, and proudly refused to negotiate changes in his styles with the Duchess of Windsor. He liked to compare his atelier to a laboratory.He disliked bras, corsets, high heels and anything that restricted movement. He once said, \u201cA woman is never more beautiful than when she is naked,\u201d which could be taken as an odd statement for a designer to make, except for the fact that nothing in Mr. Courr\u00e8ges\u2019s story was really what one might have expected.Andr\u00e9 Courr\u00e8ges was born on March 9, 1923, in the city of Pau, in the French Pyrenees. His father was a butler, who disapproved of Andr\u00e9\u2019s desire to go to art school and wanted him to be an engineer. Andr\u00e9 obliged, attending the \u00c9cole Nationale des Ponts-et-Chauss\u00e9es (now known as \u00c9cole des ponts ParisTech).He became a pilot in the French Air Force in World War II, and after the war decided to change professions: At 28, he joined the house of Balenciaga in an entry-level role. He stayed 10 years, ultimately becoming first assistant to Balenciaga before going out on his own in 1961.Mr. Courr\u00e8ges\u2019s breakthrough came in 1964 with his \u201cSpace Age\u201d collection. Patricia Peterson, writing in The New York Times, called him \u201cthe brightest blaze of the year.\u201d The little white dress replaced the little black dress as the frock of choice.Three years later he married his assistant, Coqueline Barri\u00e8re, whom he had met at Balenciaga and who would remain his partner, both personally and professionally, for the rest of his life; they had one child, Marie. Both his wife and daughter survive him.Interested in dressing working women as well as socialites, Mr. Courr\u00e8ges established a factory in Pau and, in 1968, sold part of his brand to L\u2019Or\u00e9al, the beauty products company, to help finance the expansion of his own business.By 1972 there were 125 Courr\u00e8ges boutiques worldwide, and Courr\u00e8ges had introduced its first fragrance. Mr. Courr\u00e8ges was chosen to create the staff uniforms for the Munich Olympics. The next year, his company began designing men\u2019s wear.Though fashion moved on from his futuristic vision, Mr. Courr\u00e8ges never abandoned his core aesthetic. The brand changed hands a few times before he and his wife regained control in 1994; when he retired the next year, she became artistic director. In 2002, she began developing a line of electric concept cars that resemble nothing so much as the curvaceous white helmets that were her husband\u2019s signature accessories.The couple sold their brand in 2011 to two former Young & Rubicam advertising executives, Jacques Bungert and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Torloting. Last September, after a long hiatus, Courr\u00e8ges reappeared on the Paris Fashion Week Runway schedule under new creative directors, S\u00e9bastien Meyer and Arnaud Vaillant.\u201cA Courr\u00e8ges pantsuit in yellow with white plastic belt was my first Parisian outfit,\u201d Ms. Sozzani said. \u201cToday, 50 years later, the Courr\u00e8ges shop is still my must destination in Paris.\u201dAn obituary on Saturday about the fashion designer Andr\u00e9 Courr\u00e8ges misstated, in some editions, part of the name of the company where Jacques Bungert and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Torloting had been advertising executives before they bought the Courr\u00e8ges brand in 2011. It is Young & Rubicam, not Young & Rubicon.Advertisement"}

After the offer fell through, regulations required New World Development to wait 12 months before making another bid for the unit.The new offer for all the shares that the parent company does not already own will not have to pass the head-count test because it is not using the accelerated process.

All told, the group has raised almost $51 million in the 2016 election cycle.In addition to the money raised, donors have committed to providing at least $42 million in additional contributions, officials said.

{"Headline": "A Struggle to Quell Investor Fears Over Unsettled Emerging Markets", "Date": "2016-01-24", "News": "Supported byCurrency turmoil in China and fears of a global slowdown have led investors to abandon emerging markets in droves, rattling the large asset management firms that have long promoted such investments in their hunt for higher returns.For more than a decade, star managers at Franklin Templeton, Pimco, Aberdeen and Oppenheimer seemed more like Marco Polos than Warren Buffetts, beating a path to Internet companies in China, oil giants in Brazil and gold mines in South Africa.Investing in these high-risk markets came to be seen as a necessity for a diversified portfolio as well as an opportunity for these firms to levy some of the highest fees in the industry.Now, with investors fleeing in a fury, asset management firms are struggling to stanch the bleeding.Last year, a record $105 billion was pulled out of global mutual funds, with 26 percent of that figure coming from asset managers based in the United States, according to the fund tracker EPFR.It was the third consecutive year of bond and equity outflows and one would have go back to the Asian crisis era of the late 1990s to see a similar retreat, said Cameron Brandt, the head of research at the data provider.\u201cThis has become a chronic condition as opposed to the sudden onset of something,\u201d Mr. Brandt said. \u201cThere is almost no conviction out there right now.\u201dFor large fund companies whose assets under management ballooned on the back of these flows, the world has changed drastically, largely for the worse.Take the global bond manager Pimco. It has three bond funds that invest in developing markets that the research firm Morningstar tracks: a local currency sovereign bond fund worth $4.7 billion; a broader vehicle valued at $1.7 billion, and a corporate bond fund whose assets have eroded to $202 million from more than $1 billion.In total, investors pulled $6 billion last year from emerging market funds managed by Pimco, according to Morningstar.Pimco has had to steady itself after the explosive departure of a star manager, William H. Gross, in 2014. Yet the emerging market outflows, on top of the billions of dollars that followed Mr. Gross out the door, have only added to the firm\u2019s woes.Pimco, once the world\u2019s largest manager of emerging market bonds, has experienced industry- lagging returns from outsize bets in Brazil and Russia that have propelled an investor exodus that is getting worse by the month.Last December, investors pulled $619 million from the firm\u2019s local currency fund, which has lost 21 percent of its value over the past year, trailing every fund in the category except one, according to Morningstar.A $15 billion fund in 2013, it now languishes below $5 billion.While Pimco may be struggling, it is certainly not alone. A debt fund run by MFS investment management in Boston lost $1.4 billion last year, and Trust Company of the West in Los Angeles had outflows of $1.8 billion from its $2.6 billion bond offering last year.On the equity side, the $28 billion Oppenheimer Developing Markets fund suffered by far the largest exodus last year, with $5 billion departing the fund, according to Morningstar.And in Europe, Aberdeen Asset Management, which manages $403 billion and specializes in emerging markets, had $48 billion leave the firm. Aberdeen\u2019s stock price fell by half for the year.Traders and portfolio managers say that what worries them now is the sense that sophisticated institutional investors, who generally tend to take a longer-term view than their retail counterparts (and who might even be inclined to buy at these levels), have been the ones driving the selling over the last six months.Instead of taking advantage of bond and company valuations that are at historic lows, these investors are acting more like lemmings, unloading the good and the bad in their portfolios because that is what they see their peers doing. The panicky climate is also forcing managers to have a chunk of cash on hand to meet redemption requests.\u201cWe are seeing evidence that institutional investors are capitulating,\u201d said Charles Collyns, an economist at the Institute of International Finance, using an industry term to describe the practice of wholesale selling when all hope is lost.In a recent survey of more than 100 investment managers conducted by Northern Trust in Chicago, the No. 1 risk factor cited by respondents was that problems in China would continue to bring down growth rates in the developing world.Also of concern, regulators and economists say, is the fact that many emerging market securities, especially bonds, can be very hard to sell, especially when markets are declining.The surprise decision by Third Avenue Management last month to close down a junk bond fund because it could not meet investor demands for cash has heightened fears that an emerging market bond fund could find itself in a similar position.\u201cThere is definitely a liquidity concern out there,\u201d said Mr. Brandt, the research director at EPFR. \u201cPeople are asking: \u2018If I don\u2019t get my stuff out now, will I be able to get it out later?\u2019 \u201dThings would need to get much worse for that to happen. The bonds that trade in countries like Turkey, Mexico and Brazil are far more liquid than the deeply distressed corporate securities that Third Avenue\u2019s credit fund favored.That has not stopped the selling though \u2014 especially in recent months. For example, of the $2.5 billion that left Pimco\u2019s local currency fund last year, $1 billion came in the last two months of 2015, according to Morningstar.The emerging markets unit at Pimco is headed by Michael A. Gomez, a former debt trader at Goldman Sachs who has been at the firm overseeing these funds since 2003.The dismal performance of Pimco\u2019s emerging market funds has done little to lift morale at the firm since the departure of Mr. Gross. And while Mr. Gomez\u2019s difficult run \u2014 over the last three years his local currency fund trails 89 percent of its peers \u2014 and the sustained pace of outflows has put him under some pressure, his superiors continue to stand by him.\"Michael Gomez is the leader of the emerging market team and has our full trust and support,\" said Daniel J. Ivascyn, Pimco\u2019s chief investment officer.Last year, in an effort to better gauge employees\u2019 mood, the leadership of Pimco organized a companywide survey, according to people who were briefed on the initiative. It was the first time the company ever did such a thing, and while the 8,000 responses did vary, there were those who took the opportunity to vent \u2014 using strong language to complain about the company\u2019s culture.At an employee meeting last month at company headquarters in Newport Beach, Calif., Pimco\u2019s president, Jay Jacobs, discussed the survey results. And he said that if there were no improvements he would, at some point in the future, step down.Also addressing the staff at the meeting was Mr. Ivascyn, who acknowledged the performance problems in emerging markets and said that the firm would continue to hire more experts to help matters, with Mr. Gomez leading the recruiting effort.As is often the case in emerging markets, the most opportune time to buy is when everyone else is selling. In that regard, the rally in oil and emerging market currencies last week could well be a sign that the pessimism of late has been overdone.Mark Meisel, who conducted the survey at Northern Trust, said that while it is true that global investors fear emerging markets more than anything else, they also said that the stocks and bonds in these countries were among the most undervalued investments to be found anywhere.An article on Monday about investors\u2019 withdrawing money from emerging-market funds misidentified the MFS investment management fund that had investor outflows of $1.4 billion last year. It is the Emerging Markets Debt fund, not a local currency fund.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Two Ways of Dealing With Guns", "Date": "2016-01-01", "News": "Supported byEditorialThis is a big day for Texans yearning to flaunt their handguns in belt and shoulder holsters. A new \u201copen carry\u201d law enacted by the Republican Legislature goes into effect on Friday, posing a challenge for law enforcement, businesses and other institutions that are understandably wary of how social interchange will be affected.The contrasting developments in Texas and Seattle demonstrate politicians\u2019 tug of war over gun rights and civilian safety, which the gun lobby has been manipulating by pushing through state laws that block local governments from enacting needed ordinances. The resulting crazy quilt of clashing interests demonstrates the need for federal laws, which, of course, have been rejected by a Congress captive to the gun industry\u2019s agenda.The effect of the industry\u2019s power on local streets has the Houston police chief, Charles McClelland, worrying about how his officers will deal with openly armed citizens amid rising fears over mass shootings and terrorism. \u201cHow are they supposed to know who the good guy or the bad guy is with the gun?\u201d he asks.The Texas law still bans handguns in courthouses, schools, sports arenas and businesses that get more than half their profits from on-site alcohol consumption. But a whole new world of possibilities has been opened, prompting major grocery and restaurant chains and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Dallas to exercise the law\u2019s provision to opt out, which requires a prominent sign prohibiting open carry on their premises. The First Baptist Church of Arlington, on the other hand, decided it was safe to allow its 2,500 worshipers to show up armed.Texas had banned public packing of handguns after the Civil War. That was before the modern gun lobby worked to reverse gun safety laws to the point where variations of open carry now exist in 45 \u2014 that\u2019s right, 45 \u2014 states. More and more, the open-carry movement is being used to make confrontational and intimidating protest statements.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Colleague Drank My Breast Milk and Other Wall Street Tales", "Date": "2016-01-23", "News": "Supported byOpinionI STILL think about a female job applicant I interviewed more than a decade ago, when I was a managing director at Bear Stearns and she was fresh from the Wharton School of Business.\u201cSo how do the women who work here find this environment? Tell me the truth,\u201d she said.Her question rocked me for a moment. She was a hair\u2019s distance from landing a six-figure job. We sat overlooking a giant trading floor, a sea of men punching keyboards or barreling across a room bathed in testosterone. Here and there, you could see a woman in a tailored suit. Clearly, I didn\u2019t work in some sharing-and-caring girlfriend club where women confided in one another. We didn\u2019t gossip, we didn\u2019t mentor, and sometimes we even saw one another as the competition.\u201cWhat exactly do you mean?\u201d I replied.She noted correctly that few of the female traders and analysts at the firm were mothers and that even fewer had made it to the executive level.I needed a moment to answer her carefully. I was then 11 years into my career, and seven months pregnant with my second child, and I hoped her journey would be different and better than mine.Of course she would have to avoid stereotypical female behavior, and so she could never cry. She would work long hours and hide her pregnancies and her preschooler\u2019s art. One of my co-workers even hid being married. When confronted, she practically swore never to reproduce, and she never did.I did not mention my first maternity leave, from which I returned to find a curly-haired stranger sitting at my desk, his feet propped on a cardboard box with my client account list packed inside. I had to re-earn the contents of that box, starting that morning. I also didn\u2019t mention the \u201cmoo\u201d sounds that traders made when I headed to the nurse\u2019s office with a breast pump, or the colleague who on a dare drank a shot of the breast milk I had stored in the office fridge. I thought of the guy known for dropping Band-Aids on women\u2019s desks when the trading floor was cold because he didn\u2019t \u201cwant to be distracted,\u201d and the many times I had heard a women share an idea at a meeting, only to see later that same idea credited to a man.But I didn\u2019t bring up any of that. Women like me were \u201cteam players,\u201d and I was often complimented on my thick skin. Like members of a dysfunctional family, we kept our secrets to ourselves.Instead, I kept the conversation light. I shared a funny story about my first day on Wall Street, when I opened up a pizza box to find condoms instead of pepperoni slices. Unwrapped. I was \u201cthe new girl,\u201d and the guys just wanted to see me blush. I did blush, and I lived.\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad anymore,\u201d I said with a laugh.She was horrified. \u201cHow could you stand that?\u201d\u201cStand what?\u201d I thought to myself. I remembered one guy telling me that we should hire only \u201cwomen who have brothers.\u201d I asked if she had any brothers. The pizza incident was nothing compared with everything else she was about to experience. I truly thought we were offering her the job of a lifetime if only she could let the bad stuff slide.At that time, women on Wall Street were earning 55 to 62 cents to every dollar a man in the same position earned. Afterward, Bear Stearns imploded in the mortgage market, and while I stayed close to the markets and the people who worked for them, I left. Children gave me perspective about the price of money. The women labeled stellar successes were giving up more than I was willing to part with. With the benefit of some perspective, I began to think more deeply about what I and my female colleagues had experienced.In fact, roughly two of every three cases are decided in Wall Street\u2019s favor. In addition, half of the arbitration costs are borne by the complainant and what would be a few hundred dollar filing fee in court can quickly escalate to as much as $150,000 out of pocket. It\u2019s a lot to lose should things not go your way. No wonder this practice is an effective gag for many would-be whistle-blowers.Many bankers will tell you that a lot of these complaints about harassment and discrimination are false. Indeed, while researching a novel about a woman working on Wall Street, I was told by people in banks\u2019 human resources departments that men are now often afraid of hiring women because of the potential litigation. They fear that even innocently intended comments can result in expensive complaints; that if a woman isn\u2019t working out, and doesn\u2019t get promoted, the male employer has a legal problem on his hands. More than once I was told that it\u2019s just easier to fire a guy or \u2014 my favorite line \u2014 that \u201cthere\u2019s just less drama with men.\u201dJonathan Sack, a lawyer adept at representing both sides of these disputes, told me, \u201cMen are being told they need to raise the ranks of women and minorities in their departments, but should someone not work out, especially at the more senior levels, employers worry they\u2019ll have a legal issue to contend with.\u201d Mr. Sack\u2019s firm handled 80 such cases last year alone. I asked what he estimates the number of disputes against investment banks to be last year. \u201cEasily 5,000,\u201d he responded. Something is very broken.Fake complaints likely do pollute and confuse the real ones. But this is one reason even the banks should embrace a change. If these complaints were aired in public, instead of behind closed doors, maybe banks would be less quick to settle, discouraging the opportunistic from lodging an unsubstantiated complaint. More important, lawsuits would shine a light onto the hidden stories, the family secrets that prevent banks from moving forward.We need to ban mandatory arbitration, and let employees decide if they want to hash their differences out in a conference room or demand their constitutional right to a day in court.Banks won\u2019t like it at first, but an end to this practice \u2014 through legislation or the courts, if necessary \u2014 would be a more effective cure for discrimination than their current habit of writing checks too meager to hurt them and too useless to root out the problem.My candidate took the job, and while she was passionate about her work, she was uncomfortable with the raucous trading floor environment, and lasted only five years. While none of us were able to see the details of her sealed complaint, I can easily imagine what it might contain. Many women have shared their stories with me, and they go far beyond exclusion from meetings and golf courses. There was the young banker who was groped publicly to settle a bet about whether her breasts were real, and the senior deal makers who found out their pay was a fraction of their male counterparts\u2019.Whatever her experience, her case went to arbitration. She signed a nondisclosure agreement and took a settlement check. Another case closed. Another brilliant woman\u2019s career on Wall Street ended.Maureen Sherry, a former\u00a0managing director at Bear Stearns, is the author of the forthcoming novel \u201cOpening Belle.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Animals, Auctions and Death: Outside Albany, Some Lawmakers Serve Different Interests", "Date": "2016-01-05", "News": "Supported byOnce upon a time in Albany, or so the Capitol\u2019s origin story goes, the men who governed New York State from the Legislature\u2019s vaulted chambers were farmers: citizen-legislators who laid down their plows for a few months every year to represent their fellows before returning home to make their living from the land.It is difficult, then, to know what to make of those legislators who, if not precisely the salt of the earth, hold jobs that do not seem ripe for payola, either. The Finger Lakes undertaker, for instance. The owner of a dry-cleaning business outside Buffalo. The assemblyman who for his 25 years in the Legislature has moonlighted as a one-man auction house in Cazenovia, N.Y., selling antique silverware, chickens and farm machinery.\u201cI\u2019m living the dream right now,\u201d Assemblyman Stephen M. Katz said on a recent morning, before striding into an examination room at his veterinary hospital in the Bronx to tend to a Shih Tzu with a corneal ulcer. \u201cAnd then I come back to the nightmare of Albany.\u201dAmong reformers, who say serving two masters can breed conflicts of interest that are rarely resolved in the public\u2019s favor, there may not be two words more foul than \u201coutside income.\u201dYet the hue and cry over ethics reform has also uncovered a little-known, little-heeded point of view: that of the businessman-legislator, who sees no conflict between activities like undertaking and lawmaking, and whose contempt for Albany makes a full-time Legislature seem not only ludicrous, but also outrageous.\u201cYou can\u2019t tell someone to give up your lifelong business to be a two-year legislator,\u201d said Assemblyman David DiPietro, a Republican from the Buffalo area who has run his family\u2019s dry-cleaning business, Sparkle One Hour Cleaners, since 1990, and who has recently begun organizing for the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump. \u201cThat\u2019s against the law, against the Constitution.\u201dMr. DiPietro, who earned $20,000 to $50,000 from dry-cleaning in 2014, said his experience as a small-business owner informed his work on the Assembly\u2019s small-business committee and his support for business-friendly legislation. \u201cAnd to go after us is counterproductive, because we all know where the fix is,\u201d he said.\u201cThis is the most disgusting ...\u201d Dr. Katz said, appearing to swell with fury as he began to describe his legislative colleagues. \u201cThey don\u2019t do two months\u2019 worth of work, and they have the gall to ask for a full year and a raise.\u201d Dr. Katz was equally uncomplimentary about their ethical standards (\u201cchickens, cowards and pieces of garbage\u201d).A few hours at his veterinary practice, which he took up after helping to rescue a zookeeper from a large python in 1972, seemed to prove therapeutic.A small brown poodle puppy received a vaccine (\u201cThis is one of my happy cases\u201d). A cat named Ollie had a colony of ear mites evicted (\u201cWhat a good kitty you are; I don\u2019t care what they say\u201d). Advice was offered on topics from declawing cats (he once spoke out against an Assembly bill that would have outlawed declawing) to canine pregnancy (\u201cBoy, are you in for a surprise in a few months!\u201d he told one dog).Diarrhea, a not-uncommon complaint, afflicted a doleful bulldog named Lola. Dr. Katz recommended a fecal exam.The assemblyman\u2019s disgust with his fellow lawmakers does not prevent his dual occupations from occasionally merging. Two pit bulls owned by Carl E. Heastie, the new Assembly speaker, have been patients for five years, Dr. Katz said; other members often come to him for second opinions on their pets\u2019 ailments.He said he plans to quit the Legislature after his current term ends to focus on his businesses.For Assemblyman William Magee, a Democrat of Nelson, in Madison County, the auction business he started in 1960 to sell livestock, antiques, machinery and real estate, Magee\u2019s Auction Service, has fallen off since he joined the Legislature, \u201cjust \u2019cause, you know, my other job,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s my priority.\u201dIt earned him $5,000 to $20,000 in 2014, according to his financial disclosure form, as did another business dealing in real estate, the Farm & Land Agency.\u201cA lot of my colleagues don\u2019t want to talk in front of me, because they think I\u2019m going to repeat things on the radio,\u201d he said, adding that he had never done so.The trouble can run both ways.Mr. Nojay has attended events as a pundit where \u201cpeople will say things like, \u2018Throw the bums out!\u2019 and I\u2019ll be standing there thinking, \u2018I\u2019m one of the bums!\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cSo that becomes a little bit awkward, sometimes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Security Council Condemns Nuclear Test by North Korea", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byUNITED NATIONS \u2014 The United Nations Security Council condemned North Korea for its nuclear test on Wednesday, but there was no evidence yet that the North\u2019s most powerful backer, China, was willing to stiffen sanctions in a way that could push the unpredictable country to the point of collapse or slow its nuclear progress.A two-hour closed session of the Security Council on Wednesday afternoon ended with a pledge to \u201cbegin to work immediately\u201d on a resolution containing additional measures to rein in Pyongyang. It did not specify what those measures could be, and in the past, China and Russia have usually objected to steps that could threaten the North\u2019s survival. The most obvious would be a prohibition on loading or unloading North Korean ships around the world, or on financial transactions with the nation.The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, did not indicate the basis for the administration\u2019s skepticism of Pyongyang\u2019s claim. But more than a month ago, when Kim Jong-un, the country\u2019s young leader, boasted that he possessed the technology for a hydrogen bomb, American officials said they had a variety of evidence \u2014 some technical, some from human sources \u2014 to call that claim into question.A hydrogen bomb would be far more powerful, and more fearsome, than the type of nuclear weapon the North has tested three times since 2006, when it conducted its first test during George W. Bush\u2019s administration.A South Korean Defense Ministry official, who requested anonymity to speak about a national security matter, said Thursday that the ministry believed that even if the device was a boosted fission bomb, the test was probably a failure. The explosive yield was even smaller than that from the North\u2019s last and third nuclear test, in early 2013, he said. \u201cEven a boosted fission bomb produces a yield bigger than this, so we don\u2019t think this is a successful test of a boosted fission bomb either,\u201d he added. But the true nature of the test may not be revealed until results are back from atmospheric testing, usually conducted by Air Force planes that run along the North Korean coast \u201csniffing\u201d for byproducts of an explosion. Yet after the test in 2013, such inquiries were inconclusive. \u201cWe may never know,\u201d said one intelligence official involved in the testing. \u201cThe technology is pretty hit-and-miss.\u201dGary Samore, Mr. Obama\u2019s top nuclear adviser in the president\u2019s first term, said Wednesday that the timing of the test was strange, with North and South Korea discussing restoring some economic ties and the North trying to reach out to the Chinese. North Korea claimed on Wednesday that it had tested a hydrogen bomb, the most powerful kind of nuclear weapon.President Obama said nothing in public about the test, in contrast to Mr. Bush, who responded to the first North Korean test in 2006 by declaring that the North would be held responsible if its bomb technology were found anywhere else in the world. Advisers said Mr. Obama was calculating that Mr. Kim was looking to get a rise out of him. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to give him the satisfaction,\u201d one aide said.On Wednesday evening, the White House said that Mr. Obama had spoken by telephone with President Park Geun-hye of South Korea and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, reassuring both of America\u2019s support. \u201cI know this sounds like a crazy reason to set off a nuclear test,\u201d one American intelligence official said. \u201cBut stranger things have provoked North Korean action.\u201dBut it is far from clear that all the major players with a stake in what the North does are willing to take the kind of risks, and impose the kind of sanctions, that might prompt Pyongyang to back down or, alternatively, to lash out.Kelsey Davenport, director for nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association in Washington, argued that stiffening existing sanctions, while sending a political message, would be insufficient. \u201cRatcheting up sanctions pressure demonstrates that there is a cost to violating Security Council resolutions,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cHowever, sanctions alone are not going to change Pyongyang\u2019s behavior. North Korea has complex illicit trafficking networks for evading sanctions, and not all countries in the region are adequately enforcing existing measures.\u201d The one time the United States did clearly get the North\u2019s attention was when it cut off bank accounts in Macau that Kim Jong-il, the father of the current leader, used to finance the lifestyle of the North Korean elite. But eventually, the Bush administration had to lift that sanction, partly under pressure from allies. On Wednesday, American allies engaged in a now-familiar set of rituals. Ms. Park convened an urgent meeting of her top national security aides in Seoul. Japan\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, Motohide Yoshikawa, told reporters after the Security Council meeting that his government expected the Council to adopt a robust resolution to check North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons ambitions. The American ambassador, Samantha Power, called for a \u201ctough, comprehensive and credible package of new sanctions.\u201d But the Russian ambassador, Vitaly I. Churkin, would say only that a \u201cproportionate response\u201d was necessary. For Mr. Kim, there was some domestic politics in all this. His Workers\u2019 Party is scheduled to hold its first full-fledged congress since 1980 this May. With no big improvements in the lives of his people, he needs something else to show for his four-year rule.\u201cThe biggest achievement Kim Jong-un can offer ahead of the party congress is his nuclear program,\u201d said Choi Kang, vice president of the Asan Institute for Policy Studies. \u201cIt also means that things don\u2019t look good in the economic sector.\u201dSomini Sengupta reported from the United Nations, David E.

{"Headline": "Scientists, Give Up Your Emails", "Date": "2016-01-09", "News": "Supported byOpinionIN recent months, the Obama administration has been locked in a battle with Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, the Republican chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, who disputes the scientific consensus on climate change.After the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration published a study last summer showing that climate change has continued unabated and perhaps accelerated over the last 15 years, Mr. Smith subpoenaed the emails of the agency\u2019s scientists, citing whistle-blowers who say that the study had been rushed to publication.NOAA has denied this request, and some within the scientific community have called Mr. Smith\u2019s demands a witch hunt. But allowing agencies to keep secret the communications of scientists who work for the government sets a dangerous precedent. Some of what we know about abusive practices in science \u2014 whether it concerns tobacco, pharmaceuticals, chemicals or even climate change \u2014 has come from reading scientists\u2019 emails.Around 2007, for instance, the Senate Finance Committee sought emails and documents from several companies and agencies and about a dozen academic research centers as part of a wide-ranging investigation of possible corruption in medical research.And if you think of all scientists at universities as pure at heart, think again.But don\u2019t try to explain this to many scientists. The scientific community loves to toss around the term \u201ctransparency,\u201d but it mostly remains a buzzword.Our article promptly came under attack by several scientists and by the Union of Concerned Scientists. PLOS then removed our article from its site, though left the comments about it online. Never mind that the article had been peer-reviewed and promoted on social media by PLOS. In removing the article, PLOS explained that it \u201cwas not consistent with at least the spirit and intent of our community guidelines.\u201dAs interest groups on both the left and right increasingly try to politicize the scientific process, there\u2019s little question that there will be misuse of the Freedom of Information laws that some journalists and watchdog organizations have used to uncover wrongdoing.Scientists have been harassed in the past and no doubt will continue to be harassed in the future, just like other public servants. You can argue that Mr. Smith\u2019s broadsides against NOAA are a case in point. In turn, scientists are free to fight these information requests or seek to narrow the scope of the inquiries to protect against what they believe threatens the integrity of the scientific process or chills research.But the harassment argument should not be used as an excuse to bar access to scientific research that the public is paying for and has a legitimate interest in seeing.Whenever scientists argue against transparency, they inevitably tie themselves up in contradictions.NOAA, too, has found itself on both sides of the transparency debate.This information helped persuade congressional leaders to start investigations into the Bush administration\u2019s distortion of federal research.Scientists who profess agreement with transparency only when it is on their terms are really not for transparency at all. The public should be alarmed.Paul D. Thacker is a journalist and former investigator for the United States Senate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Mystic, the Monk and the Play Brought to You by Powerball", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byIt sounds like the setup for some kind of droll joke: A lottery winner and a rhinoceros arrive at the birthday party for a dead mystic. Art, and a blowout brawl, ensues.The back story of \u201cThe Glory of the World,\u201d in some ways, includes Mr. Mee\u2019s childhood, in a Catholic home where the living room shelves were lined with dozens of books by Merton. It also involves Mr. Cockrum\u2019s time as a monk, when, while living under a vow of poverty, he decided that if he were ever to have money, he would use it to fund theater.But, most of all, it starts with a walk.Mr. Waters set about reading, or trying to read, 10 of the roughly 70 books Merton wrote, and in 2014, he called Mr. Mee, a New York-based playwright and author who had often worked at the Actors Theater. The next year, 2015, would be the centennial of Merton\u2019s birth; would Mr. Mee be interested in a commission to write about the mystic for the theater\u2019s 39th Humana Festival of New American Plays?Mr. Mee was enthusiastic. He had been raised in a family with several priests and nuns and a fondness for Merton\u2019s work. \u201cI think I know Merton pretty well,\u201d he said. But he also issued a warning, telling Mr. Waters, \u201cI\u2019d love to do that, except, you know I\u2019m an ex-Catholic, so whatever I do might get you thrown out of Louisville.\u201dMr. Waters was unfazed, and the work began.The writer and director have been collaborating for years, most notably on \u201cBig Love,\u201d which also started in Louisville and moved to BAM, and they quickly agreed on a few basic elements for \u201cThe Glory of the World.\u201dThe play would be set at a 100th birthday party for Merton, at which the celebrants would quarrel over how to describe a multifaceted man who was a Trappist monk, a prolific writer, a champion of nonviolence and a friend to Eastern religions before dying at 53 of an accidental electrocution in Thailand.All of the actors would be men, reflecting the community in which Merton lived. And the play would begin, and end, in silence.\u201cThe Glory of the World,\u201d which requires an unusually large cast of 17, is neither a biography of nor a tribute to Merton but rather an exploration of how to think about a complicated historical figure, and, in the process, how to think about ourselves. Over the course of the play, the characters offer different takes, often in the form of toasts to Merton \u2014 celebrating him as a pacifist, a Communist, a meditator, a bohemian and so on.\u201cPeople who want Merton to be like a box full of kittens may not find this to their liking,\u201d said Mr. Waters, who described the production as \u201ca party.\u201d Mr. Mee said the play \u201ctakes Merton as one of the fantastic examples of how really rich a human being can be\u201d and the production is \u201cthis fantastic physical spectacle.\u201dThe rhinoceros appears because Merton once wrote an essay called \u201cRain and the Rhinoceros.\u201d The brawl is unusually long (14 minutes) and vivid. And the silence can be, intentionally, unsettling; at the start of the play, an actor (often Mr. Waters) walks onstage and sits, with his back to the audience. The length of the silence is \u201ceither interminable, or shockingly short,\u201d Mr. Waters said, depending on your tolerance.\u201cIt makes some people in an audience uncomfortable, because it denies something that you think is going to happen in a theater piece \u2014 something is being withdrawn, and it throws you off balance,\u201d he added. \u201cSometimes the tension is very palpable. There was one night in Louisville when I heard very distinctly a woman\u2019s voice, \u2018Is this all it\u2019s going to be?\u2019\u201dAmong the enthusiasts was Mr. Cockrum, who has been traveling the country visiting regional theaters as he looks for projects to support. The play was the seventh production he saw in three days at the Humana Festival.\u201cI was just smitten,\u201d he said. \u201cI fell in love. It drew me in. I leaned to the person next to me, as the house lights came up, and said, \u2018If ever I\u2019m going to be a commercial producer, this is going to be it.\u2019\u201dHe was particularly struck by the audience response.\u201cThere was this buzz \u2014 people were talking about the play,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople were really engaged with each other about what the play had done for them, or to them, or with them.\u201dMr. Cockrum said Merton had been \u201cvery influential in my own spiritual journey\u201d and that \u201cI didn\u2019t read all 70 of his books, I don\u2019t think, but I might have, or pieces of all of them.\u201d When Mr. Cockrum was a monk, living at the Society of Saint John the Evangelist\u2019s monastery in Cambridge, Mass., he kept a prayer by Merton framed on a dresser in his cell.\u201cI promised myself then that if ever I had a pile of dough for some reason, that\u2019s what I would try to make happen,\u201d he said.As for the play\u2019s future, he said, \u201cI\u2019m focused strictly on this production \u2014 I want to make this the best it can be.\u201dFor Mr. Cockrum, the play was an obvious choice.\u201cIt has a monastic resonance for me that I recognized \u2014 the conversations that these men had between each other onstage were not unlike the conversations that happen in a cloistered environment,\u201d he said. \u201cThat kind of examination, that kind of deep, philosophical, what is sacred, what isn\u2019t sacred, goes on all the time in religious communities.\u201dBut, he added, \u201cI\u2019m not doing this because it\u2019s religious; I\u2019m doing it because it\u2019s a great play that spoke to me.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tumult in World Markets Damps Conviction at Davos", "Date": "2016-01-25", "News": "Supported byDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 The World Economic Forum has long been a citadel for corporate chieftains and government officials to bask in their collective stature, coming together to chat about what they can do as leaders about the world\u2019s troubles.Yet this year\u2019s gathering in the Swiss Alps, which ended Saturday, was marked by a bit more anxiety than usual.And just 27 percent of those C.E.O.s said they believed the overall global economy would grow this year, compared to 37 percent last year.Why the grim outlook? Any number of reasons hung in the crisp mountain air.Global events beyond the control of the World Economic Forum certainly played a role. The continuing depression in oil prices took the wind out of the sails of attendees from the Middle East and Russia whose swagger during previous forums was underpinned by the strength of their oil-based economies.\u201cIf you look at the figures, our economy will not look like anything good this coming year,\u201d Vladimir A. Dmitriev, the chairman of Russia\u2019s Vnesheconombank, sighed during a panel on the outlook for Russia.For others, the sharp swings in the markets took a toll. One financier who attended said that his optimism fluctuated with the vicissitudes of the market, particularly after the sharp plunge Wednesday as the forum began. The markets then rebounded on Thursday and Friday.Yet others appeared anxious over the very disruption that lay at the heart of the theme of this year\u2019s World Economic Forum, the \u201cFourth Industrial Revolution.\u201d It was a formulation aimed at describing the rise of new digital technologies that have been upsetting incumbents in a variety of industries.Several of those being disrupted seemed to be struggling to find their balance, even at a conference seemingly built to assure them of their importance. On a panel titled \u201cFuture-Proofing Global Finance,\u201d Bank of America\u2019s chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, repeatedly both defended the importance of traditional banks and encouraged tougher regulation of the new financial technologies that have begun to eat into his business.Mr. Moynihan emphasized that Bank of America spent billions of dollars developing its technologies. He also highlighted what he described as the proved stability of the traditional bank payment infrastructure, as traditional players spend millions on digital security. Mobile payment systems in Africa \u2014 which have essentially taken the place of traditional banks and payments systems there \u2014 might be less rock-solid, he suggested.Imagine, he argued, if people couldn\u2019t make payments for an hour, hinting at the chaos that might follow such an outage.\u201cThe payments side is critical,\u201d Mr. Moynihan said.Both he and William T. Winters, the former JPMorgan Chase executive who now leads the British bank Standard Chartered, also argued that new entrants to the finance sector should be subject to more regulation. For both banking chiefs, it was a matter of protecting consumers \u2014 in the service of what they called \u201ca level playing field.\u201d\u201cPayment systems have to be regulated,\u201d Mr. Winters said on the finance panel. \u201cThey need to be observed.\u201dOf course, not all in attendance espoused such glum outlooks.in an interview, Robert F. Smith, the chairman and chief executive of the tech-focused private equity firm Vista Equity Partners, openly embraced new technologies, promoting the possibilities that digital systems could bring to sleepy industries like car insurance.Automation and data analytics, he explained, could greatly lower the costs of car repairs for customers, insurers and auto repair shops by eliminating the waste of paper systems and duplicative data entry.Still others evinced little sign of discomfort with the winds of change. Stephen A. Schwarzman, the Blackstone Group\u2019s chairman and chief executive, happily lauded the relative stability of his own industry during the finance panel.\u201cWe\u2019re not disrupters,\u201d he cracked. \u201cWe\u2019re just lovable, friendly investors.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Argentina and Aramco Are Deals for Difficult Times", "Date": "2016-01-26", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsTwo big deals dominated the agenda in Davos, Switzerland, last week: Argentina\u2019s negotiations with holdout creditors and Saudi Arabia\u2019s potential sale of a piece of its national energy leviathan, Saudi Aramco.One would open up a robust democracy to global markets after years of feckless governance and isolation. The other would help a repressive regime retain its grip. That both would arguably leave the world better off underlines its fragile state.The plutocrats assembled in Davos at the World Economic Forum, which concluded on Saturday, spent most of their time reassuring each other that sliding stock markets represent no threat to their prosperity similar to the 2008 financial crisis. When their discussions ventured further afield \u2013 and beyond the surging poll numbers of Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidential bid \u2014 Argentina and Saudi Arabia were front and center. They represent starkly divergent developments that, while not suggestive of crisis at the doorstep, showcase the tenuous nature of global stability.Argentina\u2019s return to the economic mainstream is the happier of the two. The newly elected president, Mauricio Macri, hopes to reach a settlement with creditors led by Elliott Management who went unpaid when his predecessors defaulted. Though Mr. Macri said he had not met with Elliott\u2019s leader, Paul Singer, his delegation of cabinet members, including his finance minister and a former JPMorgan banker, Alfonso Prat-Gay, and even the leader of the opposition party, charmed the pants off the international bankers and world leaders in attendance.In addition, the Argentines used their Swiss visit to meet with bank chief executives to lay the groundwork for expanding the country\u2019s dollar reserves. By lending money to the central bank in return for as-yet-to-be-determined collateral \u2013 via a so-called repo operation \u2013 financial institutions can help bring Argentina back to the markets. That presumably entails support from the International Monetary Fund, with whom Mr. Macri and his entourage also tangoed in Davos.As Mr. Macri made a point of noting, that will benefit everyone. In an interview with Reuters, he boasted that Argentina\u2019s agricultural industry could feed 600 million people \u2013 but only if it could reach them.\u201cFor that we need infrastructure. We need roads, ports \u2014 for that we need financing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are near,\u201d he continued, to having \u201cthe worst logistics in Latin America. That\u2019s a great opportunity also for companies and investors.\u201dMr. Macri\u2019s performance should increase external pressure on the hedge fund holdouts headed by Elliott to accept any offer that looks objectively reasonable. Mr. Singer has a strong track record of holding fast to his legal convictions, but does he really want to be known as the man who deprived the world\u2019s hunger of prime Argentine beef?Contrast Argentina with the other big deal floating around Davos: a stock offering from the national petroleum company of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Bankers on Wall Street and in the City of London were feverishly preparing underwriting proposals last week for the share sale, which would probably be limited to a downstream division of Aramco to avoid shining the full spotlight of transparency on the parent\u2019s books and vast oil reserves.Top executives from banks working on the pitches professed little alacrity about the deal, for reasons that are both selfish and moral. On the first point, though an initial public offering of Aramco could be the biggest equity deal in history, the fees will be negligible. The last big Saudi Arabian I.P.O., a $6 billion offering for National Commercial Bank in November 2014, paid underwriting commissions of below 0.1 percent. By contrast, the Chinese e-commerce group Alibaba paid 12 times as much to the banks that took it public in a $25 billion deal two years ago.That might be tolerable to the banks if the deal were of a more philosophically palatable character, along the lines of, say, restoring Argentina\u2019s access to credit. Saudi Arabia last year summarily executed more than 150 people, the most in two decades, according to Amnesty International. Notwithstanding Deputy Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman\u2019s talk of transparency, the offering has to be seen as part of the Al Saud dynasty\u2019s coping mechanism for sliding oil prices and the damage this is doing to the finances of the kingdom.In an Aramco I.P.O., there\u2019s no money to be made and no pathway to moral redemption. So why participate? Though the idea of financing a regime that kicked off this year with 47 beheadings is troubling, the alternative would be worse for global stability: a chaotic, Libya-style breakdown.It\u2019s na\u00efve to think that financiers alone have the power to prevent Saudi Arabia from spreading geopolitical anxiety or to turn Argentina into a trustworthy, developed market. But given the delicate state of the global economy, World Economic Forum bankers should give it their best shot.Advertisement"}

It is being built and financed by the Indonesian businessman and collector Haryanto Adikoesoemo.Thomas J. Berghuis, previously the curator of Chinese art at the Guggenheim Museum in New York, has been hired as director of the museum, which will join a flourishing art scene in Indonesia that includes a growing network of galleries, independent art spaces, artists\u2019 communities and events like the Jakarta Biennale and the annual ArtJog festival.\u201cI want the Museum MACAN to develop and advance the understanding of Indonesians about art and the appreciation of art,\u201d Mr. Adikoesoemo said on Saturday by telephone from Singapore, where he was attending Art Stage Singapore, an annual international art fair. \u201cI also want this museum to help cross-pollinate exchanges with Indonesia and the world, to provide a platform for Indonesian art internationally and to bring international art to Indonesia.\u201dThe 43,000-square-foot museum, currently under construction, will be located outside the city center in the Kebon Jeruk district of West Jakarta. It will occupy one floor of a building in a larger development project that will include offices, apartments, a hotel and a retail area. Mr. Adikoesoemo said revenue from other parts of the development would go toward the operation of the museum.In creating exhibitions and programming for the museum, Mr. Berghuis and his team will have access to Mr. Adikoesoemo\u2019s collection of about 800 works of modern and contemporary art. The collection, built over 25 years, is about 40 percent art from Indonesia, 35 percent art from the United States and Western Europe, and 25 percent art from the greater Asian region.The artists in the collection include prominent Indonesians like Raden Saleh and Affandi as well as international artists like Gerhard Richter, Anish Kapoor, Jeff Koons and Frank Stella. The museum will focus on exchanges between Indonesia and the international art world, according to Mr. Berghuis, whose team also plans to commission new works.\u201cI knew about Haryanto from the curatorial and art world in Indonesia, and when we first started talking, I could tell this was going to be a serious initiative, not a vanity project,\u201d Mr. Berghuis said on Saturday, also by telephone from Singapore. \u201cThere are key artists tied to key movements in the collection, and what is important to me there is you can educate with that.\u201dEducation will be a key component of the museum, Mr. Berghuis said, with an emphasis on art history and research.Mr. Adikoesoemo is president of PT AKR Corporindo, an Indonesian-based chemical and energy logistics company, and president of AKR Land Development, a luxury property developer. Since 2015, he has served on the board of trustees at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C.\u201cThe private collecting milieu in Jakarta is very well developed, but more often than not the focus is on Indonesian contemporary art,\u201d said Melissa Chiu, director of the Hirshhorn. \u201cHaryanto is unusual in that he has been collecting international art alongside Indonesian art for years, so this is really the next step for him. It\u2019s a bold move.\u201dAn earlier version of this article gave an incorrect credit for a rendering of the museum. It was by MET Studio Design, not MET Design Studios.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s Payback Time for Women", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "Supported byStill, it couldn\u2019t happen here. Or could it? Over the past few years, a case for the U.B.I. has emerged that could make it appealing not just to the poor, who don\u2019t vote in great numbers, but to women, who do.The feminist argument for a U.B.I. is that it\u2019s a way to reimburse mothers and other caregivers for the heavy lifting they now do free of charge. Roughly one-fifth of Americans have children 18 or under. Many also attend to ill or elderly relatives. They perform these labors out of love or a sense of duty, but still, at some point during the diaper-changing or bedpan cleaning, they have to wonder why their efforts aren\u2019t seen as \u201cwork.\u201d They may even ask why they have to pay for the privilege of doing it, by cutting back on their hours or quitting jobs to stay home.Disproportionately, of course, these caregivers are women. Notwithstanding the advent of the stay-at-home dad, it\u2019s still mothers who do most of the invisible labor of cleaning, schlepping, scheduling and listening.To the extent that mainstream feminism has paid attention to pocketbook issues over the past few decades, it has focused on the workplace: the wage gap, absence of family leave and weak \u201cinfrastructure of care,\u201d to use Anne-Marie Slaughter\u2019s phrase. These family-unfriendly facts of life on the job do yank success further out of the reach of women who combine career and children. But the problem is not that employers hate women and children. It\u2019s that they make a common assumption about motherhood: It\u2019s a lifestyle choice, not a wage-worthy job, and no one other than parents should pay for it. Wages for child rearing and housework? When one feminist collective took up that cry in the 1970s, it was more or less drummed out of the second-wave feminist movement, which aimed to get women into the work force, not pay them to stay out of it.If mothers are glorified hobbyists who produce less value than nonmothers, it follows that they\u2019re getting a free ride on everyone else\u2019s labor. This can lead to tensions between colleagues, and also colors relations between breadwinning husbands and stay-at-home wives, who notoriously have less bargaining power in their households.I\u2019d argue that this view of motherhood gets it exactly backward. Actually, it\u2019s society that\u2019s getting a free ride on women\u2019s unrewarded contributions to the perpetuation of the human race. As Marx might have said had he deemed women\u2019s work worth including in his labor theory of value (he didn\u2019t), \u201creproductive labor\u201d (as feminists call the creation and upkeep of families and homes) is the basis of the accumulation of human capital. I say it\u2019s time for something like reparations.It\u2019s an odd kind of reparations, you may object, that goes to fathers as well as mothers, the unattached as well as those with family responsibilities. But entertain this radical proposition: The universal basic income is a necessary condition for a just society, for it recognizes the fact that most of us \u2014 men, women, parents and nonparents \u2014 do a great deal of unpaid work to sustain the general well-being. If we\u2019re not raising children, then we may be going to school, or volunteering around the neighborhood.Politically, the U.B.I. looks a lot more plausible than a subsidy aimed only at mothers, because, as Social Security and Medicare make clear, policies have more staying power when perceived as general entitlements rather than free cash for free riders. Critics on the right would dismiss a mothers\u2019 annuity as a handout to welfare queens. Critics on the left might see it as enshrining traditional gender norms. A universal basic income would sidestep both of these objections.I do not want to create the impression that feminists dominate this debate. On the contrary: They\u2019re an overlooked part of a much larger conversation that has been going on for centuries.In 1797, Thomas Paine declared that nations should give every 21-year-old a lump sum because those who inherit land have an unfair advantage over those who don\u2019t. By the middle of the last century, economists and leaders on both sides of the political spectrum were proposing minimum incomes.THIS is all very nice, skeptics say, but the U.B.I. still represents a moral hazard. Give people money for nothing, and the lazy will grow lazier and the rest of us will be bankrupted.But that does not appear to be the case. On the contrary: The U.B.I. gives workers less reason to loll about at home than do perversely disincentivizing policies like the one whereby a dollar earned is a dollar cut from a welfare check. Research suggests that, rather than weaken the will to work, unconditional regular disbursements let people manage their careers more wisely.In five famous studies on the negative income tax conducted in the United States and Canada in the 1970s, a minimum income did bring down work hours a bit, partly because the unemployed took longer to find new jobs. Researchers speculate that they were holding out for positions that better matched their skills. In the United States, male breadwinners scaled back by as much as 9 percent a year. In Canada, they hardly cut back at all. In both countries, teenagers stayed in school longer. And women with children did spend up to 30 percent less time on the job.The U.B.I. has feminist critics as well as supporters, and they don\u2019t like that finding. The U.B.I. would encourage women to drop out of the work force, they say, ceding the ground feminism has fought so hard for. But that concern strikes me as, well, paternalistic. Women should have more choices, not fewer. So should men. Equality between the sexes should not require everyone to conform to traditionally male patterns of employment.Besides, basic income policies have been shown to mitigate specifically female kinds of poverty.When cash-transfer experiments were conducted in poor towns in India, girls gained more weight and increased the time they spent at school at greater rates than boys, probably because when cash is scarce, the girls get less to eat and are kept home more.In the United States, as Kathryn J. Edin and H. Luke Shaefer showed in their book on extreme poverty, \u201c$2.00 a Day,\u201d the process of qualifying for food stamps and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, the welfare-to-work program created in 1996, can be so demanding, bewildering and degrading that many applicants simply give up. And who are the patient souls who wait in those daylong lines, pee into cups for drug tests or go home empty-handed? Women, more often than not, since there are more than four times as many families run by single mothers as by single fathers, and a third more households headed by women are on the dole than those run by men.As for stay-at-home mothers supported by their partners, a basic income would let them put aside money of their own. Most retirement-savings instruments are linked to paychecks, which means that so-called nonworking parents have no way to pay into Social Security, 401(k)\u2019s or I.R.A.s. A basic income would let them save for old age. For nonwage-earning mothers trapped in abusive relationships, cash would make it easier for them to leave.The price tag for these cash transfers would be partly offset by savings. Most anti-poverty programs would become redundant. Bureaucracies tasked with weeding out cheaters would melt away (though, unfortunately, so would the jobs devoted to weeding). The better-off would pay back parts of their grants in taxes in proportion to their earned income. Moreover, a basic income would reduce the ill effects of poverty and therefore the cost to society of bad public health, crime and incarceration. Basic-income experiments have shown that recipients make greater use of medical services and break the law less often than nonrecipients. And then there\u2019s the boost to the economy that would result from poor people with cash in hand buying more goods.Some of the many strategies proposed for raising the rest of the money include a relatively high flat tax; the closing of tax loopholes; a value-added tax; the elimination of middle-class entitlements such as the mortgage-interest deduction and retirement benefits; a careful paring back of Social Security; a tax on speculative financial transactions; and a carbon tax. We could also remit money reaped from the exploitation of public resources. Alaska, which already pays its citizens something very like a basic income, sends every adult and child a varying annual dividend of around $2,000 from a fund that invests royalties paid to the state by oil and natural gas producers.The truth, though, is that the U.B.I. is \u2014 yes \u2014 a form of redistribution. We\u2019ll be able to afford it only when we decide it\u2019s worth affording. But that\u2019s just what we ought to decide. We should cut back on military spending if we have to, or raise taxes on the rich. The political will for such a huge restructuring of our economy would require a fundamental reassessment of the relationship between the state and the people. Maybe, like Thomas Paine, we\u2019d start to think of these wealth transfers as a right of citizenship instead of an insurance policy against financial disaster.Even if we started small to get people used to the idea by offering way-below-poverty-level sums ($6,000, say), these would still buoy American families struggling not to slip underwater.The U.B.I. would also edge us toward a more gender-equal world. The extra cash would make it easier for a dad to become the primary caregiver if he wanted to. A mom with a job could write checks for child care and keep her earnings, too. Stay-at-home parents would have money in the bank, more clout in the family, and the respect that comes from undertaking an enterprise with measurable value. And we\u2019d have established the principle that the work of love is not priceless at all, but worth paying for.Advertisement"}

But really, what does all this have to do with the 2016 presidential election? After all, what is a primary \u2014 or a caucus?In this lesson, we provide a primer on the presidential nomination process by combining resources from The New York Times with videos and information from around the web, so students won\u2019t just understand how candidates get nominated, but will also be challenged to think deeply about how the system works. At the bottom of the post, we suggest a variety of ways to use these resources in the classroom, including a jigsaw strategy, a mock caucus and a debate.How are you talking about the 2016 primary season in your classroom? Let us know. 1. What is a primary? What is a caucus? How are they different?Democratic caucuses feature an arcane delegate-election procedure that requires wheeling and dealing, sometimes for hours. All in public. If you do not relish political wrangling with neighbors, or you cherish the secret ballot, the caucuses are not for you \u2013 as they are not for most Iowa Democrats.This is grass-roots politics at its purist. It really starts at your kitchen table from discussions at dinner, and it goes right to the caucus where your voice can be heard. It\u2019s not as humdrum as a voting machine.2. How does the party nominating process work? How do the primaries and caucuses lead to eventually choosing a party nomination?The 2016 Republican primary began as many Republican presidential campaigns do, with a few unexpected names atop the polls. In recent cycles, the names have included Herman Cain, Rick Santorum and Pat Buchanan. This year, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and Ben Carson.What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s made 2016 different is that unexpected names have stayed atop the polls.For the last five months, Mr. Trump, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Carson have combined for more than 50 percent of Republican voters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 preferences in national polls. And just to review: Mr. Trump and Mr. Carson have never held elective office, while Mr. Cruz is loathed by many of his fellow Republican senators. All three regularly tell untruths on the campaign trail.By contrast, the poll leaders in the final weeks before voting in the last three competitive Republican races \u00e2\u0080\u0094 2012, 2008 and 2000 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 were mostly traditional politicians: Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich in 2012; John McCain and Mike Huckabee in 2008; George W. Bush in 2000.One way or another, 2016 will be different. Either the nominee will be more stylistically radical than any recent predecessor, or an establishment figure like Marco Rubio will stage a much bigger comeback than any recent Republican nominee has.3. Why doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t anyone run for president outside the two-party nomination system? When have there been so-called third-party candidates, and how have they affected elections?\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve tried the whole third party approach. But throughout history, third parties have accomplished one of two things \u00e2\u0080\u0093 either splitting the vote and weakening one party while strengthening the other; or further polarizing us by giving a structured voice to an extreme element of society. What they haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t done is give voice to a large movement of Americans, or force the two major parties to be better. And at the end of the day, they almost always fade away, remain obscure, or get absorbed by one of the two major parties anyway.Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face it \u00e2\u0080\u0093 third parties just aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t part of our political DNA.\nWhy is Donald Trump pledging his fealty to whomever the Republican Party nominates for president? And why is avowed \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d Bernie Sanders running for the nomination of a political party, the Democratic Party, that has embraced the free enterprise system for decades?The answer is America\u2019s two-party duopoly, a peculiar and long-lasting arrangement that has stifled political competition from other forces for more than a century. Thanks to laws passed by Democrats and Republicans and upheld by the courts, candidates of other parties face discriminatory ballot access and campaign financing hurdles, gerrymandering, exclusion from debates and media blackouts. It\u2019s no wonder then that even maverick politicians like Trump and Sanders opt to run as Republicans or Democrats, even when much of what they believe is outside of those parties\u2019 mainstreams.The result leaves millions of voters frustrated by the lack of wider choices. Our politics is stagnating into an exquisite deadlock that only benefits major party incumbents, who relish blaming the other party for their inability to move the country forward even while they collude in keeping out newcomers.4. Is there a better way to choose presidential candidates than the current primary and caucus system?The two states have dominated the nominating process for so long that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to think of their role as natural.But it is not natural. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s undemocratic, in fact. It is unfair to voters in the other 48 states. And it distorts economic policy in several damaging ways.A more democratic system would allow more voters to see the candidates up close for months at a time. The early states could rotate each year, so that all kinds \u00e2\u0080\u0094 big states and small, younger and older, rural and urban \u00e2\u0080\u0094 had a turn. In 2016, the first wave could include states that have voted near the end recently, like Indiana, North Carolina, Oregon and South Dakota.A rotation along these lines would enliven the political debate. Investments in science and education, which are the lifeblood of future economic growth, might play a bigger role in the campaign. You could even imagine \u00e2\u0080\u0094 optimistically, I know \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that the deficit might prove easier to address if Medicare and Social Security recipients did not make up such a disproportionate share of early voters.5. Why Iowa and New Hampshire? Why did the media and the candidates spend so much time focusing on those two states?Detractors of this early winnowing system contend that it is unfair and no way to begin picking the leader of the world\u2019s most powerful nation. They argue that neither state is typically American, with Iowa being too rural and New Hampshire too small.Iowans and New Hampshirites do not see it that way, of course. They say their states are ideal political laboratories because voters in both states still insist on \u00e2\u0080\u009cretail politicking\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u2014 getting to know and test candidates firsthand, at town-meeting style forums, in coffee shops and, indeed, in their own living rooms.To do well in Iowa and New Hampshire, they argue, candidates must have a \u00e2\u0080\u009cground game\u00e2\u0080\u009d of hand shaking, eye contact and one-on-one conversations because the \u00e2\u0080\u009cair game\u00e2\u0080\u009d of television sound bites and advertising blitzes so often used elsewhere just won\u2019t cut it in Hawkeye and Granite country.Is this a lot of political hokum?Student ActivitiesThen, the class can simulate a caucus, where students discuss their favorite candidates and what they like about them. Finally, students can walk around the classroom to form groups based on the candidates they like most (similar to the Iowa Democratic caucus) or they can use a secret ballot to vote (similar to the Iowa Republican caucus). Then the class can hold a discussion or debate about which alternative system would work best, or if we should stick with the status quo. Afterward, students can write an argumentative essay advocating one of the proposals.Additional ResourcesC-Span Classroom | Lesson Idea: Primaries and CaucusesVote Smart | Government 101: United States Presidential PrimaryPBS | Primaries and Caucuses: How Do Parties Choose a Candidate?iCivics | The Electoral ProcessThis resource may be used to address the academic standards listed below.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Proposes Spending $4 Billion on Self-Driving Cars", "Date": "2016-01-14", "News": "Supported byDETROIT \u2014 With automakers and technology companies rushing to develop self-driving cars, the Obama administration on Thursday pledged to expedite regulatory guidelines for autonomous vehicles and invest in research to help bring them to market.Until now, the federal government has taken a hands-off approach to regulating new technology that allows vehicles to operate independently and without an actual driver.\u201cWe are bullish on autonomous vehicles,\u201d Mr. Foxx said. \u201cThe actions we are taking today bring us up to speed.\u201dThe government\u2019s new support includes a request in President Obama\u2019s proposed budget for the next fiscal year for $4 billion, to be spent over 10 years, to finance research projects and infrastructure improvements tied to driverless cars. Mr. Foxx said that autonomous vehicles had the potential to reduce traffic accidents and significantly improve safety on America\u2019s roads. He estimated that as many as 25,000 deaths could have been avoided last year if driverless technology had been in widespread use.\u201cWe are entering a new world here, and we know it,\u201d he said.The executives welcomed the government\u2019s proposed investment and its fast-track approach to developing a framework for regulating driverless models.\u201cIt takes real collaboration with our regulators so this is done right and done safely,\u201d said Mark Reuss, head of global product development at General Motors, the nation\u2019s largest auto manufacturer.Mr. Foxx said the government expected to issue guidance to companies within six months on the functions that autonomous vehicles must be able to perform to be considered safe.He said the government already had authority to allow limited deployment of 2,500 autonomous vehicles by an individual company for a two-year period.In addition, he urged companies to seek interpretations of existing federal vehicle standards from regulators for new technologies under development.He cited one such case, in which regulators recently confirmed that a remote, self-parking system developed by the German automaker BMW met federal standards.\u201cThis is the right way to drive innovation,\u201d said Mr. Foxx, adding that federal regulators were also working with various states to create a consistent national policy for driverless cars.Several automakers have vowed to have autonomous cars ready for consumers to buy within the next 10 years.But without guidance from regulators, companies have been uncertain about the legal environment that awaits their new vehicles. \u201cThe industry is anxious to have a framework, particularly in terms of safety,\u201d Mr. Reuss said.Mr. Foxx declined to say whether he expected bipartisan support for the proposed $4 billion driverless-car investment in the president\u2019s budget.He also said the government needed to address other related issues about the vehicles over the next six months.\u201cThere are liability issues that need to be thought through,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do several things at once.\u201dThe cooperative stance taken between regulators and carmakers is also extending to other areas involving vehicle safety.On Friday, the administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration will hold another meeting with auto executives to draft voluntary measures by carmakers to improve safety.The meeting is expected to complete several new safety measures, such as how companies can increase the number of vehicle owners who take recalled models in for repairs, according to one official briefed on the subject.Mark R. Rosekind, head of the safety agency, has been working closely with the auto companies on the voluntary measures after a record number of safety recalls over the last two years.He and Mr. Foxx are expected to announce the safety initiatives in an appearance Friday at the auto show.An article on Friday about federal support for the development of driverless cars referred incompletely to President Obama\u2019s $4 billion request for research into autonomous car technology and infrastructure. While the request is included in his proposed budget for the next fiscal year, it would be spent over 10 years, not one year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oil Prices Slide Again, and the Bottom Is Not Yet in Sight", "Date": "2016-01-11", "News": "Supported byLast year a broad reassessment occurred in commodities, as the global economy slowed and demand from emerging markets like China, India and Brazil waned. The slump in oil prices picked up momentum last week on renewed concerns about the health of China\u2019s economy, which led to a rout in global markets.\u201cEvery signal that the market is getting now suggests that we are going to continue to have an oil glut for some time to come,\u201d said Jason Bordoff, director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. \u201cIran is about to re-enter the market, demand numbers and economic indicators look relatively weak, U.S. supply is holding up in a low-price environment much better than people thought and global inventories are growing.\u201dOver the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.In that situation, he said, even geopolitical tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which generally would have frightened energy markets, have not had an impact on the markets\u2019 perception of risk. In fact, the sharp increase in tensions between the regional powers makes it less likely they will agree to stabilize oil markets in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. \u201cIn that world, there is almost every indication that you want to be bearish,\u201d Mr. Bordoff said.Many analysts expect more declines before prices recover. Goldman Sachs, which had predicted that oil might reach $200 a barrel during a \u201csuper-spike\u201d before the 2008 financial crisis, forecast last year that prices might drop as low as $20 a barrel in the current downward cycle.Morgan Stanley also argued on Monday that $20 oil was possible if the United States dollar made rapid gains. Analysts at Barclays cut their outlook for oil and copper prices. They still predicted oil would rebound in the second half of 2016, but set an average price of $37 a barrel this year, down from previous forecasts of $56 to $60.\u201cRecent price declines for major commodities are now greater than in any crisis of the past 30 years and speculative positioning much more negative than it was even in the depths of the financial crisis,\u201d according to a research note by Barclays. \u201cThat suggests that although the price outlook is weaker than it was previously, the road ahead could be a very bumpy one.\u201dAt the same time, the drop in oil is pushing down prices at the gas pump. The average retail price fell to $1.96 a gallon, according to the AAA motor club, down from $2.14 a gallon a year ago.Oil\u2019s decline in the last year was caused in part by the decision by Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s biggest producer, not to reduce production. This fundamental change in oil market discipline was meant to force out high-cost energy producers, particularly shale producers in the United States, by driving down prices.But the decision backfired on Saudi Arabia and other producers, which are now confronting a much higher burden of financing their oil-dependent economies.Among a raft of new economic measures, the Saudi government is considering selling its energy assets. Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil company, confirmed last week that it was studying selling shares to the public in its upstream business or its refining and petrochemical companies.Separately, coal mining companies have been struggling as demand declines. The drop in energy prices and stricter environmental regulations have made natural gas a much more attractive competitor to coal in the United States.The company said it expected its mining operations and shipments to continue. It said it had an agreement with more than 40 percent of its first-lien lenders for its debt-cutting plan and enough cash to run operations through the process.John W. Eaves, the company\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement that a court-supervised process was the best way to strengthen its balance sheet.\u201cWith oil prices collapsing, renewables on the rise and coal companies going bankrupt, we are at a key inflection point in the energy transition,\u201d said Michael Webber, deputy director of the Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cInflection points produce a lot of uncertainty and volatility for investors.\u201dClifford Krauss and Andrew E. Kramer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The museum has just published the first catalog of its collection, put the collection online and opened an art study room.

{"Headline": "For Now, Bernie Sanders\u2019s Health Plan Is More of a Tax Plan", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported byPublic HealthThat\u2019s because the plan, released two hours before Sunday night\u2019s Democratic debate, was full of details about the taxes that would be collected to finance it. The plan would charge a special income tax, called a premium, increase payroll taxes and raise a variety of taxes on high-income Americans, including income and capital gains taxes. Those are big, specific changes, worthy of detailed coverage.Missing, however, were more than a few sentences about how the proposal would change the health care system in the United States.Mr. Sanders wants what is called a single-payer program, a major change to our current system. The health care policy described by his white paper would replace all health insurance programs in the United States with coverage for everyone in the country provided by the federal government, the single payer. Large, new categories of services would be covered, including dental and nursing home care. It would eliminate co-payments and deductibles.Mr. Sanders has branded the program as \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d But the program he describes isn\u2019t an extension of the existing Medicare program, which provides health insurance for older people and the disabled. Medicare includes premiums, co-payments and deductibles, and excludes coverage for long-term care or dentistry.A lot of important details have been left out. Here are some things it doesn\u2019t say: What would the new system pay doctors and hospitals for their services? How would it decide which medical treatments it should and shouldn\u2019t cover? What strategies would it use to contain health care costs and keep the system affordable? Who would make the decisions, big and small, about how the program would work?I spoke with Gerald Friedman, a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, who provided the campaign with estimates of the program\u2019s cost. Mr. Friedman sent detailed tables explaining his calculations. He assumes that spending in some categories of health care would go up, as more Americans can afford access. Others, he said, would drop because the single-payer system would give the federal government improved bargaining power and lower administrative costs. On balance, he estimates that the single-payer system would cost the country less over time than the existing health care system.Mr. Friedman calculates, for example, that the cost of physician services in a single-payer system could be lowered by 10.7 percent \u2014 his estimate of how much doctors currently spend on billing and administration staff that they would no longer need. I asked him how the payer would get to that number \u2014 would the government pay lower prices for treatments, or change which treatments it paid for, or switch doctors to a system in which they earn government salaries?He couldn\u2019t say with certainty. \u201cThe pleasure of being an academic is I can just spell things out and leave the details to others,\u201d he said. \u201cThe details very quickly get very messy.\u201dThat doesn\u2019t preclude a single-payer system that could be devised to hit the estimates provided by the campaign. Many other countries run single-payer health care systems that provide more health care coverage than the United States while costing far less. Mr. Friedman\u2019s estimates don\u2019t suggest that the United States could cut its health care bill in half, making it similar in size to the French system. He instead finds more modest savings that could come from lowered administrative costs and better prices on prescription drugs.It\u2019s easy to rail against the country\u2019s existing health care system, which is expensive, inequitable and complex. It\u2019s harder to devise a detailed replacement that\u2019s workable, affordable and politically popular.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "State Street Settles Pay-to-Play Charges for $12 Million", "Date": "2016-01-14", "News": "Supported byState Street\u2019s banking unit will pay $12 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges that an executive and an outside lobbyist operated a pay-to-play scheme to win the firm contracts from Ohio pension funds.The former executive, Vincent DeBaggis, who was head of State Street\u2019s public funds group, is also settling with the S.E.C. over the matter, agreeing to repay $174,202.81, plus a $100,000 penalty.The public funds group is responsible for handling State Street\u2019s work overseeing public retirement funds. The S.E.C. says the two individuals struck an agreement with the deputy treasurer of Ohio during the time of the scheme in which they would make cash payments and political campaign contributions in exchange for the business.In return, State Street received three sub-custodian contracts for three of the state\u2019s big public pensions.State Street and Mr. DeBaggis consented to the orders without admitting to or denying the findings. State Street disclosed the receipt of a so-called Wells notice last June, warning that the S.E.C. might pursue action. In a statement, the Boston-based company said the activity violated its code of conduct and was done without informing others in management at the bank. State Street fired Mr. DeBaggis and in 2012 eliminated the hiring of consultants to solicit asset servicing business from state retirement plans. \u201cWe have cooperated fully with the S.E.C.\u2019s investigation and are pleased to put this matter behind us,\u201d the firm said.The lobbyist, Robert Crowe, is a law firm partner and fund-raiser who worked on behalf of State Street from 1993 to 2011. The S.E.C. filed a lawsuit against him on Thursday in federal court in Ohio, saying he illegally filtered $16,000 through his personal bank account to the treasurer\u2019s campaign funds and continued to make illicit campaign contributions until September 2010 out of fear that the business could be rescinded.The S.E.C. says Mr. Crowe acted as a \u201cconduit\u201d for corrupt payments from State Street to influence decisions about public pension contracts.\u201cPay-to-play schemes are intolerable, and lobbyists and their clients should understand that the S.E.C. will be aggressive in holding participants accountable,\u201d said David Glockner, the director of the S.E.C.\u2019s Chicago office.Arthur McMahon III, the lawyer for Mr. Crowe, said in a statement: \u201cThe S.E.C.\u2019s allegations regarding Mr. Crowe are patently untrue. Moreover, nothing the S.E.C. has alleged would constitute securities fraud, a breach of the S.E.C.\u2019s pay-to-play rules or a violation of any other rule the S.E.C. has authority to enforce.\u201d He added that he believed Mr. Crowe would be vindicated.The S.E.C. said Mr. DeBaggis also arranged a lobbying agreement with Mohammed Noure Alo, an immigration lawyer with no lobbying experience but connections to the Ohio deputy treasurer, Amer Ahmad. Under the agreement, Mr. Alo was to be paid $8,000 a month. That fee would go up to $10,000 a month if State Street got the business of at least two Ohio pensions.From February 2010 to April 2011, State Street paid $160,000 in lobbying fees to Mr. Alo, a substantial portion of which made its way to Mr. Ahmad, the S.E.C. said. Mr. DeBaggis knew Mr. Alo was acting on Mr. Ahmad\u2019s instructions and sharing his fees, the commission said.Mr. Ahmad started demanding more, however, according to the S.E.C.\u2019s lawsuit against Mr. Crowe. Mr. DeBaggis arranged a meeting between Mr. Ahmad, Mr. Crowe and others in March 2010, in which Mr. Crowe would be able to describe how he could raise funds for the treasurer. After that, Mr. Ahmad demanded $20,000 to $25,000 from Mr. DeBaggis within five days, the suit said.In 2014, Mr. Alo was sentenced to four years in prison after pleading guilty in connection with a bribery and money-laundering scheme involving the Ohio treasurer\u2019s office. Mr. Ahmad also pleaded guilty in that other case and fled the United States to Pakistan before sentencing, only to be extradited last year. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison.Mr. DeBaggis and Mr. Crowe also arranged the payment of $60,000 in political contributions to the Ohio treasurer\u2019s election campaign in return for Mr. Ahmad\u2019s awarding State Street the sub-custodian contracts, the S.E.C. said.Mr. Crowe believed that raising funds for the incumbent treasurer\u2019s campaign was critical to retaining State Street as a client, the S.E.C. said.Advertisement"}

We don\u2019t have money to pay.\u201dThe payment default does not change Puerto Rico\u2019s underlying economic troubles, although it could spur efforts in Congress to find ways to help the island.With big bond payments looming, Mr. Garc\u00eda Padilla announced last week that he had ordered a \u201cclawback,\u201d or recovery, of cash that would have normally been used to pay certain bonds. Since Nov. 30, he said, that cash had instead been diverted to help make a $328 million payment to the island\u2019s general obligation bondholders, who are entitled to be paid first, according to the Puerto Rican constitution.Because of the New Year\u2019s Day holiday, all of the due dates were extended until the close of business on Monday.The clawback allowed the government to amass enough cash to pay the general obligation bonds, which enjoyed a price rally on Monday.But it put the other bonds into default, the governor acknowledged. In some cases, bondholders could still be paid out of prepaid reserves, but drawing on a reserve without replenishing it is also considered a form of default.And in the case of bonds issued by the Puerto Rico Infrastructure Financing Authority and the Public Finance Corporation, there were no reserves. The responsibility to make the payments would then fall to bond insurers.Standard & Poor\u2019s, the ratings agency, said in a statement on Monday that it was going to downgrade the infrastructure authority\u2019s rating from CC to D. The clawback \u201cwas not done lightly, as it opens up the commonwealth to litigation,\u201d it said. \u201cHowever, we also believe it shows Puerto Rico\u2019s reluctance to default on G.O. debt, where bondholders hold a particularly strong legal claim, and could represent a shot across the bow to bondholders in ongoing restructuring talks.\u201d S.&P. did not change ratings on other bonds but added that the lack of current audited financial information created \u201cgreat uncertainty as to Puerto Rico\u2019s true financial position.\u201dExecutives of two bond insurers that had guaranteed some of the affected bonds wrote to Mr. Garc\u00eda Padilla and his advisers last week, calling the clawback illegal.\u201cWe are gravely concerned by this improper act, which violates numerous statutory and state and federal constitutional provisions,\u201d said Nader Tavakoli, the executive chairman of Ambac Assurance Corporation, and Derek M. Donnelly, senior managing director of the Financial Guaranty Insurance Company. Mr. Tavakoli and Mr. Donnelly argued that the clawback violated Puerto Rico\u2019s law for the order of payment priorities, its constitution and several provisions of the United States Constitution.But they said they were even more concerned about another diversion of money, which they said had begun in September, well before the governor invoked the clawback by executive order. They said as much as $94 million in federal excise tax on Puerto Rican rum, sold on the United States mainland, was supposed to have been placed in a trust fund, to pay principal and interest on bonds issued by the Puerto Rico Infrastructure Financing Authority.\u201cNo monies were transferred\u201d from September through the end of November, when Mr. Garc\u00eda Padilla invoked the clawback, the executives wrote. \u201cThe foregoing pattern of activity is unacceptable.\u201dThey demanded that the missing money be placed in the trust fund and that further clawbacks be halted, at least with respect to money that was designated to pay bonds that their companies had insured. They said they reserved their rights and remedies to recover the money.Mr. Garc\u00eda Padilla said he was expecting lawsuits. He said litigation would add to the government\u2019s pile of bills and possibly increase frictions between have and have-not creditor groups.\u201cIt will cost a lot for the commonwealth,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will cost a lot for our creditors. And every dollar that I need to use to pay lawsuit lawyers will be a dollar that I will not have available to pay creditors.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Tax on Views of Central Park?", "Date": "2016-01-18", "News": "Supported byLettersTo the Editor:While the first priority should be to limit the number of these mega-sun-blockers from casting their shadows on the park, a proposed luxury vista tax on newly constructed apartments with views of the park is definitely an alternative.Though the city would benefit financially from the added income this tax procures, we who love and use the park would still lose. PETER SAMTONNew YorkThe writer is an architect.To the Editor:Max Frankel\u2019s proposal to impose a tax on windows over Central Park to make the rich pay for their fabulous views from all those new towers around the park has a certain appeal. But the legality is questionable at best.Parks are not assets to be monetized. They belong to the people, and that includes rich as well as poor. Put another way, New York City has no more right to charge the rich for their view of a public park than to charge the poor to enter it and take a walk.On the practical side, tell the Department of Finance that the city can raise money by charging for views of parks, and next thing you know, it will be pushing to upzone the neighborhood as a dandy way of raising still more money from more people having those great views.In the end, you only generate more towers and make the situation worse. Better would be to downzone areas along parks, and waterways, too, to prevent those towers in the first place.MICHAEL GRUENNew YorkThe writer, a lawyer, is president of the City Club of New York. The letter represents his personal views.To the Editor:There is a much simpler solution to the problems addressed by Max Frankel in his proposal to tax apartments based on the number of windows with views. How about restructuring New York City\u2019s tax policy to shift much of the heavy lifting from income tax to property tax?If structured right, those who both work and live in the city would see their tax burden remain more or less the same. There would be a big increase in burden for those who own expensive homes but who do not earn money here.If large numbers of foreigners want to spend their money to buy apartments the likes of which most New Yorkers can only dream about, that is their right, but the city should make sure that they pay for the upkeep of the city they feel is such a good investment.JEREMY M. POSNERNew YorkTo the Editor:The city\u2019s property tax may be the proverbial \u201cthird rail\u201d of local politics, but at a time when families throughout the five boroughs are confronted with an affordable housing crisis, now is the time to push for fundamental reform.ANDREW L.

{"Headline": "Two Sides of Ted Cruz: Tort Reformer and Personal Injury Lawyer", "Date": "2016-01-20", "News": "Supported byEditorial ObserverTed Cruz says his uncompromising purity as a conservative crusader helped propel him to the top of the Republican presidential field. But his history suggests that when the cameras are off, a different Mr. Cruz emerges.To that, here\u2019s another tale of two Teds: Mr. Cruz, the Senate candidate, running as a conservative champion of tort reform in Texas while Mr. Cruz, the lawyer, quietly reaped more than $3 million while defending record-setting personal injury awards.Mr. Cruz helped write George W. Bush\u2019s 2000 campaign position paper, arguing for imposing limits on tort lawsuits. He worked in the Bush administration for two years, but by 2003, Mr. Cruz was appointed to be the Texas solicitor general, defending the state\u2019s laws, including Texas\u2019 tort reform law, whose limits are among the strictest in the nation.After leaving the solicitor general office in 2008, Mr. Cruz joined the law firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius in Houston. As an appellate lawyer, Mr. Cruz\u2019s work in Texas was often on behalf of corporate defendants. Indeed, Texas\u2019 strict limits on punitive damages led to a decline in tort lawsuits, even among firms specializing in that work.It was Mr. Cruz\u2019s talent as an appellate lawyer that netted him an unusual plaintiffs\u2019 assignment in New Mexico, whose laws are far more friendly to personal injury victims. There, he defended a $54 million award \u2014 the biggest in state history then \u2014 to a daughter of Barbara Barber, a nursing home patient who, badly neglected, had bled to death.The case was wrenching and sad. Mr. Cruz made it clear that if his firm were to take the Barber case, fighting the appeal of the judgment filed by the nursing home operator, ManorCare, \u201cthe money had to be right,\u201d Michael Gross, one of two attorneys representing the plaintiff, recalled this week. Mr. Cruz handled the appeal. ManorCare settled on the eve of arguments before the New Mexico Supreme Court.About a year later, Carl Bettinger, who with Mr. Gross had led the Barber case, asked Mr. Cruz to take on another appellate case, against ResCare New Mexico, part of a private chain of group homes for people with disabilities. The plaintiff was Larry Selk, a mentally disabled man brutally raped by an employee of the residential-care facility where he lived. This time, Mr. Cruz argued before the New Mexico Supreme Court to reinstate a $54 million damage award for Mr. Selk, which had been tossed out by a lower court. Mr. Cruz\u2019s argument was \u201cstunning in its persuasive power,\u201d Mr. Bettinger said. ResCare settled before the court ruled.At that time, Mr. Cruz was campaigning in Texas for the United States Senate, describing his work as solicitor general as epic battles for conservative principles, including tort reform.The New Mexico settlements are sealed. But Mr. Cruz\u2019s work at Morgan Lewis earned him a total of $1.6 million in 2011 and $1.7 million in 2012, according to Senate financial disclosures.Mr. Cruz\u2019s attacks on personal injury awards while working to preserve two huge awards \u201cseems so hypocritical now,\u201d Mr. Gross says.Mr. Bettinger said that by the time he paid Morgan Lewis its share of the Selk settlement, Mr. Cruz was a senator, making tort reform one of his issues in Washington.\u201cIt sure made me smile to myself,\u201d Mr. Bettinger said this week. \u201cIf Ted doesn\u2019t become president, he\u2019d be the first one I\u2019d call to defend a large-dollar verdict.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cuomo\u2019s Budget Opens New Chapter in Rivalry With de Blasio", "Date": "2016-01-14", "News": "Supported byMayor Bill de Blasio issued a stern rebuke to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Thursday for placing new financial strains on New York City, saying he would use \u201cany means necessary\u201d to restore hundreds of millions of dollars in state financing that the governor appeared to have cut from his annual budget.Mr. Cuomo responded with a question: What cuts?By day\u2019s end, Mr. Cuomo said his budget changes, in fact, \u201cwon\u2019t cost New York City a penny.\u201d Mr. de Blasio, who on Wednesday had said the state budget represented \u201creal progress\u201d for New Yorkers, described the governor\u2019s cuts a day later as \u201cunprecedented\u201d and \u201cunfair to our city.\u201dRepresentatives for both men said in statements that the mayor and the governor looked forward to working together.But peace can be fleeting between these feuding officials, and their Thursday evening d\u00e9tente capped a day of intense back-and-forth.Some fiscal experts said the governor\u2019s plans could blow a hole in the city\u2019s budget, and create financial problems for years to come. The front page of The Daily News on Thursday captured that notion, featuring photos of a smiling governor and a frowning mayor, with the caption, \u201cHey, Blaz, Hope You Played Powerball.\u201d\u201cIf you want to be fair or objective, the headline should be \u2018Unprecedented Joint Effort Between State and City on Major Priorities,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Cuomo said. \u201cI get the tabloids have to sell papers,\u201d he added.But Mr. de Blasio, perhaps sensing a rare opening against a limber political opponent, pounced. Although he had offered kind words on Wednesday about Mr. Cuomo\u2019s budget \u2014 particularly its financing for homeless services and housing for poor and working-class city residents \u2014 he made clear on Thursday that upon further review, he was not pleased.\u201cMy simple statement today is, \u2018We will fight these cuts,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. de Blasio said at a news conference in Queens. \u201cWe would ask the assistance of both houses of the Legislature in fighting these cuts.\u201d\u201cWhen a governor is good to New York City, he should be praised, commended, supported,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen a governor does something that is bad for New York City, it\u2019s the mayor\u2019s job to stand up for it.\u201dShortly afterward, the governor appeared on NY1 and said his fiscal plan represented \u201cone of the strongest budgets for New York City in a long, long time.\u201d He added, \u201cThis is a budget that really understands the problems and the priorities of New York City.\u201dThe governor said his reductions in financing for CUNY and Medicaid were meant as \u201cthe beginning of a discussion\u201d in a lengthy budget process, and that the changes to Medicaid and CUNY were about increasing efficiency, not about putting an additional fiscal burden on the city.\u201cI want to see more money at CUNY at the end of the day, and more money in the classroom,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said.Despite their continuing rivalry, the mayor and the governor did offer each other compliments on Thursday. The mayor was careful to thank Mr. Cuomo again for offering state resources to combat the city\u2019s rise in homelessness and help build housing; Mr. Cuomo, in turn, took pains to praise Mr. de Blasio for his leadership on those issues.Carol Kellermann, president of the nonpartisan Citizens Budget Commission, said Mr. Cuomo\u2019s budgets \u201chave been, as they should be, expressions of his agenda and priorities, so it is not surprising that his proposal has been taken seriously.\u201d\u201cBut it sounds like some of those proposals pertaining to New York City are meant as starting points for discussion,\u201d she added.Jesse McKinley contributed reporting from Albany.Advertisement"}

But tell me your take on the decision \u2014 and on what the popularity of WhatsApp means in general \u2014 while I pretend to listen.The new plan seems much smarter, and it\u2019s riding the crest of a larger trend: People love messaging so much that they may be willing to do a whole bunch of things from inside their messaging apps \u2014 buy stuff, book stuff, talk to customer service people and just generally engage in that great American pastime we call commercial activity. The benefit to WhatsApp (and Facebook\u2019s other messaging app, Messenger) is obvious; the company takes a cut of transactions and potentially makes billions.It\u2019s also good for developers. App stores are overstuffed, and getting people to download your app and use it requires a lot of marketing dollars and some luck. So if you want people to use your shopping or delivery or ride service, make it compatible with messaging \u2014 there\u2019s less competition there, and it doesn\u2019t require that users download new apps.Do you agree? Are chat-based services the next big thing?Here\u2019s the thing: The lowest common denominator across the world, as far as communication goes, is messaging apps. They offer low-cost data transmission. They require only basic writing, which nearly everyone does daily. Texting, particularly among millennials, is more popular than talking on the phone. I know I often would rather text someone than take a call.We already see this in other services, albeit in nascent forms. You know by now that Twitter is the social network of choice for directing obscenities at airlines when a flight is delayed. And Facebook Messenger is dabbling in the \u201cchat for business\u201d concept as well.Anyway, I am on board with the notion that chat and text will be the interface of the future. Or at least the predominant one for some time ahead.Here\u2019s a question I have: At what point do Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp end up on a collision course? Aren\u2019t they essentially doing the same thing for the company?But a future of many chat apps will be a terrible inconvenience for me \u2014 there\u2019ll be so many places to block you!Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ted Cruz and Donald Trump\u2019s Familiar Feud Over New York", "Date": "2016-01-14", "News": "Supported byAbout New YorkSenator Ted Cruz of Texas called out Donald Trump this week for the high crime of \u201cembodying New York values,\u201d which, translated into Republican primary-ese, apparently means that Mr. Trump has cooties.Whatever Mr. Cruz intended by invoking \u201cNew York values,\u201d it was not nice. The toxic coating on his hollow remark incensed Peter T. King, the Republican congressman from Long Island, who cannot stand Mr. Cruz to begin with. The congressman gave the senator\u2019s words some thought, then had a piece of advice for him.\u201cGo back under a rock,\u201d Mr. King said.During the debate, Mr. Cruz offered his tidy summary of how 8.4 million people view the world: \u201cEveryone understands that values in New York City are socially liberal, or pro-abortion or pro-gay marriage, focused around money and the media.\u201dFunny he should mention a focus on money.Mr. Cruz presents us with the familiar spectacle of a politician denouncing New York while simultaneously collecting bags of money there to pay for campaigns.Now Mr. Cruz is thought to be jostling with Mr. Trump for the same swath of voters, and until the \u201cNew York values\u201d crack, the two had been publicly civil when speaking of each other.Perhaps it goes without saying that Mr. Mercer, the foundational supporter of Mr. Cruz, lives in New York.Mr. Mercer\u2019s hedge fund, Renaissance Technologies, used a loophole to avoid $6 billion in taxes over the last decade, according to a United States Senate investigation. The fund says it complied with all the laws. The Internal Revenue Service has said it is reviewing the matter. By happy chance, Mr. Cruz has called for that agency to be abolished.But enough about public policy.The subject here, after all, is not hypocrisy but the villainy of embodying New York values.In 2013, Mr. Mercer was sued in federal court by the servants on the domestic staff of his Long Island home, who said they were docked pay and bonuses if the toiletries fell below one-third full, or when they failed to stock bathrooms with extra towels. The suit was \u201camicably\u201d settled, a lawyer for the servants told The New York Times.It is one thing for a politician to take campaign money from people who pore over federal code to get around $6 billion in taxes.It is quite another to be the creation of someone who may have calculated monetary punishments for people who did not swab the toilets to his specifications.Representative King has spoken warmly of Mr. Trump and openly encouraged his participation in the Republican primaries. But even Mr. King, who has taken a hard line on Muslims in America, claiming that they were insufficiently diligent in cooperating with the police, has taken exception to Mr. Trump\u2019s call to ban immigration by Muslims.A couple of years ago, at the screening of a documentary at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem, Mr. Trump\u2019s face briefly flickered across the screen. It was as if the bad guy wrestler had just climbed into the ring: The auditorium erupted in jeers, hoots and boos. And back in September, a crowd waiting on Fifth Avenue to see Pope Francis roll by discovered that Mr. Trump was watching from an upper floor of Trump Tower. There were boos aplenty, according to reporters on the scene. Mr. Trump has never run for office in New York City, and with good reason. Mr. Trump\u2019s values are about one person. The city is just a prop, like the campaign and everything else.It is just another week at the office when some politician uses New York as a straw man for his or her dumb prejudices. Things have reached a far greater level of injury, however, when the likes of Donald Trump are anointed the standard-bearer of our tribe.The About New York column on Friday, about Senator Ted Cruz\u2019s comment that Donald J. Trump embodied New York values, referred incompletely to the source of $1 million in loans to Mr. Cruz\u2019s successful 2012 Senate campaign. The money included loans from both Goldman Sachs and Citibank, not just from Goldman Sachs.Susan C. Beachy and Kitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}

Retreat!\u201dMs. Pistell was leading a lesson on organisms, and the students, who at the beginning of class had answered \u201cstomach\u201d and \u201cheart\u201d when asked what an organism was, now knew, with hints from her, that an organism is any living thing.\u2014 to use dance, theater, visual arts and music to teach academic subjects,\u2014 to provide training for teachers to learn how to integrate arts into their academic lessons,\u2014 and to fund student visits to museums, concert halls and theaters.While it is valuable to have proof that integrating the arts into academic lessons improves student learning, the superintendent of Hartford\u2019s school district, Beth Schiavino-Narvaez, said the arts in and of themselves are essential to education.\u201cWhen we learn things in the real world, subjects aren\u2019t compartmentalized,\u201d Dr. Schiavino-Narvaez said. \u201cHartford is so rich in arts resources. It is the first and most important thing about this partnership. It gives our children access to these critical resources that exist in the community.\u201dAs part of Hartford Performs, all students in the second, fourth, sixth and eighth grades visit arts venues that fit curriculum goals, with second graders observing dance, fourth graders hearing live music, sixth graders observing the visual arts and eighth graders watching theater.\u201cHartford Performs builds a reservoir of experiences from which to draw as they make their way through the curricula, and I think that\u2019s huge,\u201d Ms. Kane said.Another major part of the program involves vetting teaching artists and ensuring that their lessons align with the Common Core, a set of nationally recognized academic standards, as well as training artists to teach a diverse classroom of students.Classroom teachers choose from a menu of lessons such as Songs That Count for preschoolers and kindergartners; Edible Fractions, which uses pizza to teach fractions to third graders; Music and Cultures of the Americas, for fifth graders to learn social studies lessons; Personal Mandala, where middle schoolers learn English and math through the visual arts; and Dance and Step, which teaches math concepts through dance and music. Students learn from poets, quilters, actors, directors, visual artists, cartoonists, musicians, dancers, puppeteers and storytellers.Hartford Performs also seeks racially and culturally diverse instructors and lessons, so that students not only see teachers who look like them, but also can imagine their own potential as artists.\u201cThey don\u2019t just read about other cultures. They watch the dancers and musicians from those cultures,\u201d said Rie Poirier-Campbell, the executive director of Hartford Performs. \u201cYou\u2019ve got kids dancing around like molecules so they can feel what a molecule is like. They feel through their bodies the scientific principles they\u2019re studying.\u201dA key part of the partnership is helping teachers to incorporate the arts into their lesson plans.\u201cMost people don\u2019t consider themselves artists, teachers included,\u201d Ms. Poirier-Campbell said. \u201cIt probably wouldn\u2019t occur to a teacher to use dance or drawing or other art forms in their lessons. We break it down, give them techniques. It gives them an easy way that\u2019s nonthreatening to them.\u201dThis way, students may have the option of showing what they\u2019ve learned through creating a skit or a commercial rather than by writing an essay.She distributed Mr. LeWitt\u2019s instructions to students, and explained how the Connecticut artist wrote out a set of guidelines on how to create similar kinds of art, with varying levels of specificity. Mathematical notions such as horizontal, vertical, parallel, congruent and equidistant appeared in bold print on the instructions.After students colored on graph paper, following Mr. LeWitt\u2019s directions for how to color each of four squares, Ms. Klingher, an artist and former middle school math teacher, compared the students\u2019 finished pieces.\u201cLet\u2019s think about it,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you had two of the boxes but they were across from each other, would it still be the same area covered in yellow?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s four squares; two are colored in yellow. Two out of four is half,\u201d a girl said.Claire Smith, a fifth-grade teacher at Rawson Elementary, said bringing in teaching artists was crucial for students in urban schools.\u201cThey always need to be involved in their learning in a kind of a kinesthetic way,\u201d Ms. Smith said. \u201cAnd to hear different perspectives and to understand there are lots of ways to be smart, and how valuable art and music are to kids in finding a voice.\u201d\u201cTo me, the way kids end up in gangs is they don\u2019t have a voice,\u201d she added. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a way to say, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m important.

{"Headline": "U.S. Will Track Secret Buyers of Luxury Real Estate", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported byIt is the first time the federal government has required real estate companies to disclose names behind cash transactions, and it is likely to send shudders through the real estate industry, which has benefited enormously in recent years from a building boom increasingly dependent on wealthy, secretive buyers.The initiative is part of a broader federal effort to increase the focus on money laundering in real estate. Treasury and federal law enforcement officials said they were putting greater resources into investigating luxury real estate sales that involve shell companies like limited liability companies, often known as L.L.C.s; partnerships; and other entities.Future investigations, they said, will focus increasingly on professionals who assist in money laundering, including real estate agents, lawyers, bankers and L.L.C. formation agents.The use of shell companies in real estate is legal, and L.L.C.s have a range of uses unrelated to secrecy. But a top Treasury official, Jennifer Shasky Calvery, said her agency had seen instances in which multimillion-dollar homes were being used as safe deposit boxes for ill-gotten gains, in transactions made more opaque by the use of anonymous shell companies.\u201cWe are concerned about the possibility that dirty money is being put into luxury real estate,\u201d said Ms. Calvery, the director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the Treasury unit running the initiative. \u201cWe think some of the bigger risk is around the least transparent transactions.\u201dThe department will focus on sales that are both paid for all in cash and conducted using shell companies.The government is requiring title insurance companies, which are involved in virtually all sales, to discover the identities of buyers and submit the information to the Treasury.The government will put the information into a database for law enforcement.The Treasury\u2019s program will affect billions of dollars in real estate transactions.In addition to starting in only two markets, the requirement runs from March through August. If Treasury officials find that many sales involved suspicious money, Ms. Calvery said, they will develop permanent reporting requirements across the country.A senior Federal Bureau of Investigation official, Patrick Fallon, said the anonymity possible under existing shell companies had stymied investigations and the Treasury initiative would help trace illicit money.\u201cWe fully intend to encourage expansion of it, so, not only to different geographic areas but as far as the time frame as well,\u201d said Mr. Fallon, chief of the bureau\u2019s financial crimes section. \u201cWe think it\u2019ll prove its worth.\u201dMs. Calvery said the findings helped convince the Treasury that more scrutiny of high-end buyers is needed. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to talk about it with people who aren\u2019t specialists in our area when they read about it in the newspaper,\u201d she said.Real estate is becoming a larger target for law enforcement as well. According to two people with knowledge of cases at the Justice Department, lawyers there have begun to shape cases directly around money laundering in real estate deals rather than adding such transactions to other cases.The F.B.I. has in recent months created a new unit to focus on money laundering, and real estate will be one main focus. The unit, which has 10 agents, will help the Justice Department delve into shell companies and the people involved in money laundering, F.B.I. officials said.\u201cWe\u2019re going after the facilitators of the money laundering,\u201d Mr. Fallon, of the F.B.I., said. \u201cThey\u2019re the bankers, they\u2019re the accountants, lawyers, folks who are setting up L.L.C.s, they are setting up foundations, folks who are setting up nonprofits, real estate investment trusts, etc.\u201dThe new scrutiny is likely to increase headaches for the real estate industry, in part because shell companies are not easy to penetrate. Buyers often mask their identities by layering companies on top of other shell companies. Buyers also commonly fill out L.L.C. formation papers using the names of lawyers or other place holders, often called \u201cnominees,\u201d instead of their own names.The Treasury is looking for the actual owners behind shell companies, often referred to as the beneficial owners. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking for nominees,\u201d Ms. Calvery said.In its order, the Treasury defined beneficial owners as \u201ceach individual who, directly or indirectly, owns 25 percent or more of the equity interests\u201d of the entity that bought the property. Once title companies identify those people, they are required to copy driver\u2019s licenses or passports and also pass the individuals\u2019 names to the Treasury Department.Stephen Hudak, a spokesman for the Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, said any title companies or purchasers who provided false information could face penalties. The American Land Title Association said in a statement that it would help its members comply with the Treasury\u2019s new naming requirements.\u201cRepeated anecdotal information where we see criminals of different stripes putting money into real estate all suggest to us that this is an area we need to pay attention to,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sarah Palin Endorses Donald Trump, Which Could Bolster Him in Iowa", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported by\u201cAre you ready for the leader to make America great again?\u201d Mrs. Palin said with Mr. Trump by her side at a rally at Iowa State University. \u201cAre you ready to stump for Trump? I\u2019m here to support the next president of the United States \u2014 Donald Trump.\u201dHer support is the highest-profile backing for a Republican so far. It came the same day that Iowa\u2019s Republican governor, Terry Branstad, said he hoped that Senator Ted Cruz would be defeated in Iowa. The Feb. 1 caucuses are a must-win for the Texas senator, who is running neck-and-neck with Mr. Trump in state polls.The endorsement came as Mr. Trump was bearing down in the state, holding multiple campaign events and raising expectations about his performance in the nation\u2019s first nominating contest.As Mrs. Palin announced her backing, Mr. Trump stood wearing a satisfied smile as she scolded mainstream Republicans as sellouts and praised how Mr. Trump had shaken up the party. \u201cHe\u2019s been going rogue left and right,\u201d Mrs. Palin said of Mr. Trump, using one of her signature phrases. \u201cThat\u2019s why he\u2019s doing so well. He\u2019s been able to tear the veil off this idea of the system.\u201dIt is not clear that Mrs. Palin\u2019s blessing will have a major impact on Mr. Trump\u2019s long-term prospects. But in Iowa, where Mrs. Palin spent years developing a network of supporters, it could be helpful. Mr. Trump has faced questions about whether his campaign\u2019s organizing muscle can draw the voters to match his poll numbers come caucus night.Other conservatives said that Mrs. Palin serves as a particularly effective shield against Mr. Cruz, who has assiduously courted Iowa\u2019s evangelical voters.\u201cPalin\u2019s brand among evangelicals is as gold as the faucets in Trump Tower,\u201d said Ralph Reed, the chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition.\u201cEndorsements alone don\u2019t guarantee victory, but Palin\u2019s embrace of Trump may turn the fight over the evangelical vote into a war for the soul of the party,\u201d he said.Mrs. Palin could amplify the news media-circus aspects of Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy: She too is a reality television star accustomed to playing to the cameras and often accused of emphasizing flash over substance.And while Mr. Trump has already shown the ability to garner wall-to-wall cable-news coverage, Mrs. Palin\u2019s involvement in his campaign could help him deprive Mr. Cruz of attention in the homestretch to the caucuses.As rumors circulated that the endorsement was about to happen, Mr. Cruz offered praise for his former political ally after an aide to the senator mocked the pending endorsement earlier Tuesday. \u201cI love Sarah Palin,\u201d the senator told reporters in New Hampshire. \u201cSarah Palin is fantastic. Without her friendship and support, I wouldn\u2019t be in the Senate today. So regardless of what Sarah decides to do in 2016, I will always remain a big, big fan of Sarah Palin.\u201dAs word of Mrs. Palin\u2019s endorsement trickled through the Hansen Agriculture Student Learning Center at Iowa State University, the reaction from supporters of Mr. Trump who braved snow and frigid temperatures to see the candidate was mixed. Backers of Mr. Trump filled a warehouse-style building with a dirt floor that is sometimes used for tractor shows, but most said that it was the candidate that they cared about, not his new endorsement.\u201cI\u2019m not here to see her,\u201d said Rich Hoffmann, 41, of Ankeny. \u201cSome people it will matter to, but it doesn\u2019t to me.\u201dAnd like Mr. Trump, Mrs. Palin has maverick tendencies. The mantra of her final weeks of the 2008 campaign was \u201cgoing rogue,\u201d as she defied instructions from aides to Senator John McCain of Arizona, the party\u2019s presidential nominee.Little-known before Mr. McCain picked her as his running mate, Mrs. Palin ultimately eclipsed him in popularity and polls show her maintaining strong support among Republicans. She has endured as a coveted endorser with an impressive fund-raising list. After the loss in 2008, she declined to finish her term in Alaska, and went on to become a television star and a Fox News commentator.The endorsement of Mr. Trump puts Mrs. Palin back in the center of the media maelstrom, and allows her to rehabilitate her political image, which had diminished in the last year as her contract with Fox News ended.Mrs. Palin endorsed several of Mr. Trump\u2019s Republican rivals in their statewide races, including Mr. Cruz during his Senate bid in Texas and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky. Mr. Cruz, after his 2012 primary victory over the incumbent lieutenant governor, David Dewhurst, said he would not have made it to the Senate without Mrs. Palin\u2019s backing.For Mr. Trump, who is trying to accrue other endorsements in the coming weeks, the backing of high-profile Republicans could dent the outsider-to-politics aura that has been elemental to his success in the polls before the voting has begun. But the support of Mrs. Palin, a darling of the Tea Party insurgency, could help inoculate him from such attacks.The endorsement comes as Mr. Cruz is facing increasing scrutiny in Iowa for his opposition to federal ethanol mandates, highlighted by the criticism from Governor Branstad, whose son works for a group promoting ethanol, the corn-based fuel that is a crucial Iowa industry.\u201cTed Cruz is ahead right now. What we\u2019re trying to do is educate the people in the state of Iowa,\u201d Mr. Branstad told reporters at the Renewable Fuels Summit in Altoona. \u201cHe is the biggest opponent of renewable fuels. He actually introduced a bill in 2013 to immediately eliminate the Renewable Fuel Standard.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s heavily financed by Big Oil,\u201d the governor added. \u201cI think it would be a big mistake for Iowa to support him.\u201dThe remark was highly unusual for Mr. Branstad, an establishment Republican who nonetheless has stayed out of his party\u2019s presidential primaries in the past.Alan Rappeport reported from Ames, and Maggie Haberman from New York.

{"Headline": "Freeport-McMoRan Battles the Oil Slump", "Date": "2016-01-21", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseWhen some investors questioned the rationale and ethics of the deal, Mr. Moffett highlighted his own management skills with characteristic bravado. \u201cI don\u2019t want to pat us on the back, but we\u2019ve got extraordinary capabilities,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cWe found the biggest gold and copper mine in the world, and I\u2019ve said it three or four times, but I got the right to say it. Joe Namath said it isn\u2019t bragging if you can do it.\u201dOver the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.The deal now looks like a major blunder. In December 2010, Freeport\u2019s stock peaked at over $60 a share. This week it dropped below $4.\u201cThe stock is trading like they\u2019re going to file for bankruptcy,\u201d said Paul Massoud, a mining analyst with Stifel Nicolaus who downgraded Freeport shares in August 2014.Freeport is hardly alone in getting battered by plummeting commodities prices. Banks\u2019 earnings this month have taken a hit as they have marked down the value of their loans to energy companies. Many of the world\u2019s largest commodities producers, including oil-rich countries like Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, or corporate behemoths like the Swiss company Glencore, are suffering after borrowing large sums of money at ultralow interest rates during the commodities boom.In previous price slumps, commodities producers cut back. But this time, many have continued to flood the market with oil and copper even at depressed prices, confounding many economists. One explanation is that they need to generate the cash to meet debt obligations. In its last quarter, Freeport actually increased its oil production and barely cut back on copper despite falling prices.Now, Freeport, which is based in Phoenix, needs to reduce its heavy debt burden, which at more than $20 billion is more than four times the company\u2019s current market value of $4.8 billion. Once an aggressive bidder for trophy assets, it now finds itself in the position of a desperate seller. It\u2019s also cutting jobs and slashing capital spending, the lifeblood of any mining company.For its most recent quarter, Freeport reported a quarterly loss of $3.8 billion, bringing its loss for the first nine months of its fiscal year to $8.2 billion, mostly because of write-downs in the value of its oil and gas assets.When it last announced earnings in October, Freeport said its 2016 projections were based on an average oil price of $56 a barrel. This week oil dropped below $27 a barrel, though it rallied on Thursday. So expectations for Freeport\u2019s latest quarter and full year results, which will be announced next week, are grim. (A Freeport spokesman said the company couldn\u2019t comment because of the impending earnings release.)Freeport \u201cis getting hit by everything,\u201d said Anthony Young, a mining analyst at the Macquarie Group. \u201cIt\u2019s the fall in copper prices and metals, the plunge in oil and natural gas, and the amount of debt on the balance sheet. It\u2019s going to take some pretty dramatic steps by management to right this ship.\u201dStill, however much Freeport is being battered by market forces beyond its control, it\u2019s hard to feel too bad for the company\u2019s management and shareholders, given how many of its woes seem self-inflicted during a woeful lapse in corporate governance standards.A glut of crude oil on the markets is pushing the price of oil down to levels not seen since the global financial crisis.As a pure mining company that had endured over a century of commodity booms and busts, Freeport had long shunned debt and never acted as if it expected good times to last indefinitely \u2014 time-honored notions that Mr. Moffett and his allies appear to have discarded when they pushed into oil and gas. Investors \u201cloved this company for so long because they never took on much debt and never hedged,\u201d Mr. Massoud said. \u201cThey were a pure proxy for commodities. No matter the price, they\u2019d survive.\u201dMany Freeport investors were furious over the company\u2019s audacious debt-financed move into oil and gas. As Evy Hambro, chief investment officer for BlackRock\u2019s natural resources team, said in the company\u2019s investor call to discuss the deal: \u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything on this call that in any way justifies why these companies should be put together, and I find it incredibly disappointing that as a management team, you\u2019ve chosen to break the trust with investors from what the business was that we chose to invest in.\u201dThe deal was all the more troubling given that it was rife with conflicts of interest. At the time, Mr. Moffett was McMoRan\u2019s chief executive while also serving as Freeport\u2019s chairman. (The \u201cMo\u201d in the company\u2019s name stands for Moffett.)Freeport\u2019s chief executive, Richard Adkerson, was McMoRan\u2019s co-chairman. Nine Freeport directors owned stock in McMoRan totaling about 6 percent of the shares. Freeport agreed to buy McMoRan for $2.1 billion \u2014 a 74 percent premium over its market price before the deal was struck. Mr. Moffett himself was paid $73 million.Moreover, Plains owned 31 percent of McMoRan, enough to block any deal. Freeport eliminated that possibility when it bought Plains. And James Flores, Plains\u2019s chief executive, who now runs Freeport\u2019s oil and gas operations, was also a director of McMoRan. He made $200 million on the deal.\u201cWould it be possible to find out if anybody on the call from your side is not conflicted?\u201d Mr. Hambro asked pointedly during the conference call.Freeport officials denied any wrongdoing and justified the deal by saying that committees of independent directors at all the companies approved the transactions. Last year it agreed to pay $137.5 million to resolve shareholder lawsuits over conflicts of interest related to the deal. (All costs to the individual executives were covered by directors\u2019 liability insurance, the company said.)Even now, Mr. Moffett hasn\u2019t exactly been sent packing. He received a severance package valued at $79.4 million, according to company filings. He keeps the title of chairman emeritus and will be paid $1.5 million a year as a consultant. Mr. Adkerson remains Freeport\u2019s chief executive.There\u2019s no easy way out for Freeport. The company earlier said it would explore selling all or part of its oil and gas assets, but given current market conditions, any sale would be at fire sale prices. With its stock so depressed, it doesn\u2019t make sense to raise more money in the equity markets, and it would be hard pressed to borrow more, either from banks or in the debt market (where some of its bonds are already trading at distressed levels).Freeport still owns what Mr. Moffett called its \u201ctrove of treasures\u201d \u2014 the Grasberg gold and copper operations in Indonesia; the Morenci copper mine in Arizona; and majority stakes in the Cerro Verde copper mine in Peru and Tenke Fungurume, the largest copper mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Freeport recently valued its interest in Grasberg alone at $16.2 billion.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of concern about the company\u2019s long-term solvency,\u201d Mr. Young of Macquarie said. \u201cBut they do have some valuable assets that could alleviate the pressure.\u201d He said investors were anxiously waiting to see what strategy the company unveils next week.Freeport\u2019s salvation may come from a rally in the commodities markets. But just as prices looked as if they would never go down during the commodities boom, they now look as if they won\u2019t go up substantially any time soon. \u201cUnfortunately for them, if you extend these low commodity prices indefinitely,\u201d the Stifel analyst Mr. Massoud said, \u201cthere\u2019s zero equity value there.\u201dThe Common Sense column on Friday, about the mining company Freeport McMoRan\u2019s ill-timed move into the oil and gas industry, misstated, in some editions, when Paul Massoud, a mining analyst, downgraded the company\u2019s shares. It was August 2014, not last August.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Archaeologists in England Tackle Mystery of Prehistoric Village\u2019s Rapid Demise", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Supported byWhittlesey JournalWHITTLESEY, England \u2014 No one knows why a catastrophic fire tore through the small settlement that rose by a river channel, incinerating the homes of several families and sending burning timbers crashing into the marsh below. It might have been an accident, an attack by enemies or even some sort of ritual.Yet answers are emerging, piece by piece, some 3,000 years later.The Must Farm archaeological site here in Cambridgeshire is considered so rich that it has been compared to Pompeii, the Roman town buried by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79.But its treasures beckon. From the soggy earth, a charred wooden bowl and a ceramic vessel protruded last week, close to the backbone of a cow, presumably butchered for meat. A few feet away, the unmistakable shape of a human skull jutted from the murky sediment in which it had been encased since the Bronze Age.\u201cThe Pompeii analogy that keeps being talked about with this site is true, and it\u2019s also false,\u201d said Mark Knight, the site director. \u201cThere is no volcano in this landscape; this wasn\u2019t some natural disaster. But an event, like a big fire, basically caught their everyday life, dropped it into our channel and sealed it there for us to excavate.\u201d\u201cThis doesn\u2019t feel like archaeology,\u201d he said, \u201cthis feels intrusive. We have sort of turned up after some tragedy, and we are able to pick through the remains, and get some indication of what was going on in this settlement 3,000 years ago.\u201dIn that way the excavation seems as much a modern-day crime scene investigation as an exploration of prehistory. Among those working here is a fire forensics expert, who hopes to determine where the flames started and how they spread.The fire swept through at least two round houses, which were built on wooden stilts above a channel connected to the River Nene, and which were bordered by some sort of perimeter.Like any good detective story, clues advance the narrative: a bowl, complete with wooden spoon and an unfinished meal \u2014 a discovery that suggests that whoever lived here left in a hurry. The skull indicates that perhaps not everyone was quick enough.While many archaeological discoveries depend on luck, this one has benefited from several strokes of good fortune.The site was uncovered thanks to the work of Must Farm quarry, run by a construction company called Forterra which, along with Historic England, a government heritage organization, is financing the excavation. Perhaps only such a large quarrying operation could have removed so much earth across such a wide space and to such a depth, thereby exposing the prehistoric timbers.The timbers and the items that have been unearthed were preserved by the silt and the water levels in the soil, according to Selina Davenport, a field archaeologist.The way the wooden posts fell should also make it possible to reconstruct what the structures looked like before the fire broke out, sometime between 920 and 800 B.C.While some posts stand vertically, many lie in eerie, geometric lines just as they fell 3,000 years ago \u2014 charred evidence both of the sophistication of this settlement and of the devastation of the blaze that destroyed it.Archaeologists have known about the site for some time and had debated what to do with it for more than a decade. Finally, a decision was made to excavate and remove the artifacts because of worries that they would deteriorate.That has left a huge but exciting task for those digging in freezing temperatures under temporary cover. A team of about a dozen has been working since September and the project is due to finish in April, though that deadline looks ambitious.For archaeologists, who usually work on smaller, more limited projects, the prospect of gaining a unique snapshot of everyday life in the Bronze Age presents a palpable thrill.\u201cIt\u2019s an amazing window to the other side,\u201d said Iona Robinson, a project supervisor and researcher at the Cambridge Archaeological Unit. \u201cWe deal with shadows normally, we deal with absences, we are so used to working with 50 percent of the evidence and now \u2014 here \u2014 we have this fantastic window into the full picture.\u201dDuring the Bronze Age, in this boggy environment, waterways formed the only reliable means of transport and communication (nine ancient log boats were discovered near here in 2011), so the site may have been at a sort of crossroads. It may, in fact, be typical of other settlements, still undiscovered, beneath the English fenlands.From the items recovered so far, it seems that the men and women who lived here were at the high end of their society and established themselves above the waterway because of trade or other opportunities it afforded. That suggests this was a bustling nexus of their world, rather than an outpost at its margins.The community here had much that was available in prehistoric Britain: textiles, ceramics, spears and a beautifully crafted, sickle-shaped chopping tool. Beads from Central Europe have been found, as well as pots like those in northern France and swords similar to those from northern Spain.All of which makes the question of how this community met its dramatic end all the more intriguing. One possibility is an accidental fire. Another is that it was deliberately destroyed by its occupants, either as a ritual act, or because the structures had served their purpose and were falling apart. However, the fact that so many possessions were left argues against this.The third possibility is an attack by hostile neighbors, and the skull is the first sign, Mr. Knight said, that people may have died violently here.He cautions that Bronze Age Britons sometime kept the skulls of their ancestors, so it is possible that this was a relic. But digging will soon show whether it is attached to a skeleton.That thought might conjure images of Pompeii, and the way the last, desperate moments of its residents were preserved, but Must Farm was never destined to become a permanent archaeological site.Indeed, solving the mystery of what happened is a race against time, and there is only one chance to get it right.It is perhaps fitting that Must Farm resembles a construction site, because once the artifacts have been removed, the excavation will be filled with soil and broken brick, and the setting of this mysterious and very old settlement will become a roadway.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Republican Party\u2019s 50-State Solution", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported bySince the early 1970s, the right has conducted a sustained drive to gain power and set policy in the 50 states. The left, by contrast, has been far less effective at the state-level.The sustained determination on the part of the conservative movement has paid off in an unprecedented realignment of power in state governments.Sweeping Republican victories at the state level in 2010 and 2014 transformed the political landscape.What drove the right to invest so heavily at the state and local level, while the left fell behind?\u201cThe civil rights movement taught the left the lesson that one could win in \u2018one fell swoop\u2019 by going for national level changes,\u201d Frank Baumgartner, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina, wrote me in an email. Baumgartner\u2019s view was echoed by a number of other scholars I contacted.\u201cIt comes purely from a strategic political calculus,\u201d according to Thad Kousser, a professor of political science at the University of California, San Diego:The federal government has become more progressive over its history in the case of slavery, the New Deal, the civil rights advances from 1957-1965, and the environmental regulations of the 1970s. When you lose battles at the national level but still hold sway in many states, taking a stand for states\u2019 rights becomes the rational thing to do.\u201cWhat\u2019s changed seems to be the result of the relatively recent nationalization of state campaign financing,\u201d Morgan Kousser, a professor of history at Caltech (and, as it happens, Thad Kousser\u2019s father), wrote in an email:The Koch brothers understand the importance of controlling state legislatures; George Soros doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m not sure why this should be the case, but since we\u2019re really talking about a relatively small number of mega-donors who have caused this, it\u2019s a rather restricted question.have for a long time got perpetually distracted by fads and short-term metrics, whereas conservative foundations were willing to invest much more in long-term organizational capacity.Liberals, according to Hertel-Fernandez, a graduate student at Harvard, and Skocpol, a professor of government and sociology there, \u201chave left behind little more than a litany of abandoned acronyms.\u201dThe authors provide several examples of such failures: The National Conference on Alternative State and Local Policies \u201cfaded and by the 1980s, CASLP\u2019s founder had moved on to other projects.\u201d The Center for Policy Alternatives \u201cclosed its doors in 2008.\u201d The Progressive States Network \u201cnever reached the levels attained by\u201d its conservative counterparts. They go on to note that left initiatives have lost tractionas liberal funders switch to a nascent competitor. In many ways, the funding problem has gotten worse now that unions are struggling with declining dues-paying memberships and adverse legal decisions that threaten their very existence.Why do trends at the local level contrast with trends at the national level, where Democrats have made substantial gains in the competition for political money?Away from the national level, the commitment of conservative donors to support a power shift in state government illustrates the determination of the right to eliminate regulatory and legal constraints on markets where their money has proven most productive.The states, it turns out, are more receptive to the drive of the Koch Companies and their corporate allies to protect their business interests.Wealthy liberal donors, on the other hand, are driven by ideological convictions that can be volatile and vulnerable, as Hertel-Fernandez and Skocpol put it, \u201cto shifting donor fashions.\u201dIn addition, investing in such national liberal causes as refugee resettlement, climate change, gay marriage, and voting rights has the appeal of participation on a high visibility issue \u2014 with the likelihood of public acclaim. Investing in state organizations provides far fewer public rewards.The willingness of conservatives to weather difficulty and to endure prolonged delay has been demonstrated repeatedly over the past decades.The total investment of the right in state and local organizations now reaches well into the hundreds of millions.An examination of IRS reports from all of these conservative groups shows total spending in just one year, 2013, of $142.2 million, with the Texas Public Policy Foundation\u2019s $8.9 million the largest expenditure.The State Policy Network\u2019s single year total of $142.2 million is dwarfed by the network of foundations financed by Charles and David Koch and allied donors, individual and corporate.Conservatives have some inherent advantages in building a state and local infrastructure.structure of community-based cultural, religious, social organizations \u2014 churches, Elks, veterans halls, gun groups, local business organizations, etc. \u2014 that are gathering places with offices, meeting halls, phones and computers that can be used by activist troops for logistical and operational support.Stein, who has worked in the field for decades, said that the result for conservatives is thatyour volunteers and paid activists come out of a values-based institution, which is essentially not a political institution. People are there because of their values. If you come to politics from a club or church or veterans hall, it reinforces the stickiness of your work, your willingness to keep at it even if you are tired.By comparison, Stein argued, \u201cprogressives don\u2019t have these community based, indigenous resources to educate, organize and mobilize troops anymore.\u201d With the exception of unions, \u201cwe have fewer local places to gather and belong.\u201dDespite the investment, the Democratic nominee, John Kerry, lost. At that point, the liberal donor community came to general agreement that the left needed a secure a permanent infrastructure at the national level to compete with such conservative institutions as the Chamber of Commerce, the American Enterprise Institute, Americans for Tax Reform and Heritage.A year later, Democracy Alliance established its goal of building a \u201cprogressive infrastructure that could help counter the well-funded and sophisticated conservative apparatus in the areas of civic engagement, leadership, media, and ideas.\u201dLast year, the alliance initiated a program to direct a portion of members\u2019 contributions to state and local groups. I emailed Gara LaMarche, the president of the alliance, to ask how reliable alliance members are in continuing their support of relatively low-visibility state organizations. His answer:By our best accounting, at the end of last year DA Partners gave about $15 million to these funds, on top of the almost $60 million they committed to the other DA Portfolio groups.LaMarche described the response as encouraging, noting that the alliance aims \u201cto at least double the contributions to the funds in 2016.\u201dLaMarche voiced some confidence that \u201cDA donors will stay the course.\u201d He acknowledged thatour Partners don\u2019t have the bottom line personal or corporate financial interest that fuels a good deal of the right\u2019s giving, but I believe they increasingly get the importance and urgency of the state-level work, where the right has made such gains \u2014 with such damage to the progressive agenda \u2014 in recent years.During our conversation, Stein, who had helped start the organization, raised some doubts:It has begun to appear that the twenty-first century progressive brain is not as interested in clubs, communities and cultural sharing as the conservative brain is.How, Stein asked, \u201ccould we have lost that? How does a communitarian world view lose its communitarian sense of self?\u201dThe short answer to Stein\u2019s question may be that the nature of political liberalism has changed.The liberalism of the 1930s and 1940s was shaped by the Great Depression, and the response was, in many respects, communitarian: the strengthening of unions, the provision of jobs and government benefits to the poor and unemployed and the creation of a safety net to provide a modicum of security.Instead of communitarian principles, the contemporary progressive movement \u2014 despite its advocacy of local issues like community policing \u2014 has produced a counterpart to conservative advocacy of free markets: the advocacy of personal freedom.Insofar as liberals continue to leave the state-level organization to conservatives, they are conceding the most productive policy arenas in the country.Advertisement"}

At least one has met the emperor.The idols churned out by Ms. Kano, 55, are mascots \u2014 the smiling, dancing animals, mutated foodstuffs and saucer-eyed humanoids that promote every conceivable thing in Japan, from out-of-the-way tourist spots to careers in the military.Ms. Kano is a costume maker, though no one in her industry would describe the job so bluntly.\u201cWe have a motto, which is that there\u2019s no human inside,\u201d said Ms. Kano, a mother of two with a warm smile who oversees the workshop and its roughly 40 employees, almost all women.Whimsical mascots have become almost as closely associated with Japan as Mount Fuji and sushi. Popular for decades, they have become a virtual obsession in recent years, and seemingly every town, business and arm of government now has one.So ubiquitous are mascots that last year, Japan\u2019s Finance Ministry suggested that public agencies think twice before creating more, fearing that taxpayer money was being wasted. Osaka Prefecture alone was found to be supporting 92 of them, including two different dogs for separate tax departments and a caped, flying hot-water bottle representing pharmaceutical regulation. The governor ordered a cull.Ms. Kano said business was still booming, though.\u201cJapanese people have this desire to take the sharp edges off things, to take hard things and make them soft,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you want to explain, say, industrial waste, adding a character softens the message and helps it get through to people.\u201dMs. Kano\u2019s biggest claim to fame is creating the wearable version of Kumamon, a red-cheeked bear that has become one of the most popular fantasy creatures in Japan.The mascot for rural Kumamoto Prefecture, Kumamon won a nationwide popularity contest in 2011. His image adorns bags, T-shirts, key chains, plastic chopsticks, liquor bottles and countless other items. According to the local branch of the Japanese central bank, which studied Kumamon\u2019s economic impact, the bear earned Kumamoto 124 billion yen, or about $1 billion, in tourism and merchandising revenue in the two years after the contest win.Success stories like Kumamoto\u2019s have kept the mascot addiction going.\u201cThe toughest cases are when clients come in and say, \u2018Just make ours like Kumamon,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms. Kano said. \u201cI try to tell them that it\u2019s not enough to have a cute character. You have to think about how to use it to engage people.\u201dShe added, \u201cIt\u2019s sad when a government agency orders a mascot, and it ends up sitting in a box.\u201dMS. KANO was born in Miyazaki, a rural area on Japan\u2019s southwestern Kyushu island known for golf courses and citrus farming. (Official mascots: three dogs, one of which is in turn dressed as a chicken \u2014 a mascot playing a mascot.)She says she did not set out to create a cuteness empire. After a stint in New York in her early 20s, where she worked for a travel agency, she returned to Miyazaki to marry, but she later divorced. She moved to Tokyo with her children and then to rural Fukushima Prefecture, before going back to Miyazaki after she met her current husband, a designer of theater sets and commercial displays.\u201cWhen we got our first orders for mascots, we made them ourselves, by trial and error,\u201d she recalled. Demand for flashy trade-show displays and other large, expensive items dried up as Japan\u2019s economy stagnated. \u201cEventually, mascots were all that was left.\u201d Today, the company produces 20 to 25 costumes a month. International orders are growing: It has done Malaysian cartoon characters and a cuddly bear for Feiler, a German linen maker. An Italian fashion brand recently ordered a pair of mascots \u2014 design \u201ctop secret, but very edgy,\u201d Ms. Kano said \u2014 for a promotional event in the upscale Ginza shopping district in Tokyo.\u201cForeign companies are starting to understand that you need a cute mascot to sell anything to Japanese people,\u201d she said.RECENTLY, some of Ms. Kano\u2019s creations gathered in Hanyu, a semirural Tokyo suburb that hosts an annual two-day mascot fair, now in its sixth year, which draws about 40,000 visitors.Naomi Meguro, 37, and Tomoko Miyakawa, 40, wore ramen-bowl hats as they waited in a long line for photographs with Sanomaru. They described themselves as \u201ckyara-tomo,\u201d or \u201ccharacter friends,\u201d who met online through a shared love of mascots. Their favorites are in constant virtual contact.\u201cThey post photographs and messages like \u2018Good morning\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m coming down with a cold,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms. Meguro said. \u201cThey\u2019re more than just stuffed toys.\u201dChildren and adults alike embraced and stroked their favorite characters and shook hands with them. Ms. Kano said she believed one reason for mascots\u2019 popularity was that they provided an outlet for physical contact and gushing expressions of affection in an otherwise reserved society.\u201cJapanese people don\u2019t really hug, even husbands and wives,\u201d she said. \u201cI would never hug my employees, but as soon as they put on a mascot suit, I want to cuddle them.\u201dStill, Ms. Kano says she often wonders how long Japan\u2019s mascot obsession can go on. \u201cThere are times when even I think, \u2018Really? Is this necessary?\u2019\u00a0\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Legislative Session Opens in Albany With Eye on Ethics", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byALBANY \u2014 The opening of New York State\u2019s 239th legislative session looked and sounded very much as it has in years gone by, what with its ceremonial prayers, promises of hard work and bipartisan cooperation, and all manner of handshakes, hugs and how-ya-beens.\u201cThe time is up,\u201d said State Senator Liz Krueger, a Manhattan Democrat. \u201cBoth leaders have been taken out of here and are going to jail. We have to take action.\u201dThat sentiment has been echoed in recent days by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat who promised as recently as Tuesday that his agenda for 2016 would include a \u201cvery aggressive ethics proposal,\u201d despite his previous assertions that little could be done legislatively to solve venal behavior by lawmakers determined to break the law.Of course, ethics laws have been passed before, including a series of modest changes made last year, but on Wednesday several good-government groups were expressing new hope \u2014 and employing new strategies \u2014 for the 2016 session.Their proposals include asking legislators to abide by what some of the groups called the Clear Conscience Pledge, a written commitment to increase transparency, limit outside income and close the L.L.C. loophole.If lawmakers were in need of a reminder of the need for reform, it came in Manhattan on Wednesday, as Judge Valerie E. Caproni of Federal District Court, who presided in Mr. Silver\u2019s case, set a sentencing date of April 13. Mr. Skelos and his son, Adam, are to be sentenced on March 3.In the Democratic-dominated Assembly, Speaker Carl E. Heastie of the Bronx devoted an early section of his opening remarks to possible anticorruption measures.\u201cThis Assembly is serious about ethics reform,\u201d Mr. Heastie said, adding, \u201cWe know that words are simply not enough.\u201dIn the Senate, John J. Flanagan, the Long Island Republican who leads the majority in that chamber, saved his comments for the end of his speech, noting other \u201cpositive steps\u201d on ethics, and saying merely that the Republicans would engage in \u201cwhatever discussions are necessary.\u201dIndeed, the divided Legislature has proved to be a barrier to some action on ethics in the past. But the political power of ethics as an electoral issue will also be an undercurrent in 2016: The Republicans currently hold the slimmest of majorities in the 63-seat Senate, with 31 seats and the help of Simcha Felder, a Brooklyn Democrat who caucuses with the Republicans.But on Wednesday, the chairman of the state Republican Party, Edward F. Cox, expressed confidence that the Republicans would hold their majority, and he unleashed a barrage of criticism of the governor\u2019s economic policies and oratorical habits.\u201cFidel Castro would be proud of his style, the way he\u2019s going on,\u201d Mr. Cox told a herd of reporters. \u201cWhen you stand up in front of an audience telling big lies in a loud, booming voice, where you repeat it over and over again, that is exactly what Fidel Castro did.\u201d\u201cIt sounds like everybody is talking about the minimum wage as if we\u2019ve done nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe minimum wage has gone up 75 percent since 2004.\u201dMr. Heastie said the Democratic majority in the Assembly would push for a higher minimum wage, more financing for education, and paid family leave.Mostly, such policy debates were being saved for later in this session, which runs to mid-June. But even invited speakers seemed aware of the shadow hanging over Albany, including Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan of New York, who opened the Senate session with a prayer noting that humans are \u201cweak and short-lived, lacking in comprehension and judgment,\u201d and its elected representatives seemingly desperately in need of a moral primer.\u201cWe need wisdom as we open this legislative session,\u201d the cardinal said. \u201cWisdom to know right from wrong.\u201dBenjamin Weiser contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ad Wars of 2016 Campaign Erupt in a Changing TV Arena", "Date": "2016-01-07", "News": "Supported byOn WMUR, the dominant television station in Manchester, N.H., about 25 percent of commercial time is being eaten up by presidential campaign ads. Already this week, the candidates and their allies have fired off a dozen new commercials, a third of them negative, in Iowa and New Hampshire markets.The ad wars of the 2016 election are at hand.\u201cWe\u2019re getting down to the firing-squad part of the campaign,\u201d said Larry McCarthy, the strategist making ads for Right to Rise, the super PAC supporting Mr. Bush. \u201cIt\u2019s like the end of the Quentin Tarantino movie, where everyone is shooting everyone else.\u201dIt is also a huge bet that television advertisements will remain a crucial, even decisive, political battlefield when signs increasingly suggest otherwise. Candidates and their allies spent nearly $100 million on political advertising last year, including $72 million in Iowa and New Hampshire alone, Kantar Media/CMAG estimated. Much of that was spent by candidates promoting themselves, not attacking their rivals. Yet the biggest spenders reaped only scant improvement in the polls.Now, with three and a half weeks until the Iowa caucuses, presidential campaigns that spent much of 2015 wooing donors and amassing large amounts of money are spending that money hand over fist, feverishly vying to buy time during every popular show from morning to late-night TV. From Sunday to Thursday alone, according to Kantar, candidates and their allies in both parties spent an estimated $5.9 million on television ads \u2014 roughly a third of what was spent in the 2012 Republican race from the beginning of 2011 through the Iowa caucuses. And much more of it now is going toward attempts to take down their rivals.\u201cIf you attack somebody else, their support leaves, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily move to you,\u201d said Tad Devine, the longtime Democratic strategist overseeing ad creation for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. \u201cIt can be a very dangerous maneuver.\u201dFew campaigns dared to risk that blowback effect in 2015, though there was another reason to shy from mudslinging: The likeliest target of negative ads, the front-runner, was Donald J. Trump, who showed himself more than willing to go after those who provoked him, often in humiliating terms.Even now, few Republicans have directly attacked Mr. Trump in television ads. Mr. Bush and Mr. Kasich, the most prominent exceptions, have little to lose, given their standing in the polls.Yet it is Mr. Trump, with his ability to generate perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars of free television time in the form of news coverage, to whom many political ad makers attribute the growing doubts about the power of political advertising.For one thing, the shock value of the average blunt, starkly graphic television commercial is diminished when the news show it interrupts covers an even more shocking pronouncement.\u201cTelevision ads run on TV, and Donald Trump is a TV phenomenon,\u201d said Fred Davis, the Republican strategist making ads for New Day for America, the super PAC supporting Mr. Kasich. \u201cHe would say things that were so much more outrageous than what anyone would ever put in a paid ad.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s presence has also generated previously unheard-of ratings for the Republican presidential debates, turning political coverage into must-see television and giving people who might have been loosely familiar with the campaign a real-time feel for it. As a result, commercials that once offered a prime tool for candidates to inform and persuade are proving less useful at either.\u201cAds might be playing a lot less dominant role than they had in the past, partly because more people are getting their info from debates,\u201d said Mr. McCarthy, of Right to Rise.It has not helped that the crowded field of candidates has been saying many of the same things.In New Hampshire, Right to Rise, New Day for America and America Leads, the super PAC supporting Mr. Christie, combined to spend an estimated $26.4 million in 2015, more than two-thirds of the total spent on television by all Republican candidates and their allies in the state, according to Kantar. Each produced at least one ad focused on terrorism, with fearsome shots of Islamic State terrorists.Smart targeting also requires a campaign to ensure that the right ad reaches the right people \u2014 as Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign indicated it was trying to do by placing its first ad largely on cable channels like ESPN and the Food Network.\u201cThe creative has not caught up with the targeting,\u201d said Ken Goldstein, a professor of politics at the University of San Francisco who tracks advertising. \u201cThe creative has to break through.\u201dAs the battle for supporters grows more intense, though, some campaigns are starting to target their messages more deliberately, and also in ways that stand apart. The Rubio campaign\u2019s newest ad, which will begin running this weekend in Iowa, is a straightforward bid for the evangelical vote: Mr. Rubio speaks directly to the camera about \u201cthe creator,\u201d \u201cJesus Christ\u201d and \u201cGod\u2019s plan.\u201dAs the candidates start to recast both their tactics and their spending in the final weeks before the caucuses, the $100 million spent in 2015 may even start to seem small, Mr. Goldstein said.\u201cIt seems like that was a bunch of money this fall, but that was just the sorbet before the main course,\u201d he said. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t even the appetizer.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Gulf States Guarding Their Interests in Saudi-Iran Rift", "Date": "2016-01-05", "News": "Supported byCAIRO \u2014 For all the diplomatic dominoes that have fallen across the Middle East in recent days, with ambassadors from different countries flying home as a result of the explosive rift between Saudi Arabia and Iran, the map of allegiances has not significantly altered.Certainly, several countries offered muscular shows of solidarity to Saudi Arabia after an Iranian mob attacked its embassy in Tehran over the weekend, prompting a crisis that has put the United States in a bind and has threatened to set back the prospects for a resolution to the conflict in Syria.By Tuesday, Kuwait had recalled its ambassador to Iran, the United Arab Emirates had downgraded its diplomatic relationship, and Bahrain and Sudan had joined Saudi Arabia in severing its relationship with Tehran entirely.Yet many other Sunni Muslim countries signaled that they intended to take a more measured approach to the argument \u2014 sympathizing with Saudi Arabia, a rich and powerful ally, but also determined to avoid getting sucked into a harmful conflict with Iran, a country governed by Shiite clerics, with potentially grave costs.\u201cThe smaller Gulf states are worried they will get caught in the middle,\u201d said Michael Stephens, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London. \u201cIt worries them greatly that things could go badly.\u201dSome countries, like Turkey, Egypt and Pakistan, are already battling their own domestic insurgencies. Others are keen to guard their strategic interests or to keep the door open to trade with Iran while there is a prospect of American sanctions being lifted.Qatar, which shares with Iran access to the world\u2019s largest natural gas field in the Persian Gulf, has yet to declare its hand. Oman has also been quiet, sticking to its longstanding position of neutrality on Saudi Arabia and Iran.In Turkey, where senior officials have warned about the impact of the crisis on a \u201cpowder keg\u201d region, Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu offered his country\u2019s services to help resolve the conflict peacefully.\u201cDiplomatic channels must be given a chance immediately,\u201d Mr. Davutoglu said Tuesday at a meeting of his Justice and Development Party in the capital, Ankara. Frosty relations between Turkey and Saudi Arabia have warmed in recent months. But even in Pakistan, which for decades has had a close alliance with Saudi Arabia, there is a marked reluctance to plunge into the crisis.On Tuesday, the Pakistani prime minister\u2019s foreign affairs adviser, Sartaj Aziz, warned Parliament that the crisis posed a \u201cgrave danger\u201d to the Muslim world. He did not hint at any possible diplomatic moves against Iran, emphasizing instead that Pakistan would work toward \u201ceasing tensions.\u201d Although Pakistan has received substantial Saudi financing to bolster its flagging economy, the government in Islamabad also faces pressure from its sizable Shiite minority, and it plans to develop a major gas pipeline with Iran to solve its energy crisis.Another Saudi ally, Egypt, has received billions of dollars in assistance from Saudi Arabia in recent years. In a visit to Riyadh on Tuesday, Egypt\u2019s foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry, reaffirmed their nations\u2019 alliance, saying, \u201cThe security of the kingdom is an integral part of Egypt\u2019s security.\u201d But Egypt\u2019s room for maneuver against Iran is limited. Cairo severed official ties with Tehran in 1989, although there have been sporadic efforts in recent years to revive them.Mr. Stephens, the analyst, said countries with their own insurgencies were unlikely to do much for Saudi Arabia beyond offering words of support.\u201cThe Turks have a problem with the Kurds, the Egyptians have difficulties in Sinai, and the Pakistanis have their own issues,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will publicly support the Saudis, but they don\u2019t have the energy or military strength for anything more.\u201dThere is little doubt that many Gulf countries share Saudi Arabia\u2019s concerns about Iran, whose support for armed groups in Syria and Iraq has contributed to a burst of sectarian warfare across the Middle East. Many were also offended by the attacks on Saudi diplomatic buildings over the weekend, which followed the execution of a Shiite cleric, Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, in Saudi Arabia on Saturday.Western countries fear that a deepening divide in the region could scuttle efforts to negotiate an end to the Syrian crisis and defeat the Islamic State. The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, told reporters on Tuesday that it was not in the interest of the leaders of Saudi Arabia or Iran \u201cto continue to foment the kind of violence that often leads to radicalization and terrorism.\u201dYet the showdown is another reminder of Saudi Arabia\u2019s limited ability, despite all its great wealth, to bend its allies to its will. The two most powerful countries to move against Iran, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, have taken diplomatic half-steps that could easily be reversed if this storm were to blow over. And Yemen, where the Saudis are backing the government as it tries to repel a rebellion by Shiite rebels known as Houthis, has demonstrated the limits of Saudi military power.Although Saudi Arabia triggered the current dispute by executing Sheikh Nimr, a firebrand who had led popular protests in eastern Saudi Arabia, several analysts said Riyadh appeared to be acting from a position of weakness, or at least frustration. The Saudi economy is straining, the country is embroiled in conflicts in Syria and Yemen, and its leaders worry about the prospect of an American rapprochement with Iran.\u201cThey are under pressure on so many fronts,\u201d said Toby Matthiesen, a research fellow at St. Antony\u2019s College, Oxford, and author of a book on Saudi Shiites.There are signs that Iran is feeling the strain of international condemnation.On Tuesday, a commander of Iran\u2019s hard-line military group condemned the storming of the Saudi Embassy in Tehran as an \u201cugly, unjustifiable act.\u201d It was a sign, according to some analysts, that hard-liners in the Iranian regime might regret not having done more to keep the protests under control, and that they might have been taken aback by the vehemence of the international response.The statement could have been a sign of factionalism inside the Iranian regime, said Mr. Matthiesen.\u201cThis is one way of getting at the reformists inside Iran,\u201d he said. \u201cThe two key issues under debate are the negotiations with the United States, and reaching out to the Saudis. Now that relations with the Saudis have been severed, the non-reformists will be empowered.\u201dThomas Erdbrink contributed reporting from Tehran.Advertisement"}

While the nurses\u2019 super PAC is the biggest left-leaning outside spender in the Democratic primary, conservative organizations have also spent at least $4.3 million attacking Mrs. Clinton in recent months.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.\u201cWhen you have hundreds of thousands or millions of dues-paying members, you can wield a significant amount of influence,\u201d said Robert Maguire, an investigator at the center. \u201cIt\u2019s the flip side of a lot of other spending we\u2019re seeing this days.\u201dNo union has spent as much money in the Democratic primary as National Nurses United, which was born out of a 2009 merger of three smaller unions and has unapologetically embraced liberal politics and movement-building. In 2011, union nurses provided health care at the Occupy Wall Street encampment in Lower Manhattan, and the organization has lobbied forcefully for single-payer health care and a financial transaction tax.When most large labor organizations backed Mrs. Clinton, the nurses were among a handful to support Mr. Sanders, among them the Communications Workers of America and the postal workers\u2019 union. They are guided, the nurses\u2019 leaders say, by the principle that taking care of patients means taking care of the country, too.\u201cThis sick government we have right now is killing our democracy,\u201d said Jean Ross, a Minnesota nurse now serving as one of the group\u2019s three co-presidents, at a Sanders event in Des Moines on Tuesday. The union\u2019s bus stood outside a steelworkers union hall, where the red scrubs worn by the nurses speckled a room full of Carhartt jackets and denim. At any given time, as many as 30 nurses from around the country are on the campaign trail helping Mr. Sanders, rotating in on vacation days and weekends.\u201cWe have a bus, he has a bus,\u201d Ms. Ross said gaily. \u201cNurses get on, nurses get off.\u201dThe group\u2019s campaigning advocacy for Mr. Sanders has drawn charges of hypocrisy from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s supporters. While Mr. Sanders frequently declares that he has no super PAC of his own, he has not publicly called on the nurses to refrain from their efforts on his behalf. He has welcomed their help, thanking the nurses by name in campaign speeches and referring to the union in one recent appearance as a \u201cone of the sponsors\u201d of his campaign.\u201cThis is one of the prime examples of Senator Sanders saying one thing and doing another,\u201d said Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton. \u201cFor months he had criticized super PACs and pledged to shun them in his campaign, but all along he has benefited from hundreds of thousands of dollars in independent expenditures from one of those very organizations.\u201dMr. Sanders insists there is no contradiction.\u201cThe difference is a pretty simple difference,\u201d Mr. Sanders told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cHillary Clinton goes out raising money for her own super PAC. I don\u2019t have a super PAC, and in the best of all possible worlds, which I hope to bring about, we will get rid of super PACs, we will overturn Citizens United.\u201dPriorities USA has continued to husband most of its money for later in the campaign, however, in anticipation of a major general election battle with Mrs. Clinton as the nominee. Several other liberal groups have spent money on behalf of Mrs. Clinton, including Planned Parenthood\u2019s political arm and the League of Conservation Voters. But those expenditures totaled only $847,000, according to spending reported to the elections commission through Monday, less than the amount spent by the nurses\u2019 super PAC, National Nurses United for Patient Protection.Ms. DeMoro, the nurses\u2019 union official, scoffed at any comparison between the two efforts, one by nurses, the other by a political operative.\u201cThis is almost a morality play,\u201d Ms. DeMoro said. \u201cIt\u2019s Clinton\u2019s David Brock versus Bernie\u2019s nurses.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the name of an investigator with the Center for Responsive Politics. He is Robert Maguire, not McGuire.Yamiche Alcindor and Sarah Cohen contributed reporting.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Relies Heavily on Saudi Money to Support Syrian Rebels", "Date": "2016-01-23", "News": "Supported bySince then, the C.I.A. and its Saudi counterpart have maintained an unusual arrangement for the rebel-training mission, which the Americans have code-named Timber Sycamore. Under the deal, current and former administration officials said, the Saudis contribute both weapons and large sums of money, and the C.I.A takes the lead in training the rebels on AK-47 assault rifles and tank-destroying missiles.The support for the Syrian rebels is only the latest chapter in the decadeslong relationship between the spy services of Saudi Arabia and the United States, an alliance that has endured through the Iran-contra scandal, support for the mujahedeen against the Soviets in Afghanistan and proxy fights in Africa. Sometimes, as in Syria, the two countries have worked in concert. In others, Saudi Arabia has simply written checks underwriting American covert activities.The joint arming and training program, which other Middle East nations contribute money to, continues as America\u2019s relations with Saudi Arabia \u2014 and the kingdom\u2019s place in the region \u2014 are in flux. The old ties of cheap oil and geopolitics that have long bound the countries together have loosened as America\u2019s dependence on foreign oil declines and the Obama administration tiptoes toward a diplomatic rapprochement with Iran.Although the Saudis have been public about their help arming rebel groups in Syria, the extent of their partnership with the C.I.A.\u2019s covert action campaign and their direct financial support had not been disclosed. Details were pieced together in interviews with a half-dozen current and former American officials and sources from several Persian Gulf countries. Most spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the program.From the moment the C.I.A. operation was started, Saudi money supported it.American officials have not disclosed the amount of the Saudi contribution, which is by far the largest from another nation to the program to arm the rebels against President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s military. But estimates have put the total cost of the arming and training effort at several billion dollars.The White House has embraced the covert financing from Saudi Arabia \u2014 and from Qatar, Jordan and Turkey \u2014 at a time when Mr. Obama has pushed gulf nations to take a greater security role in the region.Spokesmen for both the C.I.A. and the Saudi Embassy in Washington declined to comment.The Saudi efforts were led by the flamboyant Prince Bandar bin Sultan, at the time the intelligence chief, who directed Saudi spies to buy thousands of AK-47s and millions of rounds of ammunition in Eastern Europe for the Syrian rebels. The C.I.A. helped arrange some of the arms purchases for the Saudis, including a large deal in Croatia in 2012.By the summer of 2012, a freewheeling feel had taken hold along Turkey\u2019s border with Syria as the gulf nations funneled cash and weapons to rebel groups \u2014 even some that American officials were concerned had ties to radical groups like Al Qaeda.The C.I.A. was mostly on the sidelines during this period, authorized by the White House under the Timber Sycamore training program to deliver nonlethal aid to the rebels but not weapons. In late 2012, according to two former senior American officials, David H. Petraeus, then the C.I.A. director, delivered a stern lecture to intelligence officials of several gulf nations at a meeting near the Dead Sea in Jordan. He chastised them for sending arms into Syria without coordinating with one another or with C.I.A. officers in Jordan and Turkey.Months later, Mr. Obama gave his approval for the C.I.A. to begin directly arming and training the rebels from a base in Jordan, amending the Timber Sycamore program to allow lethal assistance. Under the new arrangement, the C.I.A. took the lead in training, while Saudi Arabia\u2019s intelligence agency, the General Intelligence Directorate, provided money and weapons, including TOW anti-tank missiles.The Qataris have also helped finance the training and allowed a Qatari base to be used as an additional training location. But American officials said Saudi Arabia was by far the largest contributor to the operation.While the Obama administration saw this coalition as a selling point in Congress, some, including Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, raised questions about why the C.I.A. needed Saudi money for the operation, according to one former American official. Mr. Wyden declined to be interviewed, but his office released a statement calling for more transparency. \u201cSenior officials have said publicly that the U.S. is trying to build up the battlefield capabilities of the anti-Assad opposition, but they haven\u2019t provided the public with details about how this is being done, which U.S. agencies are involved, or which foreign partners those agencies are working with,\u201d the statement said.When relations among the countries involved in the training program are strained, it often falls to the United States to broker solutions. As the host, Jordan expects regular payments from the Saudis and the Americans. When the Saudis pay late, according to a former senior intelligence official, the Jordanians complain to C.I.A. officials.The C.I.A. training program is separate from another program to arm Syrian rebels, one the Pentagon ran that has since ended. That program was designed to train rebels to combat Islamic State fighters in Syria, unlike the C.I.A.\u2019s program, which focuses on rebel groups fighting the Syrian military.While the intelligence alliance is central to the Syria fight and has been important in the war against Al Qaeda, a constant irritant in American-Saudi relations is just how much Saudi citizens continue to support terrorist groups, analysts said.In the near term, the alliance remains solid, strengthened by a bond between spy masters. Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the Saudi interior minister who took over the effort to arm the Syrian rebels from Prince Bandar, has known the C.I.A. director, John O. Brennan, from the time Mr. Brennan was the agency\u2019s Riyadh station chief in the 1990s. Former colleagues say the two men remain close, and Prince Mohammed has won friends in Washington with his aggressive moves to dismantle terrorist groups like Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.The job Mr. Brennan once held in Riyadh is, more than the ambassador\u2019s, the true locus of American power in the kingdom. Former diplomats recall that the most important discussions always flowed through the C.I.A. station chief.Current and former intelligence officials say there is a benefit to this communication channel: The Saudis are far more responsive to American criticism when it is done in private, and this secret channel has done more to steer Saudi behavior toward America\u2019s interests than any public chastising could have.The roots of the relationship run deep. In the late 1970s, the Saudis organized what was known as the \u201cSafari Club\u201d \u2014 a coalition of nations including Morocco, Egypt and France \u2014 that ran covert operations around Africa at a time when Congress had clipped the C.I.A.\u2019s wings over years of abuses.Brief background information on the most powerful figures in the kingdom, and how they stand in the sometimes complicated order of succession.\u201cAnd so the kingdom, with these countries, helped in some way, I believe, to keep the world safe at a time when the United States was not able to do that,\u201d Prince Turki al-Faisal, a former head of Saudi intelligence, recalled in a speech at Georgetown University in 2002.In the 1980s, the Saudis helped finance C.I.A. operations in Angola, where the United States backed rebels against the Soviet-allied government. While the Saudis were staunchly anticommunist, Riyadh\u2019s primary incentive seemed to be to solidify its C.I.A. ties. \u201cThey were buying good will,\u201d recalled one former senior intelligence officer who was involved in the operation.In perhaps the most consequential episode, the Saudis helped arm the mujahedeen rebels to drive the Soviets out of Afghanistan. The United States committed hundreds of millions of dollars each year to the mission, and the Saudis matched it, dollar for dollar.In 1984, when the Reagan administration sought help with its secret plan to sell arms to Iran to finance the contra rebels in Nicaragua, Robert C. McFarlane, the national security adviser, met with Prince Bandar, who was the Saudi ambassador to Washington at the time. The White House made it clear that the Saudis would \u201cgain a considerable amount of favor\u201d by cooperating, Mr. McFarlane later recalled.Prince Bandar pledged $1 million per month to help fund the contras, in recognition of the administration\u2019s past support to the Saudis. The contributions continued after Congress cut off funding to the contras. By the end, the Saudis had contributed $32 million, paid through a Cayman Islands bank account.In a letter, the prince declined to testify, explaining that his country\u2019s \u201cconfidences and commitments, like our friendship, are given not just for the moment but the long run.\u201dAn article last Sunday about the United States\u2019 reliance on Saudi Arabia to help financially support the Syrian rebels referred incorrectly to the beheading of a Shiite cleric, Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr. While the execution was not kept secret, it was not a public execution.C .J. Chivers contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cutting Off Those Recurring Charges You Forgot About", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Supported byYour MoneySo it shouldn\u2019t come as any surprise that a service has popped up that can help you quickly cut off these subscriptions. And which companies are consumers most likely to remove from their monthly statements? Credit monitoring services from Experian and TransUnion, gym memberships at Planet Fitness and the monthly Internet-on-the-airplane offering from Gogo are highest on the cancellation list.Once Trim performs its analysis, you get a text message with a list of all your recurring charges. You reply with \u201cCancel X,\u201d and then the company takes it from there, making the request on your behalf to the service provider. Trim follows up for more information (say, your billing address) if it needs it.I offer no predictions on whether Trim will succeed in that, but its list of least popular companies serves as a good warning for consumers who hate not getting what they are paying for or paying for things that they are not getting.As for the churn that Trim inspired with its text-message alerts, a spokesman for Experian passed on feedback from Guy Abramo, president of its consumer services unit, noting that many people use the company\u2019s services to track their credit profile in the crucial months before buying a car or home. So it\u2019s only natural that those people would want to cancel once their transaction was complete. Many of them eventually resubscribe, according to Experian. A TransUnion spokesman declined to address its churn and the company\u2019s third-place spot on Trim\u2019s list.Trim\u2019s founders find the cancellation process for health clubs to be particularly noxious. They often have to send registered mail to the companies to fulfill their customers\u2019 requests. A Planet Fitness spokesman said it did not have anyone available to comment on its 30.4 percent cancellation rate.The company does not allow subscribers to cancel by simply pushing a button. Instead, it requires an interaction of some sort, which I find obnoxious but a company spokesman described as \u201cfaster and more convenient\u201d since you don\u2019t need login credentials to, say, engage in an online chat with a customer service representative.Trim\u2019s co-founder, Thomas Smyth, noted that Gogo did not give Trim too much trouble when it reached out on behalf of its customers. Trim has more challenges with Experian, where the procedure seems to change every few weeks.Mr. Smyth also admitted begrudging admiration for how Gogo uses a keen understanding of behavioral economics to hook so many people. \u201cThe per-month rate is often not that much more than the per-day or per-flight rate,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you look at it and say \u2018I\u2019m going to be a winner. I\u2019m smarter than these guys!\u2019\u201d And then you forget to cancel. For months.None of your subscriptions will bankrupt you, though taken \u2014 and canceled \u2014 together and diverted to savings, they may add up to a decent chunk of a vacation budget.But the growing list of subscriptions is yet another reminder of just how much complication can come with convenience. It is often easier to start a recurring service than end it, and even when you spot the $9.99 a month, you may not want to put the $9.99 (or more) of effort required into getting rid of it. Which is exactly what these companies want you to think.So keep a close eye on your card statements. And if credit reporting companies, health clubs or Internet providers have their claws in your plastic, reread those bills, each and every month. There\u2019s a decent chance that you have something better to do with the money that they are regularly helping themselves to.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Belinda Bencic\u00a0Is a Phenom Who Loves to Lob", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "Supported byMELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 A few hours earlier, Belinda Bencic, still just 18, had secured herself a fourth-round match with Maria Sharapova at the Australian Open.Now Marcel Niederer, Bencic\u2019s Swiss manager, was sitting in a Melbourne restaurant \u2014 sunlight streaming through the window after Friday\u2019s early rain \u2014 and thinking about geometry.Bencic\u2019s father, Ivan, was born in the former Czechoslovakia, but his family fled to Switzerland in 1968 after the Soviet invasion. Ivan Bencic and Niederer grew up in the same small Swiss town, Uzwil, and later became professional ice hockey players before starting business careers.Niederer made an excellent living by shipping coffee to Russia, and when Ivan\u2019s daughter showed a remarkable aptitude for tennis at 6 years old, Ivan asked Niederer for seed money to develop her career properly.\u201cBelinda\u2019s grandparents, they fled from the Russians to Switzerland,\u201d Niederer said. \u201cThirty years later, the money I made in Russia gave the initial financing for Belinda\u2019s career. That\u2019s a nice circle.\u201dIt is the sort of border-bridging, against-the-odds tale in which tennis seems to specialize. Sharapova in particular could appreciate it, in light of her own moonshot journey to stardom after leaving Russia as a young girl with her father, with no guarantees and less than $1,000 between them, for the Bollettieri Tennis Academy in Bradenton, Fla.Though Sunday\u2019s round-of-16 match will be Bencic\u2019s first chance to play Sharapova, it will not be their first meeting. That came at the academy.\u201cBelinda has a photo of her in Florida with Sharapova when she was 6 or 7 years old,\u201d Ivan Bencic said.A decade later, Belinda Bencic has matured into a significant threat. Coached by her father and Martina Hingis\u2019s mother, Melanie Molitor, Bencic possesses a precociously complete game, \u00e0 la Hingis, and a rare ability to read the flow of play that are making the elite increasingly nervous.Asked whether she would rather hit a lob winner or a big forehand winner, Bencic did not hesitate: a lob.\u201cUnbelievably smart player,\u201d the veteran coach Gunter Bresnik said. \u201cShe understands the game really well and knows exactly how to throw the other player off.\u201dSharapova, 28, said Friday: \u201cAn impressive player. It\u2019s a tough fourth round. We haven\u2019t played against each other before, but I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be playing many times. It\u2019s great that we can start here.\u201dUnseeded at the Rogers Cup in Toronto last August, Bencic upset Caroline Wozniacki, Ana Ivanovic, Serena Williams and Simona Halep to win the title. Seeded 12th at this Australian Open, she is on the verge of breaking into the top 10 and would probably already be there if a hand injury had not stopped her momentum late in 2015.In competition, Bencic has a perfectionist streak and has already rolled many an eye and swatted many a racket on the world\u2019s show courts in frustration. Glances at her box are as common as artful shots.But off the court, she is an upbeat and independent-minded interview subject who is quick to laugh and to answer.\u201cI always wanted to be here on the big courts, and now I finally made it,\u201d she said Friday in the players\u2019 lounge. \u201cSo I keep reminding myself that I really have to enjoy this time and not be too tight, too serious, too obsessed.\u201cI\u2019m in Australia. I don\u2019t know how many 18-year-old girls can travel the world like me and have such a great life, and I really appreciate it a lot. And I remember this when I am, like, down or not appreciating.\u201dLike many a Swiss, including Roger Federer, she is a polyglot. She speaks Slovak at home with her parents and Brian, her younger brother. Her mother, Dana, who was raised in Czechoslovakia, met Ivan when he was on a business trip to Bratislava.She also speaks Swiss German, German and English, and she is growing serious about learning French because of her friendship with the rising French player Kristina Mladenovic, who very nearly reached the fourth round as well before losing, 6-4, 4-6, 11-9, to Daria Gavrilova of Australia on Friday night.\u201cYou don\u2019t have that often with people, but we just, like, clicked,\u201d said Bencic, who watched the match in Mladenovic\u2019s box. \u201cWe have the same interests and sometimes the same thoughts, and off the tennis court. We like to hang out with each other, and, you know, typical girls\u2019 talk, like shopping, talking about boys, just stuff like this. And it\u2019s nice to have a friend on the tour, because it\u2019s not always easy. There are a lot of opponents here also.\u201dAsked in which language she feels most herself, Bencic thought for a moment.\u201cI do think sometimes you have a personality for each language,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know which one is most me. I\u2019m very thankful my parents taught me Slovakian. I think when you have a chance to have an extra language, why not? There are so many parents who can speak their language from where they are from but don\u2019t teach the kids, so I think it\u2019s a waste.\u201dIvan Bencic played tennis recreationally \u2014 and now gets beaten by his daughter when she plays with her nondominant left hand. But he was above all drawn to the sport by Hingis, who in the 1990s became the first Swiss player to reach No. 1 and win major singles titles.\u201cIn this time, there was no Roger, no football teams who had played high-level football,\u201d he said. \u201cSwitzerland\u2019s sport was a little bit understated, and Martina showed what is possible from Switzerland, and this was a good inspiration for us.\u201dContacting Molitor, Hingis\u2019s mother and coach, was thus a logical step. Molitor had also immigrated to Switzerland from what is now Slovakia. Ivan said he telephoned when Belinda was 5 and asked if Molitor would take a look.\u201cTalent is not a typical word for Melanie to use,\u201d he said. \u201cBut she saw what I had done until then, until Belinda was 5. I had played one year for one hour a day with balls and coordination things, and Melanie saw all the work we had done and said, \u2018O.K., go follow your way and sometimes we contact each other.\u2019 We had more and more contact, and then she started her academy. We were half a year at Bollettieri\u2019s and then we came back.\u201dMolitor continues to work with Bencic when Bencic is in Switzerland and to consult with Ivan Bencic when they are on the road.Asked what makes Molitor a great coach, Belinda said: \u201cWell, she tells you the truth right into the face. And that\u2019s what you need to get better. You don\u2019t always need someone tapping you on the shoulder telling you are doing great.\u201dHingis, now the top-ranked women\u2019s doubles player, also continues to be a mentor. She was in the front row of the box next to Ivan Bencic on Friday as Belinda rallied to beat Kateryna Bondarenko in three sets.\u201cIt\u2019s easy because Martina has been in this situation,\u201d Bencic said. \u201cAnd she can tell you everything about it, and you don\u2019t have to figure it out yourself.\u201dIt is quite an entourage. Niederer agreed to back Bencic\u2019s career in the early years, allowing Ivan to quit his job and travel extensively with his daughter, until sponsorship was able to fill the gap. The agreement was that Niederer would become her manager if she became a successful player. Niederer said he would soon recoup his initial investment.\u201cWhen I made this contract when she was 6, I was not thinking about the money, I was thinking it was an adventure, a tennis project,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd every year she was in the top of her age group, and it\u2019s been a great pleasure to watch her.\u201dBencic insisted that she had not felt extra pressure because of the arrangement.\u201cIt\u2019s true that it could have felt that way,\u201d she said. \u201cBut my dad and Marcel, even though they did this project and invested in me, they never gave me the feeling that I really have to do it. I always played tennis because I wanted to.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Dark\u2019 Funds May Bode Ill in 2016 Election", "Date": "2016-01-03", "News": "Supported byLetter from WashingtonThe 2016 presidential campaign seems certain to feature not only more money than any since Watergate but also more money from undisclosed donors since the days when black satchels of illicit cash were passed around.This so-called dark money, or contributions to entities that are not required to disclose their donors, topped more than $300 million in the 2012 presidential race, and some experts believe that the levels may be far higher this time. Among the risks is that foreign money \u2014 barred from playing a direct role in the election \u2014 could be surreptitiously funneled into the campaign because it could move through channels where it wouldn\u2019t have to be publicly disclosed.This lack of transparency is occurring thanks to a ruse that permits political advocacy groups to claim that they are principally social welfare agencies and thus tax exempt and not subject to disclosure. These organizations court interest groups and rich donors, some of whom want the influence that political money brings but not the public accountability. It\u2019s a win for the interest groups and the candidates; the public is kept in the dark.This time, supporters of some presidential candidates, especially Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, are getting into the act. Almost one in five television ads has been financed by dark money, according to the Center for Responsive Politics \u2014 most of them from the Conservative Solutions Project, a nonprofit group that backs Mr. Rubio. The pro-Rubio forces are \u201cbreaking new ground,\u201d said Viveca Novak, communications director for the center.Potential efforts by regulatory agencies to rein in these secretive activities were thwarted by Congress in the year-end government funding bill. The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and a number of party colleagues in the House and the Senate, yielded to the Democrats and President Obama on a number of big-ticket spending, tax and regulatory measures. But they were adamant about keeping provisions that protect the status of dark money. This means that the Internal Revenue Service, which is reviewing and soliciting comments on these tax-exempt political organizations, is barred from continuing these proceedings and from issuing any new rules. And the Securities and Exchange Commission is barred from requiring public companies to disclose their political campaign spending to investors.History suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.Mr. McConnell, once a champion of disclosure to head off campaign-finance restrictions, has pressured fellow Republicans for years to resist any disclosure requirements, arguing that secret money works to the party\u2019s advantage. About the only party member who has stood up to his demands is Senator Lisa A. Murkowski of Alaska. Even the champion of campaign finance reform, Senator John McCain, another Republican has been rather quiet lately.There are also a number of pro-Democratic nonprofit groups associated with party leaders and leadership-directed committees that make extensive use of dark money. David Brock, a onetime prominent critic of Hillary Clinton who now champions her candidacy, is involved with several political organizations including nonprofits that don\u2019t have to disclose donors, and political action committees that do. They all seem to comingle in ways that are legal.The biggest dark money practitioners, however, have been the United States Chamber of Commerce and Crossroads Grassroots Policy Strategies, also known as Crossroads GPS, a nonprofit organization of the \u201csuper PAC\u201d American Crossroads, co-founded by the Republican strategist Karl Rove.The Federal Election Commission could force these organizations, with their heavy campaign involvement, to register as political action committees, requiring them to name their donors. But the commission, almost from its inception 40 years ago, has been toothless.And with congressionally enacted prohibitions, there is almost no way to bring these activities into the sunlight, Ms. Novak said, \u201cunless the Justice Department gets into the act.\u201d Fred Wertheimer, the president of Democracy 21 and a longtime advocate of campaign finance reform, has asked the Justice Department to do just that, with an emphasis on political activities associated with Mr. Rubio\u2019s campaign. \u201cSecret money is the formula for corruption,\u201d Mr. Wertheimer said. \u201cIt\u2019s the influence buyer\u2019s dream.\u201dThe catchphrase of the Watergate scandal, where bags of cash were surreptitiously circulated, was \u201cfollow the money.\u201d Bob Woodward, who helped expose the scandal, put it more directly: \u201cThe key,\u201d he said a half-century ago, \u201cwas the secret campaign cash.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Davos Takes a Fresh Look at Emerging Markets", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported byEver since emerging markets became a major asset class in the early 1990s, a parade of potentates, policy makers and corporate chieftains have flocked to the stylish village of Davos in the Swiss Alps in the hope of becoming the latest global meme.From 2000 on, the Davos boom and the emerging markets boom have been pretty much one and the same, a living ideal of globalization helped by central banks that have printed trillions of dollars of new money.But now, as interest rates in the United States begin to rise, these dollars have begun to flow out of China, the Middle East and Latin America. Growth rates are stumbling, debt levels rising and geopolitical fears spreading.Over the last year, the exodus has gathered pace, fed by worries that China will lose control of its currency, the price of oil will drop to $20 a barrel, and Brazil\u2019s problems will worsen.And many now say that this rosy, Davos-fueled notion of a world powered by emerging-market growth and innovation needs to be reconsidered.\u201cI have long maintained that the emerging-market hype was oversold when it was clear that what was going on was high commodity prices and cheap money,\u201d said Dani Rodrik, an expert on globalization at the Harvard Kennedy School.As for the World Economic Forum in Davos, he said that over the last 10 years it had become an echo chamber of sorts.\u201cWhat we are seeing now is lower growth and policy conflicts between the emerging and the developed world,\u201d said Mr. Rodrik, who will not be making the trip this time around. \u201cIt is going to be a different type of Davos this year.\u201dPerhaps the biggest sign that global investors have lost faith is that for the first time since 1988 (when only the bravest souls invested in these countries), investors have pulled more money out of emerging markets than they have put in, according to research by the Institute of International Finance.In an unusually blunt speech in Paris this month, Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said that emerging nations needed a new model for growth after years of relying on easy money and high commodity prices.\u201cGrowth rates are down, and cyclical and structural forces have undermined the traditional growth paradigm,\u201d Ms. Lagarde said. Moreover, she warned, the dollar\u2019s continued strength against just about all emerging-market currencies could well result in a new round of financial uncertainty, pushing commodity prices and global growth forecasts even lower.Since mid-2011, the dollar has gained more than 100 percent against emerging-market currencies in Turkey, Brazil and South Africa. And over the last six months, following China\u2019s decision to depreciate the renminbi, previously robust monetary units in Singapore, Korea and Taiwan have also started to lose value against the dollar.\u201cOur own estimates show that a slowdown of 1 percent in the emerging world would lower growth in advanced countries by at least about 0.2 percentage points,\u201d Ms. Lagarde said.Still, even with the gloom and doom surrounding emerging markets these days, there is little sign that standard bearers are forgoing their annual week in the Swiss mountains.This year, more than 320 representatives from Brazil, Russia, India and China \u2014 the so-called BRIC community of emerging nations \u2014 will be in Davos \u2014 compared with 237 from these countries in 2010.None of these representatives will be heads of state, though. In the past, Brazilian presidents and Vladimir Putin of Russia have led their countries\u2019 delegations. This year, Russia is sending a deputy prime minister, Yury Trutnev, while China is sending a vice president, Li Yuanchao.Two large emerging markets that have been under significant stress of late will be sending their leaders. Turkey, recently rocked by terrorist attacks, will be represented by its prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu. And the South African president, Jacob Zuma, who has gone through three finance ministers in the last five weeks, is also planning to show up.The president of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, whose popularity polls have sunk to single digits, will not be making an appearance, but her recently appointed finance minister, Nelson Henrique Barbosa-Filho, is scheduled to attend.Ready to engage in some damage control will be the top executives at BTG Pactual, the Brazilian investment bank whose former chief executive, Andr\u00e9 Esteves, is under investigation for corruption.In terms of panels themed for developing nations, the World Economic Forum will be serving up the usual fare this year. One will explore how companies in emerging markets cope with laws that discriminate against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender workers. Another is more straightforward: What will the impact of higher interest rates in the United States be on emerging market growth?But, as is always the case at the World Economic Forum, the meetings of genuine consequence will be the ones that you do not know are happening.That could mean Laurence D. Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest money management firm, sitting down with Jean-Paul Villain, an executive at the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, or Fahad al-Mubarak, the governor of Saudi Arabia\u2019s central bank and overseer of the country\u2019s $650 billion foreign reserve stash.Or the chief executives of Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase could wind up huddling with Fang Xinghai, the vice chairman of the China securities regulatory commission. The sharp swings in China\u2019s stock market are having an outsize effect on markets in the United States, and the big American investment banks will want to hear what Mr. Fang\u2019s strategy is for 2016.But as central bankers, prime ministers and chief executives wrestle this week to make sense of it all, Ruchir Sharma, head of emerging markets at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, has a fairly simple explanation: The impact on the developed world of a slowdown in China and other emerging markets is going to be greater than most people realize.\u201cIn 1997, the emerging world\u2019s share of the global economy was 20 percent \u2014 now, it\u2019s nearly 40 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a big deal. What happens in China has an effect on the wider world, and I think that the Davos crowd has been slow to recognize this.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Day of Endorsements for Presidential Candidates in Iowa", "Date": "2016-01-23", "News": "Supported byPELLA, Iowa \u2014 After nonstop candidate traffic in Iowa for a full year, the gun was sounded on the final lap before the Feb. 1 caucuses, as the leading candidates in both parties crisscrossed the snowy plains and the state\u2019s largest newspaper announced its endorsements.And in a move that was less than an endorsement but perhaps even more significant, Iowa\u2019s senior elected Republican, Senator Charles E. Grassley, shared a stage with Donald J. Trump here in Pella, standing behind a \u201cTrump\u201d sign on a podium. The appearance conferred a seal of approval by elements of the Republican establishment that once declined to take Mr. Trump seriously and is now beginning to see him as preferable to Mr. Cruz, a hard-line conservative.\u201cI\u2019m happy to be here with such an enthusiastic group and this candidate,\u201d Mr. Grassley said. Mr. Trump reciprocated later, saying, \u201cThis is a great guy, this is a great guy,\u201d as photographers snapped pictures of the unlikely pairing. \u201cHe\u2019s respected by everybody.\u201dHis remark came in for angry rebuke from Glenn Beck, the right-wing radio host, who campaigned in Iowa with Mr. Cruz on Saturday. \u201cThis kind of hubris,\u201d Mr. Beck said gravely, referring to Mr. Trump, \u201cis beyond imagination.\u201dThroughout the gathering, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Beck alluded to the left-leaning positions taken by Mr. Trump for much of his life.\u201cNobody on earth ever grew a backbone after they got into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cIs there any chance on earth that individual would actually stand up to the cronyism and cartel in Washington?\u201dFor his part, Mr. Trump raised doubts about Mr. Cruz\u2019s eligibility to serve because of his Canadian birth and about an unreported loan he took from Goldman Sachs to finance a Senate race.\u201cYou got to pick a winner, because I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s going to win,\u201d he told Iowans, referring to the general election.In endorsing Mr. Rubio, The Register sought an alternative to the two leading Republicans in the race, who each engender hostility from large parts of their party. \u201cRepublicans have the opportunity to define their party\u2019s future in this election,\u201d the paper wrote. \u201cThey could choose anger, pessimism and fear. Or they could take a different path,\u201d the editors wrote.It called Mr. Rubio his \u201cparty\u2019s best hope\u201d for enlarging the Republican tent and called him \u201cwhip-smart\u201d about policy matters in meetings with editors.The paper\u2019s once highly anticipated backing is less meaningful in an age of reduced print circulation and the hogging of the news cycle by a candidate, Mr. Trump, whose often insulting tweets are followed by nearly 6 million people and whose rallies are covered live on cable TV.For Mr. Rubio, however, it may offer a bounce if establishment-leaning Republicans who dislike Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz, and so far have been divided among several candidates, start to coalesce behind the Florida senator.Speaking to about 250 people in Indianola, Iowa, about an hour after The Register announced its endorsement, Mr. Rubio did not revel in it. Only after a questioner congratulated him for it did he say, jokingly, \u201cI\u2019d rather have your endorsement.\u201cI\u2019m grateful for it,\u201d he added, \u201cbut I still want you to caucus for me.\u201d\u2019He seemed to have taken some of the newspaper editorial\u2019s advice to heart as he gave one of his more upbeat campaign speeches recently. Though it spoke glowingly of him, The Register\u2019s article also chided the senator, known for his optimistic message of American exceptionalism and renewal, for offering a darker assessment about the country\u2019s prospects lately. \u201cHe has pandered to rising pessimism in his party. He talks gloomily about \u2018a nation in decline,\u2019 \u201d the editorial said.On Saturday evening he was lighter on the gloom. America, he said, \u201cis the greatest country in the history of the world.\u201d He added: \u201cWe don\u2019t say that enough.\u201dMrs. Clinton was the paper\u2019s pick ahead of the 2008 caucuses as well, when she finished a disappointing third behind Barack Obama and John Edwards.The paper wrote Mrs. Clinton \u201cis not a perfect candidate,\u201d but it noted, \u201cThe presidency is not an entry-level position.\u201dAlthough it praised Mrs. Clinton\u2019s chief rival, Senator Bernie Sanders, for injecting the issue of income inequality into the races in both parties the paper hesitated over the near-impossibility Mr. Sanders would face in getting his sweeping programs through Congress.Mrs. Clinton has been making the same argument, particularly about Mr. Sanders\u2019s proposal for universal health care; she says a wiser course is to improve on President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. Recognizing the power of Mr. Sanders\u2019s idea, though, she has taken to reminding people of her own attempts to create universal health care during her husband\u2019s administration.\u201cNow, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare, as some of you might remember,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said at a town-hall-style event in Clinton, Iowa, on Saturday, the second time in recent days she has used the line.\u201cWe share the same goal: universal health care for every single American,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said of her rival. \u201cBut we have a real difference about how to get there.\u201dMr. Sanders, who began a weekend bus tour of eastern Iowa cities and towns on Saturday, began the day speaking to more than 150 supporters who hollered and stomped their feet in his Davenport campaign office, before heading out to canvass.Mr. Sanders, who has begun to resemble Mr. Trump in his penchant for citing positive polls, maintained that in head-to-head matchups with Mr. Trump he outshined Mrs. Clinton.Pointing out that former President Bill Clinton has stepped up attacking him, calling him angry, Mr. Sanders embraced the distinction. \u201cAnd, you know what?\u201d he said. \u201cIt is true. I am angry and the American people are angry.\u201dReporting was contributed by Amy Chozick in Clinton, Iowa; Yamiche Alcindor in Davenport, Iowa; Jonathan Martin in Pella, Iowa; Matt Flegenheimer in Ankeny, Iowa; and Jeremy W.

{"Headline": "Inquiry in China Adds to Doubt Over Reliability of Its Economic Data", "Date": "2016-01-26", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 The veracity of China\u2019s economic data has been increasingly questioned as the slowing pace of the country\u2019s growth has startled the world. And a new investigation into the official who oversees the numbers is unlikely to inspire confidence.The Communist Party\u2019s anticorruption commission announced late Tuesday that it was looking into the head of the country\u2019s statistics agency over what it called \u201cserious violations.\u201dChina\u2019s shrinking manufacturing sector and falling stock market have unnerved global investors. Any further doubt about its economic figures could paint an even darker picture of the health of the economy, adding to the pain in the markets. Stocks in Shanghai, which closed before the announcement, were off 6.4 percent on Tuesday.The statistics bureau has a variety of responsibilities that are hard to balance even in the best of times.The bureau is supposed to provide China\u2019s leaders with an unvarnished assessment of the country\u2019s economic strengths and weaknesses, even while reassuring the public about growth and maintaining consumer confidence. It is also supposed to release enough detailed and accurate information for investors and corporate leaders to make sound decisions about economic and financial prospects.Few doubt that China has grown enormously over the past three decades. But economists, bankers and analysts who study the numbers believe that the bureau smooths data, underestimating growth during economic booms and overestimating it during downturns.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.Many economists are worried that China\u2019s economy is not expanding anywhere close to the nearly 7 percent annual pace that bureau data still show. By some estimates, the pace is half of the official figures.Those skeptical about the data point, in part, to the underlying numbers.Still, the bureau has consistently and repeatedly defended its statistics, contending that critics do not adequately understand the data or the Chinese economy. And the market impact of the investigation could be limited by the fact that many were already wondering about China\u2019s data.\u201cThe international credibility of China\u2019s G.D.P. figures is anyway very low, so this probably is not a severe blow,\u201d said Diana Choyleva, the chief economist and head of research at Lombard Street Research, an economic analysis group in London. Lombard estimates that China\u2019s gross domestic product grew 3.2 percent last year, not the 6.9 percent that the National Bureau of Statistics claims.The reliability of China\u2019s economic data goes to the heart of the market\u2019s concerns.At the official rate, China grew last year at the slowest pace in 25 years. The government is trying to manage a slowdown without letting the pain create social unrest.That can make it hard to discern what\u2019s really happening in the economy. Among other problems, it has a glut of old-line factories that make products like steel, glass and cement. That industrial overcapacity stems from years of debt-financed investment in industries that now show little sign that they can repay those loans.Beijing is trying to rebalance its economy to focus more on consumer spending and services. But concerns about the pace of change play into the worries about the data.Take the steel industry.China produced 804 million tons of steel last year, even as demand faltered. Over all, China\u2019s steel-making capacity was set to reach 1.17 billion tons last year, according to estimates from Fitch Ratings.The government is taking steps to work through some of the excess. The country\u2019s State Council, or cabinet, decided on Sunday that it would close 100 million to 150 million tons of steel-making capacity. That would mean cutting capacity by an amount similar to the total annual steel output of Japan, the world\u2019s No. 2 steel maker.The State Council decision, which was released on Monday, also called for large reductions in coal-mining capacity, without providing a target figure.But it is a balancing act for the Chinese authorities.Li Xinchuang, the head of the China Metallurgical Industry Planning and Research Institute, told the official Xinhua news agency that the planned steel mill closings could cost 400,000 jobs. \u201cLarge-scale redundancies in the steel sector could threaten social stability,\u201d he warned.The disjointed attempts of policy makers to manage the stock markets and the currency are adding to skepticism about the economy.The outflows of capital reflect the uncertainty about the direction of the currency \u2014 and about the broader economy. Excluding foreign investment, capital outflows probably rose to as much as $900 billion in 2015, economists at Standard Chartered wrote on Tuesday in a research note.In response to the outflows, China\u2019s central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, has been eating into its reserves at a record pace in recent months. The central bank is trying to prop up the value of the Chinese currency, the renminbi, which is under pressure as the country\u2019s growth prospects weaken.It is all making for messiness in the markets. After the fall on Tuesday, Chinese stocks were at their lowest level in 13 months.Neil Gough contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mayor de Blasio Makes New York City\u2019s Fiscal Case to a Wary Legislature", "Date": "2016-01-26", "News": "Supported byALBANY \u2014 Mayor Bill de Blasio arrived here on Tuesday with a substantial wish list for the State Legislature, urging lawmakers to deliver money for several of New York City\u2019s needs, including public housing, infrastructure and health care.Many of his listeners, however, were less than sympathetic.Mayoral pitch turned to mayoral defense as Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, repeatedly found himself justifying the city\u2019s tax and spending practices. Testimony expected to last no more than a few hours became a five-hour slog, as he explained the need for the city to maintain a surplus, and calmly opposed arguments that the city should contribute hundreds of millions of dollars more to help pay for Medicaid and the City University of New York system.\u201cThe bottom line is that the city is awash in money right now,\u201d said Senator Catharine Young, a Cattaraugus County Republican and chairwoman of the Finance Committee, who opened the question-and-answer period of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s testimony with a skeptical assessment of his message: \u201cBasically, what you\u2019re saying is that you\u2019re demanding more money from the state\u2019s taxpayers.\u201dIt was a familiar dynamic for Mr. de Blasio, who now has two years of experience with the delicate fiscal dance that has left the city disappointed more often than not. As the mayor and legislators made their opening offers in what will become a monthslong negotiation, the city contingent offered a gentle reminder that the city is home to nearly half the state\u2019s population and accounts for 57 percent of its revenue.Yet the city must depend on Albany\u2019s good will not only for money, but also for legislation that affects rent controls, public schools and other parts of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s agenda, and he was careful not to complain of his grilling.\u201cI thought it was a very productive hearing \u2014 long, yes, but very productive,\u201d he said after emerging from the office of John J. Flanagan, the majority leader of the Republican-controlled State Senate, and before going to a meeting with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and another with the State Assembly speaker, Carl E. Heastie.\u201cThe hearing indicated some of the realities we live with in our state; there are partisan differences, there are regional differences. I still think it was respectful, I think it was a pretty informed and fair hearing.\u201dThe city is starting budget negotiations at a disadvantage: The budget that Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, proposed this month would shift hundreds of millions in formerly state-covered costs to the city, while taking back $600 million in city sales-tax revenue.Soon after unveiling these moves, Mr. Cuomo explained that he wanted the city and state to work together so the proposals would not \u201ccost New York City a penny,\u201d a promise Mr. de Blasio quoted several times during the hearing. But Republican lawmakers made it clear they would be content to let the city bear the extra expense, recycling some of the governor\u2019s own arguments in favor of his proposals and further insisting the city enjoys resources far beyond those of struggling upstate communities.Even as Mr. de Blasio resisted these cuts and others, he had to beat back questions that took city officials and onlookers alike by surprise. At least eight different lawmakers pressed him to explain why the city does not abide by a cap on property taxes that applies to other municipalities. Republicans have previously proposed forcing the city to impose the cap, but the issue also gained traction during the hearing with several city Democrats who want tax breaks for homeowners they represent.As the mayor spoke, the Senate was passing a bill to impose the cap on the city, a move the Republican majority said would save city taxpayers $4.5 billion by 2019. The Democratic majority in the Assembly dismissed any possibility that it would follow suit.\u201cI believe that New York City, although larger, although having a unique set of circumstances, if we\u2019re one state, then we\u2019re one state, and we should be under the same guidelines to save our taxpayers dollars,\u201d said Senator Kathleen A. Marchione, a Republican from Saratoga County.Tax-cap question after tax-cap question, Mr. de Blasio responded the same way. He said the city\u2019s financial situation was different from other municipalities\u2019, as it funds services that others do not. He suggested that the city, as the prime driver of the state\u2019s economy, needed resources to continue growing. And he warned of future fiscal tempests, saying the city should save its surplus \u2014 currently under threat from the governor\u2019s proposals \u2014 for an especially rainy day.\u201cWe will continue to build the New York City economy for the good of the whole state, with many benefits for the entire metropolitan area and the entire state,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cThat\u2019s my argument about why I think we should avoid a strategy that could limit that growth and our ability to handle the downturns when they do come.\u201dMr. de Blasio also noted that the city is the only municipality in the state that receives no direct, unrestricted aid from Albany. The mayor\u2019s aides later dismissed the property tax issue as a distraction, pointing out that the effective property tax rate on city homeowners was less than a third of the rate in the counties surrounding the city, and fiscal analysts, as well as other Democrats, chimed in with their own criticisms.Much less time was devoted to the other elements of the mayor\u2019s Albany agenda, including education, housing and homelessness.Mr. de Blasio objected to a proposal by Mr. Cuomo to increase funding for charter schools while shifting the responsibility from the state to the city. If the state wanted to increase funding for charter schools, the mayor said, it should provide the city with additional resources.His remarks drew condemnation from several charter school groups, which have strong supporters in the Senate.He also had to plead for the Legislature to knock down Mr. Cuomo\u2019s proposal to take the city\u2019s sales tax revenue for three years in exchange for savings the city received on refinanced debt that the state pays for.Mr. de Blasio asked the state to send the rest of the $100 million in capital funding for the New York City Housing Authority that it had promised \u2014 but not fully delivered \u2014 this year, as well as to commit another $100 million for each of the next two years. He also requested that the state devote more funding to homelessness prevention programs.The Legislature snubbed Mr. de Blasio last year by granting him only a one-year renewal of his control over the public schools. He said on Tuesday that he would ask for permanent mayoral control, but that he would settle for seven years. The Legislature has until the end of its session to vote on that measure.Jesse McKinley contributed reporting from Albany, and Kate Taylor from New York.Jesse McKinley contributed reporting from Albany, and Kate Taylor from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Education Technology Graduates From the Classroom to the Boardroom", "Date": "2016-01-17", "News": "Supported byJudging by the number of learning apps available to classrooms around the country, the education technology market aimed at elementary through high schools is booming.The money pouring into ed tech tells a different story, however. Despite the volume of novel products aimed at schools, the biggest investments are largely going to start-ups focused on higher education or job-related skills \u2014 businesses that feed a market of colleges, companies and consumers willing to spend to promote career advancement.The financing trend highlights the difficulties facing the numerous young companies that develop apps for school use. Many of those tech start-ups have been able raise early-stage financing, often in comparatively small amounts; a subset of those, mimicking techniques established by popular consumer apps, have grown quickly by giving away their products.But industry analysts say school start-ups that have not yet figured out how to make money are likely to have a harder time raising mid-stage financing this year \u2014 which could lead to a bit of a shakeout in the industry.\u201cWe have yet to see that aha business model in the space,\u201d said Matthew Wong, a research analyst at CB Insights. \u201cThe pressure is now on those companies to show they can provide scalable revenue models.\u201dMany big companies also pay for corporate learning services to administer and track internal programs like sexual harassment training. That has already led some academic-focused start-ups to rethink their audiences.\u201cA very simple explanation is: In corporate, they have money,\u201d said Josh Coates, the chief executive of Instructure, an ed tech company that has broadened its strategy.In 2011, Instructure began marketing a learning management system, called Canvas, to universities and school districts. Last year, the company expanded its business into employee-training platforms for corporations. Mr. Coates said he expected that Instructure would eventually derive much of its revenue from companies, which pay higher fees than schools.\u201cIf they can make an employee 2 percent better by paying $50 for corporate training, they are going to do that in a heartbeat,\u201d Mr. Coates said. \u201cA school can\u2019t do that kind of calculation. It\u2019s not an obvious return on investment.\u201dInstructure went public in November and, as of the close of business on Friday, had a market capitalization of about $490 million.The increased availability of connected devices in turn has paved the way for a new generation of learning apps, websites and software services. Some have attracted large user bases by offering a free basic product to teachers while charging schools a site license fee to use a more premium product.Yet software start-ups hoping to sell to schools face particular challenges. The market is divided into about 13,500 districts, each with its own curriculum review and often monthslong purchasing processes. And while digital tools have great potential to make education more accessible and efficient, it is unclear whether the latest wave of technology will significantly improve learning and academic outcomes for the majority of students over the long term.Some ed tech start-ups are hedging their bets by expanding beyond schools to corporations, professionals and even parents.Because many school start-ups are so new, Mitch Kapor, a partner at Kapor Capital, a venture capital fund that has invested in more than 30 education start-ups, predicted that it would take seven to 10 years for the school ed tech market to become clearer.\u201cI think we will see some successes,\u201d said Mr. Kapor, creator of the software Lotus 1-2-3. \u201cBut we\u2019re also going to see lots of companies get off to a good start, falter, end up being acquired, or fail.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Only 74 of the nation\u2019s 3,200 primary schools are run by Educate Together, the main multidenominational alternative, whose Dublin schools are swamped with four applications for every available space.The public is fast realizing this is an intolerable situation in a country with an increasing immigrant population of non-Catholics and a rising generation of younger nonpracticing Catholics. A poll last month measured almost 85 percent public approval for changing the law so it no longer tolerates religious bias against schoolchildren.There is a citizens\u2019 petition to repeal the law and a legal challenge is planned by Education Equality, an advocacy group. The bias clause has been challenged by the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has taken a position against it, too.Church officials are at odds, with some urging a slow evolution toward a more open-door policy in the schools.

{"Headline": "Hello, They Must Be Going", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported bySports of The TimesBye-bye.The No Guarantee League this week did what it does best, which is to unsentimentally discard loyalties, cities and players in service of an owner\u2019s bottom line. The N.F.L. owners voted this week to let the billionaire owner of the St. Louis Rams move his team to just outside Los Angeles, a move consistent with this league\u2019s tear-\u2019em-up, toss-\u2019em-out ethos. The players know this drill. Fall out of favor with a coach? Take too long to recover from an injury? Unless you\u2019re an N.F.L. star, you have a problem. Garry Gillam, a behemoth of a man, offered a stirring story as he went from an undrafted player to starting at tackle for the Seattle Seahawks. He signed a three-year, $1.5 million contract. However, if in the next game he misses a few blocks or gets nicked up and his coaches tire of him, Seattle could release him and pay just the guaranteed portion of his contract, which is to say $12,000.Most American cities are offensive tackles. San Diego? Oakland? Cleveland? Buffalo? Baltimore? Ask league officials, and they\u2019ll assure you that they dig your collective pigskin history. But please. If the San Diego fathers and mothers fail to ante up for a new stadium, if Oakland fails to agree to sluice all the money from luxury boxes, seat licenses and naming rights into the pockets of a wealthy owner? Harry, call the moving van.St. Louis made a yeoman\u2019s struggle to keep the Rams. It found a pretty site alongside the Mississippi and offered to put up $400 million, and all the little extras that add up to $100 million here and $80 million there. They asked \u2014 politely, gently \u2014 that the owner Stan Kroenke pay $250 million or so, but he could have offset most of that by claiming all the money from the stadium naming rights.The Rams slotted the N.F.L. to contribute $300 million. Commissioner Roger Goodell treated that offer as a near inconceivable insult. \u201cThis premise is fundamentally inconsistent with the N.F.L.\u2019s program of stadium financing,\u201d Goodell wrote to the St. Louis Stadium Task Force.Goodell\u2019s annual compensation runs north of $30 million.All of which brings us to those owners. We\u2019ll start with Kroenke, a man whose father named him after the legendary St. Louis Cardinals slugger Stan Musial. Kroenke has done reasonably well in life: He is worth $6 billion, and his wife, who hailed from the Wal-Mart Waltons, contributed her own $4.9 billion to their connubial bliss. They live in a palazzo in Columbia, Mo., and so might have been expected to put a sentimental thumb on the scale for St. Louis.That would be no. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch obtained the Kroenke proposal to the league, making the case for the Los Angeles metropolitan area and against St. Louis. He was unsparing. \u201cCompared to all other U.S. cities,\u201d his proposal stated, \u201cSt. Louis is struggling.\u201dEt tu, Stan? The N.F.L. has baroque rules of self-governance, not the least covering how it splits revenue. Owners all share in television and general ticket revenue. But luxury boxes are pure gold, and a team\u2019s owner doesn\u2019t have to share a penny of that revenue with the owners of other teams.This has led to an arms race, as owners seek to build ever-grander stadiums with ever-more-luxurious boxes.\u201cIt\u2019s very hard for the great American cities of 50 years ago to compete,\u201d noted Victor A. Matheson, an economics professor at the College of the Holy Cross and a longtime critic of tax giveaways for stadiums. \u201cSt. Louis has a baseball team because of what they did in earlier centuries.\u201dIt is no different elsewhere. Five hundred miles to the north, Minneapolis, a handsome if currently frozen-solid city, has held tight to its Vikings. But it succeeded only after its politicians agreed to help build a mighty $1 billion ziggurat for the team. The mayor also sidestepped a law requiring a voter referendum before pouring hundreds of millions of public dollars into a sports stadium.In what amounts to an outbreak of intelligent self-protection, the citizens of San Diego, polls show, have opposed building a new stadium with tax dollars. \u201cIt\u2019s the billionaire stadium scam,\u201d said Don Bauder, a not-quite-retired reporter in his ninth decade who has charted all this for The San Diego Reader. \u201cThe roads, the sewers, the water: We have big infrastructure problems. That\u2019s where our tax dollars should go.\u201dThe Spanoses want to move their team to Inglewood. After an N.F.L. absence of several decades, multiple teams now vie to pile into the Los Angeles region. The competition has occasionally been silly. The entertainment company AEG wanted to build its own stadium next to Staples Center and so sought to beat back Kroenke\u2019s proposed stadium. To this end, it hired Tom Ridge, the former homeland security chief, who argued that Kroenke\u2019s proposed stadium was too close to Los Angeles International Airport. Terrorists might seek to crash an airliner into that stadium, Ridge said. It would be, as he put it, \u201ca terrorist event twofer.\u201dThis argument did not appear to embarrass him.The N.F.L. has agreed to let the Chargers move to Inglewood. The Spanos family will dicker a while longer with San Diego officials, trolling for a better deal. Then they will probably creep north, where Kroenke will dictate the terms of their partnership. Good luck with that. The No Guarantees League is nothing if not carnivorous.Email: powellm@nytimes.com Advertisement"}

We lost that somewhere along the way.\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Vance acknowledged that such programs have always faced an uphill battle in the State Legislature, usually running into obstacles in the Republican-controlled Senate, because some conservative lawmakers consider it unfair to underwrite education for prisoners when scholarships for law-abiding people are scarce.But Mr. Vance said that expanding college programs for inmates made sense from a crime-fighting standpoint because studies had shown that inmates who earned a college degree were less likely to return to prison.\u201cIf we don\u2019t provide an exit strategy for ex-offenders, they are just going to be re-offenders,\u201d Mr. Vance said. \u201cIt\u2019s just really common sense.\u201dThe college initiative is part of a broader agenda touching on criminal justice reform and social issues that the governor outlined on Sunday, including seeking an additional $100 million for so-called community schools, which aim to address challenges for students beyond the classroom, an approach tried in New York City and other urban areas. He also wants $55 million for jobs programs for at-risk youths, a category that includes those who have committed crimes.Some state prisons already offer a handful of college courses, but Mr. Vance said the new initiative would expand those programs by about a third. It would also improve them so that credits could be more easily transferred to colleges outside prison walls, a problem that has bedeviled the existing system.The proposal would offer colleges and other educational institutions up to $5,000 per student to provide a full-time course load of 30 college credits, according to the district attorney\u2019s office. Only inmates who have a high school degree and are within two to five years of completing their sentences would be eligible. Those serving life sentences would be disqualified.Mr. Vance said studies had shown that educated inmates were less likely to commit crimes when they left prison, an outcome even law-and-order-minded prosecutors could embrace.\u201cThis is a crime reduction strategy, and it happens to be around the issue of education,\u201d he said.That sentiment was echoed by Alphonso B. David, the governor\u2019s chief counsel, who said the plan \u2014 which would take effect this fall \u2014 would balance the need for public safety with the prison system\u2019s stated goal of rehabilitation.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen that educational programming is extremely effective in preventing recidivism,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen people make a mistake, we should provide a path to redemption.

{"Headline": "Robert H.B. Baldwin, Transformer of Morgan Stanley, Dies at 95", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byRobert H. B. Baldwin, a Wall Street maverick who presided over the transformation of Morgan Stanley from a prestigious but staid old investment bank into a modern, competitive financial services corporation in the 1970s and early \u201980s, died on Sunday at a nursing home in Skillman, N.J., near Princeton. He was 95.His son Robert Jr. confirmed the death on Wednesday.At the start of Mr. Baldwin\u2019s tenure, Morgan Stanley\u2019s partners and clients wore old-school neckties, lunched at the same clubs and relied on sure things: underwriting bonds, genteel integrity, assured profits. But as Morgan Stanley\u2019s gentlemanly mystique gave way to new regulations and cutthroat competition, Mr. Baldwin liked to remind them that he had worked his way through Princeton, and that his grandfather had been a railway conductor.In short, that he was not really one of them.A tough, brusque, often polarizing leader who struck colleagues as being out of place at Morgan Stanley, he was widely credited with pulling the firm out of its white-shoe rut into an era of enormous growth and painful change, less focused on exclusive services for blue-chip clients and more on the rough-and-tumble of securities trading, mergers and acquisitions and money management.As president from 1973 to 1982 and chairman until he retired at the end of 1983, Mr. Baldwin expanded Morgan Stanley into a full-service financial brokerage and changed a culture that had been entrenched for decades, with executive success often assured by family, social and educational connections.Morgan Stanley\u2019s tweedy underwriters dealt almost exclusively with the chief executives of corporate America \u2014 American Telephone, General Electric, Exxon, DuPont and other giants \u2014 playing golf, taking leisurely lunches, giving advice and managing the sales of bond and stock issues without dickering over commissions or competing in open markets. Those relationships were not abandoned under Mr. Baldwin.But after the Securities and Exchange Commission abolished fixed commissions on stock trades in 1975, changes were inevitable. For Morgan Stanley, which sold blocks of stock for institutions at set fees, the new rule meant a huge loss of easy revenue and a need to compete for commissions. It could no longer monitor markets from a distance, but had to get down on trading floors and skirmish for bids and prices.Mr. Baldwin created a trading operation from scratch, and hired a big staff for it. The firm had long looked down on the trading-floor crowd as coarse. Now it needed traders capable of split-second, high-pressure decisions, people with quick wits, stamina and guts. Other firms were raided for talent. Incentive pay sharpened performances. Collegiality faded, competition raced ahead.Other traditions also fell. To get closer to clients, Morgan Stanley gave up its hallowed headquarters on Wall Street and moved to Midtown Manhattan. It established new offices in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Instead of taking country club memberships, it rented Madison Square Garden sky boxes to entertain clients at Knicks and Rangers games.To compete for lucrative mergers and acquisitions, long shunned by Morgan Stanley\u2019s etiquette, Mr. Baldwin named dozens of new executives whose expertise was in equities and hostile takeovers, not social relationships. The firm also began taking start-ups as clients, handled initial public offerings of stock and moved into wealth management for private clients.By the time Mr. Baldwin stepped down, Morgan Stanley had become a full-service financial hub. Its staff had grown tenfold to 2,600 and its capital to more than $300 million from $7.5 million in 1970. It was still one of the most prestigious names on Wall Street. But historians said the cost had been great.Robert Hayes Burns Baldwin was born on July 9, 1920, in East Orange, N.J., to John Frank and Anna Burns Baldwin. His grandfather really was a Pennsylvania Railroad conductor. Robert graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1938. At Princeton, he ran a laundry to pay his way. He studied economics, played football, basketball and baseball, and graduated in 1942 with high honors. In World War II, he was a naval officer on two aircraft carriers.In 1949, he married Geraldine Gay Williams. They divorced. In 1981, Mr. Baldwin married Dorothy Tobin Ayres.Besides his son Robert, his survivors include another son, Whitney; three daughters, Janet K. Baldwin, Deborah Baldwin Fall and Elizabeth Baldwin Maushardt; two stepchildren, Mary Ayres Hack and W. Dillaway Ayres Jr.; and 13 grandchildren.Mr. Baldwin joined Morgan Stanley in 1946. He became a general partner in 1958 and a limited partner in 1965. From 1965 to 1967, he took a leave to be President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s under secretary of the Navy.As president and chairman of Morgan Stanley for a decade, he was an influential voice on Wall Street, quoted by the press when interest rates changed, inflation worsened or government agencies imposed new regulations affecting the industry.His 1975 prediction that hundreds of brokerage firms would go out of business as a result of the new S.E.C. rule eliminating fixed commissions was quoted often as its accuracy became apparent over the next few years. In 1978, he signaled Wall Street\u2019s cautious approval of a national market system linking the major securities exchanges electronically. And he spoke for many colleagues when he criticized President Jimmy Carter\u2019s tax reforms and enthusiastically endorsed Ronald Reagan in 1980.When he stepped down as chairman at the end of 1983, he joined a board that informally advised Morgan Stanley on policy matters and business ventures. From 1989 to 1992, he was chairman of the Lodestar Group, a New York merchant bank.In later years, as Morgan Stanley became a global financial operation with 1,300 offices and 60,000 employees in 42 countries, Mr. Baldwin was remembered by old colleagues as a man of rough edges and driven energy, awkwardly misplaced among the Ivy Leaguers but the savior of a proud institution.\u201cTo the last, Baldwin remained hypercompetitive and bent on having his way,\u201d Mr. Chernow wrote in his history of the House of Morgan. \u201cYet for all his flaws, the tough, tactless Baldwin had emerged as the most important person in modern Morgan Stanley history, giving the firm the market skills to compete in a world no longer based on old-school ties.\u201dAn earlier version of this obituary misstated the year of Mr. Baldwin\u2019s marriage to Dorothy Tobin Ayres. It was 1981, not 1961.Sam Roberts contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: Jane Mayer\u2019s \u2018Dark Money,\u2019 About the Koch Brothers\u2019 Fortune and Influence", "Date": "2016-01-12", "News": "Supported byBooks of The TimesThat effort may have backfired: Since that first article, Ms. Mayer has followed the trail of the tax-deductible \u201cdark money\u201d the brothers have secretly donated to political causes; absorbed the work of dozens of outstanding independent investigative journalists; ferreted out articles, speeches and interviews the brothers, or their advisers, have given, many of them quite revelatory; and secured access to previously unpublished sources.\u201cDark Money,\u201d the result of Ms. Mayer\u2019s research, is a persuasive, timely and necessary story of the Koch brothers\u2019 empire. It may read overly long and include some familiar material, but only the most thoroughly documented, compendious account could do justice to the Kochs\u2019 bizarre and Byzantine family history and the scale and scope of their influence.Ms. Mayer begins with Fred Koch, the family patriarch. \u201cOddly enough,\u201d she writes, \u201cthe fiercely libertarian Koch family owed part of its fortune to two of history\u2019s most infamous dictators, Joseph Stalin and Adolf Hitler,\u201d for whose regimes Mr. Koch\u2019s company built oil refineries in the 1930s.Largely because of his experience in the Soviet Union, Fred Koch became a staunch anti-Communist and, in 1958, one of the 11 founding members of the John Birch Society. His son Charles did not fully commit himself to his father\u2019s political project until the mid-1970s, when, Ms. Mayer writes, Charles Koch \u201cbegan planning a movement that could sweep the country.\u201d His declared goal? Nothing less than destroying what he referred to as \u201cthe prevalent statist paradigm.\u201dThe 1980 platform of the Libertarian Party, to which the Koch brothers provided financial support and on which David Koch ran for vice president, offered a preview of their anti-government zealotry. The Libertarians opposed federal income and capital gains taxes. They called for the repeal of campaign finance laws; they favored the abolition of Medicaid and Medicare and advocated the abolition of Social Security and the elimination of the Federal Election Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. \u201cThe platform was, in short,\u201d Ms. Mayer concludes, \u201can effort to repeal virtually every major political reform passed during the 20th century.\u201dNot surprisingly, given the extremism of their views, which William F. Buckley Jr. characterized as \u201cAnarcho-Totalitarianism,\u201d the Libertarians polled less than 1 percent of the votes. Ronald Reagan was elected president.As Ms. Mayer notes, the Kochs, instead of accepting the voters\u2019 verdict, chose to spend money changing the way Americans voted. \u201cDuring the next three decades,\u201d Ms. Mayer writes, \u201cthey contributed well over $100 million, much of it undisclosed, to dozens of seemingly independent organizations aimed at advancing their radical ideas.\u201dThe Kochs, Ms. Mayer is careful to remind us, are only one of several fabulously wealthy families that have tried to move America to the right. Their outsize influence is a result not only of their outsize fortune \u2014 according to Forbes magazine, the brothers are the fifth and sixth wealthiest Americans, with a combined family income larger than that of Bill Gates \u2014 but also of their intellectual prowess and organizational skills. For more than a decade, they have organized donor summits to which they have invited like-minded billionaires, political consultants, media celebrities and elected officials. At these meetings, plans are made, issues chosen, money raised, donations pooled, spending coordinated for the next election cycles.The Koch brothers and their allies insist, and no doubt believe, that their war on big government has been motivated by their commitment to the individual freedoms that government interferes with. Still, \u201cit was impossible not to notice,\u201d Ms. Mayer writes, \u201cthat the political policies they embraced benefited their own bottom lines first and foremost. Lowering taxes and rolling back regulations, slashing the welfare state and obliterating the limits on campaign spending might or might not have helped others, but they most certainly strengthened the hand of extreme donors with extreme wealth.\u201dOne of the more startling revelations in Ms. Mayer\u2019s book concerns the number of billionaires in the Koch network who have had \u201cserious past or ongoing legal problems\u201d and whose companies have been fined for violations of the Clean Air and the Clean Water Acts. Koch Industries, she reports, has been perhaps the most flagrant and willful polluter and scofflaw. According to the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s database, it was the No. 1 producer of toxic waste in the country in 2012.To protect their investments in coal and oil pipelines and refineries (somewhat pared down in the last decade), the Koch brothers have, Ms. Mayer points out, funded think tanks committed to raising doubt about climate change. They have also spent tens of millions of dollars to roll back environmental regulations and defund or abolish the federal agencies that write and enforce them.There are signs that the Kochs\u2019 influence may be waning. The Republican candidate they appeared to have favored, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, is no longer in the presidential race. Donald J. Trump, the candidate out in front, has made clear that he has no need for Koch money and has ridiculed those who \u201cbeg\u201d for it. Still, as Ms. Mayer reports, twice as many Koch network dollars will be in play in 2016 than were in play in 2012: $889 million, only slightly less than the $1 billion that the Democratic and Republican national committees each expect to spend on the election.David Nasaw is the Arthur M.

The full filings, with details on donors and the amounts spent by the campaigns, are not required to be submitted to the Federal Election Commission until Jan. 31.Mr. Cruz, who has been rising in polls, particularly in Iowa, raised nearly $20 million from October through the end of the year, according to a memo released Wednesday by his campaign. The figures were intended to show a muscular operation that can convert money into votes, with the total representing a two-thirds increase over the $12.2 million that Mr. Cruz reported raising from July through the end of September.\u201cWe will conclude 2015 with having raised over $45 million,\u201d Mr. Cruz\u2019s campaign manager, Jeff Roe, wrote in a memo that also laid out the campaign\u2019s number of volunteers, its fund-raising leaders in crucial regions and its overall preparedness for the long nominating contest ahead, which starts with voting in Iowa a month from now.Mr. Carson, meanwhile, reported raising roughly $23 million, a small increase from the nearly $21 million he raised in the previous quarter.The figures were notable given that Mr. Carson has recently slipped in polls after being pummeled by reports questioning some of the details of his life story, which he has used as the basis for his candidacy. The retired neurosurgeon has also struggled to answer elemental questions on foreign policy as national security has risen as a significant issue for voters.But several candidates had no plans to release numbers on Thursday, according to aides. For some, that was a function of the fact that the final day of fundraising could bring in more money. For others, delaying a potentially bad story about low fundraising to the end of January, the day before the Iowa caucuses, may be a factor.On the Democratic side, none of the three candidates had released their numbers by midday Wednesday. Martin O\u2019Malley, who trails behind Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders, is the only candidate who has applied for federal matching funds. He has reallocated staff members from his Maryland headquarters to Iowa in recent weeks, and has been said by people briefed on the matter to have had discussions about taking a bank loan based on the pending matching funds. Mr. O\u2019Malley\u2019s aides declined to comment on the discussions. Such loans based on the expectation of matching funds are considered fairly standard.Aides to Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders have recently tried to raise expectations for what the other side will report in its fund-raising numbers while diminishing perceptions of their own totals, engaging in the common practice of setting expectations before the numbers are actually released.Mr. Sanders has a strong base of low-dollar donors who can be tapped repeatedly, while Mrs. Clinton has relied more on traditional, larger fund-raising events.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Untangling an Accounting Tool and an Ancient Incan Mystery", "Date": "2016-01-02", "News": "Supported byLIMA, Peru \u2014 In a dry canyon strewn with the ruins of a long-dead city, archaeologists have made a discovery they hope will help unravel one of the most tenacious mysteries of ancient Peru: how to read the knotted string records, known as khipus, kept by the Incas. At the site called Incahuasi, about 100 miles south of Lima, excavators have found, for the first time, several khipus in the place where they were used \u2014 in this case, a storage house for agricultural products where they appear to have been used as accounting books to record the amount of peanuts, chili peppers, beans, corn and other items that went in and out.In some cases the khipus \u2014 the first ones were found at the site in 2013 \u2014 were buried under the remnants of centuries-old produce, which was preserved thanks to the extremely dry desert conditions.That was a blockbuster discovery because archaeologists had previously found khipus only in graves, where they were often buried with the scribes who created and used the devices. Many others are in the possession of collectors or museums, stripped of information relating to their provenance.Khipus are made of a series of cotton or wool strings hanging from a main cord. Each string may have several knots, with the type and location of the knot conveying meaning. The color of the strands used to make the string and the way the strands are twisted together may also be part of the khipus\u2019 system of storing and relaying information.Researchers have long had a basic understanding of the numerical system incorporated in the khipus, where knots represent numbers and the relation between knots and strings can represent mathematical operations, like addition and subtraction.But researchers have been unable to identify the meaning of any possible nonnumerical signifiers in khipus, and as a result they cannot read any nonmathematical words or phrases.Now the Incahuasi researchers hope that by studying the khipus and comparing them with others in a large database, they may find that the khipus discovered with the peanuts contain a color, knot or other signifier for \u201cpeanut.\u201d The same goes for those found with chili peppers, beans and corn.\u201cIt\u2019s not the great Rosetta Stone but it\u2019s quite an important new body of data to work with,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s tremendously exciting.\u201d For now, the 29 khipus from Incahuasi, which are about 500 years old, are kept in an unassuming brick house in a residential neighborhood in Lima, along with a scattering of artifacts from other excavations, including two mummies (of a child and a dog), some bags of human bones, dozens of fragile textiles rolled up between layers of paper, and numerous pots meticulously reassembled from shards.The house belongs to Patricia Landa, an archaeological conservator, who also keeps a menagerie of cats and dogs, including three hairless Peruvian dogs of the kind once raised by the Incas for food.It is Ms. Landa who takes the Incahuasi khipus, some of which were found neatly rolled up and others in snarled jumbles, and painstakingly cleans and untangles them and prepares them for researchers to decipher.\u201cYou have a very special relationship with the material,\u201d Ms. Landa, 59, said. \u201cI talk to them. I say, \u2018Excuse me for disturbing your rest but you\u2019re helping us to understand your ancestors.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIncahuasi, which means \u201chouse of the Inca emperor,\u201d was a city used in the late 15th and early 16th centuries as the base of operations for the Inca invasion of Peru\u2019s southern coast, after which it became a thriving administrative center, according to Mr. Chu, the archaeologist. It sat in the arid hills above the green valley of the Ca\u00f1ete River.\u201cThere was probably lots of movement, with llama caravans bringing in farm produce,\u201d he said.The storehouse where the khipus were found was probably used to keep food needed to maintain the large number of troops deployed in the invasion.The Incas, who were highly organized and governed a vast area, would have used khipus to keep track of provisions, and copies of the string records were probably sent to an administrative center, such as Cusco, the Inca capital, where they could be read, checked and perhaps filed. The Incahuasi excavation has even turned up what are essentially duplicate sets of khipus tied together, which the researchers believe could have been made when the same products were counted twice \u2014 perhaps to guarantee accurate bookkeeping.One khipu found at the site had its knots untied, suggesting that the information stored there had been \u201cerased\u201d by the accountants so that the khipu could be reused, Ms. Landa said.The khipus found at Incahuasi appear to be all about counting beans, literally. But colonial-era documents suggest that khipus had many uses in both the pre-Hispanic and colonial period that went beyond accounting, including to keep calendrical information and to tell historical narratives.Colonial records show that in some cases, such as land disputes, indigenous litigants would bring khipus to court and use them to explain or justify claims of land ownership, Mr. Chu said. He said that scribes would read the khipus and a court clerk would enter the information into the trial record.Mr. Urton has created a database of all known khipus, about 870 of them, with detailed information on two-thirds of them, recording their configurations, colors, numerical values and other information.Because the Incahuasi khipus appear to be relatively simple inventories of agricultural products, it may be easier to decipher them than the more complex khipus that record historical information, Mr. Chu said.And a breakthrough in deciphering the Incahuasi khipus could be a first step in reading more complex versions.\u201cIf we can find the connection between the khipu and the product that it was found with we can contribute to the deciphering of the khipus,\u201d Mr. Chu said.Mr. Urton said that the difference between the accounting khipus at Incahuasi and more elaborate khipus, \u201cis the difference between, let\u2019s say, your tax form and a novel.\u201d But they may also have key similarities: \u201cThey both use the same language, they both use the same numbers when they use numbers, and it\u2019s in the same writing system.\u201dThe excavations at Incahuasi have stopped because of a lack of financing. Much of the vast storeroom complex has yet to be excavated, and Mr. Chu hopes there could be more khipus there.\u201cIt was very exciting to find them,\u201d Mr. Chu said. \u201cWe started to find the storerooms and we didn\u2019t think we would find any khipus. Then we started to clear away the dirt and we saw the knots.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Challenging Uber, Lyft Bets on a Road Wide Enough for Two", "Date": "2016-01-09", "News": "Supported byThe word \u201cmonopoly\u201d has a distinctly nefarious ring to it, conjuring up images of thuggish industrialists in smoky rooms, scheming to undermine their rivals.Yet in Silicon Valley, it\u2019s not at all uncommon for one company to dominate a particular field. Google is the runaway leader in online search. Facebook is the largest social network in the world by a wide margin. Amazon is far and away the biggest e-commerce site.But while market dominance is hard to break, that doesn\u2019t stop upstarts from trying. In the case of Uber, it is Lyft that is doing its best to keep up.\u201cWe\u2019re gaining share in the United States,\u201d said John Zimmer, Lyft\u2019s president and co-founder. \u201cThat\u2019s not what happens when one player has a complete monopoly.\u201d\u201cThe mere possession of monopoly power, and the concomitant charging of monopoly prices, is not only not unlawful; it is an important element of the free-market system,\u201d Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in that opinion. \u201cThe opportunity to charge monopoly prices \u2014 at least for a short period \u2014 is what attracts \u2018business acumen\u2019 in the first place; it induces risk-taking that produces innovation and economic growth.\u201dIn the book \u201cZero to One,\u201d which he wrote with Blake Masters, the investor and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel offers tips on how to create monopolies, arguing that once achieved, they lead to more innovation.\u201cMonopolies drive progress because the promise of years or even decades of monopoly profits provides a powerful incentive to innovate,\u201d he writes. \u201cThen monopolies can keep innovating because profits enable them to make the long-term plans and to finance the ambitious research projects that firms locked in competition can\u2019t dream of.\u201dAnd regulators have not been cracking down on Silicon Valley. Given how many big technology companies loom large in their respective markets, there have been relatively few big antitrust actions brought against tech giants.\u201cThis is different from the old monopolies of the industrial age,\u201d Robert Reich, the former labor secretary, said of technology companies.Unlike United States Steel or Standard Oil, two of corporate history\u2019s biggest brutes, today\u2019s tech monopolies are rarely the exclusive provider of an essential commodity. Instead, many achieve their initial dominance by distinguishing themselves in a crowded marketplace, then rapidly taking market share thanks to the power of network effects \u2014 that is, the more people use a service, the more valuable that service becomes to other people, who join in and make the service all the more popular.Network effects helped Google, Facebook and Amazon run away from their competitors, and are helping Uber today. Google wasn\u2019t the first search engine, Facebook wasn\u2019t the first social network, and Amazon wasn\u2019t the first to sell goods online. There are still many other sites for search, social and e-commerce. But despite an array of options, users keep coming back to the market leaders.Some argue, however, that the regulatory framework needs to adjust for a new kind of market dominance.Along with network effects, another hallmark of today\u2019s tech monopolies is that, perhaps fearing obsolescence, they diversify. While Microsoft still makes its Windows and Office software, it also owns Skype and has a big video gaming business. Google is now a subsidiary of Alphabet, a new parent company that is also home to a health care company, a self-driving-cars division and a venture capital firm. Amazon is expanding its cloud computing and streaming-media businesses. And Facebook has diversified into messaging with WhatsApp, photos with Instagram, and virtual reality with Oculus Rift.This, too, creates challenges for regulators. When mergers and acquisitions are part of the natural life cycle of start-ups and venture capital, it isn\u2019t easy to block deals that might hypothetically reduce competition down the road. As a result, regulators have blessed many acquisitions that, to critics, appear to be deeply anticompetitive.Gary Reback, a lawyer who helped prompt a landmark antitrust investigation into Microsoft and is now pursuing Google in Europe, makes the case that Google bought its way to dominance in online advertising through the acquisition of DoubleClick, bought its leadership in mobile by purchasing Android and bought its strong mapping franchise in the deal for Waze. Similarly, Facebook bought two of its nearest rivals, WhatsApp and Instagram. If any of those deals had been blocked, Mr. Reback argues, behemoths like Google and Facebook might today be facing more concerted competition.\u201cOnce one of these companies gets a monopoly, it\u2019s easy to spread the monopoly to adjacent markets by acquisition,\u201d Mr. Reback said. \u201cYou would think antitrust enforcers would know this by now.\u201dWhile monopolies in the tech industry are perhaps easier than ever to achieve, industry experts contend they are also more vulnerable than ever before. The advent of the smartphone and widespread access to broadband Internet connectivity have democratized access to creative new technologies.\u201cSun Microsystems. EMC. Cisco. All these were considered the dominant market players in their category at the time,\u201d said Rich Wong, a venture capitalist at Accel Partners. \u201cThen the vast majority of them got whacked by this thing called the cloud.\u201dAnd of course, billions of people browse the web without Google, use other social networking apps besides Facebook, and shop on websites besides Amazon. Though no upstarts have replaced them yet, none are immune to disruption.As for Uber, if it\u2019s not a monopoly already, it is the giant in the ride-hailing market, at least in the United States. One rival, Sidecar, shut down last month, and Lyft is its last meaningful competitor on a national scale. (Uber faces a tougher road abroad, where it is tangling with regulators in Europe, recently withdrew from Frankfurt and is fighting against entrenched rivals in China and other international markets.)As the underdog, Lyft is trying to put more drivers on the road and acquire new users. Like Uber, the company is private, and neither shares much information about performance. But Mr. Zimmer said the company was quickly increasing market share in the United States. He also sees the on-demand ride business as different from search or social media and more like telecommunications companies, where several big competitors can compete on service.\u201cJust like AT&T and Verizon need three bars of coverage,\u201d he said, \u201cwe get down to two to three minutes of wait time for a vehicle to arrive. Once it gets to that point, there\u2019s no difference in behavior between services. That\u2019s when you compete on experience.\u201dStill, Lyft will be hard pressed to unseat Uber.\u201cThe network effects hold competition at stiff arm\u2019s length,\u201d said Steve Cheney, an entrepreneur and co-founder of Estimote, a micro-location platform for mobile developers.Or perhaps the ride-hailing market is big enough for both Uber and Lyft. Monopolies don\u2019t necessarily mean there is no competition whatsoever. While a company like Uber may take a huge lead in market share, others, like Lyft, may still have room to profit and even prosper. Even Google has not managed to squash every other search engine.\u201cMicrosoft has a decent search business. A lot of Yahoo\u2019s profits still come from searches on Yahoo properties,\u201d said Roelof Botha, a partner at Sequoia Capital, which has investments in WhatsApp and Airbnb. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a \u2018winner takes most\u2019 than a \u2018winner takes all\u2019 phenomenon.\u201dShould that be the case in the ride-hailing industry, Uber and Lyft may become something truly competitive by Silicon Valley standards: a duopoly.Advertisement"}

All parties hoped, and continue to believe, that the resolution of the nuclear issue would enable us to focus on the serious challenge of extremism that is ravaging our region \u2014 and the world.President Rouhani has repeatedly declared that Iran\u2019s top foreign policy priority is friendship with our neighbors, peace and stability in the region and global cooperation, especially in the fight against extremism. In September 2013, a month after taking office, he introduced an initiative called World Against Violence and Extremism (WAVE). It was approved by consensus by the United Nations General Assembly, giving hope for a farsighted global campaign against terrorism.Unfortunately, some countries stand in the way of constructive engagement.Following the signing of the interim nuclear deal in November 2013, Saudi Arabia began devoting its resources to defeating the deal, driven by fear that its contrived Iranophobia was crumbling. Today, some in Riyadh not only continue to impede normalization but are determined to drag the entire region into confrontation.\u0648\u0632\u06cc\u0631 \u0627\u0645\u0648\u0631 \u062e\u0627\u0631\u062c\u0647 \u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u06cc \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u062f: \u062a\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u062a\u0627 \u06a9\u0646\u0648\u0646 \u0628\u0627 \u062a\u062d\u0631\u06cc\u06a9\u0627\u062a \u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0636 \u0628\u0627 \u062e\u0648\u06cc\u0634\u062a\u0646 \u062f\u0627\u0631\u06cc \u0639\u0645\u0644 \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0633\u062a.Let us not forget that the perpetrators of many acts of terror, from the horrors of Sept. 11 to the shooting in San Bernardino and other episodes of extremist carnage in between, as well as nearly all members of extremist groups like Al Qaeda and the Nusra Front, have been either Saudi nationals or brainwashed by petrodollar-financed demagogues who have promoted anti-Islamic messages of hatred and sectarianism for decades.The Saudi strategy to derail the nuclear agreement and perpetuate \u2014 and even exacerbate \u2014 tension in the region has three components: pressuring the West; promoting regional instability through waging war in Yemen and sponsoring extremism; and directly provoking Iran. Riyadh\u2019s military campaign in Yemen and its support for extremists are well known. Provocations against Iran have not grabbed international headlines, primarily thanks to our prudent restraint.The Iranian government at the highest level unequivocally condemned the assault against the Saudi embassy and consulate in Tehran on Jan. 2, and ensured the safety of Saudi diplomats. We took immediate measures to help restore order to the Saudi diplomatic compound and declared our determination to bring perpetrators to justice. We also took disciplinary action against those who failed to protect the embassy and have initiated an internal investigation to prevent any similar event.By contrast, the Saudi government or its surrogates have over the past three years directly targeted Iranian diplomatic facilities in Yemen, Lebanon and Pakistan \u2014 killing Iranian diplomats and locals. There have been other provocations, too. Iranian pilgrims in Saudi Arabia have endured systematic harassment \u2014 in one case, Saudi airport officers molested two Iranian boys in Jeddah, fueling public outrage. Also, Saudi negligence was to blame for the stampede during the recent hajj, which left 464 Iranian pilgrims dead. Moreover, for days, Saudi authorities refused to respond to requests from grieving families and the Iranian government to access and repatriate the bodies.Throughout these episodes, Iran, confident of its strength, has refused to retaliate or break \u2014 or even downgrade \u2014 diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia. We have until now responded with restraint; but unilateral prudence is not sustainable.Iran has no desire to escalate tension in the region. We need unity to confront the threats posed by extremists. Ever since the first days after his election, the president and I have indicated publicly and privately our readiness to engage in dialogue, promote stability and combat destabilizing extremism. This has fallen on deaf ears in Saudi Arabia.The Saudi leadership must now make a choice: They can continue supporting extremists and promoting sectarian hatred; or they can opt to play a constructive role in promoting regional stability.

In the last quarter of 2015, there was a major investment slowdown; funding to private companies dropped 30 percent from the previous quarter, to $27.3 billion, the research firm CB Insights said.Jawbone is trying to retain employees by making sure they don\u2019t lose money as part of this latest financing deal. In order to do this, Jawbone said it would issue more shares to workers to make up for the reduced value of each share. This also increases their ownership stakes in the company by at least 25 percent, the spokeswoman said.Employees at Jawbone, as at most start-ups, have to work at a company for a certain period of time before they have the right to own their stock, a process known as vesting. Jawbone said the new stock it will issue to employees who have already earned the rights to their old stock will be fully vested, meaning they don\u2019t have to stay at the company for an even longer period before they can own the new stock.Last year, Jawbone laid off employees as part of a restructuring.

Instead, the co-writer and director, Adam McKay, gives audiences a timeline of Wall Street from the raunchy \u201970s on. There are glimpses of nudity and of the products and personalities that obsessed Americans over the years, when they might otherwise have tuned in to an impending economic meltdown: Christie Brinkley, \u201cTop Gun,\u201d the first iMac, \u201cSouth Park.\u201d Faced with a potentially stultifying subject, Mr. McKay offers an unlikely comic stroll through financial malfeasance.\u201cAdam\u2019s sense of outrage is infectious, but his anger doesn\u2019t preclude his ability to be funny about it,\u201d said Steve Carell, who plays a scrupulous hedge fund boss in the movie and who has known Mr. McKay since their days as improvisers in Chicago the 1990s. \u201cHe had a much finer political acumen than most people at Second City had at that time,\u201d Mr. Carell said, \u201ccoupled with an absurdist sense of humor.

He said he wanted the movie to be straightforward. \u201cWe\u2019re going to explain everything cleanly,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to seem complicated, you\u2019re going to feel dumb, but the truth is, it\u2019s not that hard.\u201dStill, whether these offbeat storytelling choices would work \u201cwas the big question on set,\u201d he said.Mr. McKay countered: \u201cWe actually did create a whole Brick back story. Our theory was that he just one day wandered onto a plane and ended up in San Diego, and walked in to the news station and just said, \u2018I like the weather. It\u2019s sunny out.\u2019\u201dFor the look of \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d Mr. McKay branched out from his comedy team, bringing in Barry Ackroyd (\u201cThe Hurt Locker,\u201d \u201cCaptain Phillips\u201d) as the cinematographer \u2014 because \u201cI wanted Wall Street to be messy and textural and sweaty,\u201d he said \u2014 and Hank Corwin, best known for his work with Terrence Malick, to edit.Mr. Corwin said he was \u201cbewildered\u201d to get the call from Mr. McKay. \u201cI told him, I\u2019m not a comedy guy. And he said, \u2018I\u2019ve got it covered.\u2019\u201dMr. Corwin worked on Mr. Malick\u2019s \u201cThe Tree of Life,\u201d which includes a sequence about the origins of the universe. \u201cThis actually was more complicated,\u201d he said.\u201cYou have to feel the world,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat were we thinking about? I didn\u2019t see the collapse coming. What was I busy with? What were we all busy with?\u201d\u201cThe Big Short\u201d may at least alter the course of Mr. McKay\u2019s career, or turn audiences on to his brand of serious-minded humor. He grew most excited discussing the hurdles for banking regulatory reform and his belief that \u201cthe good news is, corruption never works.\u201d But he laughed the most recalling an old collegiate habit. \u201cI\u2019m 47 years old, and if you told me there\u2019s a way to do crank phone calls, where we could block the number and still call, I would do crank phone calls for two hours,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll always be my favorite stuff.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It is still improvising solutions even as the war in Syria, which is helping to drive the exodus, looks likely to continue. Plans developed months ago by the European Union to relocate tens of thousands of migrants arriving in Italy and Greece have failed to gain traction, and fewer than 300 people have been moved so far.The bloc is still discussing whether to allow specialized border guards to take over responsibility from national officials in countries like Greece in order to ensure external security.In recent weeks, Germany has been moving to shift its policies as criticism mounts within the country that Mrs. Merkel has failed to clearly articulate a plan for an integration process that is likely to last many years.Since the start of the year, Germany has tightened its screening of migrants trying to enter the country from Austria, even as other European countries like Hungary have erected fences or border checkpoints to block or divert the flow of migrants.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders at a Crossroads: Attack Hillary Clinton or Stay Positive?", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Supported byThe senator has prided himself on running an inspiring, issue-oriented campaign, and he says often that he is not interested in tearing down Mrs. Clinton.But the decision he is now grappling with echoes questions voiced by his supporters as Mr. Sanders finds himself in striking distance of Mrs. Clinton in Iowa: Does he have the stomach to directly attack and potentially defeat her, or will he be satisfied having injected important issues into the race and preserved his reputation for eschewing negative campaigning?\u201cWe have options to go in different directions,\u201d said Tad Devine, the campaign\u2019s Washington-based senior adviser and media consultant, who said top advisers had planned to gather and weigh the question Wednesday.That night, at the end of a rally here, the campaign\u2019s spokesman, Michael Briggs, said the advisers had not made a decision.Mr. Devine declined to describe the advertising in detail, other than to say that the tougher ad would give \u201cnew information more in the wheelhouse of the kind of Wall Street argument.\u201d He was careful not to refer to the ad as negative, instead emphasizing that it highlighted differences between the two candidates.But it is likely that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign, which is especially sensitive to criticism of her connections to Wall Street, will view the ad as negative.The moment for Mr. Sanders is a significant one. If he was to prevail in Iowa and then go on to win in New Hampshire, where he is favored, he could generate momentum and financial support to present a serious challenge to Mrs. Clinton. A loss in Iowa, however, would probably diminish his standing, and his campaign could quickly lose steam.In an exclusive interview on board his campaign plane on Tuesday, Mr. Sanders seemed to be wrestling out loud with the conflict between his desire to preserve his reputation for positive campaigning and his eagerness to defeat Mrs. Clinton. He rejected any suggestion that his candidacy was only symbolic.\u201cWe want to win,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cWe think we have a good chance to win. We think Iowa has a historical role to play in making it clear that the American people want to move this country in a very different direction, away from establishment politics and establishment economics. And that\u2019s what we hope will happen.\u201dIn the interview on the plane, a leather-upholstered Gulfstream jet, during which he snacked on cheese wedges and kiwis, Mr. Sanders repeatedly described his campaign as positive. Nonetheless, he questioned Mrs. Clinton\u2019s acceptance of more than $600,000 from Goldman Sachs for giving three speeches.\u201cI am surprised that Hillary Clinton does not understand why so many people have strong concerns about her receiving many, many hundreds of thousands of dollars from Goldman Sachs and from many other financial interests,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cAnd I think people don\u2019t understand why she doesn\u2019t see the concerns that Americans have when you receive millions of dollars in speaking fees from Wall Street, the most powerful entity in America. You know, people can draw their own conclusions, but that is just simply a fact.\u201dMr. Sanders\u2019s remark drew quick fire from Clinton campaign headquarters.\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that Senator Sanders has abandoned his claims of a positive campaign in order to parrot Karl Rove\u2019s attacks,\u201d said a Clinton spokeswoman, Christina Reynolds, referring to a Republican strategist. \u201cThe truth is, Wall Street and hedge fund donors are running ads to defeat Hillary Clinton because they know she will hold them accountable.\u201dWinning in Iowa once seemed a dream for Mr. Sanders, an independent socialist who acted more as a progressive conscience complaining on the shoulder of the Democratic caucus than as a power player in Washington. But his campaign, with its promises of free tuition, universal health care, better race relations, a cleaner environment and a cleaned-up campaign finance system, caught the imagination of liberals, especially young ones.This month, Mr. Sanders suddenly seemed poised for victory here in Iowa, hitting his stride on the trail to the apparent alarm of the Clinton campaign. The usually press-wary Mrs. Clinton began calling in to cable news programs as her daughter questioned Mr. Sanders\u2019s electability, and her surrogates flooded reporters with critiques of his record on gun control.Overnight tracking surveys this week have steadied her campaign\u2019s nerves, and both sides agreed she had a slight lead here as of Tuesday.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers said she could now devote herself to pushing her agenda and leadership experience. But the Sanders campaign derided a new television ad released by Mrs. Clinton on Wednesday, tacitly suggesting he would add to Washington gridlock and fail to stand up to the gun industry. \u201cWe were disappointed but not surprised that Secretary Clinton has decided to broadcast a television ad in Iowa that completely distorts my record,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in a statement Wednesday night. Within the Sanders campaign, some advisers are eager for the senator to more aggressively exploit Mrs. Clinton\u2019s weaknesses, especially the doubts about her trustworthiness. Mr. Devine, a veteran of several presidential campaigns and a longtime adviser to Mr. Sanders, acknowledged some frustrations in the ranks. But he said the campaign had to reflect the tone of its candidate.\u201cI understand that people would want more confrontation,\u201d Mr. Devine said. \u201cBut what is important is that a candidate be comfortable delivering the message.\u201dPatrick Healy contributed reporting from Decorah, Iowa.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iran\u2019s Sanctions Lift, and the West Goes to Talk Business", "Date": "2016-01-25", "News": "Supported byIt represents the first wave of a broad rethinking of the Iranian market by Western businesses after they were banned from doing business there for nearly two decades. The nuclear deal led to the lifting of crippling economic sanctions on Iran that have left Tehran with a long shopping list, from planes to cars to oil-field equipment.\u201cThere is a huge demand for commercial vehicles, especially trucks,\u201d said Wolfgang Bernhard, the head of Daimler\u2019s truck division. Last week Daimler said it had signed letters of intent with two Iranian partners, Khodro Diesel and Mammut Group, to return to the Iranian truck market it had left in 2010.Credit also remains a serious obstacle as major Western banks are waiting for clarity from the United States Treasury regarding the \u201cstate sponsor of terrorism\u201d label. The label means that no money intended for Iran can move through American banks, something that is all but impossible to avoid in many modern transactions.For its part, Iran is promoting an investment law that promises tax breaks to foreign investors of up to 100 percent, the right to send revenue out of the country and protection of investments in case laws are changed. Still, some legal experts point out that the law seems to conflict with the constitution at some points.Conflicting views among Iran\u2019s political factions could also endanger investments, particularly involving products perceived as symbols of Western consumption. A newly opened restaurant calling itself Kentucky Fried Chicken (most likely a knockoff of its American counterpart) was closed in December by the morality police.One Moscow investment bank, Renaissance Capital, recently said in a note to investors that it expected foreign investors to follow an arc similar to that of investors in Russia in the 1990s \u2014 from enthusiasm to disillusionment \u2014 as Iran opens to the world.\u201cInvestors will likely learn the pitfalls of investing in a country with entrenched vested interests, from the clergy to the Revolutionary Guard, and surprising linkages between banks and companies that lead to some investments turning sour,\u201d the note said.On Monday Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, was scheduled to depart for Italy with a trade delegation. There he is widely expected to reach a multimillion-dollar pipeline agreement with the Italian company Saipem. Saipem is one of many European service companies that Iran hopes can help resuscitate aging Iranian oil and gas fields whose production has declined in recent years.Iran\u2019s economy has suffered as sanctions prevented the sale of its oil on the international market. It barely took a week after the sanctions\u2019 lifting, though, for local oil producers to move back into the global market. Iranian oil officials say they will increase crude production by 500,000 barrels a day immediately, and reach one million additional barrels by the end of the year, effectively erasing the decline over the past four years.\u201cThe Iranians are going to try and come back with a vengeance because they want to show they were unbroken by the international sanctions,\u201d said Helima Croft, chief commodities strategist at RBC Capital Markets, a division of Royal Bank of Canada.Iran\u2019s oil and gas fields are in dire need of infrastructure upgrades. In total, industry analysts say, Iran could spend up to $100 billion rebuilding its natural gas pipelines.Executives in the energy services business in the United States remain cautious.\u201cIt\u2019s not investable yet, not with these low oil prices,\u201d said Dragan Vuckovic, president of Mediterranean International, a Houston company active in the Middle East. Oil prices have collapsed in recent months to some of their lowest levels in years, falling briefly below $30 a barrel before bouncing back slightly.In addition, Mr. Vuckovic expressed concern about future United States policy toward Iran in light of Republican criticism of President Obama\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran. \u201cIran is O.K. under Obama, but what happens after him, we don\u2019t know,\u201d Mr. Vuckovic said.Before Mr. Rouhani\u2019s departure Monday for Italy, he said that two French automakers were also poised to secure new contracts, PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn and Renault, according to Iranian state news media. Officials at Peugeot and Renault did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The two largest American automakers, General Motors and Ford, said on Monday that the revised sanctions did not yet allow them to do business in Iran.Iran Air operates exclusively Western-built jets, consisting of around 40 planes with an average age of 25 years, including several Boeing 747s as well as models no longer in production, like the Airbus A300 and the Fokker 100.The orders, which are likely to be partly financed with loans from European export-credit agencies, could be announced as early as this week in Paris during a visit by President Rouhani, Mr. Akhoondi said.Airbus would not confirm that discussions with Iran were sufficiently advanced to lead to an order in coming days. \u201cAlthough Iran clearly has a need for new aircraft, we conform strictly to all applicable international laws,\u201d said Stefan Schaffrath, an Airbus spokesman in Toulouse, France.In response to questions about interest in Iran on the part of Boeing, the American aircraft giant, a company spokesman said: \u201cFor now, we continue to assess the situation.\u201dRichard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst with Teal Group in Virginia, noted, \u201cIt\u2019s in Iran\u2019s interests to overstate its commercial potential.\u201d Nevertheless, facing sluggish markets in places like Brazil, Russia and India, \u201cthe world\u2019s aircraft manufacturers are eager for any kind of new growth story,\u201d he said.Fatal air accidents have occurred with alarming frequency in Iran. Since the 1979 revolution, there have been 26 civilian plane crashes in the country, according to the Aviation Safety Network, claiming more than 900 lives.With a full lifting of sanctions on aircraft sales, analysts estimate that Iran\u2019s commercial fleet could expand rapidly to around 400 or 500 jets over the next five years, from around 150 planes today.Russian businesses, themselves hard hit by sanctions, along with slumping oil prices at home, are eyeing Iran as well. Sukhoi, the plane maker better known for making the fighters and bombers now streaking over Syria, is in talks to sell Iranian airlines 100 planes before 2020, Dmitry Rogozin, a Russian deputy prime minister, said late last year. Russian oil services companies say they are ready to sell to Iran\u2019s petroleum industry.Russia also expects military sales to pick up. Mr. Rogozin said that Russia began to supply S-300 antiaircraft missile systems to Iran. \u201cThis contract is now executed and paid for,\u201d he said.Reporting was contributed by Andrew Kramer, Thomas Erdbrink, Christopher Drew, Jack Ewing and Bill Vlasic.Advertisement"}

In fact, he was born in the front seat of a yellow cab.\u201dThe latest of several taxi-themed shows Mr. Pollack has had over the years, it is now in its third year on the air.This night, he had several guests in the studio, including William Guerra, 61, from Queens, a case study in how taxi medallions have plummeted in value since the popularization of Uber.There was also Tom O\u2019Connor, 85, a retired cabby whose claim to fame was driving for 50 years in Manhattan and never receiving a traffic ticket.During the hourlong show, Mr. Pollack made industry announcements, including vehicular recalls, a coming rally for livery drivers and a reminder not to drink and drive \u2014 for this, he cracked open a soda for a homemade sound effect.He yelled. He ranted. He scolded his guests to stop stealing his show. He fumed about a simple oil change that wound up costing him $279, leaving his next guest, State Senator Tony Avella, Democrat of Queens, on hold.Mr. Pollack publishes and edits The Taxi Insider, a monthly trade paper whose current issue has two photos of Mr. Pollack on the front page.He also works for the Melrose Credit Union, on Queens Boulevard. Mr. Pollack runs the Taxi Action Center there, working as a fixer for medallion owners and drivers, and lately as a therapist.Melrose is a major lender for taxi medallions, and Mr. Pollack buoys aggrieved medallion owners watching their investments plummet as the yellow cab industry takes a beating from Uber and other app-based ride-hailing services.\u201cI had medallion owners coming in here ready to jump off bridges, and I had to calm them down,\u201d he said.\u201cI tell them, \u2018Listen, the taxi industry has been around for 80 years and New York City is still a hailing town,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYellow cabs are the only ones allowed to pick up street hails.\u201dHe said that with a few key court decisions and some solid city enforcement, he thought \u201cwe\u2019re going to be all right.\u201dMr. Pollack, who grew up in the Bronx, said his father and grandfather were indeed New York City cabdrivers, not to mention an uncle and some cousins as well.Mr. Pollack insists the \u201cborn in a cab\u201d story is true \u2014 in his father\u2019s cab, rushing his mother to Bronx-Lebanon Hospital.By the time Dave was 7, Dad was giving him driving lessons in his 1962 cab, and taking him to the local taxi drivers\u2019 credit union.\u201cThe old-timers would tell me that during the Depression, there were signs on banks that said, \u2018No Dogs, No Cabdrivers,\u2019 and that taxi drivers had to save nickels and dimes to buy their medallions,\u201d Mr. Pollack recalled. \u201cSo I was brought into this world of taxi drivers and taxi owners at a young age, so I understand the financing side.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve sat on all sides of the taxi poker table,\u201d he said. \u201cI was an insurance broker, a medallion broker, the drivers\u2019 association, leasing agent association.

{"Headline": "My Accidental Career as a Russian Screenwriter", "Date": "2016-01-07", "News": "FeatureStifled by the Kremlin\u2019s impositions on free speech, I quit my job as editor of the Russian GQ and found freedom in cinema \u2014 sort of.Supported by\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c.On an October day last year, a large crew had commandeered the manor to shoot an episode of \u2018\u2018The Optimists,\u2019\u2019 a series I developed for Russia\u2019s Channel 2 about young Soviet diplomats in 1960. In this scene, set at a government dacha, they are joined by their American counterparts at the State Department for a daylong picnic that grows increasingly informal, involving drinks, flirtation, a guitar jam and (spoiler) contact between two spies. At times in my new job, I feel like a spy myself, and one with a shaky cover. I don\u2019t have a good answer for how I got here. Not only have I blindly managed to write Russia\u2019s most popular feature film and one of its most-\u00adtalked-\u00adabout TV series of the year, but I managed to do it in 2015, when relations between the United States and Russia were at their coldest point since the events depicted in \u2018\u2018The Optimists\u2019\u2019 (which deals with the aftermath of the Francis Gary Powers spy flight in 1960 and the Berlin Crisis).In the Russian news media, Americans are demonized daily as imperialists bent on weakening President Vladimir V. Putin. The fighting in Syria is presented as an old-\u00adfashioned proxy war. On the very same channel that will air \u2018\u2018The Optimists\u2019\u2019 next year, the political commentator Dmitry Kiselev brags about Russia\u2019s ability to turn the United States into \u2018\u2018radioactive ash.\u2019\u2019 In fact, relations between the two countries may be worse than they were during the Soviet era. Back then, Kremlin propaganda drew a line between good Western workers and the evil capitalists oppressing them; this time, with no clear ideological split between the two systems of government, the very humanity of the other side is being impeached.And yet here I am, hanging out by Lenin\u2019s deathbed, having somehow navigated a media landscape that should, by all accounts, have no use for me or my characters. I don\u2019t know if I am the exception that proves the rule, a designated useful idiot or simply lucky. The only thing I\u2019m sure of: It all begins with \u2018\u2018Rushkin.\u2019\u2019What happened was a drubbing. By the end of 2012, Putin was back as the president for a third term; dozens of opposition activists were in prison; the protests had curdled into an impotent intramural squabble; my job, meanwhile, turned out to involve an endless string of lunches and launches that seemed increasingly obscene as the Third Rome burned around me. I would report at the courthouse where the members of the band Pussy Riot were being tormented for dancing in a church, then throw on a blazer and run to pose against some logo somewhere. It felt absurd.Russia and the United States had exchanged the first salvos in the new cold war. Congress passed the Magnitsky Act, barring certain apparatchiks from entering the United States. In an asymmetric response, the Duma barred all Americans from adopting Russian children \u2014 a sudden jolt of direct discrimination, as my wife and I had been considering exactly that.At work, too, not a week seemed to pass without a new law designed to curb free speech. Hastily adopted legislation basically made it illegal to offend any social group \u2014 though as wielded by the authorities, the new laws primarily seemed to protect the strong from the weak. Impugning the Soviet Union\u2019s conduct in World War II was illegal. Disrespecting Russia\u2019s \u2018\u2018territorial integrity\u2019\u2019 was illegal. Mentioning drugs or suicide in a way that could be construed as \u2018\u2018instructional\u2019\u2019 was illegal, and prosecutors could use an agency called Roskomnadzor to shut down any website for so much as an unruly user comment. A vile anti-gay law banned speech that \u2018\u2018creates false equivalence between traditional and nontraditional lifestyle.\u2019\u2019 (This in a country whose pop stars\u2019 wardrobes suggest that Russia\u2019s biggest natural resource is rhinestones.) I had to fight Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s in-house counsel for the right to publish a positive review of the Liberace biopic \u2018\u2018Behind the Candelabra\u2019\u2019; he objected to the use of the word \u2018\u2018love\u2019\u2019 to describe a same-sex relationship.The genius of all these laws was in their purposeful inconsistency, which ensured that almost anyone could be silenced at any time; they were designed to be implemented capriciously, to weed out undesirables. Editing a magazine became hazardous to your health \u2014 mental and otherwise. GQ\u2019s political columnist, Andrew Ryvkin, was beaten up on the street by two pro-\u00adPutin writers of some renown, Sergei Minaev and Eduard Bagirov. I myself ended up slapping a Tatler editor on the steps of the Bolshoi Theater after he wrote anti-\u00adSemitic diatribes about me. This was shaping up to be the most surreal year of my life.One night, I called Ryvkin with a spur-\u00adof-\u00adthe-\u00admoment idea: \u2018\u2018Let\u2019s write \u2018Louie,\u2019 but about me in Moscow.\u2019\u2019 Ryvkin had a similar background to mine (he spent his formative years in Boston) and similar comedic sensibilities; we both worshiped \u2018\u201830 Rock\u2019\u2019 and Louis C.K. Three weeks, a few joints and several pizzas later, we had a pilot. The main character, a neurotic, blocked, broke Brooklyn novelist, comes to Moscow to promote his book, gets Jew-\u00adbaited on live TV by a glib Russian oligarch and reconnects with his childhood friend Roman, now an out-\u00adof-\u00adcontrol photographer modeled on Terry Richardson. The friends spend most of the episode crafting an appropriate response to the slur and finally head over to the oligarch\u2019s club to beat him up. When they get there, however, the offender offers the novelist a plum job in Moscow, forcing him to sell out on the spot.The script was a mishmash of autobiography and anger, filled with profanity, drug use, gay jokes, Nazi jokes and weird structural hiccups. I was venting every frustration of my day job. In a good measure of how little I cared about the pilot\u2019s suitability for Russian TV, I named its protagonist Matt Rushkin, \u2018\u2018Rashka\u2019\u2019 being an \u00e9migr\u00e9\u2019s derogatory term for Russia itself.As early as 2004, Putin had consolidated control over all television news, instituting a system in which the main talking points were beamed down from the Kremlin itself. Network heads took weekly instruction from Putin\u2019s deputy chief of staff, Aleksei Gromov, and his surrogates were inserted into the news organizations\u2019 management. \u2018\u2018Independent\u2019\u2019 journalism had been allowed to exist within only a few carefully watched playpens, including GQ. (Perhaps the most corrosive legacy of Putinism is the persistent belief among many Russian media professionals that the American media is run the same way.)But the regime left show business more or less alone. Oddly enough, for the first 20 or so years of its post-\u00adSoviet existence, the Russian government all but disregarded fictional entertainment as a way to promote new values. It was simply considered too frivolous to regulate. And so, in the sea of pap, islands of fine content have quietly proliferated. At Channel 1, as long as its news division is in line with the latest twists in Kremlin policy, the eccentric visionary Konstantin Ernst, who presided over the heady opening ceremony of the 2014 Sochi Olympics, does pretty much whatever he wants, from airing \u2018\u2018Mad Men\u2019\u2019 to handing prime time over to the indie director Valeria Gai \u00adGermanika, which would be a little like entrusting ABC to Harmony Korine. Channel 2, whose soap operas cater mostly to women of a certain age, occasionally puts on a lush mini-\u00adseries, often a literary adaptation (\u2018\u2018Life and Fate,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018And Quiet Flows the Don\u2019\u2019). And STS and TNT, which wisely refrain from news content altogether and thus elude Kremlin control, successfully mix lowbrow comedies with increasingly ambitious original dramas.Whatever censorship exists is mostly self-\u00adadministered. The timidity on display, though, is often hilarious: The Russian adaptation of \u2018\u2018Homeland\u2019\u2019 moved the action back to 1999, because nothing bad could possibly happen to Russia under Putin (at least on TV). At the same time, on \u2018\u2018The Kitchen,\u2019\u2019 a long-\u00adrunning original sitcom on STS, a main character is gay, and while jokes about his sexuality are roughly on the level of \u2018\u2018Police Academy,\u2019\u2019 they are not, per se, anti-gay. \u2018\u2018The Gym Teacher,\u2019\u2019 an edgier TNT sitcom, comments freely on right-wing nationalism and corrupt politicians. In the absence of hard guidelines (which is the way the Putin government generally likes it, the better to keep the citizenry on its toes), people are left to explore the boundaries of their own bravery.This all changed with the arrival of the current minister of culture, Vladimir Medinsky. Medinsky, a prolific writer and World War II enthusiast given to anti-\u00adWestern conspirology, quickly got to work implementing his agenda, which many see as fulfilling Putin\u2019s mandate. He started directly dictating his preferred topics to filmmakers (space exploration, sports achievements and plenty of World War II). He also took controversial steps to load the dice toward domestic product by pressing theater chains to adopt a minimal quota on Russian films (20 percent beginning in 2016) and move major Hollywood premieres up or down, lest they coincide with big Russian releases. Neither measure is likely to help. As more and more state money flows to \u2018\u2018socially significant\u2019\u2019 films about the glories of Russia, more viewers flock to \u2018\u2018Furious 7\u2019\u2019 or stay home streaming TV shows. Of the movies that have received state financing in the Medinsky era, the biggest hit in terms of profitability has been \u2018\u2018Kiss Them All!,\u2019\u2019 a wedding comedy.In late 2012, however, when I started writing \u2018\u2018Rushkin,\u2019\u2019 the government pressure was still low, the ruble was going strong and the sense of adventure was still in the air \u2014 especially on TV, where executives couldn\u2019t help noticing that the viewers, conditioned by Western series, demanded something more than local adaptations of \u2018\u2018Everybody Loves Raymond.\u2019\u2019 Unlike career screenwriters, I felt that I had nothing to lose. So I worked up the nerve to show the \u2018\u2018Rushkin\u2019\u2019 script around. The reaction of the first executive who read it was something out of \u2018\u2018Barton Fink\u2019\u2019 and roughly what I expected: \u2018\u2018When you\u2019re ready to make some real money,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018bring me something about a cop or doctor.\u2019\u2019The second reader, however, was Slava Murugov, the head of STS, who had by that point greenlighted a number of ambitious shows. He was looking to do something with an international angle. Murugov, in turn, showed it to Fedor Bondarchuk, one of Russia\u2019s biggest movie stars and directors (\u2018\u2018Stalingrad\u2019\u2019). Much to my surprise, Bondarchuk was interested; not only might he produce the show, he would also play the oligarch character himself. Even the main character\u2019s last name, which I thought was an affront to Russian common sense, might not be a deal breaker. Turned out there was an actual public person named Rashkin (pronounced the same). He was a Communist Duma deputy.The other offer was to write a sequel to Russia\u2019s top-\u00adgrossing domestic release of 2012, \u2018\u2018Soulless.\u2019\u2019 One of the very few Russian movies to have turned a domestic profit, the original \u2018\u2018Soulless\u2019\u2019 was a chronicle of yuppie redemption: The protagonist, a cokehead banker, falls in love with a protester vaguely inspired by Nadya Tolokonnikova of Pussy Riot. It was loosely based on a novel by Sergei Minaev \u2014 one of the writers who beat up Ryvkin. Now we had been handed his most prized possession.By New Year\u2019s of 2014, with all three projects deep in development, I resolved to quit GQ and focus only on screenwriting. I wasn\u2019t alone: All around me, Russian journalists were wriggling out of their regulatory straitjackets in print media for the relative freedom of film and TV work. My friends and colleagues Elena Vanina (a co-\u00adwriter of episodes of \u2018\u2018Londongrad\u2019\u2019) and Roman Volobuev even created a \u2018\u2018House of Cards\u2019\u2019-like TV series about the opposition winning the Russian elections. It was called \u2018\u2018Tomorrow.\u2019\u2019In scripts, this is the point at which a complication must arise. Cut, then, to Putin, in an office about a mile from mine, calculating that unrest in Ukraine would be a perfect time to lay claim to the Crimean Peninsula. Conceived in a Russia that was enthusiastically opening to new ideas, my stories would emerge in a different country altogether: belligerent, baleful, bristling with paranoia.My chief opposition was not ineptitude but apathy: Why try? \u2018\u2018A Russian viewer watches TV with his back to the screen while slicing salami\u2019\u2019 was the phrase I heard again and again, though less and less as the shoot went on. By the time my co-\u00adwriters and I were done, \u2018\u2018Londongrad\u2019\u2019 looked \u2014 well, not exactly authentic, but more like an American series set in London and inexplicably filmed in Russian.As for censorship, I kept expecting it and not finding it. The little restrictions I did encounter concerned the overall whitewashing of daily life typical for network TV (no swearing, no smoking, little alcohol) rather than, say, social satire \u2014 of which we sneaked in plenty.On March 5, 2015, while \u2018\u2018Londongrad\u2019\u2019 was filming, \u2018\u2018Soulless 2\u2019\u2019 came out in theaters. We had refashioned it into a corporate thriller in the vein of \u2018\u2018The Firm,\u2019\u2019 with the banker protagonist dragged out of a cozy exile on Bali and forced to infiltrate a corrupt state corporation. The prosecutors doing the forcing are then revealed as equally corrupt, with the scheme going all the way up to the Kremlin.I had no idea whether any of this would work at the box office: There had never been a Russian corporate thriller before, much less one in which the role of the evil corporation is played by the state itself. In the last scene, the main character is seen leading a huge street rally, like the ones that attracted me to Russia in 2011. The scene\u2019s meaning was deliberately left ambiguous: Is this a street protest or a sanctioned election rally? Is the hero an opposition leader, a new establishment fixture or a double agent once again? More important, who was I in this equation? By getting a film about Kremlin-\u00adlevel corruption into Russian theaters, was I doing something cool or just helping the system perpetuate the notion that Russia allows free speech?But I don\u2019t think audacity was the key to the movie\u2019s popularity. We simply made a decent genre movie in a genre that no one in Russia had tried before. Common wisdom \u2014 the same common wisdom that told me about the TV viewer slicing salami \u2014 held that a Russian audience wouldn\u2019t care about a main character who wears a suit to work. A soldier, a poet, an alcoholic, anyone but an urban professional. This left a huge demographic that had never seen itself portrayed in the Russian movies \u2014 the same one, incidentally, that came out to demonstrate for fair elections in 2011: white-\u00adcollar, westernized, middle-\u00adclass.But the real hurdle facing \u2018\u2018Londongrad,\u2019\u2019 one I didn\u2019t expect, wasn\u2019t that it was too Western. It was that it was too Russian. A common stance among educated Russians \u2014 the ones I imagined would enjoy \u2018\u2018Londongrad\u2019\u2019 the most \u2014 is to refuse to watch a series or a film simply because it\u2019s Russian. The first Twitter reactions to \u2018\u2018Londongrad\u2019\u2019 sounded the same note, over and over: \u2018\u2018It\u2019s watchable, probably because it wasn\u2019t filmed in Russia.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018As much as I hate everything Russian, I might give this one a try.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018God help me, I can\u2019t believe I am watching a Russian TV series.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018I might watch it later. I\u2019m in no mood to see my compatriots.\u2019\u2019 On a site devoted to romantic fan fiction, an author expressed her shock after combining two of the lead characters\u2019 names into one, as is the custom among fanfic writers (Misha + Alisa = Milisa): It was the first time in her memory that the names were Russian.So far, the only way I was able to make it in the Russian culture was to ignore the facts. Just like I blithely pretended that I was editing GQ, not GQ Russia, I would write my scripts as if they would end up at CBS or Channel 4 in Britain. I didn\u2019t force myself to inhabit the Russian point of view, even if my characters were ostensibly Russian, and instead wrote them from a remove \u2014 and I think that\u2019s precisely what worked, because the Russians themselves are tired of their centuries of self-\u00adexamination.For a while, it looked as if I would be working on \u2018\u2018Londongrad\u2019\u2019 again, but the studio spent so much of its rapidly devaluating budget on the first season that for Season 2, after the ruble\u2019s collapse, it could barely afford the main star (we were ordered to write in a way that would reduce his shooting days by 50 percent), the street scenes (60 percent of the London action now had to take place on a Moscow soundstage) and even, finally, myself and my writing team. As a result, the second season of \u2018\u2018Londongrad\u2019\u2019 was a bit like a community-\u00adtheater production of the first season. But at least it got made.Which is more than I can say for \u2018\u2018Rushkin,\u2019\u2019 the semiautobiographical sitcom that started the whole adventure. By late 2014, Slava Murugov, the channel head who greenlighted the show, had left STS, and the new management killed \u2018\u2018Rushkin\u2019\u2019 three days before production was scheduled to begin. A year later, a strangely similar sitcom appeared on STS, titled \u2018\u2018How I Became Russian.\u2019\u2019 The main character was a New York journalist in horn-\u00adrimmed glasses who gets stuck in Moscow after befriending a baldheaded oligarch and a trickster named Roman. But the jokes now skewed broad and anti-\u00adWestern; the show\u2019s marketing slogan proclaimed \u2018\u2018We will make a man out of an American!\u2019\u2019 At the end of each episode, the hero, like Doogie Howser, opened his laptop and tapped out a valuable lesson he learned about Russia: I have learned that Russian people have big souls, etc.It\u2019s fully dark out now, and we\u2019re shooting the Americans\u2019 departure. It\u2019s the last shot of the night. The Cadillac rolls down a gravel alley; the sozzled diplomats are hanging out the windows, waving and yelling goodbyes, until they vanish in the night and I am, once again, the only American on set.As for the cowboy outfit: I have compromised right down the middle. The hat comes off. The neckerchief stays on.Michael Idov is a screenwriter and novelist. After two and a half years in Moscow as the editor of GQ Russia, he now lives in Berlin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.N.-Appointed Panel Calls for a Tax to Pay for Crises", "Date": "2016-01-17", "News": "Supported byUNITED NATIONS \u2014 What if the next time you buy World Cup tickets or summon an Uber ride, you found yourself paying a few cents extra to pay for winter blankets for Syrian refugees or clean water for those displaced in Darfur, Sudan?The nine-member panel\u2019s report comes as new conflicts erupt in places like Yemen, old ones persist in places like Darfur and climate change intensifies floods and droughts in already fragile countries. Aid for the millions of people affected has sharply risen, but it has not kept pace with demands.The panel \u2014 which includes representatives of donor governments, corporations and civil society \u2014 takes pains to point out that despite the growing needs, what the world needs to pony up for emergency relief is a fraction of the $78 trillion global economy. It also argues that in the end, while \u201chelping people in distress is morally right,\u201d providing aid is also in the interest of donor countries.\u201cToday\u2019s massive scale of instability and its capacity to cross borders, vividly demonstrated by the refugee crisis in Europe, makes humanitarian aid a global public good that requires an appropriate fund-raising model,\u201d the report says.The conventional wisdom for the humanitarian aid sector had been that most conflicts would be short-lived \u2014 and that aid agencies could rely on voluntary contributions from a handful of rich nations to meet those needs. That wisdom no longer always applies. For instance, some conflicts drag on for so long that those who are displaced from their homes remain displaced for an average of 17 years. Countries that host refugees feel the impact acutely, but do not always have direct access to donor money. And refugees are often prohibited from working in the countries where they are living.The report also suggests tapping into what it calls \u201cIslamic social finance\u201d to help meet humanitarian needs in the Muslim world in particular. That could include earmarking a portion of \u201czakat,\u201d the ritual annual donation that Muslims are urged to make as an element of their faith.In addition, the panel suggests that middle-income countries like Jordan, which is hosting hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees, should be able to tap into grants and loans that are currently available only to the poorest countries.The report urges money transfer agencies to drop their fees, which is a nod to the importance of remittances from migrants to their home countries, especially in times of crisis. The authors of the report also encourage more cash assistance, rather than food, tents and blankets. They cite one 2014 study in which 70 percent of a sample group of Syrian refugees traded \u201cin-kind assistance they received for cash.\u201dThe authors nudge newly wealthy countries to be more generous, suggest that aid officials should tap the private sector more creatively, and fault some United Nations agencies for failing to systematically track and report on how its donor money is spent.The panel members could not agree on exactly what to tax, nor the rates at which to tax. That absence of consensus was a measure of how difficult it could be to come up with such a humanitarian tax. But it has an important backer: one of the leaders of the panel, Kristalina Georgieva of Bulgaria, the European Commission\u2019s vice president for budget and human resources. \u201cI\u2019m in support of a voluntary levy,\u201d she told reporters in a briefing before the report was released. She added that the taxes could be small ones on concerts, sports events, even taxi rides.Ms. Georgieva is among those whose names have been floated as Mr. Ban\u2019s potential successor as secretary general.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "President Xi Jinping of China Is All Business in Middle East Visit", "Date": "2016-01-30", "News": "Supported byMemo From BeijingBEIJING \u2014 When President Xi Jinping of China traveled to the Middle East this month he dropped in on two regional rivals, Saudi Arabia and Iran, a feat few global leaders could pull off.The risk of arriving in the middle of a huge dispute between the Saudis and Iranians paid off, delivering what Mr. Xi no doubt considered an important prize as he tries to extend China\u2019s prestige abroad.He became the first world leader to visit Iran after the completion of the deal on Iran\u2019s nuclear program that the United States and Russia worked on together with China\u2019s support. Arriving so soon after the lifting of sanctions provided an optimum moment for China to set the stage for its future deal making.China\u2019s deep economic interests in the Middle East carry little of the historical overlay of the empire building and alliance shaping of the European powers. France colonized Syria, the British carved out Saudi Arabia, the United States meddled in Iran in the 1950s, and Washington and Tehran became implacable enemies after the Islamic revolution of 1979. China, weak and minding its own affairs at home, was absent at all those milestones.That is not to say China always refrained from taking sides. China was a major supplier of arms to Tehran during the Iran-Iraq war when the United States and Europe imposed an arms embargo. That military relationship is likely to be revived when a more recent arms embargo on Iran is eased, though that is not likely any time soon.But for the moment, China is concentrating on buying and selling in the Middle East, and playing Riyadh and Tehran off each other for better oil deals, leaving the strenuous diplomacy to the United States.China is wary of the Islamic State, but is not hugely motivated to enter the Syrian conflict. \u201cThe Middle East is the graveyard of great powers,\u201d said Li Shaoxian, a former vice-president at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, a government research institute. \u201cChina doesn\u2019t really care who takes the presidency in Syria in the future \u2014 as long as that person could stabilize and develop the country, we would agree.\u201dMr. Xi began his trip in Saudi Arabia, China\u2019s biggest oil supplier, which is looking to recoup its diminished oil sales to the United States with increased supplies to China, an objective that may be hard to achieve given China\u2019s economic slowdown. With King Salman, Mr. Xi visited the Yasref oil refinery, China\u2019s largest investment project in Saudi Arabia, a joint effort between Sinopec, the Chinese state-owned energy giant, and Saudi Aramco.In Cairo, Mr. Xi met with President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the military strongman whose rule signifies the definitive end of the Arab Spring uprising that the Chinese government was so afraid might infect its own people. There he splashed around $1 billion in financing for Egypt\u2019s central bank and a $700 million loan to the state-owned National Bank of Egypt.At the Arab League, a traditional platform for American leaders, Mr. Xi promised to be different from the other big powers. China would not seek proxies or spheres of influence in the Middle East, he said in a speech filled with loans of eye-popping sizes to Arab countries.Iran was the most intriguing stop. Mr. Xi\u2019s arrival was preceded with a glowing article in the Iranian press about the legendary Silk Road that flourished during the Tang dynasty. And he extended an invitation to Iran to join the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a regional security group.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.Under the sanctions regime imposed on Iranian oil by the United States, China was \u201cpretty good\u201d in terms of compliance, said Edward Chow, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Now China wants to be first in line for consideration as Iran\u2019s oil and gas sector opens up, he said.Access to Iran\u2019s market may not be automatic for another reason. Iranian businessmen have grumbled that the Chinese muscled out domestic industry during the sanctions, and flooded the country with cheap goods.In the longer term, the Chinese could do well in military sales, said Suzanne Maloney, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \u201cThe roots of the economic relationship between China and Iran are in fact in the military arena,\u201d Ms. Maloney said.The Chinese-manufactured J-10 fighter jet has long been seen as a likely weapon for Iran, a possibility that Israel has objected to. But China cannot sell the J-10 without a green light from Washington until 2020, and the likelihood of China flouting the arms embargo is \u201chighly improbable at best,\u201d Ms. Maloney said.The Israelis should not worry, said Yin Gang, a research analyst at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences who has written books on China\u2019s relationships with the Middle East.Iran is sure to purchase fighter jets from Europe, Russia or China, and \u201cit would pose the smallest threat to Israel and Arabic countries if they buy the Chinese jet, which is inferior in performance,\u201d he said.There is little risk, Mr. Yin added, that China will become actively involved in the fight against the Islamic State. China might provide some economic help on the antiterrorism front but a military contribution was out of the question. \u201cWe simply have no such military might,\u201d he said. \u201cHow could China send soldiers there? It would be like sending new corpses.\u201dThe Memo From Beijing article on Jan. 31, about the serendipitous timing of a visit by China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, to Iran \u2014 coming just as international sanctions against Iran had been lifted \u2014 referred incorrectly to the deal Iran reached with world powers last summer. It is meant to prevent Iran from being able to make nuclear weapons; it is not an agreement to eliminate such weapons \u2014 which Iran does not have. The article also misspelled the surname of a research analyst at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences who said the possibility that Iran would someday buy the Chinese-manufactured J-10 fighter jet should not concern Israel. He is Yin Gang, not Ying.Yufan Huang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Foursquare Raises $45 Million, Cutting Its Valuation Nearly in Half", "Date": "2016-01-14", "News": "Supported byOn Thursday, Foursquare said it had raised $45 million in a new round of venture funding, as it tries to bolster its location data-based advertising and developer businesses. The financing pegs Foursquare\u2019s valuation at roughly half of the approximately $650 million that it was valued at in its last round in 2013, according to three people with knowledge of the deal\u2019s terms, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Foursquare, which is based in New York, is likely to be joined by other start-ups this year in doing what is known in investing circles as \u201cdown rounds,\u201d in which companies that once raised money at soaring valuations are forced to accept funding at lower values. While tech start-ups boomed in recent years \u2014 with many easily attracting investors and big sums \u2014 that environment has now turned on fears that many of these young companies got ahead of themselves.\u201cThe short of it is, expect more down rounds,\u201d said Anand Sanwal, chief executive of CB Insights. \u201cYou might be able to raise, but not at the valuation you might have gotten even just a year ago.\u201d\u201cEveryone thought we were going to be the company that toppled Facebook, which is crazy talk,\u201d Mr. Crowley, 39, said in an interview. Still, he added, \u201cwe\u2019re building a really amazing, very scalable business around the many successful products we\u2019ve built that people love.\u201d\u201cTo raise $45 million in this environment, and on very employee-friendly terms, is a testament to the real business we have,\u201d said Jeff Glueck, Foursquare\u2019s chief operating officer, who is being promoted to chief executive. Steven Rosenblatt, the chief revenue officer, will also shift roles to become president.The executive moves reflect Foursquare\u2019s future direction, said Mr. Crowley, who added that his new role would be more advisory. \u201cI know what my strengths are \u2014 building, prototyping and making things from scratch,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe it\u2019s important for Foursquare to be run by executives who have previous experience scaling companies.\u201dAt its birth, Foursquare made a splash as a pioneer of using the global positioning technology found in Apple\u2019s iPhone. The app let people \u201ccheck in\u201d to venues and businesses, a type of social game that quickly rose in popularity among tech elites and young audiences.As of early 2012, Foursquare said it had 1.5 billion check-ins and 15 million users. The company began making money by selling location-based ads to local businesses; a sandwich shop, for instance, could send a coupon in the form of a smartphone notification to a Foursquare user walking by its restaurant, all using the GPS technology running in the background of the app.But the location check-in quickly became a standard feature among other apps like Instagram and Facebook, and users became less interested in the gamelike aspect of Foursquare. The start-up shifted direction to focus on \u201cdiscovery,\u201d and split itself into two apps: Swarm, an app for check-ins, and Foursquare, which recommends users to nearby restaurants and venues based on their location and preferences.That vision, which has had stop-and-start degrees of success, has also changed over time. Today, Foursquare\u2019s business is primarily selling data and insights about consumer trends to developers. Foursquare said it planned to spend its new capital on bolstering that business, which accounts for a majority of its revenue. The company says it now has 50 million monthly active users and has had 7.8 billion check-ins.Even with the new capital, down rounds can be brutal on start-ups for several reasons. In addition to any shifts in the public perception of a company\u2019s fortunes, employees who had joined at the higher value may find the equity they own isn\u2019t worth as much as it once was. Investors who bought in at the higher value also will see the worth of their stakes decline.\u201cIn a down round, there are a few folks who can suffer,\u201d said Mr. Sanwal of CB Insights.Foursquare\u2019s new financing was led by the venture capital firm Union Square Ventures, which was an existing investor in the company. Other previous investors including Andreessen Horowitz and DFJ Growth, as well as a new participant, Morgan Stanley, are also involved in the new funding.\u201cLocation is one of the linchpins for creating compelling experiences on mobile,\u201d said Albert Wenger, managing partner at Union Square Ventures.The funding will buy Foursquare some time to prove that its new vision can become a reality. The company said it planned to hire 30 more employees across sales, engineering and other divisions to meet what it expects to be great demand for the location platform.\u201cGood things happen to companies who are performing really well,\u201d Mr. Crowley said. \u201cIf we continue performing how we have been, we\u2019ll find that we have a lot of options down the line.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Price of Republican Orthodoxy", "Date": "2016-01-20", "News": "Supported byIn the report, David C. Maurer, the director of homeland security and justice issues at the G.A.O., wrote:Under federal law, there is no basis to automatically prohibit a person from possessing firearms or explosives because they appear on the terrorist watch list. Rather, there must be a disqualifying factor (i.e., prohibiting information) pursuant to federal or state law, such as a felony conviction or illegal immigration status.On another level, these votes illuminate a conservative orthodoxy that dominates Republican politics. In some way, this orthodoxy is analogous to the liberal orthodoxy known as political correctness.There are adverse consequences for the nation in adherence to doctrinal conservatism.It is more interesting to see how climate change opposition plays out in Republican-controlled states facing the brunt of rising seawaters.In the memo, he flatly rejected all compromise strategies in negotiations with the Clinton administration:Any Republican urge to negotiate a \u201cleast bad\u201d compromise with the Democrats, and thereby gain momentary public credit for helping the president \u2018do something\u2019 about health care, should also be resisted.Instead, the first step in a bid to revive \u201ca newly bold and principled Republican politics,\u201d Kristol wrote,must be the unqualified political defeat of the Clinton health care proposal. Its rejection by Congress and the public would be a monumental setback for the president; and an incontestable piece of evidence that Democratic welfare-state liberalism remains firmly in retreat.During the Obama years, the Kristol strategy has become fully operational for Republicans dealing with administration proposals.In many ways, the Republican strategy of huge resistance has backfired on the party itself.The Trump campaign \u2014 with its angry, \u201ctruth telling,\u201d transgressive style \u2014 might open the door to a less hidebound, more honest politics in the future.

(The city, which still finances the system\u2019s two-year colleges, now puts about $30 million a year toward the four-year campuses.)It is a history that Mr. Cuomo and his aides often deploy at opportune moments. Their argument: With the city restored to financial health, it is time to reassess.Given the city\u2019s one-third representation on the university system\u2019s board of trustees, the governor and his aides said, it made even more sense for the city to pay a commensurate share of the costs.From the city\u2019s perspective, the sudden four-decade rewind is a \u201cshock to the system,\u201d said Carol Kellermann, executive director of the Citizens Budget Commission, who cautioned against accepting the governor\u2019s rationale too readily. \u201cBecause something was done that way before the 1970s doesn\u2019t mean that the crisis didn\u2019t cause us to rethink these things in a more thoughtful and appropriate way.\u201dMr. Cuomo appeared to soften his language on Thursday, when he said on NY1 that this was only the beginning of a budgetary discussion that would take months.\u201cAt the end of the day, there will be no cut to CUNY,\u201d he said on NY1. \u201cI want to see more money at CUNY at the end of the day, and more money in the classroom.\u201dA spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo, Dani Lever, explained in a statement that the state wished to redirect savings from \u201cbureaucratic costs\u201d to academics, and that it needed the city\u2019s cooperation to do so.But the budget\u2019s trumpeting of a $6.9 billion \u201cinvestment\u201d in CUNY and the State University of New York system papers over a decline in overall state financing over the past several years, leaving the CUNY unions torn between cheering for Mr. Cuomo\u2019s decision to make money available for a possible labor agreement and protesting what amounts to a $485 million cut in state funding.Since before the 2008 recession, the amount of per-student funding that CUNY receives from the state has declined 17 percent, adjusted for inflation. At the same time, tuition has risen by $300 in each of the last five years as a result of legislation backed by the governor that combined tuition increases with greater financial aid. Mr. Cuomo\u2019s proposed budget would extend that legislation another five years.\u201cIt used to be free, and now we\u2019re seeing it go up every year for the next decade,\u201d said Chika Onyejiukwa, a junior at Hunter College who serves as the CUNY student senate\u2019s vice chairwoman for legislative affairs. \u201cSo the financial burden is being placed on CUNY, and students more so.\u201dBarbara Bowen, president of the Professional Staff Congress, said the squabbling between the city and state over who should pay for what obscured a more urgent problem.Responding to a persistent budget shortfall that stood at about $51 million last year, CUNY has cut down on courses, jettisoned part-time faculty members and skimmed money from student services and even laboratory supplies. What classes remain are getting larger, Ms. Bowen said, and faculty members frustrated by the lack of raises have moved on to other jobs.\u201cIt\u2019s just a constant, constant austerity, even though we\u2019re way past the recession,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we say that the discussion should be about increasing resources to CUNY after this long starvation, not just who\u2019s going to take responsibility for already inadequate funding.\u201dMichael M. Grynbaum contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Taxing Google and Other U.S. Giants Is Dividing Europe", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byBRUSSELS \u2014 For some European nations, big American corporations like Google are seen primarily as employers and technological innovators whose presence can help with their global competitiveness.But for others, the multinational giants are seen as having used complex accounting to sidestep corporate taxes. That, some argue, makes them prime targets at a time when governments are grasping for revenue to fill budget deficits and trying to address populist concerns about inequality.The divide, long present in Europe, is playing out with new intensity.European Union officials in Brussels are intent on imposing a blocwide standard for taxation and clawing back what they consider to be improper tax breaks granted by national governments to multinational companies.While some countries like France and Germany are happy to see back taxes collected from big corporations as a result of the effort, others are essentially saying they would rather the companies keep all or some of their tax breaks as long as they bring prosperity.The difference in approach may not rank with more existential problems for the European Union, like how to control the migrant influx without sacrificing open borders across much of the Continent. But it shows how tax policy cuts to the core of economic competitiveness for most countries in Europe, where sustained growth and balanced budgets have been hard to achieve lately.Ms. Vestager made her comments about Britain\u2019s deal with Google on the same day that the European commissioner for financial affairs and taxes, Pierre Moscovici, proposed measures meant to close a number of corporate tax loopholes across the European Union.The European Union wants no member state to use tax policy to achieve an unfair business advantage over its neighbors. But the ability of European countries to tailor tax practices to their own purposes is a matter of national sovereignty that many leaders are unwilling to cede to Brussels. That is true for the countries that are trying to compete for jobs and foreign investment brought by multinational titans like Google, Apple or Facebook as well as for those trying to wring more tax revenue from rich companies to help support a struggling economy.\u201cNational governments have competing objectives here,\u201d Neal Todd, an international tax expert and partner at the law firm Berwin Leighton Paisner, wrote in an email message to reporters on Thursday. \u201cWhilst nearly all governments want multinationals in general (and U.S. tech groups in particular) to pay more tax,\" he wrote, \"none of them want to change their own rules only to find that businesses simply relocate to warmer fiscal climes.\"Although the British prime minister, Mr. Cameron, defended his Google deal, his political opponents have criticized it as too generous to the company and not reflective of the full magnitude of its British revenue for the 10 years it covers.In studying the Cameron-Google agreement, Ms. Vestager may follow up on a request of the Scottish National Party, a British opposition party, which has sent a letter to the European Commission criticizing the tax deal with the search giant. A spokesman for Ms. Vestager\u2019s office said on Thursday that the complaint would need to be studied to see if it warranted a formal investigation.The issue could be particularly delicate, coming as Mr. Cameron has been trying to negotiate better terms for Britain within the European Union. As soon as June, Britain may hold a referendum in which voters would be asked whether they want to remain in the bloc or leave it.But Christian Cubitt, a Cameron spokesman, declined on Thursday to elevate the tax dispute to the level of the debate on Britain\u2019s place in the European Union. He said simply that it was \u201ca decision for the commission\" to decide whether to investigate, although he stressed that Google had agreed to pay all the tax that is due.Britain is by no means alone in seeking to handle corporate tax matters on its own terms.Italian financial police officials were to issue an investigative report to Google on Thursday, indicating whether the company has paid sufficient taxes in Italy since 2008. Although Google has not been accused of wrongdoing, tax officials say the delinquent amount could be about 300 million euros, or about $325.3 million.Google is also in discussions with France over back taxes. Last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the company\u2019s executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, met with the French economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, to discuss the matter.There has been no public discussion of how much in back taxes is being sought by France\u2019s Socialist government, but local news reports have placed the figure as high as \u20ac500 million.Google\u2019s official response to reports of those negotiations has been the same, which it repeated yesterday: \u201cGoogle complies with the tax laws in every country where we operate. We continue to work with the relevant authorities.\u201dThe biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Ms. Vestager is also investigating tax arrangements between Ireland and Apple, and Luxembourg and Amazon over whether the companies received preferential tax deals that broke the European Union\u2019s state-aid rules. A decision in the Apple case is expected in March, at the earliest; the Amazon case could also be decided in the coming months. The companies and governments say they have done nothing wrong.In previous cases where Ms. Vestager has ruled that corporate tax arrangements violated European Union law by favoring certain companies, governments have been ordered to recoup back taxes that they would rather not collect lest they signal to other multinationals that their countries are not business-friendly.While Ms. Vestager is investigating cases where countries might have let companies pay too little tax, the proposals by Mr. Moscovici on Thursday are meant to prevent tax avoidance before it happens by closing gaps in cross-border rules to channel profit to subsidiaries in lower-tax countries.In a news conference, Mr. Moscovici said losses from the loopholes amounted to nearly \u20ac70 billion a year, discriminated against small business and angered ordinary citizens.His proposals mean to deter European governments from, for example, letting companies shift profit to low-tax jurisdictions. Mr. Moscovici said his proposals also showed Europe\u2019s eagerness to put into effect international standards endorsed by the leaders of Group of 20 major economies last year.Mr. Moscovici\u2019s measures would also require corporations to fully disclose all of their taxes, profit, revenue and other financial data to the administrations of all countries where they operate.The proposals, though, might be hard to turn into law. They would require the unanimous approval of European Union governments, and some could balk. And the measures would not affect the low across-the-board corporate tax rates that countries like Ireland use as an inducement to attract foreign companies.Oxfam, an antipoverty group, criticized Mr. Moscovici as taking an ineffective \u201clowest common denominator approach\u201d to the tax overhaul.British lawmakers aligned with Mr. Cameron\u2019s government were wary of Mr. Moscovici\u2019s proposals.\u201cGlobally, there is a battle raging for jobs and growth,\u201d said Ashley Fox, the leader of the delegation of British Conservatives at the European Parliament. \u201cThe E.U. must ensure that its proposals do not act as a deterrent to international investment and employment.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Friday about divisions in Europe over the taxing of multinational corporations misidentified the recipients of written comments about European tax policies from Neal Todd, an international tax expert. They were sent to the news media, not to Mr. Todd\u2019s clients.James Kanter reported from Brussels, and Mark Scott from Rome.

{"Headline": "Ted Cruz Starts to Crack G.O.P. Establishment\u2019s Wall of Opposition", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported byThe vast majority of Republican elites remain bitterly opposed to the prospect of Mr. Cruz\u2019s becoming the party\u2019s presidential nominee, some even preferring to take their chances with Donald J. Trump. Yet, to the strains of a jazz threesome a block from St. Charles Avenue here, over Texas barbecue at his Houston campaign office and in one of Washington\u2019s see-and-be-seen steakhouses, Mr. Cruz, Washington\u2019s chief anti-establishment agitator, has quietly begun wooing some of the party\u2019s most entrenched donors and officials.\u201cWe\u2019re working hard to consolidate a lot of support,\u201d Mr. Cruz told a reporter as he mingled with guests arriving at the Matalin-Carville home.Some in the old guard have started signaling to their reluctant right-of-center brethren that it is time to face the possibility that the hard-line Mr. Cruz could be their standard-bearer.That even traces of d\u00e9tente have appeared between Mr. Cruz and the party\u2019s traditional power brokers this early illustrates how thoroughly unpredictable the Republican race has been \u2014 and that, for major political donors, it can be safer to hedge one\u2019s bets in such a volatile environment.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.But others in the party hierarchy, including the officially neutral Ms. Matalin, either share some of the frustrations that have propelled Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump or at least recognize what the two have tapped into.They also take him at his word. \u201cI believe in Senator Cruz because he believes what he\u2019s saying,\u201d Mr. Sewell said outside the Matalin-Carville home, echoing sentiments often heard among the rank-and-file at Mr. Cruz\u2019s Iowa gatherings.What is more striking, and will cause deep consternation among Republican strategists, is that other donors are beginning to embrace Mr. Cruz\u2019s argument that he can win a general election by motivating core conservatives to come to the polls rather than by appealing to swing voters.\u201cI\u2019ve become a one-issue voter,\u201d Mr. Puzder said. \u201cMy one issue is whether somebody is going to win. My big question is: What is your path to a general election victory?\u201dUnhappily recalling that Mr. Romney won among self-described independents but still was soundly defeated by President Obama, Mr. Puzder said, \u201cPart of the reason was that the base didn\u2019t turn out to vote, and Senator Cruz understands that needs to happen.\u201dThe theory of the missing conservative voter, central to Mr. Cruz\u2019s pitch, has been widely and robustly challenged, including by figures on the right. But it is taking flight among some in the party\u2019s donor class.\u201cThe reason Republicans lost in 2012 and 2008 is not because we lost swing voters,\u201d Carla Sands, a California investor, wrote in an invitation to a $1,000-a-plate Los Angeles luncheon this week featuring Mr. Cruz\u2019s wife, Heidi. \u201cThe reason Republicans lost is because they failed to motivate and turn out their base \u2014 mainly evangelical voters in states like Florida, Colorado and Pennsylvania who didn\u2019t feel that the Republican nominee spoke to their issues.\u201dMs. Sands, a philanthropist who has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to establishment-aligned Republicans, predicted that \u201cthis election will also be a \u2018base\u2019 election, and we need a candidate who inspires and excites the base of our party to come out and vote.\u201dMr. Cruz\u2019s wife, who met him on the 2000 Bush campaign and worked in the administration, has emerged as something of a liaison to right-of-center donors. She headlined events in Atlanta; Austin, Dallas, Houston and Midland, Tex.; Birmingham, Ala.; and Seattle in November and December, helping Mr. Cruz raise nearly $20 million in the final quarter of the year. That haul is expected to exceed those of any of the more establishment-friendly candidates.But Mr. Cruz has other links to the party elites he has long railed against: Mr. Puzder was connected to him by Anthony R. Dolan, Ronald Reagan\u2019s chief speechwriter, who is now part of Mr. Cruz\u2019s team of advisers. Chad Sweet, Mr. Cruz\u2019s campaign chairman, worked at Goldman Sachs and was chief of staff to Michael Chertoff, a Homeland Security secretary under George W. Bush.Mr. Cruz\u2019s campaign manager, Jeff Roe, has also cultivated relationships with the relatively small universe of Republican strategists. In December, he phoned the lobbyist Charles R. Black Jr., a veteran of Republican presidential campaigns, about arranging a meeting with him for Mr. Cruz when Congress returns this month. (The meeting has not come about.)Mr. Cruz will, however, appear at a pair of fund-raisers in the Washington area next week that may lure some party regulars: a $1,000-a-person \u201chappy hour\u201d at the Capital Grille, followed by an event at the McLean, Va., home of Michael Adams, a former Bechtel Group executive.Not all of Mr. Cruz\u2019s wooing has led to a love connection. Former Mayor Richard J. Riordan of Los Angeles, who describes himself as \u201ca RINO\u201d \u2014 a Republican in name only \u2014 rode from the airport to a fund-raiser with Mr. Cruz when the Texas senator visited California last month.\u201cHe\u2019s doing extremely well, which surprises me because I don\u2019t think he\u2019s as warm a personality as others,\u201d Mr. Riordan said. \u201cBut he\u2019s a very strong person.\u201dThe response was more favorable in New Orleans, where Mr. Cruz drew younger Republicans and local figures like William Goldring, a distillery executive, the restaurateur Dickie Brennan and Rob Maness, who ran for the Senate here in 2014.Mr. Cruz, who has wandered into trouble at some private events by uttering things he does not say in public, mainly stuck to policy, according to two attendees. But he also spoke more personally than he often did on the stump, describing his connections to Louisiana and praising the city\u2019s music and cuisine.He even poked a bit of good-natured fun at his wife\u2019s dietary preferences, describing \u201cwhat it\u2019s like to be from Texas and have Christmas dinner with vegetarians.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Take someone whose personality might have been merely disagreeable under normal circumstances, and give him the kind of wealth that lets him surround himself with sycophants and usually get whatever he wants.

Which brings me to the current election cycle.The most obvious illustration of the point I\u2019ve been making is the man now leading the Republican field.

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "PAID FOR AND POSTED BYWith thousands of migrant workers subjected to abuse and exploitation, development in the Middle East comes at a high human cost.FOR UNSKILLED LABORERS from Bangladesh, India, Nepal and other populous developing economies, jobs are scarce and wages are very low, some less than $100 per month. It is little surprise, then, that a job in the Middle East advertised as paying upward of $500 per month can seem irresistible.Yet for the hundreds of thousands of laborers who jump at this opportunity and migrate to the oil-rich Gulf region, this vision often proves to be a mirage.\u00a0First, securing a position often means paying a local recruiter a $2,000 fee, usually obtained through a loan with an extortionate interest rate. Upon arrival, workers may have to sign a contract \u2014 often in Arabic, a language most of them cannot read \u2014 the terms of which may state that the job pays only $200 a month, far less than promised, with housing costs deducted from that. This leaves approximately $100 a month \u2014 barely enough to cover the loan interest on their recruiting fee.The exploitation, however, often extends beyond mere money. In many cases, the company they signed up to work for confiscates their passports, making it impossible for them to leave without the permission of their employer. Unable to access labor protections, many are\u00a0forced to live in cramped, unsanitary conditions with no time off.\u00a0The result is a form of modern-day slavery that exists together with human trafficking, debt bondage, child labor and forced marriage.And some pay the ultimate price. Between 2010 and 2013, for example, the International Trade Union Confederation estimates that about 1,200 migrant workers died in the state of Qatar; some\u00a0of these casualties were related to the massive drive to build stadiums for the 2022 World Cup. Additionally, in 2015 seven workers were killed, six were injured and 15 were trapped under the concrete of a building site at a university in Qassim, northwest of Saudi Arabia\u2019s capital, Riyadh.Flawed as these labor practices are, they have become the lifeblood of many industries in\u00a0the Gulf\u2019s wealthiest nations. Today, migrant workers make up more than 70 percent of the work force in the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) \u2014 Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman. A large proportion of the workers, meanwhile, are almost entirely from South Asia: Nearly all migrant laborers from India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, for example, take jobs in a GCC country.\u00a0Those who do are all too often left stranded, broke and trapped as forced laborers in the deserts of the Gulf, building the gleaming skyscrapers, huge stadiums and world-class airport facilities that are redefining the architecture and economy of these oil-rich nations.\u00a0With local labor shortages and high-profile construction projects underway\u00a0\u2014\u00a0such as Qatar\u2019s\u00a0World Cup stadiums; new airports in Doha, Dubai and Abu Dhabi; and branches of art museums such as the Louvre and the Guggenheim\u00a0\u2014\u00a0migrant workers are needed more\u00a0than ever across the region.\u00a0\u201cYou have significant demand for workers from Bangladesh, Nepal and India,\u201d says Nick Grono, CEO of the Freedom Fund, a philanthropic initiative focused on the fight against modern slavery. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a whole bunch of structural factors that facilitate exploitation.\u201d\u00a0For example, in a 2015 investigative report, it emerged that roughly one-third (about 10,000 people) of the migrant workers employed in the construction of New York University\u2019s Abu Dhabi campus were unable to access the protections of the university\u2019s labor guidelines on fair wages, working hours and living conditions.\u00a0According to the U.S. Department of State\u2019s 2014 Trafficking in Persons Report, in Kuwait, despite 2010 legislation setting maximum working hours, the law excludes migrant domestic workers. Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch found that in Qatar these laborers are not allowed to form unions or engage in strikes.Back in their home countries, migrants are driven into the hands of unscrupulous recruiters by everything from joblessness and poverty to corruption and political conflict.\u00a0\u201cAt its core, it\u2019s about global inequality,\u201d says David Segall, a policy associate at the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. \u201cBecause of that supply and demand, workers have a strong incentive not to ruffle any feathers by asserting their rights,\u201d adds Segall, who focuses on the recruitment and migration of construction workers from South Asia to the Persian Gulf. \u00a0Male laborers are not alone in their suffering. Human Rights Watch estimates that there are 236,500 domestic workers in the United Arab Emirates, of whom 146,100 are female, accounting for 12.8 percent of the total employment in the country. \u00a0In a 2014 study conducted by the organization, a few of them talked about enduring physical and sexual abuse, being confined to their employers\u2019 homes and working long hours without time off, with insufficient food and no medical treatment.\u00a0As in other parts of the world, the chain of responsibility for migrant workers in the Middle East is long and complex. \u201cEach stakeholder tends to pass the buck on to others,\u201d says Segall.Faced with unsafe conditions as well as physical and sexual abuse, migrant workers in Kuwait show an alarmingly high suicide rate. Domestic workers accounted for 56% of all suicides in 2013, with 81% of all suicides involving South Asian migrants and 19% involving African migrants. Migrant-Rights.org estimated that in 2010 migrant workers in Kuwait were attempting or committing suicide every two days.In Saudi Arabia, domestic employees work an average of 63.7 hours a week, the second-highest rate in the world. Long hours are not the only abuses. In 2014, 3,740 migrants filed complaints about employers, with issues ranging from nonpayment of wages to refusal to renew residency permits.Between 2010, when the World Cup was awarded to Qatar, and 2013, 1,200 workers died, according to data from India and Nepal obtained by the International Trade Union Confederation (as some have pointed out, it is not possible to link World Cup construction projects directly to all these deaths). According to human rights activists, worker abuses in Qatar include passport confiscation, lack of trade union representation, cramped accommodation and delayed wage payments.Research by Human Rights Watch found that migrant workers in Bahrain routinely faced discrimination and abuse, including a series of violent attacks in 2011 during anti-government protests. Human Rights Watch cited Bahrain\u2019s Ministry of Interior, which said that four migrant workers were killed in the incidents during the unrest and 88 were injured, including 11 Indians, 18 Bangladeshi, 58 Pakistanis and one Filipino.In 2013, hundreds of striking migrant workers in Dubai were threatened with deportation after Arabtec, the contractor working on projects that include the city\u2019s airport and the Abu Dhabi branch of the Louvre museum, refused to accept their demands for higher wages. In addition to poor wages, many of the workers in UAE also endure extremely cramped conditions in labor camps such as Sonapur, where dozens of workers have to share single rooms and water shortages are common.After the earthquake that hit Nepal in 2015, killing more than 8,000 people, Nepalese workers being employed on the World Cup construction sites in Qatar were denied permission to leave the country to visit relatives and attend funerals, according to news reports quoting the Nepalese government.The global attention of labor activists focused on sex trafficking among female domestic workers when in 2010 authorities discovered two underage Bangladeshi girls with forged passports at an airport in Bahrain. Thai and Bahraini nationals had told the women they would be working as domestic servants but then forced them into prostitution in entertainment venues.Filipina domestic workers are routinely subject to physical abuse in the United Arab Emirates. One worker told Human Rights Watch that her employers slapped, kicked and beat her. Another said her female employer had punched her on the arm, pulled at her clothes and spat in her face.About 57% of total remittances sent by workers overseas to their families back home come from Gulf Cooperation Council countries. While these remittances help pull families out of poverty, workers\u2019 safety and welfare are threatened by corruption and the presence of middlemen and fraudsters.On construction projects in the Gulf, worker safety is often compromised. In April 2015, two construction workers were killed and at least 14 injured after a collapse at a convention center being built at a university in Qassim, northwest of the capital, Riyadh. The workers were mainly from Pakistan.With huge demand for construction laborers and domestic workers means millions of migrants from poor communities have traveled to the Middle East enticed with promises of high wages, only to find themselves forced into labor. The International Labor Organization (ILO) estimates that there are 600,000 forced labor victims in the region. These workers are often subjected to abuse and exploitation with no legal or social networks to support them.Click on the dots to learn more about the labor conditions in key migrant worker source and destination countries in the Middle EastFaced with unsafe conditions as well as physical and sexual abuse, migrant workers in Kuwait show an alarmingly high suicide rate.

In addition to poor wages, many of the workers in UAE also endure extremely cramped conditions in labor camps such as Sonapur, where dozens of workers have to share single rooms and water shortages are common.After the earthquake that hit Nepal in 2015, killing more than 8,000 people, Nepalese workers being employed on the World Cup construction sites in Qatar were denied permission to leave the country to visit relatives and attend funerals, according to news reports quoting the Nepalese government.The global attention of labor activists focused on sex trafficking among female domestic workers when in 2010 authorities discovered two underage Bangladeshi girls with forged passports at an airport in Bahrain. Thai and Bahraini nationals had told the women they would be working as domestic servants but then forced them into prostitution in entertainment venues.Filipina domestic workers are routinely subject to physical abuse in the United Arab Emirates. One worker told Human Rights Watch that her employers slapped, kicked and beat her. Another said her female employer had punched her on the arm, pulled at her clothes and spat in her face.About 57% of total remittances sent by workers overseas to their families back home come from Gulf Cooperation Council countries. While these remittances help pull families out of poverty, workers\u2019 safety and welfare are threatened by corruption and the presence of middlemen and fraudsters.On construction projects in the Gulf, worker safety is often compromised. In April 2015, two construction workers were killed and at least 14 injured after a collapse at a convention center being built at a university in Qassim, northwest of the capital, Riyadh. The workers were mainly from Pakistan.The Gulf is\u00a0a major destination for\u00a0this global flow of migrant labor, where workers leave their homes to work temporarily in wealthier economies. But this region is not the exception. Worldwide, there are 232 million international migrants and the International Labour Organization estimates that about 21 million of them are trapped in jobs into which they were coerced or deceived.\u00a0Indeed, with the globalization of trade and commerce has come the globalization of labor. In manufacturing industries, companies have outsourced production of everything from textiles to toys and electronics to developing countries, where wages are lower, even if human rights may not be respected and working conditions can be harsh. In the Middle East, due to the construction boom, the dynamic is similar but transposed \u2014 it is the workers who are imported rather than the goods they make.\u00a0\u201cIn a globalized economy, we\u2019re going to continue to see risks and cost reductions pushed down to the most vulnerable in society, and that often means migrants, refugees, people affected by conflict, women and children, and those in lower social castes,\u201d says James Cockayne of the United Nations University, who has studied modern slavery. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely part of what we see in the Middle East.\u201dIf the drivers of labor-rights abuses in the Middle East are complex, so too will be the solutions. And many argue that this means not only addressing the complex networks of unregulated subcontractors and unscrupulous recruiters but also helping change the practices of large global corporations.Some see consumer pressure playing a role, particularly in the case of high-profile projects. \u201cCompanies\u00a0\u2014\u00a0especially Western-based construction firms\u00a0\u2014\u00a0are beginning to realize\u00a0that\u00a0reputation risk is increasing, especially with regard to the World Cup,\u201d says Segall.Others see incentives for companies to combat forced labor because of the risk of legal consequences they face if found contravening legislation such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. \u201cIf you are a U.K. or U.S. corporation and you\u2019re employing a work force, there\u2019s potential court liability,\u201d says Grono.Financing provides another leverage point. Duncan Jepson, founder of Liberty Asia, believes persuading banks to treat these risks like any other investment risk could bring about change. \u201cIn this area of the Middle East, these projects are vulnerable to corruption, exploitation and fraud and they should think about this before they invest,\u201d he says.Others argue that highlighting the business case for promoting a better labor environment\u00a0could help companies address safety and poor working\u00a0conditions. \u201cThe turnover rate is extraordinary and it costs money to bring in new workers,\u201d says Segall. \u201cAnd a happy work force is a more productive work force.\u201dThere is a powerful message here for governments, too, since a stable, skilled work force with legal protections is necessary to advance their development goals. The fight against forced and bonded labor is therefore important not only to end injustice and abuse, but also because workers who are released from modern-day slavery and forced labor could become a happy and healthy work force with the potential to advance development in nations and local communities around the world.Tricked and Indebted on Land, abused or Abandoned At SeaIllegal \u201cmanning agencies\u201d trick villagers in the Philippines with false promises of high wages and send them to ships notorious for poor safety and labor records.The Price of Nice NailsManicurists are routinely underpaid and exploited, and endure ethnic bias and other abuse, The New York Times has found.\u2018Sea Slaves\u2019: The Human Misery That Feeds Pets And LivestockMen who have fled servitude on fishing boats recount beatings and worse as nets are cast for the catch that will become pet food and livestock feed.SELECTED BYThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}

Interfax, a nongovernment news agency, reported that the central bank held an emergency meeting Thursday evening with Russian bankers.A main stock market index, the dollar-denominated RTS, recovered from an early decline to close up by 0.6 percent for the day. But it is still just above its post-2008-crisis low, and not much higher than in the late 1990s, indicating the severity of the retreat of Russia\u2019s market.Another benchmark index, the Micex \u2014 which is denominated in rubles \u2014 was up 2.9 percent for the day.Aleksei L. Kudrin, a former finance minister, said at the World Economic Forum on Thursday that Russia should brace for oil\u2019s bottoming out at $16 to $18 a barrel for a short period this year.\u201cThe price will, of course, correct and rise,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly, there is a shock. But in a year or two the economy will pull through to positive growth.\u201dOil prices are nearing a level that could be catastrophic for Russia\u2019s budget, analysts say, given that the government cannot tax oil companies more than the cost of producing oil in Siberia.The production cost in Russia is estimated to average about $15 a barrel. With roughly half of Russia\u2019s budget derived from taxes on oil and natural gas, a sustained drop in oil prices to the levels Mr. Kudrin predicted would compel tax increases or a budget reduction known as a sequester, forcing salary cuts for teachers, soldiers and police officers, and lower pensions.Futures contracts for Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, traded below $28 on Wednesday, but were back in the $30 range on Thursday.In another reflection of the severity of the oil-price shock for Russia, the government is considering canceling a five-year-old social security program. It had deducted contributions from wages to build up funds for future retirees. The government plan would shift to financing pensions from current taxes, the daily newspaper Kommersant reported, even though demographic changes mean more workers will retire in future years.Also on Thursday, the Russian central bank revoked the banking licenses of three lenders \u2014 Vneshprombank, Miraf-Bank and Turbobank \u2014 that had become insolvent.Advertisement"}

And Keep It Short", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "Supported byYour Money8 PhotosManaging your money should be pretty straightforward, but that doesn\u2019t make the task all that easy.That\u2019s the biggest takeaway from the handful of simple financial instruction lists making the rounds among the New Year\u2019s resolution set.So this week, I did two things. First, I asked these writers why so many people fail to follow those four commandments, none of which are new. There must be a reason we all have to keep repeating them.Why do we fail? When it comes to the lack of emergency funds, there are millions of Americans with no bank accounts at all, whether because of poor credit or poor access. Many millions more cannot afford to save anything.Some of the people who give in might do better with more structure. If you\u2019re one of them, don\u2019t assume you\u2019ll push a button each month or set aside a pile of $20 bills. Instead, set up automatic account transfers. \u201cUnless you automate it, it\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Ms. Olen said. (A disclosure: I see both Mr. Clements and Ms. Olen every year or two, as the guild of full-time money writers is fairly small.)Still, why is most money still chasing the dream of picking investments that will do better than all the others? Ms. Olen points to lingering Peter Lynch-ism \u2014 the tendency of older investors who remember the exhortations of the famed Fidelity mutual fund manager to follow their instincts. If the parking lot is full, buy the stock!But this approach gives people a false sense of superiority. You may be looking at the wrong lot in the wrong suburb at the wrong time in the wrong industry. Even if you aren\u2019t, plenty of professional investors will notice the Costco lot with all the Mercedes in it before you do. This overconfidence leads people to invest only in companies with headquarters near them and buy too much of their employer\u2019s stock, because they assume they have superior knowledge about the company.Mr. Clements added that many people who bet on individual stocks had never actually compared their portfolio with an index fund. This used to be hard, but online brokerage firms can now do it for you in a few clicks (and you can check your broker\u2019s picks on most any investment website). Most people, if they\u2019re being honest and including the losers that are no longer in their portfolio, will find that an index fund will beat their own basket of stocks over long periods of time.All of the experts here think buying a home is a perfectly fine idea, but it has to be an affordable one. And many of us are delusional about exactly what that means.\u201cI was of the mind-set of \u2018Don\u2019t you know who I am?\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd now I know that he knew exactly what I was.\u201d14 PhotosThe family borrowed elsewhere, but that first banker\u2019s skepticism tempered their enthusiasm. They borrowed a bit less than they could have and were glad they did. Within a few years, housing prices plummeted. Today, the house would still sell for less than their original purchase price.People can\u2019t predict their financial future, but they can be cautious in the present. Ms. Olen suggests asking yourself the following question before buying: Couldn\u2019t you just get something a little smaller? \u201cFor almost the entirety of human history, most people did not live the way that we do,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mother grew up sharing a bedroom with her brother.\u201dNobody much likes talking about death, let alone planning for the possibility of dying young. So it\u2019s no big surprise that not enough people sign up for the experience of shopping for life insurance.But Mr. Adams, who has an M.B.A. and a stint at a bank to go with his ace cartooning skills, wrote his original list after a long effort to simplify things and to do so from the perspective of someone who had no stake in the outcome. \u201cThe incentive of financial professionals is to keep people frightened and helpless,\u201d he said in an interview this week. \u201cWhat they sell is a solution to the problem.\u201dSales agents, however, are often eager to push other forms of insurance that include complex investments, large and often hidden fees, and complex riders laden with mumbo jumbo. \u201cThe complexity is overwhelming, and people know they will be bamboozled because they do not know what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Mr. Adams said. \u201cSo it\u2019s just this daunting horrible thing that is not easy to think about.\u201dBut they should. You should. Ask for term insurance by name. Supply a urine sample and submit to a nurse\u2019s exam. Then hand over the money.All of these tasks require some discipline. And one thing I learned writing my own card and sitting around a table as my colleagues wrote theirs is that there is real value in discussing your financial goals with others. So be honest with yourself, consult someone who knows your weaknesses and come up with your own money priorities.An earlier version of this column misstated the percentage of mutual fund money invested in indexed mutual funds at the end of 2014 and 10 years earlier. It was 15.6 percent at the end of 2014, not 18.5 percent, compared with 8.9 percent \u2014 not 9.8 percent \u2014 a decade earlier.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Investing Advice That Doubles as a Bookmark", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byOff the ShelfMastering the basics required to put together a solid financial plan is not too hard. Getting the most out of every investment dollar is.That is the message of two books aimed at helping you get your financial life in good shape.Let\u2019s start with some basic advice that is not only simple but short. In fact, everything you need to know can fit on a large index card, or at least that\u2019s the view of Helaine Olen, a personal finance writer, and Harold Pollack, a professor at the University of Chicago\u2019s school of social service administration.They have created 10 rules \u2014 such as \u201csave 10 to 20 percent of your income,\u201d \u201cnever buy individual stocks,\u201d \u201cmax out your 401(k) and other tax-advantaged savings accounts\u201d \u2014 that do indeed fit on an index card. (The rules are printed on a card included in the book.) These simple rules, they argue, will help to put you on the right financial track and keep you there.To answer the second question first, the authors contend that \u201cmost of us don\u2019t want to follow rules unless we know why they are rules.\u201d Their book, they say, \u201cexplains how the rules work and why we chose them. They may be simple, but they aren\u2019t always self-explanatory.\u201dAnd the rules are good. Saving 10 to 20 percent of your income is difficult to do, but a great idea. And paying off your credit card balance in full every month just makes sense (you can invest all the money you were giving the credit card companies in interest). I particularly love the idea of holding your financial adviser to a fiduciary standard, a requirement that is more difficult to achieve than it ought to be.Today, many financial advisers merely follow what is known as \u201ca suitability standard.\u201d Here is how the Securities and Exchange Commission explains it on its website: Under this standard, your adviser \u201cmust have a reasonable basis for believing that the recommendation is suitable for you.\u201dThe problem with that, the authors correctly note, is the adviser can recommend something that is O.K. for you, even though there could be better options out there. Why would advisers recommend the O.K. choice? Because they make more money on it.Fiduciaries, on the other hand, have a legal obligation to put your interests before theirs and act in your best interest. The S.E.C. is considering such a standard, and the Labor Department has already proposed it for retirement accounts. But the authors say you don\u2019t have to wait. You can hold advisers to that standard by having them sign a statement promising to do so. The book even provides sample wording.All this is terrific. But the difficulty with simplifying anything so that it fits on an index card is you have to leave stuff out. Even in their extended discussion, the authors are not great on explaining how asset allocation works.And while subtracting your age from 100 to determine what percentage of your investments should be in stocks has long been traditional advice, with people living longer, it might be too conservative today. I\u2019m in favor of subtracting your age from 115.Similarly, the author\u2019s idea of having 15 percent of your stock holdings in international funds is old-fashioned thinking. Today, many financial planners suggest a minimum of 20 percent, and the authors don\u2019t even bother talking much about what bond funds to buy.8 PhotosStill, as a place to begin, the advice is sound.But the normally reliable Ms. Quinn falls a bit short. She is trying to address just about every financial concern people might have once they have retired, and that is impossible to do in any depth, even in the 350 pages she gives herself.For example, she makes the good point that if you are a homeowner, you may find that you have more house than you need once you retire \u2014 and that presents you with options as varied as buying something less expensive, selling and renting a new place, and moving in with \u201ca willing adult child.\u201d They are all potentially good choices. But how should you decide? When you devote only three pages to the topic, it\u2019s hard to provide much insight.And even when she gives a subject substantial space \u2014 her discussion of seemingly every type of health insurance takes up more than 10 percent of the book \u2014 she goes through the information too quickly for a reader to know exactly what to do.In some very good sections \u2014 for example, her discussion of the pros and cons of taking part of your retirement savings and converting it into an immediate annuity \u2014 Ms. Quinn provides websites and phone numbers of professionals and financial service companies that can offer detailed advice. I can\u2019t vouch for the people and companies she recommends, but I love the idea of double-checking investing ideas with pros.In fact, I am going to do this as I prepare for my eventual retirement. I intend to use some of the information she provides to generate questions \u2014 for example, what is the best way for me to minimize my taxes if I stop working \u2014 and I expect to seek professional help for the answers.With any luck, the questions will fit on an index card.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Journalism Catches Hollywood\u2019s Eye", "Date": "2015-12-31", "News": "Supported byIt is not every year that Hollywood produces two movies about journalism that are Oscar contenders, but 2015 appears to have been that year. First came \u201cTruth\u201d in October. Based on the memoir of a former \u201c60 Minutes\u201d producer, Mary Mapes, it purports to tell the story of her gutsy 2004 investigation into George W. Bush\u2019s service in the National Guard when he was a young man. When it turned out that her story, which was broadcast on \u201c60 Minutes II\u201d months before the president\u2019s re-election, had unwittingly relied on falsified documents, the network suits turned against her and her famous correspondent, the CBS anchor Dan Rather, costing them their jobs.\u201cTruth\u201d was followed in November by \u201cSpotlight,\u201d which goes inside The Boston Globe\u2019s groundbreaking investigation into the pedophile priest scandal \u2014 and the shocking fact that child-molesting clerics were being protected by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston. (And, as we now know, by dioceses all across America and much of the rest of the world.) Starring Michael Keaton as Walter V. Robinson, known as Robby, the head of The Globe\u2019s Spotlight investigative unit, the film is the most straightforward journalism procedural since \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men.\u201d\u201cThey weren\u2019t attacked about the substance of their story,\u201d Mr. Vanderbilt told me recently. \u201cThey were attacked on the documents.\u201d Which suggests that even though he wrote the screenplay for a previous film involving journalism \u2014 David Fincher\u2019s 2007 thriller, \u201cZodiac\u201d \u2014 he really doesn\u2019t understand the difference between good reporting and bad.(The outlier is Sydney Pollack\u2019s underrated 1981 film \u201cAbsence of Malice,\u201d in which Sally Field plays a reporter so eager for a scoop she betrays a man who has become her lover. The lover, played by Paul Newman, gets the last laugh, however, causing Ms. Field to lose her newspaper job.)What\u2019s always struck me as surprising about the appeal of journalists in films is that the act of reporting rarely involves secret meetings in dark garages with unnamed sources. Which is to say, it is almost never the stuff of high drama. \u201cIt\u2019s not very glamorous,\u201d Mr. Bergman noted. \u201cWhen Michael Mann and Eric Roth were doing \u2018The Insider,\u2019\u201d \u2014 Mr. Mann directed the film, which he wrote with Mr. Roth \u2014 \u201cthey would ask me: \u2018Do you do anything? Are you always on the phone? Do you have a gimmick, a trick that you do?\u2019\u201dAlas, he didn\u2019t. As a result, Mr. Mann and Mr. Roth resorted to dramatic license to make Mr. Bergman\u2019s job seem more exciting \u2014 something movies about journalism invariably do.\u201cMann used to say to me, \u2018We\u2019re not making a documentary,\u2019\u201d Mr. Bergman said. Indeed, according to Mr. Bergman, it was William Goldman\u2019s screenplay \u2014 and not the book by Mr. Woodward and Mr. Bernstein \u2014 that first used the phrase \u201cFollow the money,\u201d which their source, nicknamed Deep Throat, supposedly told Mr. Woodward. That has become one of the most famous lines associated with Watergate, yet it never appears in the book Mr. Pakula\u2019s movie is based on.Mr. Vanderbilt\u2019s theory \u2014 and it\u2019s a persuasive one \u2014 is that despite journalism\u2019s dramatic shortcomings, reporters make good central characters because they are detectives with pens. \u201cThere is something inherently interesting about someone who comes to work every day saying, \u2018I\u2019m going to get to the bottom of this,\u2019\u201d he said.\u201cI\u2019ve always been fascinated with journalism,\u201d he added. But in tying his movie to a book written by a journalist unable to acknowledge her error, Mr. Vanderbilt\u2019s fascination led him astray.In that sense, Tom McCarthy, the co-writer and director of \u201cSpotlight,\u201d was lucky: He didn\u2019t have anybody\u2019s memoir to rely on, since none of the members of the Globe\u2019s Spotlight team had written a book about their experience. All he had were the articles, which were brought to his attention after two young producers, Nicole Rocklin and Blye Pagon Faust, read a case study published by the Columbia Journalism School. In effect, he and his co-writer, Josh Singer, had to do journalism to learn about The Globe\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning journalism.\u201cIn some ways, our process mirrored theirs,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would walk out of an interview with one of the Globe reporters, and we would race back to the hotel and discuss it. We would get excited, and that inspired our approach to the material.\u201d They had discovered the thrill of reporting by reporting. Mr. McCarthy\u2019s goal was to convey the excitement of journalism he had discovered in interviewing The Globe\u2019s journalists. It\u2019s also why he didn\u2019t feel the need to gild \u201cSpotlight\u201d with extraneous subplots and long-suffering spouses.Mr. McCarthy and Mr. Singer even uncovered a few new facts. One in particular stands out. They learned that years earlier, The Globe had run an article suggesting that 20 priests had molested children \u2014 and that the article had been buried in the Metro section. The two men found the article and confronted Mr. Robinson about it.\u201cYeah, that was me,\u201d a chagrined Mr. Robinson said. He had just become the Metro editor, he added. \u201cI don\u2019t remember it at all.\u201d Though it never actually happened during the Spotlight investigation itself, Mr. McCarthy added that scene toward the end of the film. Even in a movie depicting journalism at its most exciting, Mr. McCarthy, like all filmmakers apparently, still felt the need to spice it up a bit.It seems inevitable that filmmakers will continue to make movies about journalists, especially if \u201cTruth\u201d and \u201cSpotlight\u201d receive Oscar nominations. And dramatic license is something journalists will have to get used to, if they\u2019re not already. The real question is whether the movies will ever truly understand the difference between good reporting and bad, as Mr. McCarthy did and Mr. Vanderbilt did not. Don\u2019t get your hopes up. It\u2019s the movies after all.An article last Sunday in the Oscars special section about journalism in movies misspelled the surname of the actress who starred with Paul Newman in \u201cAbsence of Malice\u201d in 1981. She is Sally Field, not Fields.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ratings Agencies Still Coming Up Short, Years After Crisis", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "Supported byFair GameThe mistakes that led to the 2008 mortgage crisis can\u2019t happen again, right?There\u2019s an entertaining \u2014 and illuminating \u2014 scene in the movie \u201cThe Big Short\u201d that perfectly captures the pathology. As a Standard & Poor\u2019s employee played by Melissa Leo replies when asked why the ratings agency didn\u2019t insist on higher standards: \u201cThey\u2019ll just go to Moody\u2019s.\u201dTen credit ratings agencies are currently registered and operating in the United States. As their overseer, the S.E.C. must conduct examinations of them every year and issue an annual report of its findings.The most recent such report came out on Dec. 28, easily missed in the holiday crush. But its contents are a potent reminder that absent strong enforcement of the rules, questionable behavior is not likely to change.The S.E.C. report doesn\u2019t identify which agencies ran afoul of what rules. That\u2019s unfortunate. But it does separate the companies into two groups based on size. So when the regulator describes a problem at one of the \u201clarger\u201d credit ratings agencies, you know it means one of the big three \u2014 Fitch Ratings, Moody\u2019s or Standard & Poor\u2019s.Some of the problems uncovered by the S.E.C. are frighteningly basic. For example, two of the larger companies \u201cfailed to adhere to their ratings policies and procedures, methodologies, or criteria, or to properly apply quantitative models.\u201d These failures occurred on numerous occasions, the report noted.Errors seem common. Because of a coding mistake, a structured finance deal made by one larger ratings agency didn\u2019t reflect its actual terms. It took some time for this error to be detected and when it was, the transaction\u2019s rating took a substantial hit.In another example, a larger ratings agency employee noticed an error in the calculations used to determine certain ongoing ratings, but in subsequent publications, the company disclosed neither the mistake nor its implications. This ratings agency also inaccurately described the methodology it used to determine some of its official grades, the S.E.C. said.Then there were the analysts at one larger ratings agency who learned of flaws in outside models used to determine ratings. But no one at the company assessed the impact of the errors or told others about them as required under its procedures. The S.E.C. also identified instances where substantive statements made by this agency in its rating publications directly contradicted its internal rating records.Even more alarming, policies and procedures at one larger credit ratings agency did not prevent \u201cprohibited unfair, coercive or abusive practices,\u201d the report found. As a result, the agency gave an unsolicited rating to an issuer that was \u201cmotivated at least in part by market-share considerations.\u201d Such a practice would allow an agency to gain an issuer\u2019s business by offering a better rating than a competitor.At the same agency, two grades assigned by ratings committees were changed at the urging of \u201csenior ratings personnel,\u201d the S.E.C. found. This not only violated the unnamed firm\u2019s policies and procedures, but also resulted in a misapplication of the company\u2019s ratings criteria, the report said.\u201cThese are the exact same deficiencies that caused the 2008 financial crisis,\u201d he added, \u201cand that the Dodd-Frank Act was supposed to address.\u201dRatings agency rules from 2007 and 2010 were intended to diminish potential conflicts of interest at these companies, improve their internal controls and create new standards of training, experience and competence.But rules work only if companies that violate them are punished for doing so.The S.E.C.\u2019s report comes from its Office of Credit Ratings; officials in this unit conduct exams and collect data on how the agencies are adhering to the rules.The task of cracking down on violators falls to members of the S.E.C.\u2019s enforcement staff. And it seems from this report that they have their work cut out for them.\u201cThe S.E.C. is going to have to be extraordinarily tough if they want to change the internal practices of the credit ratings agencies,\u201d Mr. Hauptman said. \u201cThere are legitimate concerns about the S.E.C.\u2019s willingness to go that route.\u201dIn October, the S.E.C. also took action against DBRS, a smaller ratings agency, for misrepresenting its ratings methodology on certain securities; the firm paid $6 million to settle the case. But these cases stem from activities several years ago. And the numbers in those matters aren\u2019t much when set against the profits ratings agencies generate. For example, Moody\u2019s earned almost $1 billion in 2014, the most recent annual figure available.\u201cWe\u2019ve always been optimistic about the potential that the new rules had,\u201d Mr. Hauptman said. \u201cNow we have to wait and see how vigorously the S.E.C. enforces them.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Boom or Gloom?", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Supported byWhether the winner of the 2016 presidential election emphasizes optimism or pessimism, he or she will face some sobering economic developments.important because when big companies swallow up others, it signals that acquiring companies have essentially outsourced their ideas rather than growing internally.According to Litan, the increased number of mergerssuggests that the safer thing to do is to buy someone else rather than develop new products and services yourself. The merger trend is a sign of a collective failure of nerve, the risk-taking that historically contributed to much higher economic growth rates, such as the roughly 4 percent average from 1948 to 1973.Aggregate productivity growth depends not only on innovations and technology investments within firms but also on the economy\u2019s ability to reallocate resources from businesses with lower productivity to businesses with higher productivity.These four authors conclude that the decline in \u201crapid firm-level growth\u201d indicates that there has been a corresponding decline in the \u201cefficient movement of labor toward high-productivity producers,\u201d which, they cautiously note, is \u201ca cause for concern.\u201dIn a dynamic economy, businesses are born, grow, and die; jobs are created and lost; and resources are reshuffled according to their best use. If there are fewer new companies and more aging ones, then labor and capital hang tight in old industries. The economy is not refreshed and growth slows.In the century after the end of the Civil War, life in the United States changed beyond recognition. There was a revolution \u2014 an economic, rather than a political one \u2014 which freed people from an unremitting daily grind of manual labor and household drudgery and a life of darkness, isolation and early death. By the 1970s, many manual, outdoor jobs had been replaced by work in air-conditioned environments, housework was increasingly performed by machines, darkness was replaced by electric light, and isolation was replaced not only by travel, but also by color television, which brought the world into the living room. Most importantly, a newborn infant could expect to live not to the age of 45, but to 72.Since 1970, in contrast, new innovations have occurred primarilyin a narrow sphere of activity having to do with entertainment, communications and the collection and processing of information. For the rest of what humans care about \u2014 food, clothing, shelter, transportation, health and working conditions both inside and outside the home \u2014 progress has slowed since 1970, both qualitatively and quantitatively.The Republican candidates have been talking more about doom and gloom than candidates usually do. If Gordon is right, whoever holds the White House after Jan. 20, 2017, will find the job as frustrating as it is rewarding.In an email, Gordon forecasts a 0.3 percent annual growth rate of \u201cmedian disposable income per person after taxes and transfers\u201d for the period from 2015 to 2040 \u2014 one sixth the 1.69 percent rate from 1920 to 2014. Gordon\u2019s apprehension is based in part on his findings, which show the rise and fall of productivity (you can see this in the accompanying chart).In addition to the slowdown in innovation, Gordon sees four \u201cheadwinds\u201d: the aging of the population, the decline of American education in comparison to foreign nations, rising inequality which, among other things, diminishes consumer purchasing power, and the growing federal debt burden.growth has been consistently weaker than was expected. This has occurred even though interest rates have fallen substantially, suggesting that it reflects a reduction in demand.As unemployment increases, more people adjust to a lower standard of living. As they become accustomed to the lower standard of living, people may not be as determined to achieve the previously desired higher living standard. In addition, as more people become unemployed, it becomes more socially acceptable to be or remain unemployed. After the labor market returns to normal, some unemployed people may be disinterested in returning to the work force.The views of both Summers and Gordon are controversial, and disputed by other scholars.Some of the best economists of our age, including Larry Summers, Paul Krugman, and my own colleague Robert J. Gordon, are joining the chorus of the doomsayers.But not Mokyr. His response to those who say \u201cthat product and process innovation are running out of steam\u201d is \u201cshort and simple: we ain\u2019t seen nothin\u2019 yet, the best is still to come.\u201dBarry Eichengreen, an economist at Berkeley, takes Gordon to task in a chapter he contributed to \u201cSecular Stagnation\u201d:For economic historians, this argument flies in the face of 200 years of experience. Pessimists have now been predicting slowing rates of invention and innovation for centuries, and they have been consistently wrong. Looking ahead, it seems clear that the productive potential of robotics and the human genome, for example, have only begun to be realized. Evidence that we are learning how to use intelligent machines to replace first unskilled and eventually skilled labor suggests that we have a distribution problem, not a growth problem.The transformations brought about by digital technology will be profoundly beneficial ones. We\u2019re heading into an era that won\u2019t just be different; it will be better, because we\u2019ll be able to increase both the variety and the volume of our consumption.In this new world, there will be \u201cbounty instead of scarcity, freedom instead of constraint.\u201dIn a phone interview, Brynjolfsson made the point that \u201cwe are far from tapping out the innovations\u201d growing out of digitization, computers and information technology. Three-dimensional printing, he said, is \u201cthe biggest revolution manufacturing has ever seen.\u201dAccording to Brynjolfsson, as computers learn to identify faces or cancerous lesions, or how to spot fraud in an accountant\u2019s report, the range of new uses for computers will grow geometrically.Despite the conflicting views of optimists and pessimists on the future of technology, there is a surprising level of agreement among those engaged in the debate over the public policy imperatives.Eichengreen of Berkeley puts it this way in his chapter of \u201cSecular Stagnation\u201d:If the U.S. does experience secular stagnation over the next decade or two, it will be self-inflicted. The U.S. must address its infrastructure, education and training needs. Moreover, it must support aggregate demand to repair the damage caused by the Great Recession and bring the long-term unemployed back into the labor market.Summers similarly argues in the same book that reformsshould include increased public investment, reductions in structural barriers to private investment and measures to promote business confidence, a commitment to maintain basic social protections so as to maintain spending power, and measures to reduce inequality and so redistribute income towards those with a higher propensity to spend.Although Brynjolfsson is optimistic about future economic growth, he believes that major improvements in education and training are necessary to ensure that workers have the skills to fill newly created jobs.The current configuration in Washington precludes the adoption of such proposals. Big ticket items \u2014 a major boost in infrastructure spending, enactment of a federally directed program of school reform and alteration of tax and spending programs to redistribute income appear to be out of reach. The ironclad commitment of Republicans to oppose any domestic initiatives that require higher taxes or deficit financing stands in the way of progress. Democrats themselves have misgivings \u2014 ranging from teacher union rejection of school reform to the opposition of upscale Democrats to redistributive tax policies.Perhaps, then, Gordon\u2019s pessimism is justified. \u201cHypothetical legislation,\u201d he writes:however politically improbable, has its limits. The headwinds that are slowing the pace of the U.S.\u2019s future economic growth have been decades in the making, entrenched in many aspects of our society. The reduction of inequality and the eradication of roadblocks in our educational system defy the cure-all of any legislation signed at the stroke of a pen.An earlier version of this column misstated the given name of an economist at the Federal Reserve; he is Ryan Decker, not Roland.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u20182666,\u2019 a Most Difficult Novel, Takes the Stage", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Supported byAmong the awed and mesmerized is the theater director Robert Falls, who will also admit to some bafflement, if not quite exasperation.\u201cI became weirdly obsessed with this novel years ago, and I still don\u2019t quite know why,\u201d Mr. Falls said. \u201cThe process of staging it is part of trying to figure out what it is I personally respond to. I still don\u2019t quite know.\u201dBut \u201c2666,\u201d written in five loosely connected parts, is also about evil, memory, chaos, futility, dread, hunger for meaning, and, not least, the sometimes maddening lure of literature itself.Seth Bockley, who is adapting and directing the production with Mr. Falls, compared the production \u2014 which features 15 actors playing almost 80 characters, elaborate video projections and even a full-fledged movie, projected on a screen that lowers over the whole stage at several points \u2014 to \u201cbinge-watching\u201d Bola\u00f1o.\u201cThere are absolutely times when the book is mystifying and unbelievably digressive, and you have no idea what\u2019s coming next,\u201d he said. \u201cThe challenge we took on wasn\u2019t to be confusing and experimental and wild, but to ask, how do we do what Bola\u00f1o did, only in the time-based, 3-D, actor-driven medium of theater?\u201dWhen the English translation of \u201c2666\u201d came out in 2008, Mr. Falls \u201cdevoured it\u201d and was soon \u201ccarrying it everywhere, highlighting and crossing out pages,\u201d he recalled.Sharing directing duties \u201cwas the big, unusual leap for me,\u201d Mr. Falls said. \u201cBut I admired Seth\u2019s work, and he was much more experienced with the use of narrative voices\u201d \u2014 much of \u201c2666\u201d is addressed directly to the audience \u2014 \u201cwhich is something I\u2019d never really done.\u201dBut the sprawling, phantasmagoric \u201c2666\u201d \u2014 which is being presented outside the Goodman\u2019s regular season and financed entirely with the Cockrum grant, previously described by the theater as \u201cin the high six or low seven figures\u201d \u2014 is big even by his maximalist standards, longtime colleagues say.\u201cI think this really goes beyond anything Bob has done,\u201d said Henry Godinez, the Goodman resident artistic associate who plays several roles. \u201cHe\u2019s at the point where he could just kick back and do the next \u2018Death of a Salesman\u2019-type play, but instead he chooses something this risky and dangerous.\u201dMr. Falls offered a more modest take. \u201cI sort of aspire to the same life older conductors have, of continuing to be challenged by classical repertoire and new music. There\u2019s such a great history of conductors going into their 80s and doing great work. Theater directors, not so much.\u201dThe play is being presented with three intermissions. To keep things moving, Mr. Falls and Mr. Bockley boiled the novel down to essential characters and story lines, though they would periodically restore some of the stories-within-stories-within-stories, like the tale of a painter who attaches his mummified hand to a self-portrait \u2014 one of the many stories of artistic madness that pop up throughout Mr. Bola\u00f1o\u2019s work.\u201cThere\u2019s an incredibly beautiful, digressive, poetic sensibility to Bola\u00f1o that we realized we needed to let back in the room,\u201d Mr. Bockley said.The directors and the design team worked to create a distinct style for each of the five parts, keyed to the radically different literary genres Mr. Bola\u00f1o drew on: fairy tale, hard-boiled crime novel, academic satire, lyrical short story, \u201cDon Quixote\u201d-style picaresque.At one point, the directors toyed with doing one part in Spanish, with subtitles. And then there was a lucha libre-style scene they experimented with in rehearsal, in which two actors, playing lovelorn academics brawling over a woman, were pelted with sombreros, stuffed animals, paper flowers and other props while mid-\u201990s Mexican death metal roared over the sound system.\u201cIt\u2019s really like watching five different shows,\u201d said Sean Fortunato, a member of the ensemble. \u201cPeople are really going to surprised at how fast it goes by.\u201dThe noirish third part, about the American journalist who is drawn to the unsolved murders in Santa Teresa and falls in with some local thugs, is told partly through a Tarantino-esque movie, shot over four days around Chicago and at a taco restaurant and a disco built inside the Goodman.But the dark heart of the novel is the 300-page fourth section, called \u201cThe Part About the Crimes,\u201d which toggles between a police procedural and dozens of one-paragraph descriptions of the murder and mutilation of women, in the dispassionate style of a forensic report.The directors said they had pared back on the reports of the murders \u2014 recited by three women, Greek chorus-style \u2014 but then put more back in. \u201cI really feel like the audience should experience what you do when reading the novel, which is a certain \u2018Enough. Enough with the dead women,\u2019\u201d Mr. Falls said.In rehearsal, actors playing the less-than-motivated police detectives on the case tweaked the scabrously misogynist jokes that provide dark comic relief (Mr. Bola\u00f1o\u2019s own list goes on for several pages). There were laughs, but Mr. Falls also offered an analogy to the murder wave that has gripped minority neighborhoods in Chicago.\u201cWe live in a world where people are constantly being murdered,\u201d he said during the break. \u201cHow many until we notice?\u201dIn the final part, which circles back to the elusive Archimboldi, Mr. Falls and Mr. Bockley don\u2019t solve the murders. But they do provide more of an ending than the novel, which, more than one critic has noted, doesn\u2019t so much conclude as simply stop.The book is in some ways unfinished, which a play can\u2019t get away with, Mr. Falls said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to give the audience what it wants,\u201d he added, \u201cbut not in the way it thinks it\u2019s going to get it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Responses in an Age of Megacrises", "Date": "2016-01-21", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe world has responded with billions of dollars in humanitarian aid to the multiplying emergencies around the world, but the need has far outstripped that generosity. The fact is, as the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, puts it, we are living in \u201cthe age of the megacrises.\u201d Wars and natural disasters have pushed 125 million people worldwide from their homes and severed them from their traditional livelihoods.To provide these people with the barest means of survival requires $40 billion a year. Though humanitarian funding reached $24.5 billion in 2014, more than 12 times the $2 billion raised in 2000, that still left a shortfall of nearly $15 billion. The current system, based on responding to catastrophes as they happen and on the outdated notion that each crisis will be limited in scope and in time, clearly isn\u2019t working.On Sunday, the United Nations released a report detailing ambitious plans to overhaul global humanitarian financing. The report recommends a multipronged approach: more concerted effort to end conflicts and prepare for natural disasters, increasing funds by imposing small taxes of a few cents on the sale of high-volume goods and services, tapping into Islamic finance mechanisms in the Muslim world and enlisting the expertise of global businesses. The report\u2019s recommendations will be discussed at the first-ever World Humanitarian Summit, to be held in Istanbul in May.The members of the panel that worked on the report failed to reach consensus on some of the particulars, including microtaxes on transactions. But there is precedent for that strategy: A small tax on airfare raised $2 billion between 2006 and 2011, largely for immunization programs worldwide. The panel has reached out to FIFA, the soccer governing body, for a humanitarian tax added to ticket purchases. Another possibility is placing small, voluntary fees on taxi rides, through Uber and other taxi apps.At the summit in Istanbul, governments and organizations should strive for consensus around the main proposals of the United Nations report. As the refugee crisis in Europe drives home, the fallout from a calamity in one region can trigger crises in others. Fixing financing for humanitarian aid is urgent in the interest of global stability.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "David Bowie Allowed His Art to Deliver a Final Message", "Date": "2016-01-11", "News": "Supported byDavid Bowie, 1947-2016At the same time, it turns out, he was telling everyone through his art.James C. Nicola, the artistic director of New York Theater Workshop, where \u201cLazarus\u201d runs through Jan. 20, said, \u201cWhat seemed not too long ago intriguingly complicated, ambiguous and opaque now seems pretty clear: a man who was yearning for immortality.\u201dDuring his life, Mr. Bowie pushed his music relentlessly forward while reinventing himself as many personas \u2014 from Davie Jones, a young rhythm and blues singer from the London neighborhood of Brixton, to the interplanetary pop star Ziggy Stardust and the dapper hedonist the Thin White Duke. He explored androgyny and otherworldliness, and sampled cultures from different continents (and galaxies) as his musical and visual palettes continued to evolve, always theatrical and deeply layered until his focus turned to his own looming end.But while laying bare his demons for an audience, Mr. Bowie kept much of his life private, even after his death. Mr. Bowie\u2019s family and representatives have opted not to disclose what kind of cancer he had, or where he died, preferring to let the icon speak, however abstractly, through the thinly veiled characters in his work, all versions of himself.\u201cThe production of \u2018Lazarus,\u2019 and also this new album, \u2018Blackstar,\u2019 when you look at them both, you find so many lines and phrases that meant so much more than people knew before today,\u201d said Ivo van Hove, the musical\u2019s director, who was one of a handful of collaborators with knowledge of Mr. Bowie\u2019s condition. \u201cIt\u2019s like two testaments,\u201d he said.The singer\u2019s recent collaborators described his work ethic as tireless throughout his last phase, which included simultaneous work on the album, its accompanying videos and the theater production, a nontraditional sequel to \u201cThe Man Who Fell to Earth,\u201d the novel that inspired his 1976 film.Mr. van Hove said that Mr. Bowie told him he was sick in November 2014, via Skype, when the show was in its early stages, but requested the information remain strictly confidential. (The director said in a Dutch radio interview on Monday that Mr. Bowie had liver cancer.)\u201cIt was immediately clear it was very serious,\u201d Mr. van Hove said, though he kept his word and did not tell the cast \u2014 including Michael C. Hall, who stars as the extraterrestrial Bowie stand-in, Thomas Newton: \u201cConfidential is confidential.\u201d\u201cIt was very strange,\u201d Mr. van Hove said of trying to convey Mr. Bowie\u2019s intentions. Citing the title track, he continued: \u201cThe song is a man in total distress, and then finding a way out, in his imagination, so he could still be alive, in freedom, as a bluebird. It\u2019s the message of the whole show.\u201dWhile \u201cLazarus\u201d was already in the works before the diagnosis, its themes were appropriate: \u201cIt\u2019s a very existential drama about why are we here, what does it mean, is there something after we are gone?\u201d Mr. van Hove said.On Monday, outside a Manhattan recording studio where the actors from \u201cLazarus\u201d were scheduled to record the cast album, Mr. Hall said of Mr. Bowie, \u201cHe was a very private person \u2014 it wasn\u2019t something he announced to any of us.\u201d\u201cHis passing certainly informs the experience of this recording session and will inform the experience of performing the show as we continue to do it,\u201d Mr. Hall continued, adding that he was \u201cin a state of awe\u201d at Mr. Bowie\u2019s closing run of releases.Of the \u201cLazarus\u201d music video, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s obviously made by a man who knows what he\u2019s up against and is turning it into something so vital and profound.\u201dMr. McCaslin said he recorded with Mr. Bowie \u201cessentially from 11 to 4 every day\u201d in early 2015 during his illness. The musicians were in the studio, often playing in the same small room, about one week a month from January to March. \u201cWhat I didn\u2019t know is that he was then going to Henry Hey\u2019s place and working on \u2018Lazarus,\u2019 \u201d Mr. McCaslin said, referring to the show\u2019s music director.Mr. Bowie \u201cwas just living life to its fullest \u2014 fully engaged in the moment, fully engaged in his art,\u201d Mr. McCaslin added through tears.Tim Lefebvre, who played bass on \u201cBlackstar,\u201d said: \u201cI don\u2019t know where he found the strength. It\u2019s amazing.\u201dDespite the recording sessions becoming \u201cpretty intimate, pretty quick,\u201d Mr. Lefebvre added, \u201cIt never looked to us like he was sick. He was just coming in and singing his ass off.\u201dTony Visconti, Mr. Bowie\u2019s most constant collaborator since \u201cSpace Oddity\u201d in 1969, described \u201cBlackstar\u201d as the singer\u2019s \u201cparting gift.\u201d Its finale, \u201cI Can\u2019t Give Everything Away,\u201d includes the lines: \u201cI know something is very wrong/The pulse returns for prodigal sons/The blackout\u2019s hearts with flowered news/With skull designs upon my shoes.\u201d\u201cDavid always did it his way and his way was the least obvious way,\u201d Mr. Visconti said. \u201cHis death was no different from his life \u2014 a work of Art,\u201d he added in a statement on Facebook. \u201cI knew for a year this was the way it would be. I wasn\u2019t, however, prepared for it.\u201dHe described a friendship mostly relegated to online correspondence in recent years: \u201cI received an email from him seven days ago,\u201d Mr. Eno wrote. \u201cIt was as funny as always, and as surreal, looping through word games and allusions and all the usual stuff we did. It ended with this sentence: \u2018Thank you for our good times, brian. they will never rot.\u2019 And it was signed \u2018Dawn.\u2019 I realize now he was saying goodbye.\u201dRobert Fox, a British producer who helped finance the show and knew about Mr. Bowie\u2019s illness, added, \u201cEven if he wasn\u2019t in the room, he was on the telephone, he was on Skype, he was on FaceTime, or wherever he could be to be involved.\u201dBut Mr. van Hove said that on opening night, Mr. Bowie was \u201cvery fragile. I knew that evening \u2014 I felt it deeply \u2014 that this would be the last time I see him.\u201d A frail but pleased Mr. Bowie took in the show, greeted the cast and even appeared on stage, beaming in a T-shirt and blazer, for a curtain call. He was too tired to make the after-party.Nate Chinen and Andrew Chow contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Iowa, Voters on the Edges May Set Tone for Primaries", "Date": "2016-01-31", "News": "Supported byBut as the Iowa caucuses loom on Monday \u2014 the first votes after 1,500 candidate rallies, 60,000 TV ads and a nail-biting tightening of the polls here \u2014 the state\u2019s voters are poised to play perhaps their most significant role ever in both parties\u2019 nominating contests. And their embrace of candidates on the ideological fringes has amplified a national grass-roots rebellion against establishment politicians.Both Democrats and Republicans have seen their presumptive nominees of a year ago \u2014 deeply experienced, proven political leaders \u2014 brushed aside by Iowans in favor of idol-smashing outsiders.\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous amount of anti-establishment, anti-Washington sentiment here, and I would not be surprised if an outsider on both sides wins,\u201d said Gov. Terry E. Branstad, a Republican, who has exerted himself in an unheard-of effort to derail one of his own party\u2019s front-runners, Senator Ted Cruz.Voters on the ideological edges, who dominate both parties in Iowa, have made Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, and Donald J. Trump and Mr. Cruz, whose views are anathema to Republican leadership, the standard-bearers of the left and the right.The embrace of Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump, visible nationally in huge rallies, has stirred Iowa\u2019s latent Midwest populism, with voters angry about the hollowing out of the middle class, Wall Street greed and the corrupting influence of money in politics. It has created two insurgents who in some ways are opposite sides of the same coin.The policies of President Obama have added accelerant to the fire, with the far left unhappy he did not go far enough, and the right convinced he radically changed the United States.The results of Monday\u2019s caucuses, which will take place in 1,681 precincts across Iowa, ride on such concrete factors as candidates\u2019 get-out-the-vote efforts \u2014 but also on intangibles like voters\u2019 perception of who is catching fire at the last minute, and even on the weather. Campaigns were anxiously checking forecasts amid reports of a snowstorm arriving late Monday, but expected that the weather would hold enough to encourage turnout, which could give an edge to the two candidates with large support from first-time voters, Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders. A victory for Mr. Trump, who has drawn thousands to his rallies here, would devastate Mr. Cruz. The senator has deployed waves of volunteers and sought to visit all 99 counties in Iowa to mobilize evangelical Christians, the core of a conservative coalition that he has built along with Tea Partiers and libertarians.A Trump victory would demonstrate that if the billionaire developer\u2019s fans, a working-class demographic that is less inclined to vote, can navigate the byzantine caucus process, they are even more likely to turn out in the primary states that follow, where casting a ballot is easier.\u201cIf Trump wins Iowa, it\u2019s hard to see how he would not run the table,\u201d said Douglas E. Gross, who was the Iowa finance chairman for George W. Bush\u2019s re-election bid.On the Democratic side, a victory by Hillary Clinton over a surging Mr. Sanders would banish doubts and set her more firmly on the road to the nomination. But a victory for Mr. Sanders would expose Mrs. Clinton\u2019s vulnerabilities, uncork another stream of donations for Mr. Sanders and embolden his supporters, including minorities in Southern states that are supposed to be a Clinton firewall.\u201cBernie speaks forcefully to the anxiety that both young people have and the middle class has,\u201d said former Senator Tom Harkin, Iowa\u2019s senior Democrat, who supports Mrs. Clinton like nearly all state party officials who publicly endorsed. \u201cHillary speaks to that, too, but she\u2019s not as unique as Bernie Sanders, and in every election some people want the unique, the new, the untried.\u201dAmong Republicans, more than six in 10 described themselves as \u201cdevoutly religious\u201d in the same poll, for The Des Moines Register.The conditions for a rush to the fringes were already in place a year ago, when Iowans initially embraced both parties\u2019 presumptive front-runners. Those candidates were long on executive experience in government. For Republicans, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who enacted conservative policies in a blue state, led polls in Iowa for months.Mrs. Clinton held such a commanding lead over her little-known Democratic rivals that Republicans mocked her expected \u201ccoronation.\u201dBut the Iowa grass roots, with the opportunity to scrutinize candidates close up and often reflect trends early, had other ideas. When Mr. Sanders visited Iowa in late spring, he drew the largest crowds of any candidate up to that time. \u201cThe base right now is really hungry for a bold progressive message,\u201d Brad Anderson, who had run President Obama\u2019s re-election campaign in Iowa, said at the time.\u201cHis message is unwavering,\u201d said Nadene Eller, a retired school librarian in Des Moines, who supports Mr. Sanders even though her union has endorsed Mrs. Clinton. \u201cI don\u2019t think people know what\u2019s going on on the ground here.\u201dMr. Trump, labeling Mexican migrants criminals while promising to deport millions, forced Mr. Walker to the right on immigration at the State Fair in August. Soon Mr. Trump was at the top of the polls, and Mr. Walker dropped out.Mr. Sanders, calling for a political \u201crevolution,\u201d embraced a criticism by former President Bill Clinton that he projected too much anger.\u201cI am angry,\u201d Mr. Sanders said on the campaign trail. \u201cThe American people are angry.\u201dWhereas Mr. Sanders offers a New Deal-style menu of programs (and is sometimes vague on how to pay for them), Mr. Trump is light on policy substance, and his supporters have mainly responded to his stick-it-to-the-man style.\u201cTrump is willing to say whatever he believes in whether it offends someone or not because it\u2019s the truth,\u201d said Dakota Anderson, a Walmart worker, who listened raptly while Mr. Trump spoke in Davenport after calling for a ban on Muslims entering the country.The establishment in Iowa this year has gone \u201cdeep underground,\u201d Mr. Gross said. \u201cI think Rubio could have won Iowa if he would have really dedicated himself, but in his message he wasn\u2019t sure if he was competing against Cruz. If he finishes a strong third, the establishment could coalesce around him, but I would be doubtful he finishes a strong third.\u201dOn the Democratic side, Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign faces a similar challenge to Mr. Trump\u2019s: harnessing the passion of large crowds to get first-time caucusgoers, especially young people, to turn out. Mr. Sanders has built a robust field staff in a short time to mobilize supporters, but his challenge is greater than Mrs. Clinton\u2019s, who is better organized in Iowa and appeals to more reliable voters.Carol Rivas, a retiree, who in age and gender was typical of attendees at a Clinton rally in West Des Moines last week, said a daughter in California called her daily to press her to switch support to Mr. Sanders from Mrs. Clinton. She has not budged.\u201cBernie says all the right things, what everybody wants to hear,\u201d Ms. Rivas said, \u201cBut I don\u2019t know where he\u2019d get the money to do it.\u201dStuart Stevens, who was Mitt Romney\u2019s top strategist in 2012, predicted a long campaign ahead for both parties because of the disruptive signals likely to emerge on Monday.\u201cWe\u2019re going to look back on Iowa in March and April, and it\u2019s going to seem like the Crimean War,\u201d he said. \u201cThis thing is just beginning.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "John Maynard Keynes: Great Economist, Terrible Currency Trader", "Date": "2016-01-12", "News": "Supported byUnhappy ReturnsGreat fortunes have been made by traders who correctly predicted swings in the dollar, yen or pound, that much is true.But winning big in currencies is harder than it looks \u2014 even if you happen to be one of history\u2019s greatest economic thinkers.Those gains look particularly modest given the risks Keynes was taking on, as he experienced huge swings in his portfolio when his bets turned out wrong. And simplistic trading strategies relying on the momentum of currencies and the \u201ccarry trade,\u201d of borrowing money in a currency with low interest rates and investing it in a currency with a higher rate, outperformed his more judgment-driven choices, at least during the 1920s.\u201cIn many cases he called currencies right in terms of direction,\u201d Mr. Chambers said. \u201cBut his great frustration was how to time a trading position. That was the thing he found most difficult.\u201dAre there any lessons to be had from the trading records of a man who died 70 years ago? Just maybe.The first is the simplest: In financial markets, being brilliant isn\u2019t enough. The best traders have to not only understand the fundamentals of the asset they are trading, but also have almost a sixth sense for how the timing and momentum within markets will evolve. You can lose a lot of money having the right idea at the wrong time.\u201cKeynes\u2019s experience shows how difficult currency speculation is,\u201d Mr. Chambers said. \u201cHe was trading his own money and he understood what he was doing. He was able to absorb losses. Some hedge funds are trying to do this stuff and live hand-to-mouth on a quarter-to-quarter basis, and that\u2019s really difficult to do.\u201dKeynes was also an active investor in the stock market, and in the 1920s tried to time stock picks. But his returns were low, and he took a big hit in the market crash of 1929.In the 1930s, he shifted toward a long-term approach of buying stocks with good long-term potential and holding them indefinitely, what Mr. Chambers calls \u201cessentially a Warren Buffett type of approach.\u201d His returns improved.So the final lesson on money management from the trading records of one of the 20th century\u2019s great economic minds may be the most fundamental of them all: The person on the other side of the trade probably knows more than you.Advertisement"}

Presidential Debate", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byBusiness woman, former CEO of Hewlett Packard, Carly Fiorina.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)(APPLAUSE (CHEERING)(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)(BELL RINGING)(LAUGHTER)I talked about that eight years ago, and I\u2019m talking about it now. I talked about the importance of preserving life, of not just saying we\u2019re going to defund Planned Parenthood, but let\u2019s do something bolder. Let\u2019s get rid of abortion once and for all by applying the Fifth, and Fourteenth amendment to every person from conception because that means that we recognize that no person can be deprived of life or liberty unless they have due process. And, that\u2019s not happening in our country.And, I believe, and continue to practice that we need the Fair Tax to revive our economy. To make it so that people are able to be rewarded for their work rather than punished for it.(APPLAUSE)Senator Santorum, four short years ago you won Iowa. You beat Mitt Romney, pretty much shocked the country. But, just the other day you talked about what is in the greater good for your campaign. Is Monday night your last stand?SANTORUM: You know, listening to what your network was talking about prior to this race, this debate, reminded me of the coverage that many on this floor are getting. This race, this debate, was called the, \u201cUndercard Debate\u201d. The undercard debate.It wasn\u2019t advertised significantly. In fact, the entire hour lead up to this there was no conversation about any of the four people on this debate stage, and that is the chronic situation.In fact, they listed \u2014 they put a poll up from Wall Street Journal/NBC News, they listed the candidates, and they failed to mention I wasn\u2019t listed. I got zero, why? Because they \u2014 NBC, Wall Street Journal poll never includes my name on the list.This is what the media has been doing over the past year, and trying to segregate, and take Iowans out of the process. What Iowans deserve...(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)(APPLAUSE)(BELL RINGS)SANTORUM: You know, this, again, more of the politics of trying to get people to throw stuff at each other. I\u2019m not going to throw mud at anybody on this stage tonight. I\u2019m not going to throw mud at anybody on the stage later.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: I\u2019m not going to attack Donald Trump. What I\u2019m \u2014 Mike Huckabee and I were asked to come to an event where money was going to be raise to do help our veterans. You know, I thought about it.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: And I thought about. I said well, wait a minute, now, if there were no political considerations and I had some time because I\u2019m not doing anything at 9:00 tonight.(LAUGHTER)And so if I had some time, would I go...(BELL RINGS)SANTORUM: ... if I could help raise money for veterans? And the answer was yes, I would. And so I\u2019m going.(APPLAUSE)GILMORE: Well, Bill, can I first...HEMMER: Thank you, senator. One moment. We\u2019ll get to you in a moment, Governor. We have a few coming up.MACCALLUM: So it will come as no surprise that there is an idea out there that there is a civil war brewing within the GOP over the meaning of conservative and the question of who is electable.There are some in the GOP who are so outraged by Trump and Cruz that they say they would actually rather have Hillary Clinton in the White House.(BOOING)The people in Iowa showed up and they are still showing up. Hundreds and hundreds of them at every event. I have done over 150 events in the state of Iowa and I have 15 more coming up.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)What they ask me about is Carly, tell us why zero based budgeting is so important. Tell us why you are a leader who is going to produce results. Tell us how you are going to defeat ISIS. Tell us how we are going to replace Obamacare.In other words, I\u2019m going to put my faith every single time not in the pundits, not in the polls. Most definitely not in the national media. I\u2019m going to put my faith in the common sense and the good judgment of the voters of Iowa.And the last time I looked, you hadn\u2019t started voting yet. So, on Monday night, I hope you will stand with me, fight with me, caucus for me. Because...(BELL RINGS)(APPLAUSE)But never mind that, I want to return to something. I\u2019m the only veteran, Bill and Martha in this race. And I\u2019m not going to any Donald Trump event over across town on some sort of faux veteran sort of issue.I\u2019m going to speak to you tonight about the issue that really confronts veterans. I\u2019m going to talk to you about the concerns that they have got with the veterans administration.The lousy appeals process that they have got. The fact that sometimes they get good service at the V.A. and sometimes they don\u2019t and the fact that post traumatic stress syndrome is not properly recognized. That psychology positions are unavailable in the Veterans Administration.(APPLAUSE)One candidate in this race has criticized so-called \u201cNew York values\u201d. So tell me, in your opinion, are New York values different than Iowa values?(LAUGHTER)This much I will tell you. I wish that some of those New Yorkers had funded as much of my campaign as they did the corporately funded candidates, but they didn\u2019t.And to be honest with you, when I say I\u2019m \u2014 wish they had, I\u2019m glad they didn\u2019t. I\u2019m not a New York-funded campaign. I\u2019m not bankrolled by the corporatists, I\u2019m not bankrolled by Goldman Sachs and Citibank and AIG and all the big brokers \u2014 brokerage houses and the billionaires.I\u2019m sponsored by people like Thomas, a part-time Uber driver in Pennsylvania who sent me $25 this week. He\u2019s between jobs. He\u2019s driving an Uber car. But he believed in what I\u2019m talking about enough that, even on a limited, part-time income, he sent me $25 to help in my campaign.I\u2019ll stand with the Thomases of the world any day. I\u2019ll leave all the discussion of the big financiers to other candidates. But there\u2019s only a few of us in the entire Republican process who are not corporately funded by the same group.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.And let me just finish by saying, you want to know why things never change depending on whether Democrats or Republicans are in power, and why Republicans in Iowa and the rest of the country are so frustrated?The reason is, is because if you follow the money, the same folks who finance the Democrats finance the Republicans, and no matter what the speeches and the ads, they get the same results.If you want a different result, I\u2019m available.(APPLAUSE)Senator Santorum, according to Google, the Paris terror attacks were the largest story that was searched in 2015, with nearly 1 billion searches of that story worldwide.There have been at 18 terror attacks so far this year \u2014 in just January alone, in 2016, and it will likely, as we all know, get worse. But what can an American president do to stop these terrifying killings?We have to have an honest discussion with the American people about the nature of the threat that we confront. This president says that ISIS has nothing to do with Islam, and as a result has put together a strategy that doesn\u2019t take care of what the reality is, which is ISIS has established a caliphate.A caliphate is like a kingdom ruled by \u2014 a caliphate is ruled by a caliph, a kingdom is ruled by a king. Only the difference is a caliphate is also a religious title, and it is both a religious call to help this state, as well a \u2014 to \u2014 to make the state stronger.The reality is that ISIS has established a caliphate, and is using that to attract people around the globe to follow them as the leaders of the Sunni world.And you say, \u201cwell, how do we stop them from following them?\u201d Well, to be a legitimate caliphate, you have to control land and operate a state under sharia law.If you don\u2019t do that, you cannot call for that support. And so the answer is we must take their land and make them...(BELL RINGS)... illegitimate in the eyes of the Muslim world. So I would put troops on the ground and take the land back from Iraq and return to its rightful ownership in Iraq. That would delegitimize them.(APPLAUSE)Actually \u2014 actually, it is ISIS, followed closely by Iran. And those two things are linked, so that when our president cozies up to Iran, all of our allies in the Middle East, who are ready to help us defeat ISIS, wonder whose side we\u2019re on. And the truth is, under this president, we are on Iran\u2019s side, not our allies\u2019, who would help us defeat ISIS.You know, one of the things we have to start with is understanding that we must stand up to adversaries. So Hillary Clinton famously asked, what difference does it make how four Americans died in Benghazi? This is the difference it makes, Mrs. Clinton.That, Mrs. Clinton, is what difference it makes.(APPLAUSE)But we have seen Putin\u2019s quote-unquote \u201chelp\u201d in Crimea and in Ukraine. And this week the U.K. implicated him in the poisoning death of one of his rivals. So are you foolish to think that we can ever work with Vladimir Putin?But let\u2019s be very clear about how we take out ISIS. And I think Rick Santorum is exactly right. You take away their land.But one of the things we have to do is a comprehensive strategy to get ISIS. First of all, take away their access to social media platforms. They are using the same social media platforms to recruit, and to train, and to direct people as I use to see pictures of my grandkids. That\u2019s ridiculous.The second thing, go after them financially. Wage war with them. Make it so nobody can do commerce with ISIS. Not a nickel of transfer. Any company, any country, that even gets close to dealing with them, absolutely put sanctions on them. Make them pay.And finally, you have got to go after them militarily. And that means we send the land, the sea, the air forces, the A-10 Warthogs dropping ordnances on every truck and every tank, and we obliterate them. But we have to understand that they are a force that\u2019s getting bigger. And with any kind of cancer, you don\u2019t contain it, you eradicate it. And that\u2019s how we have to fight ISIS, comprehensively. That\u2019s what I would suggest we do.(APPLAUSE)And I\u2019m the candidate who is best qualified to deal with this issue. A degree in foreign policy in Russian area studies. I\u2019m the only United States Army veteran having gone to Europe during the Cold War as United States Army Intelligence agent, the governor during the 9/11 attack, the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security for the United States for five years.And this is what I will do. If I become the president, I\u2019m going to rebuild the United States military. We\u2019re going to take the sequester off the defense budget. Give the Navy the ships it needs. Refit the United States Army. Refit the United States Marine Corps.And on this international guerrilla war, we need to recognize our Special Forces, our intelligence community, and the people that we need in order to really protect us.And finally, this war of ideas, we must win this. We must say to the world that radical Islamism is the threat. It isn\u2019t just confined to ISIS. It is worldwide. And if we win the war of ideas, then we will win the international guerrilla war.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)Is this Presidency, and presidency, simply too small a David to slay the Goliath of government?The other day I was in Newton, Iowa. It used to be a vibrant place where Maytag washers and dryers were built. Went out of business in 2007, all those shops went to Mexico. All those people lost their jobs. There was a guy in my forum that day, he lost his job. He still has never found an employment that got anywhere near the job that he had.Let me ask you, how many people do you think living around the Beltway know a guy like that? Care about a guy like that? Not many. And, that\u2019s because they\u2019re six of the ten richest counties in America that surround Washington D.C. People who live in the bubbles of the high finance world of New York, the government world of Washington, the entertainment world of Hollywood, don\u2019t have a clue about how hard people out here in Iowa are working every single day.And, I believe one of the values of campaigning in Iowa, you can\u2019t win unless you go out and talk to farmers and housewives \u2014 and welders, and unemployed truck drivers, and I hate...(BELL RINGING)(APPLAUSE)And the only way to control the money is to ask the federal government to budget the way you do, to examine every dollar, to cut any dollar to spend \u2014 to move any dollar.The fancy word for that is zero-base budgeting. I call it common sense. That three-page tax code I talk about all the time here in Iowa? It\u2019s been around for 20 years. But politicians don\u2019t want to talk about it, and you bet the lobbyists don\u2019t want to talk about it.In fact, nobody wants to vote on a three-page tax code or zero- base budgeting, although they\u2019ve both been around for a long time. You know why? Because if you get those two things done, you are goring everybody\u2019s ox.You are taking the political establishment apart. You are actually challenging the status quo, which is what we need in the Oval Office. So you know who I\u2019m going to count on? The citizens of this great nation, because you have extraordinary power.But when you do not use it...(BELL RINGS)... you are losing it. So take out your smartphones, folks. The people of Iowa know what I\u2019m talking about. You take out your smartphones. if you agree with me that three-page tax code needs to be passed, lobbyists aren\u2019t going to be in my office.If you agree we gotta finally pass zero-base budgeting, take out your smartphones. Press one for yes, ladies and gentlemen. Press two for no. Citizens, we must take our country back.(APPLAUSE)Your critics would argue that\u2019s exactly what you did at Hewlett Packard when 30,000 people lost their jobs. If it did not work at H.P., why would it work at the federal government?Secondly, at Hewlett Packard, as you know \u2014 the people of Iowa know this \u2014 we went through a tough time. The worst technology recession in 25 years \u2014 a great company called Gateway used to do be right here in Iowa. But they didn\u2019t make the tough calls necessary to save all those jobs, and so they lost every one of those jobs.Yes, I\u2019ve had to make some tough calls. We saved 80,000 jobs. We went on to grow to 160,000 jobs. And, frankly, I think the American people know we need a president who\u2019s going to make some tough calls.So let me tell you where I\u2019m going to start. The American people got a bill passed through Congress that said we could fire the top 400 senior executives at the V.A. for dereliction of duty.When we know that 307,000 veterans have died waiting for health care and the V.A. handed out $142 million worth of bonuses for superb performance, I\u2019m going to start by firing 400...(BELL RINGS)... senior executives at the V.A.(APPLAUSE)She leans on her parents for help. She says she can\u2019t buy presents for her children. We are all sympathetic to this woman\u2019s plight. On the other hand, the G.O.P. is supposed to be the party of smaller government. So what would you look her in the eye and say?History suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.This is an opportunity for America. It\u2019s an opportunity for us to get those jobs back. And by the way, do you want to solve global climate change? Take 2 million jobs from China in manufacturing and moving them back here to the United States, where we produce one-fifth the CO2 when we make things.(APPLAUSE)We can help \u2014 we can do every \u2014 we can do it all. We can take care of the environment. We can create more jobs here. Seventy-four percent of Americans don\u2019t have a college degree.And unfortunately most folks who, in the Republican Party, don\u2019t talk about what we\u2019re going to do to create jobs for people who feel like neither political party cares about them.(BELL RINGS)When you elect me, we\u2019ll create opportunities for working men and women in this country \u2014 all over this country.(LAUGHTER)But that person you asked Rick about a moment ago, that lady that\u2019s making 10,000 bucks a year, do you know what our poverty programs do to people? They keep them in poverty.They keep them in poverty because we have these arbitrary thresholds...(APPLAUSE)My mother grew up in a house, oldest of seven kids. She had lived in a house that didn\u2019t have floors. Just dirt. No electricity. No running water. I resent it when people say, oh, people are poor because they want to be. No, they are not.Nobody wants to be poor. And that\u2019s a stupid, foolish thing, mean thing to say. People are poor because they don\u2019t know how to get out of the hole. And government shouldn\u2019t push them back in the hole which is what our policies do when they punish people who want to go to work and don\u2019t let them out. (APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)You and others say that you would rip up that deal. But, really, by the time the next president is in office, won\u2019t that horse be well out of the barn?And that\u2019s very dangerous because it means people in the Middle East have to begin to react to that right now. The United States, I think, has to continue to exercise its influence in the Middle East, stay active, and not do this pull-back type of program that we are seeing all over the place with President Obama, which is creating this kind of danger.The world is a more dangerous place now than when I was an intelligence agent. We have not only this international guerrilla war but also these challenges from these other countries as well.But, Martha, I want to say one more thing to you and Bill. I disagree with Carly Fiorina when she says that it\u2019s just a political class in Washington. The truth is that the country has changed. And there are powerful forces at this point that are really controlling our lives. And that\u2019s why people are so angry.One of those is government, which is regulating everything through the Environmental Protection Agency, through other places. But the biggest one is the organized establishment media.And I just noticed just now you gave Carly Fiorina two one-minute answers in a row. This media across the country is manipulating and shaping and framing this campaign and has been for at least a year now in order to get the kind of choices that people are going to have an opportunity to see.This is wrong. It has to change. And when I\u2019m president, it\u2019s going to change.(APPLAUSE)(LAUGHTER)When it comes to the tragic mass killings that we have seen in this country, Donald Trump says that what we need to do is build quote \u201cmore institutions for people who are sickos.\u201dCharles Krauthammer also says that in some cases involuntary commitment would help. And you have agreed with that. Given that institutions would be extraordinarily expensive to begin building, how much is too much to ask on this from the American taxpayer?But I do believe this is one of the really principle issues in this campaign. The president and Hillary Clinton are working very hard to change the culture of this country in order to put us in a position where we can\u2019t exercise Second Amendment rights.That\u2019s wrong. I am a board member of the National Rifle Association.If gun control...(BELL RINGING)(APPLAUSE)The Conservative Club for Growth has had an issue with your policy on taxes for years. In fact, it called you, \u201cTax Hike Mike\u201d. And, the record shows state spending in Arkansas increased 54% when you were in charge, 94% if you include federal dollars during that same period. When it comes to helping people at the margins, $30,000, $32,000 dollars a year, what\u2019s better? A tax and spend approach, or shrinking government?I also was able to see per capita income growth in my state go up by 50%. I think that\u2019s a pretty darn good record. Look at the overall record and it was fine.But, it\u2019s not about stats from when I was governor. Look, one of the reasons I support the Fairtax is because it\u2019s the one thing, Bill, that would truly empower people at the bottom of the economy by no longer punishing them for their work.If a guy works an hourly job, and he works eight hours, gets paid for it, terrific. But, if he works 16 hours, he doesn\u2019t get a double paycheck because he\u2019s going to be bumped up into a new tax bracket, and the government will get more of his second shift than he will. So, we\u2019ve actually punished him for being industrious, hardworking, and that is a foolish economic policy...(BELL RINGING)(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: Well, in fact, the plan that I put forward is scored by the Tax Foundation as bringing three and a half million jobs into this country, and we have provisions in the flat tax for the corporate side that actually has a phase in of manufacturing. Manufacturers initially don\u2019t pay any income tax. Ten percent the next year, and 20.We\u2019re going to also have a repatriation provision which says that if you have money overseas, and you\u2019re Apple, and you got a couple hundred billion dollars there, bring it back. The most you\u2019ll be taxed 10%, invest it here in America. Create jobs here in America with all that money that\u2019s sitting overseas.We also \u2014 it\u2019s not just taxes. It\u2019s regulation. I\u2019ve pledged to cut every single Obamacare \u2014 I mean, excuse me, Obama regulation, including Obamacare, and remove those regulations that cost more than a hundred million dollars in the economy. That will liberate \u2014 and that includes waters of the U.S., and the ozone regulations, they \u2014 the mercury regulations. All of these just crush our manufactures and don\u2019t create an opportunity for us to survive.And, remember, China produces five times as much CO2 and other pollutants per dollar of GDP as we do.(BELL RINGING)SANTORUM: You want to help the environment? Bring jobs back to America.(APPLAUSE)HEMMER: Senator, thank you.MACCALLUM: Still more to come from the Republican Presidential debate tonight.We\u2019ll see you, just a moment \u2014 back.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK )MACCALLUM: We are back live at the Iowa events center and this question goes to Carly Fiorina. In the last debate you said as part of your introduction, quote, \u201c And unlike the other woman candidate in this case I actually love spending time with my husband.\u201d(LAUGHTER)FIORINA: He is right there. He is right there.MACCALLUM: But back in September in an interview you said that you would stick only to the record, your record versus Hillary Clinton\u2019s record. And never resort to personal attacks. So what changed?FIORINA: It wasn\u2019t a personal attack. I was pointing out the fact that Hillary Clinton will do anything to gain and hang on to power, anything. Listen, if my husband did what Bill Clinton did, I would have left him long ago.(APPLAUSE)FIORINA: So, here\u2019s the deal. Hillary Clinton has been climbing the ladder to try and get power and here now she is trying for the White House. She is probably more qualified for the big house, honestly.(LAUGHTER)She has escaped prosecution more times than El Chapo, perhaps Sean Penn should interview her.(LAUGHTER)The woman should be prosecuted.(APPLAUSE) FIORINA: And while Mrs. Clinton has flown hundreds of thousands of world around the global, I have too. And I know flying is an activity not an accomplishment. While I know that she has held many positions and many titles she has not accomplished much of anything in her life. She has gotten every single foreign policy challenge wrong.(BELL RINGS)She continues to lie to the American people. It\u2019s called the Clinton way. Both Bill and Hillary practice it, the Clinton way. Say whatever you have to say, do whatever you have to say. Lie as long as you can get away with it. Hillary Clinton cannot be the president of these United States.(APPLAUSE)MACCALLUM: All right. Carly, I want to stay with you on this next question as well.You waded into the Planned Parenthood early on. You took some heat for it. Now the people who shot that undercover video are the ones who got indicted and Planned Parenthood is untouched. Hillary Clinton has been crowing about this. Any regrets about this?FIORINA: Well, you know, Hillary Clinton hasn\u2019t been indicted either. So that tells us a lot about our justice system in this country. But, look, the facts of Planned Parenthood have not changed, folks, and I will not be rendered silent on this issue or any other issue.And it doesn\u2019t matter what stage I\u2019m on. Here are the facts. Planned Parenthood engages in partial birth abortion, in late-term abortion. They alter those abortion techniques to harvest and sell body parts. They have admitted that they are not going to accept compensation for this anymore.The reality is, most Americans find this practice horrific. Most Americans find horrific that Hillary Clinton\u2019s position on this is it\u2019s not a life until it\u2019s born. Most Americans find horrific Hillary Clinton\u2019s position or the Democrat party\u2019s position, that a young woman does not need her mother\u2019s permission to get an abortion.But if you are 13 years old, you can get an abortion, but you can\u2019t go to a tanning salon without your mother\u2019s permission. A president Fiorina \u2014 in a president Fiorina budget, there will not be one dime for Planned Parenthood, although there would be a lot of money for women\u2019s health and we will finally pass the pain capable unborn child protection act.I will always stand for life and religious liberty...(BELL RINGS)... because this is about the character of our nation.(APPLAUSE) MACCALLUM: Thank you Carly Fiorina. Let me just ask a quick question here to Senator Santorum.Carly Fiorina was the only one of the GOP candidates to attend the March for Life in Washington last week. Where were you.SANTORUM: Well, I\u2019ve been to the March for Life for about 25 years and I thought \u2014 I think that\u2019s a pretty good record.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: Spoken at it a few times and I have shepherded every single piece of pro-life piece of legislation that\u2019s passed over the last 20 years. I\u2019ve either authored it or shepherded it through the United States Congress and I\u2019m pretty proud of that record too.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: But we have an election going on and there was some snow coming. So I decided that maybe it would be better for me to get out and do some campaigning and not be stuck as my wife and kids were for a week, piling out of two and a half feet of snow.So, here\u2019s what I would say. If you want someone that is going to talk a good game, there are a lot of folks on this stage that have talked a good game on the issue of life.Not only have I talked a good game on life and I\u2019ve done some things. But I\u2019ve also lived it. You know, one of the things Saint Francis said was, you know, if you preach the gospel, then if you have to, speak.The bottom line is, that twice in my life, we were counseled to have an abortion, one with our son Gabriel and one with our little girl Bella. And neither time did Karen and I for a moment think about it because we know that life begins at conception.We know the dignity of every human life and we know the potential of every child, no matter how long that life lives. And that is a message that can come across to all Americans and without having to say a word and defend the institution of life and the dignity of life in this country.(APPLAUSE)FIORINA: Martha, can I just say we\u2019ve been talking tonight about a lot of issues and we\u2019ve also been talking about the fact that the game is rigged and frankly, the media has a lot to do with that.It is outrageous frankly, that Fox News, and you, would question the pro-life credentials of Rick Santorum.(APPLAUSE)FIORINA: That is outrageous.(APPLAUSE)HEMMER: Thank you Ms. Fiorina.Governor Gilmore. Who are the moderate Muslims do you seek advice and counsel from on how to deal with the threat from radical Islamic terrorism?GILMORE: You know Bill, that raises, I think, the question of the future of the Republican party. The question is \u2014 first of all, I stand second to no one in standing up to radical Islamism. I understand that ISIS is a piece of that but it is a world-wide phenomena that has manifested itself in Paris, in 9/11, in San Bernardino, in Boston.I recognize all that. But I also recognize this. This is a strain of Islamism that cannot be supported and cannot be stood for. And what we need is for people in the Muslim community in the United States to stand up and be counted and to say that this is not right.And yes, I have met with some people. And I\u2019m not going to identify who they are. I met with them last week. And they told me some terrible stories about how they have been harassed and their children have seen them be harassed.And I said to them. You have got to stand up and condemn this radical Islamism because it\u2019s the war of ideas that we are going to have to win to go along with our military conflicts that are coming forward.But the point is Bill...(BELL RINGS)... we cannot have a Republican party that scapegoats anyone, Hispanics, Muslims, any women, African Americans, anyone. If that becomes the future of the Republican party, I don\u2019t want to be a part of that.HEMMER: Thank you governor.(APPLAUSE)HEMMER: Governor Huckabee. Here in Iowa 43 percent of Democratic caucus goers describe themselves as socialist. That\u2019s a higher number than those who say they are capitalist. I guess you could say, they\u2019re feeling the burn.(LAUGHTER)HEMMER: This is a country rooted in capitalism, the United States of America. How did we get here?HUCKABEE: I honestly don\u2019t understand how anybody with IQ above plant life would honestly think...(LAUGHTER)HUCKABEE: ... that we would be better off if we let the government have all of the private property and that the government would dole out what they thought we should have.I\u2019m not \u201cfeeling the Bern,\u201d Bill. I\u2019m not feeling it.(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: And when Bernie Sanders promises these kids free college, I\u2019m telling them, because I get asked, what about free college? I said, look, if we give you free college when you are 20, pal, you are going to be paying for it when you are 30, when you are 40, and when you are 50.(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: There is no such thing as the government giving you anything. They will definitely make a mess of it.And I just think there are a lot of people who have never understood the basic understanding of economics, that you do not make people rich by tearing down those who are you providing jobs, and you don\u2019t help poor people by taking away.You give them jobs. Let them work. Let them earn. And then you let them keep the money that they earned. That\u2019s how we build a great economy.(APPLAUSE)HEMMER: Thank you, Governor.Senator Santorum, the president says politics in America have become meaner over the past several years with him in the White House. Two weeks ago at the State of the Union he said the following. \u201cA president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide.\u201dHEMMER: Lincoln and Roosevelt, that\u2019s pretty good company. If he is right, do Republicans share some of the blame?SANTORUM: The president of the United States has been the most divisive president in \u2014 certainly in my lifetime. This is a man who constantly...(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: He is not trustworthy. You can\u2019t sit down and negotiate with him. He won\u2019t keep a deal. We have heard that over and over again. And here is what he does that really, really creates the friction in Washington.He personally attacks people. He ascribes motives to them that aren\u2019t true and then he tears them down. How are you going to work with someone if you don\u2019t treat them decently, honestly, and respectfully?I was a tough fighter when I was in Washington. I had very sharp elbows. I fought. I went there and joined a game named Jim Nussle here from Iowa with the \u201cgang of seven.\u201d And we, in four years\u2019 time, took a Congress that had been controlled by Democrats for 40 years, and brought in the first Republican majority because we fought and we fought tough.But you know what? I was able to then work with those same people that we fought with and able to pass welfare reform. Unborn Victims of Violence Act. Pro-life bills. Health savings accounts.A whole laundry list of things not because I was mean, but because I was able to be respectful in the disagreements. And that\u2019s what we need in Washington, someone who can be respectful and still unite this country.(APPLAUSE)HEMMER: Thank you, Senator.MACCALLUM: All right. Coming up, we will have the closing statements from our candidates tonight as we continue live from the Iowa Events Center in Des Moines. We\u2019ll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HEMMER: In the closing few moments, the candidates have an opportunity to make a closing statement, 30 seconds for each. And, we want to start tonight with the former Virginia Governor, Jim Gilmore.GILMORE: Well, thank you very much, Bill. And, thank you, and Fox and Google for including me in this debate tonight. I think it\u2019s been a wonderful opportunity.I\u2019m the son of a meat cutter. My father worked for Safeway stores for 45 years. My mother was a secretary, she ended her career as the Secretary for the Methodist Bishop. I didn\u2019t have a father that could give me a million dollar loan to start my business. But, my father did talk character, and he provided for his family, and he was a wonderful example.And, I\u2019m not about to go across town tonight to carry the coat for some billionaire. Instead, I intend to run for President of the United States, speak to the issue of this international war, and challenge that we\u2019re in. This issue of veterans rights, and the issue of Second Amendment rights, and I ask for your support...HEMMER: ... Thank you, Governor.(APPLAUSE)MACCALLUM: Alright, let\u2019s go now to Senator Rick Santorum.SANTORUM: I just want to thank the people of Iowa. Over the last five years I\u2019ve done 700 speeches and town hall meetings all throughout the state of Iowa, and it has been an incredible right. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)I want to thank all the wonderful folks like Pastor Carey (ph) Gordon (ph) who gave me a smooth stone and said you go slay Goliaths. Someone like Jim and Janet Cook who over this past Christmas gave up Christmas presents for their kids, and they have more than I do, just they can help me and my campaign.That\u2019s the kind of people...(BELL RINGING) SANTORUM: ... in Iowa. And, here\u2019s what I\u2019m asking you to do. You\u2019re good people. You know good leaders. Lead. Pick the right person, not what the polls say. Not who the money give people to. Pick the leader you know is best for this country. Thank you.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)HEMMER: Governor Huckabee.HUCKABEE: Well, this week there was a little dust up about a video we put together with the music of Adele, so I thought it\u2019d be appropriate for me to begin tonight by saying, \u201cHello, Iowa. It\u2019s me.\u201dMACCALLUM: (LAUGHING)HUCKABEE: And, you know me. You gave me the largest number of votes in the history of the Iowa caucus eight years ago, and I think you did it because you trusted me, you believed that I had your best interest at heart.When I was governor I had a little plaque in my office in the Governor\u2019s office, and it simply said this. Come, let us reason together.(BELL RINGING)HUCKABEE: I believe the next President needs to put that plaque in the oval office, and needs to lead this country by saying, \u201cCome, let us reason together.\u201dGod bless you, and thank you for your support.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)HEMMER: Thank you, Governor.MACCALLUM: Carly Fiorina.FIORINA: In over 150 events I have come to know and love the people of Iowa. And the people of Iowa know what the rest of Americans have figured out, this ain\u2019t working anymore. The government no longer works for those who pay for it. The professional political class says and does whatever they need to do to win, and then does whatever they please.We need to return to a citizen government. That is why I am running for President. The media, the establishment, they all want to tell you this elections over, they know who\u2019s going to win it, except that you haven\u2019t...(BELL RINGING)FIORINA: ... cast a single vote yet. So, the people of Iowa, stand with me, fight with me. Caucus for me. It is time to take our country back.MACCALLUM: Thank you, Carly.(APPLAUSE)HEMMER: That concludes our debate tonight, but the night has just begun.MACCALLUM: In one hour, seven more candidates take the stage for a debate hosted by Bret Baier, Megyn Kelly, and Chris Wallace. But, up next, the O\u2019Reilly Factor.Good night, everybody.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Leaders Deny Strife Caused Departures From Politico ", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Supported byIn recent weeks, the staff at Politico noticed nearly all of its bosses \u2014 including the political publication\u2019s founders, Jim VandeHei and John F. Harris \u2014 going in and out of meetings at its sleek new offices in Virginia.Despite the staff\u2019s suspicions about the many meetings \u2014 \u201cif they hadn\u2019t noticed, they are probably working in the wrong place,\u201d Mr. Harris said of his reporters \u2014 the announcement shocked the newsroom, and the political media establishment, of which Politico had become an integral part.In interviews on Friday, Mr. Harris, now Politico\u2019s publisher and editor in chief, and its owner, Robert Allbritton, dismissed reports that any tension among the organization\u2019s leaders had led to the departures.\u201cI think Jim really wants to run his own company, and at the end of the day, that is the one thing I cannot offer him,\u201d Mr. Allbritton said.In a separate interview, Mr. VandeHei said his departure was very much a personal choice, and was not prompted by any disagreement or awkwardness, as reflected by the long transition period before his departure.\u201cI have been at this a decade, and I have my own ambitions,\u201d he said.The decisions were announced at once, Mr. Harris said, because he had worried that a series of announcements might prompt further speculation and intrigue in the newsroom and outside.Mr. VandeHei, Mr. Allen and Roy Schwartz, the chief revenue officer, will depart after the November presidential election. The chief operating officer, Kim Kingsley, and the executive vice president for expansion, Danielle Jones, will leave sooner.Mr. VandeHei and Mr. Allen will most likely start a venture together, with Mr. Schwartz, according to a person with knowledge of their plans who spoke on condition of anonymity. It will not be a direct competitor to Politico, the person said.Politico was founded in 2007 with a few employees, and has grown to employ nearly 500 worldwide. It has established a business model that combines lucrative \u201cpro\u201d subscriptions for insiders, with revenue from advertising and events, and it has recently been expanding its reach. It started a European operation, in partnership with the German media company Axel Springer, and has begun an expansion into statehouses across the United States, now the front line for many national political issues.Politico\u2019s leaders had routinely debated those moves and their timing, Mr. Harris said. \u201cI\u2019d say over the past few years, there were really vigorous discussions about whether Europe was something for someday, or right now,\u201d he said. \u201cRobert thought right now, a year or so ago,\u201d he said, and the company pursued that expansion. \u201cThe states, Jim felt strongly about, and he made an enthusiast out of Robert \u2014 but he had to answer a lot of legitimate, tough-minded questions.\u201dThe departures are a transition point for Politico, Mr. Harris, Mr. Allbritton and Susan Glasser, its editor, said.\u201cThis is a problem that all successful start-ups have,\u201d Mr. Allbritton said. \u201cThey have to learn how to manage their growth. It\u2019s maybe a bit strange that this is happening in journalism as opposed to tech.\u201dThe executives who remain, he said, are the ones who have been most intimately involved with the company\u2019s expansions. Politico will hire at least 50 people in the coming year and successors for those who have left. None of the planned new endeavors \u2014 including more reporting on finance \u2014 will come at the expense of what Ms. Glasser called \u201chigh-velocity scoop reporting.\u201dThe Playbook morning email franchise, which Mr. Allen made his own over years of high-metabolism reporting, will be expanded, Mr. Harris said, though it will not try to replicate Mr. Allen\u2019s unique style. \u201cJournalism in many cases is driven by people with distinctive, individual voices,\u201d he said.Mr. Allbritton said that Politico had repaid its initial investment within three years of its founding, and that money it now makes goes back into the business to support the expansion. It remains the case, he said, that any new project must support itself financially in about three years. \u201cMy intention with the company is to continue the strategy we have proposed, with serious and meaningful growth and the serious investment that comes with that \u2014 tens of millions of dollars,\u201d he said. He declined to disclose specific details of the company\u2019s financial performance.The departures, Mr. Harris said, were not a divorce in the face of that growth, but a graduation, a bittersweet moment.Mr. Allbritton said that Mr. VandeHei and Mr. Allen had not sought to start their venture within Politico \u2014 a move that would have echoed how Politico was founded. Mr. VandeHei and Mr. Harris were working at The Washington Post, where they proposed the idea before striking out on their own.Mr. VandeHei concurred. \u201cI can\u2019t say that it\u2019s not an emotional decision,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have a start-up it\u2019s in your bones, it becomes a part of who you are.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hispanics and Asian-Americans Face Barriers to Lower Offices, Report Finds", "Date": "2016-01-25", "News": "A new report from a nonpartisan organization focused on getting more Asian-American and Latinos elected to state and local offices found that the two groups are facing obstacles as they seek to achieve greater representation to match their fast-growing populations.Among the barriers members of these groups faced is that they were less likely to come up with the idea of running for office themselves \u00e2\u0080\u0094 usually only doing so if the idea was suggested by another person. Hispanic women also were likelier to report being discouraged \u201cby their political party more than any other group,\u201d the report noted. Th candidates also tended to rely strongly on support from unions and community groups to be successful, and they found fund-raising one of the most difficult hurdles. That was particularly true among Hispanic women, according to the report. The report is significant at a time when both the Democratic and Republican parties are trying to groom candidates for top offices  by having them enter politics through lower positions. The report surveyed responses from 544 elected officials across the country, and found that Asian-Americans and Hispanics faced specific hurdles that other minority groups did not. Sayu Bhojwani, the president and founder of the New American Leadership project, said that there were nevertheless encouraging signs in the report. \u201cWhat we see from this report is that Asian-Americans and Latinos face barriers, yes, but that despite this, they run and win,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery individual candidate matters to us, because each one helps to close the representation gap and fights for her community.

{"Headline": "The Timeshare Hard Sell Comes Roaring Back", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "Supported byFor more than 25 years, Mary Ann Gutierrez, 77, has spent several weeks a year at on the southern shore of Lake Tahoe, Calif., often playing host to her children and grandchildren at one of two timeshare units she owns.When she checked into one of the properties last year, she was stopped at the front desk. A $100 gift card would be hers if she attended a presentation by Diamond Resorts International, the company that owns the resort. But first she had to fill out some papers and supply her credit card information.The gift card came with a cost, as Ms. Gutierrez soon learned. For five hours, she said, Diamond representatives pushed her to give up both of her timeshare deeds, including one at the nearby Tahoe Beach & Ski Club, a resort that Diamond does not own. With the upgrade and membership in Diamond\u2019s ownership points system, they said, she would keep her maintenance costs low and could use her points at other resorts in the company\u2019s network. It would cost just $30,000 upfront, they said.Even when representatives suggested her maintenance fees would rise if she didn\u2019t switch, Ms. Gutierrez kept declining, saying that the cost was too high. Undeterred, the Diamond representatives suggested that she ask her children to pay for the upgrade. She continued to say no and, at last, they let her go.\u201cThey weren\u2019t going to let me out that door,\u201d Ms. Gutierrez said. \u201cI was shaking, I was so nervous.\u201dThe feeling turned to shock, however, when a Diamond representative handed her a record of a voided charge in the amount of $4,840 on her credit card. The representatives had been so certain that she would agree to the offer that they had charged her card for the down payment \u2014 even though she had not given approval.After crashing in the financial collapse, timeshare sales are rising again, and with them high-pressure sales practices such as those Ms. Gutierrez described. Perhaps acknowledging these problems, some in the industry have cautioned in recent months that regulators from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau could increase their oversight. New rules would affect all operators, including big players like Diamond, Interval Leisure Group, Marriott Vacations Worldwide and Wyndham Worldwide. But tighter regulation might have an especially big impact on Diamond, because its business is devoted solely to timeshare sales and management.Interviews with timeshare owners, lawyers and other specialists in the arena, moreover, suggest that Diamond\u2019s sales practices can be especially forceful.\u201cIn my experience, Diamond is much more ambitious, aggressive and downright nasty in their sales presentations compared to Marriott and Westin,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cDiamond just has an amazing reputation of being tough on people.\u201dDavid F. Palmer, Diamond\u2019s chief executive, sees its sales methods in a very different light. In an interview, Mr. Palmer described how Diamond tries to bring fun to its customer interactions, both before an initial sale and once a member buys in. \u201cThe industry didn\u2019t quite realize that you have to engage and create intimacy and pervasiveness with somebody that you don\u2019t really know,\u201d he said. \u201cOur lifetime subscription model creates a series of systems where you can track that engagement and make sure you are constantly providing a series of experiences that exceed their expectations over many, many years.\u201dNeither Mr. Palmer nor the company\u2019s spokeswoman would discuss Ms. Gutierrez\u2019s experience. But on the topic of high-pressure sales tactics, Mr. Palmer said, \u201cI have belligerently zero tolerance for anyone who goes off script.\u201dDiamond has had great success in the industry. In less than 10 years, the company\u2019s revenue reached $845 million last year, more than double the 2010 figure. Its average timeshare transaction price was $21,700 last year, up from $12,510 in 2012.But while Diamond\u2019s growth has benefited its executives \u2014 Mr. Palmer received a total of $19 million in compensation in the most recent two years for which figures are available \u2014 the company\u2019s business practices seem to have alienated some customers.In lawsuits and in interviews, customers complain not only of high-pressure sales, but also of sky-high maintenance fees and frustration at procedures that block club members from taking vacations where and when they want. Perhaps most distressing to owners is the fact that once you buy into a timeshare it is almost impossible to get out.Larry Vicks, a retired engineer in upstate New York, is a disgruntled Diamond resort member who read the transcript of a Diamond conference call with Wall Street analysts and investors. \u201cIt made me laugh how they are making boatloads of money,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe reason I\u2019m laughing is that it\u2019s all at my expense.\u201dIn the early years of timeshares, owners received deeds specifying their ownership. Now, the industry has moved to a system where buyers receive a certain number of points they can use for time and amenities, rather than a deed.Many timeshare buyers say they like being assured time at a resort they enjoy without the hassle of owning a second home. Using their points for a vacation at a different location managed by their timeshare company is another potential benefit.Diamond, which was created in 2007 by Stephen J. Cloobeck, a veteran of the vacation ownership industry, has its headquarters in Las Vegas. The company operates 99 resorts worldwide and has associations with an additional 255 resorts and four cruise itineraries that it says its members can use. The company\u2019s tagline: \u201cWe Love to Say Yes.\u201dBut two lawsuits filed against Diamond suggest a less solicitous attitude, one that reflects the experience of Ms. Gutierrez in Lake Tahoe. One case was filed in October 2014 in California. In it, 11 timeshare owners said they had agreed to pay to upgrade their membership in the Diamond resorts. After the upgrade, the lawsuit says, the members were unable to use the resorts they had hoped to and their maintenance fees rose even though Diamond\u2019s representatives had told them they would fall.A Florida lawsuit filed in March 2015 said that Diamond tried to pressure the plaintiffs to upgrade to what amounted to \u201cprograms to fleece more and more money out of the plaintiffs.\u201dThe two suits seek cancellation of the contracts, money back and unspecified damages.Diamond declined to comment on the California case; it said that the litigants in the Florida suit \u201cnever made a purchase from Diamond\u201d but were owners in a resort company it had purchased without assuming such liabilities.Not all of Diamond\u2019s customers are unhappy, of course. Six members whose names were supplied by Diamond were all complimentary.Walter Hunter, a retired chemist who lives in Fort Collins, Colo., is one. A member of the homeowners\u2019 association board at Daytona Beach Regency, a Diamond resort in Florida, Mr. Hunter, 94, said in an interview that he was happy with the company\u2019s management. With Diamond, \u201cwe\u2019ve been more pleased, the resort is better managed,\u201d he said. Although he acknowledged that maintenance costs rose significantly after Diamond came in, he said, \u201cWe are convinced that they are doing a good job.\u201dOwners of timeshares in desirable resorts with unusual attributes, like a private beach, can often sell their ownership interests on the secondary market. But in areas glutted with condos for sale or rent, selling a timeshare can be almost impossible. In these cases, timeshare ownership can become an almost perpetual liability.Rub\u00e9n Pe\u00f1a\u2019s experience is a case in point. An engineering consultant with Pro Data Inc. in Jersey City, Mr. Pe\u00f1a has never been inside the Las Vegas timeshare he bought 15 years ago. After spending roughly $42,000 to buy and maintain the property over those years, Mr. Pe\u00f1a stopped paying his loan, which had an original interest rate approaching 17 percent, and maintenance fees. He bought the timeshare from a company called Pacific Monarch Resorts, which went bankrupt. Diamond now owns and manages the resort.\u201cI wanted to deed back the property to Diamond and get my equity of about $27,000 out,\u201d Mr. Pe\u00f1a said in an interview. \u201cBut I got no response whatsoever.\u201dBefore he stopped paying his loan in 2014, Mr. Pe\u00f1a was being charged $3,262 a year in interest, taxes and maintenance fees for his ownership interest in the timeshare. Expedia.com offers a week at the propertyfor, at most, a little over $2,000.Diamond declined to comment on Mr. Pe\u00f1a. But the company said that one reason it doesn\u2019t buy back members\u2019 stakes is that it would create accounting problems related to how Diamond had booked the revenue.Don Nelms is a Diamond member and longtime owner of an insurance agency in Sedona, Ariz. In an interview at the company\u2019s suggestion, he said that he was pleased with Diamond\u2019s resort management. But he added that he was troubled by the company\u2019s refusal to buy back timeshare holdings from customers who can no longer afford them or just want out. Acknowledging that this practice is industrywide, he said changing it would be an \u201cowner-friendly\u201d move by Diamond.\u201cIf it\u2019s paid-up on the principal, they could purchase that from an owner at maybe a reduced market value that helps the person who wants to say goodbye,\u201d he said. Not making that effort, he added, \u201ccould be something that blows up in their face.\u201dCompanies like Diamond benefit from the lack of an organized buyers\u2019 market for timeshares. The company\u2019s most recent annual financial filing noted that if such a market \u201cwere to become more organized and liquid,\u201d the resulting availability of vacation units \u201ccould adversely affect our sales and our sales prices.\u201dAnd even if an owner defaults and walks away from maintenance fees, Diamond can prosper. It simply repossesses the unit at little cost and tries to resell.An official at the bureau declined to comment on the industry.Aggressive sales tactics are among the most common complaints. Typically, potential timeshare buyers are invited to a free or low-cost mini-vacation at a resort if they agree to attend a sales presentation during their stay. Participants say fast-talking, commission-paid sales representatives often run these events, emphasizing the merits of timeshares as investments and downplaying their shortcomings.Customers are told the meetings will last less than two hours, but they often go on far longer, and participants find it difficult to leave.Speaking about the industry generally, Mr. Finn said that buyers are often led to believe they are making a real estate deal and that their holding will have a value that they can recoup in a resale or pass on to their children.\u201cNothing can be further from the truth,\u201d Mr. Finn said.In November, Diamond said that over the last 12 months it had conducted about 221,000 tours at its 53 sales offices around the world. The company says that 15.1 percent of tours result in sales.Diamond says its innovative programs \u201cinfuse hospitality into our sales and marketing efforts.\u201d Its \u201cEvents of a Lifetime\u201d include golf outings with a professional, spring training with Reggie Jackson, the baseball Hall of Famer, or tickets to a show near a Diamond-owned resort.In the interview, Mr. Palmer said he was proud that roughly 60 percent of the company\u2019s sales came from existing customers. \u201cI wear it like a badge of honor,\u201d he said. \u201cThese people bought from us, and they want to own more.\u201dIn addition, he noted, sales are regulated by state authorities. \u201cNo one stumbles into a purchase here,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have five to 10 days to think about it.\u201dBut even fans of Diamond recognize that accusations of high-pressure sales tactics in the industry can be problematic for property managers. \u201cThere\u2019s some natural tension between management who wants to create the best experience possible, and the sales organization \u2014 they are motivated to want different things,\u201d said Terry Timm, a Diamond timeshare owner who is chief administrative officer of Thrivent, a financial services company. \u201cThe way timeshare sales are structured have really really incentivized the wrong things.\u201dDiamond often buys resorts that have fallen into bankruptcy, acquiring timeshare owners as part of the deals. After Diamond takes over a resort, it usually becomes the management company and often raises maintenance fees.Some of these increases reflect the costs of necessary improvements at resorts that have fallen on hard times. But Diamond members who are critical of the company say that it typically gains control of the resort\u2019s governing board, known as the homeowners\u2019 association, giving timeshare owners little say in how money is spent.Owners at some resorts are wary about ceding any board control to Diamond. Jacob Bercu, is a retired Silicon Valley software engineer and longtime resort owner at Tahoe Beach & Ski. A few years ago, some of the resort\u2019s roughly 7,000 owners noticed that Diamond was buying up defaulted timeshare segments at county tax auctions. Last September he won a board seat sought by a Diamond representative. \u201cWe took aggressive action to keep them away from the ownership, to convince our owners not to sell out and, instead, to vote for us so we keep control,\u201d Mr. Bercu said.Timeshare owners of the Grand Beach Resort, a 192-unit property in Orlando, Fla., on the other hand, learned in a letter in September that their annual maintenance fee would rise 14.9 percent this year. Management fees paid by the resort members, the letter said, are expected to jump to a total of $1.15 million from about $366,000 in 2015.Diamond said the increases at Grand Beach resulted from a new management contract, consistent with the company\u2019s deals elsewhere, and higher operating costs and reserves for renovations.The chief beneficiary of these cost increases is Diamond, which levies management fees at the properties it owns and operates. Diamond tells investors that it typically reaps a fee equal to as much as 15 percent more than the costs of running a resort: labor, utilities, taxes and other overhead, including the reserve funds kept for emergencies.\u201cAnything that is put in the budget that gets expended on an annual basis, we get our 15 percent fee,\u201d Mr. Palmer explained to investors at a September 2014 conference, according to a transcript. \u201cThat is basically a 100 percent profit business.\u201dIn the interview, Mr. Palmer added that the company was completely transparent with owners about its charges. \u201cAll the costs are disclosed on a private website,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are no hidden fees.\u201dDiamond\u2019s founder, Mr. Cloobeck, is something of a celebrity.This compensation disturbs owners faced with rising maintenance costs extracted by Diamond. Among them is Eleanor Varkel, a caterer from South Africa who has two of the company\u2019s timeshares, one in Las Vegas and another in Hawaii. Both were taken over by Diamond after the companies operating the resorts collapsed.\u201cEvery year the maintenance fees go up, up, up,\u201d Ms. Varkel said in an interview. \u201cWe were paying $300 a year in maintenance 15 years ago, and now it\u2019s gone up to $2,000 a year.\u201d Ms. Varkel said she had tried, unsuccessfully, to sell her ownership stake either to Diamond or elsewhere. \u201cYou can\u2019t give it away, not even to charity.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the number of resorts operated by Diamond. It is 99 resorts, not 93.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Alarmed Clinton Supporters Begin Focusing on Sanders\u2019s Socialist Edge", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported by\u201cHere in the heartland, we like our politicians in the mainstream, and he is not \u2014 he\u2019s a socialist,\u201d said Gov. Jay Nixon of Missouri, who is term-limited and working to elect a Democratic successor. \u201cHe\u2019s entitled to his positions, and it\u2019s a big-tent party, but as far as having him at the top of the ticket, it would be a meltdown all the way down the ballot.\u201dAnd after months of ignoring Republican cheerleading for Mr. Sanders, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign has started aggressively highlighting how much the opposition is openly providing him aid and comfort \u2014 mostly recently in a new ad by Karl Rove\u2019s group American Crossroads that echoes Mr. Sanders\u2019s attacks on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s ties to Wall Street.Mr. Sanders, for his part, has taken to highlighting polls that show him faring better than Mrs. Clinton against some of the Republican candidates, and his aides insist that voters will look past labels to consider his record, ideas and proposals.Yet Mrs. Clinton herself has begun urging activists in Iowa to consider \u201celectability and how we make sure we have a Democrat going back into that White House on Jan. 20, 2017.\u201d And her supporters, with the campaign\u2019s blessing, are aggressively moving to sow doubts about Mr. Sanders\u2019s viability, a tactic aimed at alarming primary voters concerned about retaining the presidency and regaining the Senate.For all the authorized fear-mongering, though, it is clear that few Democrats seeking re-election this year relish the prospect of running with Mr. Sanders on top of the ticket.\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be helpful outside Vermont, Massachusetts, Berkeley, Palo Alto and Ann Arbor,\u201d said Representative Steve Cohen, Democrat of Tennessee.\u201cThe Republicans won\u2019t touch him because they can\u2019t wait to run an ad with a hammer and sickle,\u201d said Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, a supporter of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.Mr. Sanders and his supporters deny that he would be a drag on other Democratic candidates. And Tad Devine, Mr. Sanders\u2019s consultant, recalled another election when Mrs. Clinton\u2019s supporters said her primary opponent was unelectable. \u201cThis is all so reminiscent about what they said about Obama in 2008,\u201d he said.Instead, he framed the primary as a choice between a candidate who is inspiring younger, new and independent voters or one running a 1990s-era race, focused on suburban swing voters, seizing the middle ground on issues like taxes and pushing \u201cincremental change.\u201dAs for the socialist label, Mr. Devine said: \u201cVoters are going to be bombarded with a phenomenal amount of information about him, his life, his political philosophy and his plans, and they\u2019re not going to let that word stop them from looking at him and considering him.\u201dYet after largely ignoring Mr. Sanders as he raised tens of millions of dollars and built a robust grass-roots following, mainstream Democrats are now following Mrs. Clinton\u2019s lead.\u201cI can tell you, as somebody who ran the Democratic Governors Association, that candidates in purple states would face serious problems with him on top of the ticket,\u201d said Gov. Jack Markell of Delaware, referring to the most politically competitive states.\u201cHaving somebody who is identified more as a socialist in many decades of public service than as a Democrat makes it impossible for Democrats in a state like Missouri,\u201d Ms. McCaskill said of her state, which could have competitive races for governor and senator this fall. \u201cAnd it makes it very difficult for Democrats in states like Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida,\u201d she added, referring to states where some of the hardest-fought Senate races will take place.Some Democrats are even talking openly about a kind of cautionary Democratic attack on Mr. Sanders, to show how much the party could be harmed if he were the nominee and Republicans got to sink their teeth into him.\u201cSome third party will say, \u2018This is what the first ad of the general election is going to look like,\u2019\u201d said James Carville, the longtime Clinton adviser, envisioning a commercial savaging Mr. Sanders for supporting tax increases and single-payer health care. \u201cOnce you get the nomination, they are not going to play nice.\u201dAfter the ranks of Democrats in Congress and state capitols thinned under President Obama, the party\u2019s standard-bearer is no small issue. Democrats need at least four seats to win the Senate, and their hopes are promising largely because the races will be fought in states like Wisconsin, Illinois, Nevada and Pennsylvania, which tend to vote for Democratic presidents or at least be hotly contested. They are unlikely to recapture the House, but they could pick up as many as a dozen seats under good conditions. And the outcome of at least five governor\u2019s races will be determined in part by the national political environment.A Sanders-led ticket generates two sets of fears among Clinton supporters: that other Democratic candidates could be linked to his staunchly liberal views, particularly his call to raise taxes, even on middle-class families, to help finance his universal health care plan; and that more mainstream Democrats would have to answer to voters uneasy about what it means to be a European-style social democrat.\u201cHillary Clinton doesn\u2019t have to explain socialism to suburban voters,\u201d said Representative Steve Israel of New York, the former head of the campaign arm for House Democrats, whose hardest-fought races this year include districts outside Philadelphia, Washington and Chicago.House Democrats got a taste of those challenges last fall. As many of their candidates met in Washington with consultants, donors and reporters, word leaked that Mr. Sanders was to give a speech explaining what it means to be a democratic socialist. \u201cWe had candidates and consultants calling us, emailing us, saying: \u2018What do we say about this? How do we explain this?\u2019\u201d recalled a House Democratic official, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to intervene in the presidential race.The official drafted a mock question-and-answer memo.\u201cSenator Sanders has caught fire in the Democratic primary. He is a democratic socialist. Are you a democratic socialist?\u201d went one of the questions. \u201cNo,\u201d was the recommended response.Another question asked the difference between a Democrat and a socialist. Candidates were urged to express pride in being a Democrat but also belief in capitalism and small businesses, \u201cthe engine of our economy.\u201dTo some Democrats, efforts to portray their party as extremist would be made easier were they to nominate a left-wing crusader.\u201cThe things Republicans lied about when they attacked the president would be more true with Bernie in terms of how far left he is,\u201d Mr. Markell said.And Matthew Miller, a former top aide at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said Mr. Sanders would be burdened with the two most glaring vulnerabilities of the Republicans Donald J. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. \u201cHe is hard to see as president, like Trump, and his politics are so far to the left, like Cruz\u2019s are to the right.\u201dAs for whether Democrats risked turning off Mr. Sanders\u2019s legion of youthful supporters by assailing his electability, Senator McCaskill said the party would have no trouble healing.\u201cSix months ago there was a lot of nervousness about keeping the party united and walking gently because we didn\u2019t want to offend millennials and progressives,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think Ted or Trump are going to take care of our need to be united.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fading Presidential Hopes Complicate Rand Paul\u2019s Senate Re-Election Bid", "Date": "2016-01-20", "News": "Supported byBack when Mr. Paul, the curly-haired libertarian darling with the snappy fashion sense, was still a hot presidential prospect, he hatched a plan to skirt a state law barring candidates from being on two ballots at once. If Kentucky Republicans staged a caucus \u2014 \u00e0 la Iowa \u2014 to pick their presidential nominee, Mr. Paul could seek the party\u2019s nomination for the White House and re-election to the Senate, too.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really pass the smell test, running for two offices at once,\u201d said Jim Skaggs, a longtime Republican official and neighbor of Mr. Paul here, describing the initial reaction from the party establishment, which acquiesced in the end. \u201cIt was very skeptical, to say the least.\u201dInstead, around the state and here in Bowling Green, where people know Mr. Paul as an eye surgeon and a soccer coach to his three sons, the talk is of when he will quit his juggling act and come home.\u201cI think he ought to be spending more time on his Senate race,\u201d Tommy Holderfield, an insurance broker and a Democrat who crossed party lines to vote for Mr. Paul, said last week after a Rotary Club luncheon here. \u201cI think he has a better chance of winning that one.\u201dMr. Paul declined to be interviewed. But aides to the senator \u2014 whose supporters briefly interrupted the debate last week with chants of \u201cWe Want Rand!\u201d \u2014 say he is certainly not dropping his White House bid now, even though national polls show that only about 2 percent of Republicans favor his candidacy.\u201cThe only timetable the campaign is focused on at the moment is when the ballots start being cast in Iowa,\u201d said Chris LaCivita, a senior adviser to both Paul campaigns, noting that Mr. Paul still has no Democratic opponent in his Senate race.\u201cHe\u2019s not tending his garden \u2014 he\u2019s hanging out in New Hampshire,\u201d said Jim Cauley, a longtime Kentucky Democratic strategist. \u201cI don\u2019t think he thinks he has a problem, which I think is dangerous in politics.\u201dNow Donald J. Trump and other Republican candidates are \u201csucking all the oxygen out of the room,\u201d in the words of David Adams, who managed Mr. Paul\u2019s 2010 Senate primary campaign.As Mrs. Warner said: \u201cI\u2019m surprised he is not ahead of them. I mean, Cruz? Ben Carson? Really?\u201dThe dual race is unusual, but not unheard-of.In 1960 in Texas, Lyndon B. Johnson was on the ballot for Senate and for vice president, and in Delaware in 2008, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., then a senator, ran for both offices. But Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, one of Mr. Paul\u2019s fellow freshmen, gave up his chance at re-election this year to seek the Republican nomination for president.\u201cHe believes in competition,\u201d said one person close to Mr. Paul, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he did not have authorization from the campaign to speak publicly. \u201cHe\u2019s willing to have them come in and compete, and if the party wants Rubio, so be it.\u201dFor Mr. Paul, arranging for the Kentucky Republican Party to stage its first presidential nominating caucus was no easy feat.Mr. Paul had to win over a skeptical Mitch McConnell, Kentucky\u2019s senior senator and the Republican leader, whose backing prompted party leaders and county chairmen to get on board \u2014 but only after Mr. McConnell extracted a promise from Mr. Paul to foot the caucus bill. (The state pays for the regular primary election in May.)So far, Paul aides say, his campaign has paid $250,000 to help county parties rent space, train and organize volunteers and have ballots printed. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty big chore, since we\u2019ve never done it before,\u201d said Mr. Skaggs, who is on the party\u2019s executive committee and opposed the move.\u201cTrump will come because of his ego, and Rand will come because he lives here,\u201d Mr. Skaggs said.Mr. Skaggs predicts that Mr. Paul will win the Kentucky caucuses, but he still backs another candidate: Jeb Bush.

The crisis quickly escalated with the ransacking of the Saudi Embassy in Tehran on Saturday and with the decision of Saudi Arabia and several of its allies to sever diplomatic ties with Iran.The newspaper, noting \u201ccenturies-old confrontation between Arabs and Persians,\u201d compared the clash of Iran and Saudi Arabia to that of Europe\u2019s great powers in the period leading up to the World War I. \u201cEuropeans think the dispute is serious but they think \u2014 and so does the White House \u2014 that Saudis don\u2019t want reconciliation with Iran, want to exclude Iran from all regional discussions and want to provoke Iran into an action that would then derail engagement with West,\u201d Dr. Nasr said. \u201cThis crisis was started by Saudi, and Riyadh was quick to use it to break ties, which means an end to any broad regional engagement like the Vienna talks.\u201dHe also expressed alarm that countries with mixed populations \u2014 Syria and Yemen, where civil wars are raging, and Bahrain, where a Shiite population is governed by a Sunni monarchy \u2014 could fall into even further chaos.For average Europeans, \u201cit\u2019s the executions themselves that are revolting to the general public.\u201d Policy makers, he said, were more focused on not losing the momentum of the European d\u00e9tente with Iran.\u201cIran has been, relatively, good in implementing the nuclear deal so far, and elections are coming next month,\u201d Mr. Xavier-Bender said. \u201cThe normalization of relations with Iran is almost going too well.

The Vermont senator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hourlong speech focused on the legacy of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and on how his presidency would continue Dr. King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legacy by fighting various forms of discrimination and inequality.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is absolutely imperative that we see his life not as a museum piece, something simply to be looked at, to be studied, to be appreciated, to be kept on a shelf,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said of Dr. King. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo truly honor the life of Dr. King, we must fight to carry out his radical and bold vision for America. And his vision was of a nation in which we not only end all forms of institutional racism, and bigotry, but a nation in which all of us, black, and white, and Latino, Asian-American, Native American, all of us, come to together to create a country which provides economic, social and environmental justice for all.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Sanders also spoke about other core issues of his campaign, including the need to break up big commercial banks, to reform campaign finance laws, to increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour, to invest in sustainable energy and to transform wealth distribution. He talked of recently released details about his plan to create a \u00e2\u0080\u009csingle-payer Medicare for all\u00e2\u0080\u009d health care system, and of his plans to use taxes on the rich to pay for progressive programs. And, riding the high of his debate performance, Mr. Sanders reminded the crowd that he is close to beating Mrs. Clinton in Iowa and New Hampshire.About 5,700 people were at the event at Boutwell Auditorium, and another 1,400 people outside watched it from an overflow area on large televisions.Earlier in the day, Mr. Sanders visited the 16th Street Baptist Church, where four black girls were killed in a bombing in 1963. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis was terrorism,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said during the tour.He also stopped by the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute, where he touched the bars of the Birmingham jail cell where Dr. King was held and viewed exhibits including segregated water fountains and a Ku Klux Klan robe.Before the event, people eager to get into the auditorium braved frigid weather and stood for more than an hour in a line that extended blocks and wrapped into a nearby parking lot. As the event\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start time neared, volunteers bellowed that the space was filling up fast and was standing room only.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe end of the line is all the way down,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a volunteer shouted to people who looked shocked at the turnout. One supporter sighed, dismayed by the wait. Another, however, cheerfully stared at the line and declared, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis gives me hope.\u00e2\u0080\u009dChris Echols, 41, drove about 90 miles from his home in Montgomery to see Mr. Sanders. As he stood in line, Mr. Echols said that until Sunday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debate he had been undecided about which Democratic candidate to support.Now, he plans to vote for Mr. Sanders. Mr. Echols also said that if Mrs. Clinton were to win the Democratic nomination and Mr. Sanders were to run as an independent, he would still vote for Mr. Sanders.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe biggest thing for me is health care,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Echols, an audio-visual technician, said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe finally laid out how he is going to pay for it, and he kind of stood his ground on a lot of issues. I think before now I looked at him like he was just a cranky old guy going on and on about the same things.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAs the event came to a close, Mr. Sanders said he would have to work hard to win Alabama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s March 1 primary. He added that those in the crowd had harder work to do in the Southern state to garner support than he had to do in Vermont. In the end, he left them with a direct message.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have got to go out to our white, working-class friends,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said to the mostly white crowd. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have got to go out to our brothers and sisters there and say stop voting against your own best interests.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "A Year Junk Bonds Lived Up to Their Name", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byInvestors chasing high yields have been battling high anxiety.Many of the woes of the junk-bond sector are a result of the steep dive in commodity prices.The North American shale rush was financed largely with junk bonds. According to MarketAxess, high-yield bonds issued by gas and oil companies grew to more than $250 billion last year from $95 billion in 2012. Yet with the price of oil 65 percent below its 2012 peak, many energy companies now find themselves in a cash-flow pinch. Energy companies that defaulted on debt in 2015 include SandRidge Energy, Halc\u00f3n Resources, Quicksilver Resources and Walter Energy.Plenty of others are in rough shape. For example, some bonds issued by Chesapeake Energy, a natural gas and oil exploration and production company, fell more than 70 percent in 2015.S&P Dow Jones Indices tracks \u201cdistressed\u201d high-yield corporate bonds. By its definition, a bond that yields at least 1,000 basis points (10 percentage points) more than a Treasury issue with a comparable maturity earns a spot in the distressed heap. About 15 percent of the $1.6 trillion high-yield United States bond market is distressed right now. Thirteen commodity-related industries account for nearly 40 percent of the distressed market, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices; the rest is spread among more than 85 industries.Unless a sharp rally in commodity prices provides relief for energy and mining companies, there is likely to be more bloodletting in the high-yield world. Moody\u2019s Investors Service expects the 3.4 percent default rate for domestic junk bonds at the end of last year to rise to 4.1 percent by late this year. The pain is expected to be highly concentrated: The default rate is expected to rise to near 7 percent for metals and mining issuers and more than 5 percent for bonds issued by oil and gas companies.Gershon Distenfeld, director of high yield at AllianceBernstein, points out that falling commodity prices are a boon for companies that use them \u2014 as well as for consumers, who drive about two-thirds of the domestic economy. Moreover, the broad sell-off in junk bonds over the last 18 months has made the high-yield bond market more compelling.That sell-off was painful, of course. An index of high-yield bonds that yielded 5 percent before commodities collapsed was at 8.75 percent at the end of 2015. If you owned junk during that climb, you felt the pain. That is because bond prices fall when yields rise, and a fund\u2019s total return is the sum of the yield plus the changes in the price of the bond. The negative returns of late reflect the fact that the income payouts were not enough to offset the decline in bond prices.But those past declines may help now. \u201cOdds are that high yield will do better going forward given where yields are now,\u201d Mr. Distenfeld said. He added that a \u201cpretty good guide\u201d for forward annualized returns over a four- or five-year rolling period was the yield at the beginning of the period. That is more than 8 percent now.Just do not expect anything resembling a smooth ride. The Fed has signaled its belief that a still-weak economy is at last strong enough to merit lifting interest rates off the zero level in place since the financial crisis. But with that less-than-robust backdrop, every bit of disappointing economic data could set off an outsize investor reaction. And if recession chatter picks up meaningfully, losses in high-yield bonds could be big. Case in point: The average junk fund lost more than 25 percent in 2008.One indication that the high-yield market is dicey comes from actively managed high-grade core bond funds, which typically have the freedom to invest 10 to 20 percent or so of their assets in high-yield issues. It makes sense to do so when they surmise they are getting a big enough yield payoff to compensate them for the risk. (Core index funds do not own junk bonds.)But these funds are holding back. According to Morningstar, the average actively managed core bond fund holds less than 10 percent of assets in issues rated below investment grade, and that includes investments in low-rated mortgage- and asset-backed securities. The two largest actively managed core bond funds, Pimco Total Return and Metropolitan West Total Return, have little to no exposure to high-yield corporate bonds.The third-largest active bond fund, DoubleLine Total Return, has never trafficked in high-yield corporate bonds (it does own lower-rated mortgage- and asset-backed issues), and the DoubleLine Core Fixed Income Fund has just 5.3 percent of its assets invested in high-yield corporate bonds and bank loans. \u201cJust because it is cheap doesn\u2019t mean it is a deal,\u201d said Bonnie Baha, head of DoubleLine\u2019s Global Developed Credit Group. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on slowing U.S. growth, slow global growth and the fact that the Fed can\u2019t justify raising rates based on fundamentals,\u201d Ms. Baha said.Given the evident risks, now is a time to play it as safe as possible within the junk world.That starts with the quality of the bonds a fund owns. The bond rating scale starts at AAA for the high-quality issues, and then continues to AA, A, BBB, BB, B, all the way to C and unrated. Any bond rated below BBB is considered high yield. Junk bonds rated BB and B are the most solid part of the high-yield market. Once you get into the C range, you\u2019re not trawling just among the riskiest companies, but among bond issues that are the hardest to trade in volatile times.Those trading difficulties are what brought down Third Avenue Focused Credit Fund, a high-yield portfolio that specialized in distressed debt, which it bought with the expectation that it would rebound in value, sooner or later. But nearly 90 percent of the portfolio was in issues rated CCC and lower. When investor redemption requests increased, the fund\u2019s managers decided to shutter it rather than be forced to promptly meet redemptions by selling bonds at fire-sale prices. Dan Gagnier, a spokesman for Third Avenue, said there was no timetable for how long it would take the fund to liquidate and make final payments to shareholders. With a loss of more than 40 percent since the middle of 2014, many shareholders are facing net losses.Sarah Bush, a bond fund analyst at Morningstar, said the emphasis on distressed issues made Third Avenue Focused Credit an extreme outlier, and she did not expect there to be similar implosions among other junk funds. \u201cMost junk funds focus on BB- and B-rated debt,\u201d she said, \u201cbut Third Ave. explicitly invested in much lower-quality issues from firms that were known to already be in trouble.\u201dIn fact, the average high-yield mutual fund has about 17 percent of its assets in bonds rated CCC or lower. That is about what the SPDR Barclays High Yield Bond E.T.F. holds. The iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond E.T.F. has about 10 percent invested below B.Anthony Valeri, fixed-income strategist at LPL Financial, said that index funds, which are required to track the market even when it includes very risky constituents, may be at a disadvantage when it comes to junk bonds now. \u201cWe recommend investors seek out actively managed high-yield mutual funds, where the manager can avoid the land mines,\u201d he said.The actively managed Vanguard High-Yield Corporate Fund recently had less than 6 percent invested in issues rated below B. Last year it lost 1.4 percent. That may not seem like anything to boast about, but passively managed competitors did worse: The SPDR E.T.F. lost more than 7 percent, and the iShares E.T.F. lost more than 5.5 percent.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Primer on the N.F.L. Relocating a Team to Los Angeles", "Date": "2016-01-10", "News": "Supported byThe N.F.L. has talked about returning to the Los Angeles area almost from the moment the Raiders and the Rams left after the 1995 season. All the talk may end when the 32 owners meet Tuesday and Wednesday in Houston, where they are expected to vote on proposals that would allow one or two teams to return to the nation\u2019s second-largest market. Here is a primer:The fact finding is largely done. The Chargers, the Raiders and the Rams have applied to relocate. The Rams said they would build a domed stadium in Inglewood, Calif., that could accommodate a second team, while the Chargers and the Raiders, if allowed, plan to build an outdoor stadium together in Carson. The cities of Oakland, St. Louis and San Diego have told the N.F.L. how they intend to help their teams stay at home.The three teams play in some of the oldest stadiums in the league and they claim that they do not generate enough money to keep franchises competitive. While the teams are in the bottom half of the league when ranked by value, they are all profitable thanks to ample television revenue. Still, they say their host cities have been unwilling to help them build newer stadiums.The Chargers said they wanted to stay in San Diego, but when the Rams announced plans to move to Inglewood, they felt compelled to protect their turf in Southern California.The owners have been guided by the committee on Los Angeles Opportunities comprising the owners of the Chiefs, the Giants, the Panthers, the Patriots, the Steelers and the Texans. The committee is expected to make a recommendation to the full owners before or during the two-day meeting.The stadium and finance committees have also vetted the proposals and helped set parameters for the ultimate vote, which requires that at least 24 owners approve any proposal to move.The N.F.L.\u2019s relocation guidelines outline how and when teams can move. Among other things, teams and cities must negotiate in good faith to find an appropriate stadium for the team. The Chargers, the Raiders and the Rams claim they have been stymied in their efforts to get a new stadium, something civic leaders in Oakland, St. Louis and San Diego dispute.In St. Louis, a group led by Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon has proposed building a $1.1 billion stadium, 40 percent of which would be paid for with public money. The Rams\u2019 owner, E. Stanley Kroenke, dismissed the proposal, saying that the stadium would lead to \u201cfinancial ruin\u201d for any team that moved in.The owners must approve the criteria of their final vote first. For instance, they must approve the fee that a team or teams would pay to relocate to a much larger market. The fee is expected to be $650 million paid over 15 or 20 years.They also must decide on whether they are voting for teams or stadium proposals. This is important because the owners have many supporters and detractors. The Chargers\u2019 owner, Dean Spanos, is considered the most popular of the three, while some owners do not feel inclined to help Mark Davis, the owner of the Raiders, because they still resent his father, Al Davis, who was often at odds with the league when he owned the team before his death in 2011. Kroenke has a few powerful allies, including Jerry Jones, the owner of the Dallas Cowboys.There are two proposals on the table: The Rams move to Inglewood, and the Chargers and Raiders to Carson. But alternatives include, among others, the Chargers moving to Carson alone; the Chargers teaming up with the Rams in Inglewood or Carson; the Raiders moving to Inglewood with the Rams and the Chargers remaining in San Diego.At present, neither proposal on the table has 24 votes, though the Carson alternative is much closer. One or more of the alternatives could be added to the slate to reach a solution.Advertisement"}

The group also pointed to falling university enrollments in other major English-language markets, including Britain and South Africa.\u201cOur competitive performance during the last three years has been strong, but the cyclical and policy-related challenges in our biggest markets have been more pronounced and persisted for longer than anticipated,\u201d said John Fallon, Pearson\u2019s chief executive.\u201cFaced with these challenges, we are today announcing decisive plans to further integrate the business and reduce the cost base, rationalize our product development and focus on fewer, bigger opportunities,\u201d he said.Pearson said it expected to absorb around 320 million pounds, or about $450 million, this year in costs linked to the reorganization, which will include combining its education and professional testing activities in North America, as well as efforts to consolidate some back-office activities like finance, human resources and information technology. Such measures are expected to generate savings of about \u00a3350 million by 2017, the company said.Pearson said it expected the job cuts, which represent roughly 10 percent of its global work force, to be fully put in place by the end of this year.The group also lowered its forecast for 2015 operating profit to about \u00a3720 million, or 69 pence to 70 pence a share, from a forecast late last year of 70 pence to 75 pence a share.

{"Headline": "Aboriginal Brass Band Offers Burst of Hope in a Bleak Community", "Date": "2016-01-24", "News": "Supported byYarrabah JournalYARRABAH, Australia \u2014 This remote stretch of coastline in north Queensland has much to offer: pristine beaches dotted with mango and palm trees, tropical breezes, an azure ocean.But the lush surroundings belie a troubled history. Yarrabah was settled as an Anglican mission in the 1890s, and Aboriginal and some South Sea island natives were forcibly relocated here from their traditional lands. Under mission rule, they toiled in agriculture, working on sugar and coffee plantations, for meager rations.Children were separated from their parents and sent to church-run dormitories, their native languages banned and their freedom of movement curtailed and the Aboriginal community still struggles with this grim history. There is, however, one aspect of the mission days that many older residents here remember fondly: the Yarrabah Brass Band. Established in 1901 to accompany hymns, it was one of eight indigenous brass bands in Queensland (brass, unlike string instruments, can survive humidity and heat). When the mission closed in the 1960s, the Yarrabah band also fizzled out.Now, after nearly a half-century of silence, the band is making music. In an era when brass bands have fallen from favor in their mother country, Britain, the tradition has come to life here in the past few years. And in its own modest way, the band is helping to heal deep racial wounds.Greg Fourmile, who plays the euphonium, is credited with reviving the tradition in 2012. He agreed that there was a sense of \u201cownership, and it\u2019s a shared thing because music is universal.\u201dOn a recent hot afternoon, the band rehearsed as children scampered under palm trees. People lounged on wide porches, fanning themselves. Among the players was Paul Neal, a burly, bearded youth counselor who said he once had \u201ctrouble clapping, let alone playing an instrument.\u201d Undeterred, Mr. Neal, 31, pitched up at the band tryouts, chose the tenor saxophone (one of 15 donated instruments) and learned his somewhat rough scales in six weeks.All 13 of the band members are indigenous, with the exception of Tracey Radford, the conductor, who is white, and Lee Rogers, an African-American who plays the alto saxophone and is known as \u201cthe Texan.\u201d Mr. Rogers, who served in the United States Navy, moved to Yarrabah in 1994 and married a local woman.With its amateur cast of players that includes schoolchildren and grandmothers, the Yarrabah Brass Band does not always hit the right notes, and its rehearsals can be faintly raucous.But a polished performance is only one aim. More important, Mr. Fourmile said, is a hope that the band can act as an ambassador to bring the community together and show the outside world another side of Yarrabah.\u201cWe\u2019ve been on the map for all the bad reasons,\u201d said Errol Neal, who is the mayor of Yarrabah and is Paul\u2019s uncle. Residents still have \u201cpost-traumatic stress,\u201d he said, \u201cas a result of being taken away, forcibly removed.\u201dThe band is \u201ca big part of how we move forward,\u201d he added.Though it is just an hour\u2019s drive down a winding road from Cairns, Australia\u2019s gateway to the Great Barrier Reef, Yarrabah has not benefited from a similar boom. Yarrabah, which is wedged between mountainous rain forest and the Coral Sea, first got electricity in the 1960s, followed by its first bitumen road, residents say. During the 1970s and \u201980s, a permit was required to visit. The white man, locals often joke, is akin to Migaloo, an albino humpback whale, because it is rare to see either in Yarrabah.The area\u2019s isolation contributes to the widespread poverty here. According to Mr. Neal, the unemployment rate in Yarrabah is 80 percent, with younger people the most affected. About 4,500 residents inhabit just over 400 houses; others live in makeshift bush shacks. Parts of town have a gritty, desperate feel.To help counter those problems, Mr. Neal hopes to transform the coastal shire into a tourist destination: He has proposed a $250 million eco-tourism village and an $80 million cruise ship terminal. Yarrabah has received $7 million in government funding for a ferry jetty connecting it to Cairns.\u201cWe have to get off the welfare \u2014 give our people a sense of hope,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be filling in rehabilitation centers, or correction centers, or being hooked up in dialysis, or going to the graveyard.\u201dWho will come is another question.Many remain at best apathetic, and at worse hostile, toward their Aboriginal neighbors. Some assume you still need a permit to visit; for others there is a perception that if your car got stolen, \u201cyou\u2019d be able to find it\u201d here, said Ms. Radford, the conductor.Mr. Fourmile, whose wife is white, said the band was an instrument to combat racism. \u201cTo make people realize this is not a scary place where all the black fellas hang out,\u201d he said. \u201cYarrabah is not Alcatraz \u2014 it is a community.\u201d\u201cOne way to break down barriers is to educate people \u2014 and what better way than to have an event based on music, because everyone understands music,\u201d he added. \u201cTo show people that we are just like everyone else.\u201dIn the 1990s, Yarrabah had a high suicide rate, said Mr. Neal, the saxophone player, who specializes in self-harm prevention. \u201cThe youths that graduate here don\u2019t have a job to come back to,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have trouble getting out of the community, let alone the state. Empowerment is low, self-esteem is low.\u201dThe irony of gaining empowerment by returning to a culture introduced by British colonialists is not lost on the band\u2019s members. Paul\u2019s mother, Teresa Neal, a flute player, said the difference was that while band members were forced to play during the mission days, \u201cnow we\u2019re freely picking up the instruments ourselves.\u201dDuring the mission, being a member of the band provided a rare route to escape the shire. The band members, wearing black caps and crisp cream shirts, toured Queensland.At the festival in November, Mr. Morrison played with Robert Patterson, a respected elder known as Uncle Bobby, and Yarrabah Brass Band member.\u201cThe kids were mucking around and there was this great atmosphere \u2014 and Uncle Bobby stood there for a minute,\u201d Mr. Morrison said of the crowd, where white and Aboriginal swayed together. \u201cThen he looked at me and said: \u2018That\u2019s reconciliation.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAdvertisement"}

Thank you for being here.\u201cWell it is my pleasure to call the 239th Legislature to order. In our five years we have accomplished much. After many, many bad years for the state we love, the arrows are finally pointed in the right direction.\u201cGovernment, as you know, is ultimately about results and you delivered. You made this state a better state. And what\u2019s what government is all about, and congratulations to each and every one of you.\u201cBut with all that we\u2019ve done, we are not immune to the problems vexing our nation. Crumbling infrastructure, a slow economic recovery, the unambiguous reality that climate change threatens the very way of life, a growing specter of terrorism, homelessness, an ever widening gap between the wealthy and everyone else, political polarization and government gridlock. All challenged issues to be sure.\u201cBut thanks to the people in this room we have a government that is built to lead. These problems may have confounded other states and the federal government, but I know New York must and can address them.\u201cThe state of the state, my friends, is strong. Today I am proud to report to the 239th Legislature that we stand stronger than at any point in recent history. The Empire State is poised to grow and to lead.\u201cWhile our challenges are daunting because of what this body has accomplished in the past, it should give all of us great hope for the future.\u201cAs President Clinton liked to say, \u2018We brought arithmetic to our government.\u2019 We limited the state\u2019s new spending to less than 2 percent a year. We passed a 2 percent property tax cap that has brought welcome relief to the citizens of our state and we have cut income, corporate and estate taxes. In total, we have reduced the tax burden on New Yorkers by $114 billion dollars.\u201cWhy is that important? Because reducing taxes is part of our strategy to create jobs, and when you\u2019re creating jobs, you\u2019re creating opportunity and you\u2019re creating hope and you\u2019re creating progress and it is working here in New York. Unemployment is down from 8 percent to 4.8 percent, and today New York State has more private sector jobs than ever before in the history of the state of New York \u2014 7.9 million. From Montauk to Niagara Falls, the New York economy is on the rebound.\u201cOur economic success was matched with an uncommon partner, namely unprecedented social progress. In the past, our government offered a Sophie\u2019s choice: it embraced either fiscal responsibility or social progress \u2014 one or the other. We said we could do both. We said we could bring fiscal responsibility to the state and we could also be the nation\u2019s progressive leader: a beacon for social justice and fairness.\u201cAnd we did it. And we were right to do it. And we were right when we showed this nation true leadership and passed marriage equality; and we were right when we stood up for the women of this state and we passed the Women\u2019s Equality Act; and we were right when we passed the most aggressive law stopping sexual violence on college campuses in the nation; and we were right when we stopped fingerprinting for food; and we were right when we led the way on climate change; and we were right when we stopped discrimination based on sexual identity; and we were right when we passed common-sense gun safety laws. New York now has the smartest gun laws in the nation. And remember this, since Sandy Hook, when we passed our gun control law, we have had fewer gun deaths in the state of New York thanks to your good work.\u201cThat is leadership.\u201cFiscally responsible Democrats, people said, were impossible. Socially progressive Republicans, people said, were impossible. These legislators acted responsibly and we reached compromise and we showed that that can happen. And we didn\u2019t listen to the zealots and we didn\u2019t listen to the extremists and we didn\u2019t list to the naysayers. We governed, we came together, we refused to be intimidated, we refused to be shouted down. We said we are New Yorkers first and we are coming to come together and we are going to kick the extremists to the side and we are taking this state forward on what\u2019s good for the state of New York, and just because you yell, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re right. And just because you stand, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re correct. That\u2019s what this Legislature is all about.\u201cNow, going forward, we must continue our laser focus on reinvigorating the state\u2019s economy, because that is the engine that pulls the train, and remember, my friends, when you are helping the economy you are helping everyone because the best social program is still a job.\u201cWe charted a new path and it is working. New York is on the move, and we have just begun. Building forward starts with maintaining our fiscal discipline.\u201cI will submit a $145 billion budget that spends an additional 1.7 percent \u2014 less than our 2 percent spending limit.\u201cTo stimulate economic growth I propose a tax cut for small businesses because that is the engine that is driving the economy. Ninety-seven percent of all businesses in New York employ fewer than 100 people \u2014 that\u2019s 3.4 million employees working in small businesses. I propose a $300 million tax cut that will reduce the rate from 6.5 to 4 percent, plus a 15 percent income exemption for partnerships and S-corporations. That\u2019s a tax reduction for one million small companies and another clear signal that New York is open for business.\u201cAt the same time, we will continue to reduce the mandates and their cost to the locality. The largest mandate is the Medicaid program. Three years ago we capped the increase in cost to the locality. Localities are now held harmless. Since then, the state has assumed approximately $3 billion in costs from the counties. I believe the state should continue to cap the growth and assume the cost as long as the local government adheres to our 2 percent cap.\u201cRemember, my friends, the property tax is the killer tax in this state, and it has been for a long time. It\u2019s nothing new. Listen to what F.D.R. said, and I quote, \u2018The public is at last coming to realize that the increase in real estate taxes is due wholly to the increase in the cost of local and not state government. These taxes on real estate are too high.\u2026 Local government has in most communities been guilty of great waste and duplication.\u201cThe cost, the waste, the inefficiency of our 10,500 local governments is still this state\u2019s financial albatross, and that is what is driving up the cost. Consolidation, shared services, local efficiencies must be a top priority and we must encourage those choices by framing the true economic realities for local governments. Local governments must be sustainable from a financial point of view. That is the clear economic truth and that is what we have to work towards.\u201cControlling spending and reducing taxes will continue our growth but we can do even more. Our state\u2019s founding fathers\u2019 and founding mothers\u2019 early vision and daring was really breathtaking. Their boldness in constructing our transportation and infrastructure made this state the success it is today.\u201cThe tallest buildings, the longest bridges, the deepest tunnels \u2014 they never said quit. Now it\u2019s our turn, my friends. We must provide the vision and the daring for the next generation. To continue to grow in size and strength, we must develop a new interconnected, planned system of mass transportation, roads and bridges and airports for the next 100 years. We can and we will.\u201cI propose the New York: Built to Lead program. It is a development initiative that would make Governor Rockefeller jealous. A $100 billion investment in transformative projects statewide.\u201cAll experts are unanimous that investment today in the infrastructure of tomorrow creates jobs and builds economic strength. In Washington, both sides agree. However, like so many issues, Washington just can\u2019t get it done. In New York, we can and we will.\u201cOur new Tappan Zee Bridge is an exciting symbol of what we can accomplish. A bridge that other administrations couldn\u2019t even begin is now moving forward. It\u2019s rising from the Hudson like our aspiration is rising for this state.\u201cLet\u2019s take a moment and recognize some of the daring men and women who are working on the Tappan Zee Bridge in the winter, when it\u2019s cold, under dangerous circumstances and are doing a great job. They\u2019re here today. We\u2019ll ask them to stand and show them our appreciation.\u201cThe New York Built to Lead program will begin by ensuring New York remains an international destination at the cutting edge of air travel.\u201cDownstate New York we will build a new airport to replace the outdated La Guardia. Not rebuilding what was, but building a whole new state-of-the-art airport. It will be the first new airport in the United States in over 20 years and New York will lead the way again.\u201cThis year we will also present a new vision for the current maze of terminals at Kennedy Airport and we will also continue our development of Republic and Stewart Airports.\u201cI also propose $6 million in this budget to build a customs center to make MacArthur Airport on Long Island a real international hub once and for all. This will reduce the air demands on La Guardia and Kennedy and increase economic activity on Long Island.\u201cBut mass transportation is the key if our region is to grow in size and strength. If our regions are going to grow, it must be through mass transit. We must move more commuters faster with less damage to the environment. A record $26 billion investment in the M.T.A., buying 1,400 new subway cars and 3,100 new buses, will reinvent the commuting experience. Likewise, $5.6 billion invested in the L.I.R.R., and $3 billion invested in Metro-North will improve the system\u2019s comfort, safety and reliability.\u201cOur $20 billion Gateway Partnership \u2014 a project long overdue \u2014 is now a reality \u2014 it is a coordinated effort among the federal government, New Jersey and New York. It will build a new rail tunnel \u2014 the first in one hundred years \u2014 and it will speed commuters from the west.\u201cFrom the east, the commute from Long Island to New York City is one of the worst commutes in the nation. We need to add a third track to the Long Island rail system so we can expedite commuters and promote intra-island transit.\u201cThe main mass transportation access point in New York City is Penn Station. Penn Station is grossly over capacity and underperforming.\u201cPenn is, in a word: miserable. Amtrak owns it. It is un-New York, it is unwelcoming and it is unacceptable.\u201cIf Vice President Biden was critical of La Guardia Airport, we\u2019re only lucky he didn\u2019t take a train and end at Penn. I can only imagine what he would have said. But we won\u2019t give him the chance. We will build a new Penn Moynihan complex, finally.\u201cNew York State did a great thing in 1986 when it opened the Jacob Javits Convention Center which attracted thousands and thousands transcripts on New York. But it is no longer competitive for many of the big shows. It\u2019s too small and its configuration is not conducive to the exhibitions of today. We will add one million square feet to the convention center and remove thousands of trucks and their diesel fumes that currently line up along Manhattan\u2019s West Side. It\u2019s going to be a boon to the economy, a benefit to the environment and it\u2019s going to be self-financed by the Javits Center. That\u2019s what I call a win-win-win.\u201cNow, upstate New York must remain an economic priority. The cold truth is that this state government shortchanged upstate New York for many years. And that was short sighted. Not only are we one New York family, but we are one New York balance sheet and upstate growth means a stronger economy for all. I propose a record $20 billion economic development program to grow the momentum in upstate New York.\u201cOne of the heavy costs for upstate businesses and citizens are the tolls that we impose on the New York State Thruway. Now as you know, the New York State Thruway was paid off in 1996, but the tolls have continued. I propose we set aside $1 billion of our settlement funds as a reserve fund to maintain and improve the Thruway system. It will also allow us to freeze tolls for all users until 2020. We can also cut tolls by half for all frequent users, and \u2014 listen to this \u2014 eliminate all tolls for our agriculture sector which has been struggling for many, many years.\u201cThis will show upstate businesses and citizens that we are on their side. We owe it to them. Let\u2019s do it and let\u2019s do it this year.\u201cUpstate\u2019s roads and bridges, broadband and other infrastructure must be upgraded also. I propose the largest roads and bridges investment in history \u2014 a $22 billion, five-year investment \u2013 achieving parity with downstate.\u201cI also propose $250 million necessary to assist local governments in rebuilding their water and sewer infrastructure. It\u2019s not fancy but it\u2019s necessary.\u201cThe Regional Councils are producing dividends. Today there are more than 4,000 economic development projects underway thanks to their work. I propose another round of R.E.D.C.s \u2014 our sixth \u2014 for $750 million, to keep the momentum going. Our R.E.D.C. partnerships have created or retained 165,000 jobs. Let\u2019s give them a round of applause.\u201cThe I Love New York tourism campaigns have been a phenomenal success. We have invested $181 million in tourism over the past five years. That $181 million has seen tourism spending increase $8.5 billion and the total impact is now over $100 billion in tourism. I want to add another 10 percent to that budget for a total of $50.5 million because what we\u2019ve learned is that when people see upstate New York they love upstate New York. So we just have to keep them coming and the I Love New York campaign is a way to do that.\u201cThis year we will continue our part by holding the Adirondack Challenge and we will add the Catskill Challenge to which you are all invited. I hope you all can make it.\u201cLeader Flanagan appears physically fit and is legendary for being fast on his feet \u2014 I mean running. But we don\u2019t yet know how he can handle the rough waters \u2014 I mean rafting. We will soon find out because I\u2019m sure the Leader is going to come to both the Adirondack and the Catskill Challenge.\u201cSpeaker Heastie grew up near a river so he is the odds on favorite to win. I understand the speaker is wagering two to one odds on his victory. That\u2019s Assembly confidence, for you. For those of you who wonder what river did the speaker grow up near, of course, it\u2019s the legendary Bronx River.\u201cOur paradigm of entrepreneurial government is the way of the future. The regions of this nation that excel will be the most functional, creative public private-sector partnerships and New York is already leading the way.\u201cWe began in 2011 with our partnership to stimulate dairy production through our Greek yogurt industry expansion and it has worked. We now produce more Greek yogurt than Greece, believe it or not. And our dairy industry is booming because the yogurt companies are consuming all of the milk we\u2019re producing. It has been a great victory and an important lesson, and besides having some cows suffering from sore udders, it has been a great, great success.\u201cWe can also toast our wine and beer initiatives. The number of wineries has increased four fold, breweries have increased sixfold and distilleries and cideries sevenfold. We have made it easier for these businesses to grow and do business by revising some of our laws. But we have to do even more. We have to overhaul the Prohibition-era S.L.A. laws that are way overdue and are an obstacle to growth and we have to do it this year.\u201cThis year I propose our most ambitious entrepreneurial partnerships that we are excited about.\u201cThe first deals with agriculture and food. As you know, agriculture is a critical part of our economy. As you also know, there is a growing health concern among consumers about the food we eat \u2014 what is in it and how it was grown. There is a burgeoning market for safe, healthy food. However, consumer confidence is lacking. Many of the labels that are on those products are virtually meaningless and they have no standard and they have no legal definition. Labels like \u2018all natural\u2019 or \u2018no antibiotics\u2019 actually have no legal definition. Much of our quote-unquote organic produce comes from overseas. So consumer skepticism is justified. To reassure and inform consumers, and provide an opportunity for New York farms, we will initiate the first program to certify the bona fides of natural products.\u201cThe Departments of Health and Agriculture will define what are now vague standards and conduct inspections to certify those standards are being met. Labels like \u2018all natural\u2019 will mean something. \u2018No pesticides\u2019 will mean something. \u2018Hormone free\u2019 will actually mean something. The attorney general will police the program so consumers will know when they buy that product, they are getting exactly what that product says it is.\u201cWe are going to call it the NY Certified High Quality program. It will be voluntary for our farmers to participate but we will advertise this program and its products nationwide, and we think there is a significant marketing asset for the farms that participate. It\u2019s an exciting opportunity. It can help grow our farms. Better products for our consumers. It\u2019s exactly what we need. Let\u2019s take a moment and say thanks to Commissioner Ball, Dr. Zucker and Attorney General Schneiderman.\u201cSecond partnership, the problem of climate change is finally being recognized by most world leaders, anyway. Here in New York we have already been actively working to address it. Now, New York State has a business and an environmental opportunity. Let\u2019s become the international capital for clean and green energy products. We have already attracted some of the largest solar manufacturers on the planet to New York State. We\u2019ve already attracted some of the biggest research and development firms on the planet to New York. I now propose a $15 million Clean Energy Opportunity Training Program so SUNY and our community colleges can train the workers with solar technology and installation.\u201cI believe this is the economy of tomorrow and while we\u2019re developing the business plan, we can also employ it in the state of New York. I propose installing solar in over 150,000 homes and businesses and converting SUNY facilities to renewable energy by the year 2020. We can do it and we should.\u201cMy friends, this is the path for the future to ensure that the planet has a future \u2014 let New York lead the way once again on this important topic.\u201cWe all realize that all of these new economic opportunities demand a world-class education. More and more, education is everything if you\u2019re going to get ahead and do well in this economy. I believe in the promise of education and its potential to serve as the doorway to opportunity. For generations of New Yorkers, education has been the ladder to climb out of poverty. Today, the need for that ladder is greater than it has ever been.\u201cTo open the door of opportunity even wider, and provide the highest quality public education, my budget invests $6.9 billion in SUNY and CUNY. I also propose extending our highly successful SUNY and CUNY 2020 rational tuition and challenge grant program. Our goal is to make our public higher education system the envy of the country. I know we can. With Carl McCall and Chancellor Zimpher, that is exactly what we are going to do and we thank them for their leadership.\u201cLikewise, we will not rest until our K-12 system is the best in the nation. Last year we made dramatic changes. We reduced testing, we increased parental participation and empowered local districts. These reforms were essential because we saw that parents were losing faith in the system. Roughly 20 percent of our students opted out of exams and in some districts it as high as 90 percent opted out. Simply put, the education system fails without parental trust. Our goal was to restore that trust and we said we would correct the State Education Department\u2019s Common Core curriculum implementation mistakes and testing regimen. Time has shown that this was the right decision. We urge the State Education Department to do it right this time and we are all fully available to assist in and monitor in this effort.\u201cIt is also essential that our school districts have the necessary funds to do the job. I propose for this two-year cycle, $2.1 billion increase to $25 billion, the highest total spending on education in the history of the state of New York. With that funding increase I want to do two things:\u201cFirst, once and for all, let\u2019s end the Gap Elimination Adjustment. Second, let\u2019s transform every failing school in the state of New York into a community school.\u201cOur charter schools are public schools and serve some of our neediest students \u2014 more than 100,000 of them all across the state. Charters are an important option for parents in communities with failing schools and provide education laboratories. On average, charters are half the cost of public schools. They are an important component of our system and we continue to encourage their development in this budget.\u201cWe are also working to attract and keep the best public schoolteachers, many of whom work very hard under very difficult circumstances. Many teachers even go into their own pocket to pay for food and supplies for the students in their classroom. What a beautiful sign of dedication. But they shouldn\u2019t have to bear that cost. They deserve our encouragement, support and gratitude. I propose a $200 tax credit to reimburse teachers for their expenses. They more than deserve it.\u201cProtecting our environment is a top priority. The Native American proverb is true: \u2018We don\u2019t inherit the land from our parents. We are borrowing it from our children.\u2019 One of the most effective programs to make our state cleaner and greener is the Environmental Protection Fund. I propose raising the Environmental Protection Fund to the highest level in history \u2014 $300 million.\u201cWe previously set a goal that 50 percent of New York\u2019s energy must come from renewables by 2030. This year it\u2019s no longer a goal \u2014 it is now a requirement. And it makes New York the nation\u2019s leader in the fight against climate change and that\u2019s something we should all be proud of.\u201cFinally, we will eliminate all use of coal in New York State by 2020. We will help the few remaining coal plants transition but we must clean our air and protect our health and that must be our first priority.\u201cWhen it comes to public safety, we have much work to do. In addition to what is now called extreme weather and the new normal, I\u2019m sad to say that in many ways we have another new normal to confront and that is the widening threat of terrorism. San Bernardino, Calif., Rochester, N.Y. It can be Anywhere, U.S.A., at anytime. The Internet has opened a portal of hate. What was at one time largely confined to the Middle East can arrive here now with the click of a mouse. We must be diligent.\u201cI propose $40 million to fund the permanent deployment of more New York state troopers and National Guard at key target areas across the state because public safety must be our priority.\u201cThe State Police and the National Guard do an excellent job. They are out there when no one wants to be out there. They ae there when we have to rebuild after floods. They are there to keep us safe. We are blessed to have them. I ask them to stand and let\u2019s give them a sign of our appreciation.\u201cLast year I asked former N.Y.P.D. Commissioner Ray Kelly to do a security audit and tell us the best way to defend ourselves and the state\u2019s counterterrorism operations. Commissioner Ray Kelly recommends moving the state\u2019s counterterrorism operations to the New York State Police to improve intelligence sharing and reduce response time. I believe that recommendation makes sense. I\u2019m going to recommend it in this budget and I want to thank Ray Kelly very much for his service.Terrorist attacks no longer mean just airplanes and buildings. More and more, attacks include heavily armed individuals, active shooters in shopping malls, and even churches.\u201cTo ensure that our State Police have the right equipment to respond to these situations I propose $4 million to provide every on-duty uniformed state trooper with better weapons, body armor and tactical helmets. They give their all for us. They deserve our support. Let\u2019s give them the tools they need. Please rise while we take a moment to acknowledge you.\u201cWe are also joined today by New York state troopers who conducted an around-the-clock search for the escapees of Dannemora. It was a truly difficult feat in difficult terrain that went on day after day, week after week. The climax of the event was a truly heroic event, where a single trooper confronted one of the escapes and it was just that trooper, and that escapee, a stone\u2019s throw from the Canada-state border. The New York state trooper stepped up in the finest tradition of the New York State Police. His name is Sergeant Jay Cook and he is here today. We ask him to rise, and let\u2019s give him a round of applause.\u201cWashington, D.C., still can\u2019t agree on the use of intelligence information concerning terrorists when it comes to gun background checks. This gridlock is not funny and it literally endangers our safety. I believe it is reckless and irresponsible not to share information about possible terrorists who are living or operating within our borders. New Yorkers are concerned and rightfully so. New York has had a history of being a target of terrorist attacks. Don\u2019t tie one hand behind our back. Give us the access to the information because we have a right to defend ourselves.\u201cThis state\u2019s role as the progressive capital of the nation is important to me and should be important to every person in this room. Government\u2019s ability to evolve and grow is essential. Everything is changing \u2014 faster than ever before \u2014 government must progress to stay relevant, not to mention lead.\u201cHubert Humphry said, and I quote, \u2018The moral test of government is how that government treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are in the shadows of life, the sick, the needy and the disabled.\u2019\u201cThis state was one of the first in the nation to start universal pre-K in 1966, believe it or not. Over 60 percent of our communities now participate. We must work to bring that number to 100 percent in our communities. In 2013, this Legislature took the next step by expanding to full day pre-K, offering to local governments across the state including New York City. I propose $800 million in total funding so we can once again partner with our local communities and once again pay 100 percent of the cost because our children deserve the best.\u201cNew York\u2019s economy is growing to be sure. But we must also ensure that the bright sunlight of economic opportunity reaches those who have been left too long in the shadows. We already have the highest M.W.B.E. goal in the nation \u2014 30 percent \u2014 which is about $2 billion in economic opportunity for minority and women-owned businesses across the state. But our current goal only applies to our direct state contracts, not local government contracts. Compounding the omission is the fact that many local governments do not even have their own M.W.B.E. require or if they do, their goal is anemic at best. This must end now. I propose that our M.W.B.E. goals also apply to local government contracts funded by state dollars. This could triple our New York opportunity for minority- and women-owned business and it will lead the nation once again.\u201cFor all of our economic success there are still pockets of poverty that persist. The greatest feast has the most guests at the table. Our Rochester Anti-Poverty Initiative shows great promise. Deputy Leader Joe Morelle has been doing a great job and I would like to recognize him for his service. I am proposing $25 million to expand that initiative to the 10 cities in upstate New York with the highest poverty rate. Let us commit ourselves to the principle that in our great state no child should have to worry about where his or her next meal is coming from. No child should live in poverty.\u201cI was proud last year to appoint the attorney general as a special prosecutor in cases where a police officer kills an unarmed civilian. It was a national precedent. The appointment of an unbiased, qualified individual has helped restore trust in our system and it literally helped to end demonstrations in our streets. I urge you to pass a law making this reform permanent. Assemblyman Keith Wright has advocated for such a law for over a decade. It is an historic achievement and it should not be left to my executive order. Make it yours \u2014 make it permanent pass the bill. Let\u2019s all give the attorney general a round of applause for his great work.\u201cOne of our nation\u2019s greatest challenges is stopping the cycle of incarceration. This nation incarcerates more people than any industrialized nation on the globe. Over 2.2 million people are in prison in this country. We are better at building and equipping a prison cell than a classroom. We are quicker to find a 16-year-old a jail cell than a job interview and that is just wrong.\u201cNew York State is going the other way. I am proud to be the governor who has closed more prisons than any governor in the state of New York. We have the most aggressive re-entry program in the country. We have a new conditional pardon program for youthful offenders. We are working to end warehousing in prisons and moving towards educating and rehabilitating as an operating mantra for our corrections system.\u201cWe all agree that public safety is paramount. But we can also all agree that it is madness to spend over $50,000 a year for a prison cell while ignoring the wisdom of early intervention.\u201cAnd it starts from the very beginning. It starts from the classroom and let\u2019s finally recognize the past flaw in our approach to education in poor districts. Schools in poor communities not only face an educational challenge, they face many, many other burdens that other schools and other communities don\u2019t face. They face the issue of poverty. They face the issue of one-parent households. They face the issue of after-school problems, nutrition issues, crime issues, violence issues. Let\u2019s invest in the right help early on so we are not paying for problems later on.\u201cLet\u2019s make a big change. Let\u2019s make a big difference for thousands of children. Let\u2019s help thousands of children. Let\u2019s do it this year. Let\u2019s dedicate $100 million to transform every failing school in New York into a comprehensive, holistic, full-service community school and change the basic education system in this state and stop the cycle of incarceration in this state and paying for problems, rather than stopping the problems at an early age.\u201cWe must also provide an alternative to the street corner. Young minority males have an unemployment rate of over 40 percent. They need hope and opportunity, they need a light at the end of the tunnel. We pioneered a new approach that has been working for a few a years, providing job vouchers for private sector employers that provide a job and job training. It\u2019s working. Just go to the Bronx and talk to Borough President Diaz, and you can feel on the street where the unemployment rate has come down and young people have jobs and have hopes and crime is down. Let\u2019s build on that and let\u2019s invest another $55 million to provide opportunities to another 10,000 young men and women and keep them on the right course.\u201cAnd we must go further on our social, racial and economic justice agenda.\u201cEconomic anxiety for working families hangs in the air like a thick, stifling fog. This month 560,000 families live in poverty and millions of low-wage workers in this state are forced to choose between paying rent and buying food for their families.\u201cThere is an unhealthy income inequality gap that is only growing.\u201cI say lift up the poor and the working families of this state and pay a real decent wage that honors F.D.R.\u2019s original intent and promise. We can raise the minimum wage to $15 and we can show this nation what real economic justice means\u201cNow, my $15 proposal is reasonable. And it is phased in over an amount of time to allow our economy to grow and to adjust to expand the number of people participating in that success. It\u2019s only fair and it\u2019s only right \u2014 listen to this \u2014 if the minimum wage in the 70s, had been indexed to the rate of inflation you know where it would be? My proposal today at $15 an hour. What that means is that the minimum wage since the 70s has not kept pace. What that means is you\u2019ve had 45 years of economic injustice where the poor were getting poorer, while everyone else was moving up. That\u2019s not America\u2019s way because that\u2019s not fair.\u201cSome argue against this proposal. They say its government interference in the private sector economy, government interference in the private sector economy. That argument is the height of hypocrisy. Listen to this. Companies that pay the minimum wage, like a McDonald\u2019s, have full time workers who are still below the poverty level and since they are below the poverty level they still qualify for welfare and food stamps. That costs taxpayers, on average, $6,800 per worker. So McDonald\u2019s is paying $18,000 and we are paying $6,800 to subsidize that worker. It is a subsidy for McDonald\u2019s. It subsidizes their payroll by 40 percent. It is corporate welfare at its worst. I have not heard the opponents stand up and say \u2018stop the McDonalds subsidy, stop the Burger King subsidy, stop the small business subsidy!\u2019 In New York State, we spend $700 million a year subsidizing workers just to McDonald\u2019s and Burger King. $700 million a year. Explain that to your constituents. I say it\u2019s time to get out of the hamburger business, pay people a decent wage, raise it to $15, join me in the fight. It\u2019s what this state needs. We can get it done. We won\u2019t stop until we get it done. Let them defend McDonald\u2019s and the corporate subsidies to the big corporations with your money.\u201cWe also, my friends, have a true human crisis that is a litmus test for society\u2019s compassion and government\u2019s competence. There has been a recent explosion in the number of homeless people living on our streets. It is a human tragedy.\u201cNow, to me this is personal. I spent my life \u2014 starting in my 20s \u2014 working to help the homeless. Literally building shelters and running them. And it touches me deeply and I know I\u2019m not alone. New Yorkers are troubled by the homeless problem. Why? Because we are a caring, loving people.\u201cWe are joined today by Joey Resto who was in the news this week for literally giving his shirt off his back and the hat off his head to a shirtless, shivering homeless man in the subway. Let\u2019s give Joey Resto a big round of applause for being a good Samaritan. Raise your hand, Joey! Raise your hand \u2026 there he is.\u201cThis is New York. This is New York. And we are New Yorkers and we will not allow people to dwell in the gutter like garbage. It hurts all of us. You can see it on people\u2019s faces. Every time we walk by a homeless person most of us can\u2019t even bear to look, we can\u2019t bear to make eye contact. We pretend that we don\u2019t see them. Why? Because we don\u2019t want them to see us \u2013 because it diminishes us. To walk past a brother and sister, sitting on the sidewalk and doing nothing.\u201cIt\u2019s as if every time we walk by a homeless person we leave a piece of our soul on that curb. This is not who we are as a people, it\u2019s not our values as a society, it\u2019s not what we were taught, it\u2019s not how we live and it\u2019s not what we\u2019re going to do as a government. We are better than this.\u201cNow, we have made significant progress on the problem before and working together we can do it again. I believe our people will support the funding necessary to help protect and support their brothers and sisters.\u201cThat\u2019s why in this budget I propose a record $20 billion over the next five years. This proposal includes $10 billion for 100,000 permanent affordable units. It also includes $10 billion for 6,000 new supported beds over five years, 1,000 emergency shelter beds, and other homeless services.\u201cAnd the plan goes further. Over 15 years, we will be funding a record 20,000 supportive housing beds. And we will continue to fund 44,000 supportive units and 77,000 shelter beds. That\u2019s $28 billion over 15 years. New Yorkers have a big heart, but New Yorkers are also smart. And society\u2019s compassion must be matched with government confidence.\u201cEach jurisdiction requesting or requiring homeless assistance from the state will be asked to design a strategic plan we call the Continuum of Care, which assesses the size and needs of each sub group within the homeless population and identifies exactly what they need. We implemented this system nationwide at the department of housing and urban development, and it was a great success.\u201cIt is also well established that many of our shelters are unsanitary and unsafe. People have been attacked and victimized in some shelters and some would rather stay outside in the frigid cold than risk entering, and they are right to do it. Over this past year, the state has recorded 2,500 health and safety violations in shelters across the state. This suffering has gone on for a long time. Adding insult to injury, taxpayers fund over $1 billion for a dysfunctional statewide shelter system. It\u2019s just unacceptable.\u201cIt is imperative that we improve the conditions of the shelters and restore the public\u2019s trust in the system. We need a true independent review, inspection, and action plan from objective experts to go forward.\u201cRemember you are state officials and this is a state constitutional responsibility. The state\u2019s obligation to the needy goes beyond empty guarantees and is intended to be a social obligation. And we will honor it.\u201cWe have developed a strategy and a plan. Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli will audit shelters statewide and we thank him very much. Comptroller Scott Stringer will review and inspect the New York City shelter system and we thank him very much. Comptroller, Stringer. Buffalo Comptroller Mark Shroeder will do the same with the Buffalo shelter system. Mark Shroeder, where are you (applause)? There he is. Mark is way in the back of the room because he\u2019s on his way out. He\u2019s going to start the inspections now, as a matter of fact. To the extent these gentlemen need additional personnel, we will provide it from the state. Buffalo and New York City because those are our two largest shelter systems.\u201cThey will do on-site inspections and review operating and financial protocols.\u201cThereafter, shelters they find to be unsafe or dangerous will either immediately add local police protection \u2014 or they will be closed.\u201cShelters which they find as unsanitary or otherwise unfit will be subject to contract cancellation, operator replacement, immediate remediation or closure.\u201cIf an operator\u2019s management problem is systemic, a receiver will be appointed to run that system.\u201cThere are many qualified not-for-profits that are capable of running good operations and many of the current shelters are well run. But we need to know which are well run and which are not, and we do to do something about those that are not well run immediately. And that\u2019s exactly what this system will do.\u201cIn addition, we will require all social service districts, municipalities, social service workers, and police departments to operate in full compliance with New York State laws and regulations or they will be subject to state sanctions.\u201cWe have developed this approach in cooperation with our local partners, across the state, and we will be working with them to facilitate the three Comptroller\u2019s efforts. I want to thank all our local leaders but I especially want to thank Mayor de Blasio and Mayor Brown for their cooperation, they\u2019ve been working very hard and this is a priority for them. I believe this will improve shelter services and thereby help bring the homeless off the streets and will give the public confidence that everything that can be done is being done. It also happens to be the right thing to do.\u201cWhile we have done much in New York to be proud of, there is still a threshold issue which must be addressed. We have proven competence, and we have proven we can make government work, but recent acts have undermined the public\u2019s trust in government.\u201cPublic trust is essential for government to function at the level we need. I have a number of recommendations that will be in the budget that I believe will help restore the public trust.\u201cThe original constitutional view of a part-time legislature dates back to colonial charters and our first State Constitution in 1777. Now back then, legislators returned to their farms to tend the crops. But that doesn\u2019t happen today. Today, legislators work at law firms or business that pose real or potential conflicts. I propose we adopt the congressional system of limiting outside income for legislators. It\u2019s a proven, it\u2019s cleaner and it\u2019s more effective model that the people of this nation have confidence in, and I believe we should accept the same.\u201cFor years we have discussed and I have proposed closing the L.L.C. loophole. The time for discussion and debate has passed. It\u2019s time for action. I call on the Legislature to close the L.L.C. loophole this year. It is imperative. Pass it and I will sign it into law the very same day.\u201cIn our current campaign finance system, people without funds are virtually uncompetitive. Public campaign financing can help level the playing field, particularly for those seeking to enter. We should encourage new participation in our democracy. I will again propose public financing of campaigns. Long term, this is healthy for our democracy and healthier for our government, and you should pass it this year.\u201cSenator Valesky is right. Our lobbying law is too often circumvented. It can and should be improved. People who work to procure state contracts currently don\u2019t register as lobbyists \u2014 they should. Political consultants who advise elected officials while also representing clients before the government do not currently register as lobbyists either \u2014 and they should also. I am going to send you that bill, and that\u2019s a bill that you should sign.\u201cIt is perverse that taxpayers\u2019 money would support officials found guilty of committing a felony against the taxpayers. We must take state pensions from those convicted of a crime related to their government service. Anything else shows disrespect for the rule of law and for the taxpayer.\u201cThe Freedom of Information Law is a central component of public integrity and disclosure yet the legislature has exempted themselves. It is indefensible, especially in today\u2019s context for you to say you believe in the Freedom of Information Law and for you to sign bills reforming the Freedom of Information Law, but excluding yourself. Let\u2019s make a statement to the citizens and taxpayers of this state that you get it. If you pass a FOIL bill, include yourselves. I will sign it the very same day.\u201cIt has been 50 years since we had a constitutional convention. All too often, public opinion is not reflected in legislative action in Albany. A constitutional convention that is properly held \u2014 with independent, nonelected official delegates \u2014 could make real change and re-engage the public. We need a citizen-government relationship reboot. This is the time to do it and the constitutional convention could be the vehicle to do it.\u201cThe key to reforming our government is engaging people in the democratic process. We already know government is of the people, by the people, for the people. So why do we make it so difficult for the people to participate? Voter registration should be a presumption, not a hurdle. Let\u2019s flip the paradigm and automatically enroll voters when they get a driver\u2019s license. They can always opt out.\u201cThese ethics reforms are important. Especially considering the context of the past year.\u201cWe have to remember the people we serve, and it\u2019s our responsibility to give them the government that they deserve.\u201cAnd remember the stronger the citizen trust, the stronger the government\u2019s ability. We have a big agenda.\u201cNow my friends in closing, there are two other issues that I would like to speak to. These are the lessons that I learned the hard way but maybe an opportunity for me and the state to learn and grow. 2015 was a tough year on many levels. It was a tough year an ugly year on many levels. For me there were also personal hardships in 2015 just about this time last year, we lost my father. He was in this room many a time, he was at this podium many a time. Many of the people in this room knew him very well.\u201cHe had been failing during the holiday season and I was trying to fortify him against the indignities of bodily failure. My father was a very proud and dignified man and the end of his life was very difficult for him to handle. And I kept trying to give him reason to hang on and to fight and to motivate him and I would say, \u2018You know it\u2019s Thanksgiving, you have to be there for Thanksgiving,\u2019 and then I would say, \u2018It\u2019s my birthday in early December,\u2019 and then I say, \u2018It\u2019s Christmas, Pop, you have to be there for Christmas,\u201d and then I said, \u2018January 1st, it is my inauguration and I need you there for the inauguration.\u2019\u201cHe said, \u2018No you don\u2019t.\u2019 I said, \u2018Oh no I need you to help me write the speech,\u2019 and he said again, \u2018No you don\u2019t.\u2019 That was a losing argument. So he said, \u2018O.K. I will be here for your inauguration.\u2019 I looked him right in the eye and I said, \u2018You have to promise me.\u2019 He said, \u2018I promise you, I will be here for your inauguration.\u2019My father never in his life broke a promise to me. January 1st, the day of the inauguration, I went by his apartment to see him, went down to the Freedom Tower in Lower Manhattan, I was sworn in. We had talked about the speech before, he heard the speech over the phone back in his apartment. I then got on a plane and went to Buffalo, the lieutenant governor and I were doing a second inauguration because Kathy Hochul is from Buffalo. And I was giving the speech in Buffalo. In the back of the room I saw the State Police major take a phone call which was unusual. As I saw him starting to walk back down the main aisle of the hall, I knew at that minute exactly what had happened.\u201cLife is such a precious gift and I have kicked myself every day that I didn\u2019t spend more time with my father at that end period. I could have. I am lucky. I could have taken off work, I could have cut days in half I could have spent more time with him. It was my mistake and a mistake I blame myself for every day. But there are many people in this state who do not have the choice. A parent is dying, a child is sick, they can\u2019t take off of work.\u201cTheir employer says, if you don\u2019t come you are fire, if you don\u2019t come you don\u2019t get paid. People have children and mothers run the risk of losing their job if they stay home with their child. Out of 185 countries, the United States is one of just three that does not have paid maternity leave. The others are Suriname and Papua New Guinea. This is not where New York should be. We should have a paid leave program, paid for by employees, who can get twelve weeks of pay and Senator Jeff Klein is exactly right.\u201cAt the end of the day family matters. Intimate relationships matter and in this 24/7 world let this state make a statement of what is really important and those relationships are important. We should be there, one for another, especially in a family environment. Let\u2019s pass family leave this session.\u201cThe second issue, last March, Sandy mentioned to me she was going for a breast exam. I didn\u2019t think anything of it, Sandy was \u2014 had no family history of cancer, 48 years old so it was just a regular check up. A few days later she called me up, she was crying. What happened? She got the results from the screening and one word changed our life: cancer.\u201cAnd that started weeks and weeks and days of a torturous long road with tears and pain that I cannot even begin to articulate. Sandy was great. You know how they say you can really tell a person\u2019s mettle in tough times and when the heat is on. She got stronger, she got braver, she didn\u2019t complain, she had a double mastectomy. Went through that, was recovering at home and all she was thinking about is how do I take this experience and use the energy to help others. How do I take the negative and how do I make it a positive? I just want her to know she was such an inspiration to me because that strength and that love for community is everything we talk about. But you did it.\u201cNow since Sandy\u2019s operation, she has talked about it, word got out about it. Since her operation three women who work with me in their thirties and forties came to me and said, I heard what happened with Sandy, I went and got a screenings. Three women all three had breast cancer. And they never would have gone but if not for Sandy. I know ask women who are in the target age group, \u2018Do you go for screenings?\u2019 They say, \u2018Well it\u2019s hard, I can\u2019t, my insurance, my kids, work, family.\u2019\u201cEarly detection is the best treatment. Early detection is the best treatment. I propose $90 million to make New York where we have the most aggressive breast cancer screening operation in this country. Mobile unites that can get to women, longer hours for clinics, weekend hours for clinics. D.F.S. making sure insurance companies are willing to pay for the screening. These are our wives, our daughters, our sisters. Let\u2019s stand up and say, \u201cNew York is the place. One out of five women will suffer from breast cancer. We\u2019re going to get that number down in New York because we\u2019re going to do what we need to do to save lives because these are our women. And the best thing we can do is to save the lives of New Yorkers.\u201cIn closing, my friends, there is no doubt that this is an ambitious agenda. What else did you think I was going to give to you? But we need the agenda. Now is the moment to maximize the progress that we have made and we have made progress all across this state on every level and now is the time to double down.\u201cAlso, this nation has real problems that we haven\u2019t seen before. And with the gridlock in Washington, I\u2019m not going to rely on them to solve them. New York has a legacy of leading. We\u2019re going to have to act to protect ourselves and to protect our own people. So yes, it is an ambitious agenda, and yes, it is going to be a challenge. But I know you and I know what you\u2019re capable of and I\u2019ve seen what you can do and I have no doubt that you are going to rise to this challenge. You took a $10 billion deficit, and you made it into a $5 billion surplus. You took a Legislature that couldn\u2019t function and you did give budgets in a row. You took the worst partisanship gridlock and you came together and you put your politics aside.\u201cI believe Senator Flanagan and Assemblyman Heastie are not going to operate as Democrats and Republicans. They\u2019re not going to be partisans and they\u2019re not going to be zealots. They\u2019re going to act first as New Yorkers and do what\u2019s right for the state of New York. And I know who we are. In our DNA we are New Yorkers. There is nothing that we can\u2019t do as New Yorkers. We never say quit, we never say no. that\u2019s who made us, that\u2019s who brought us. We came from people who came from different lands. They came in little boats, they went across oceans. They didn\u2019t know where they were going, but they were going for opportunity. They were daring, they were gutsy, they were strong. That\u2019s the blood in your veins.\u201cWe\u2019re the people who survived 9/11. You knock us down, we get up twice as strong. That\u2019s who we are. And our strength \u2014 our strength is insurmountable because it is a strength rooted in our principles. That\u2019s what drives our ambition and conviction. It\u2019s our belief and it is our values. It\u2019s what we stand for. That makes us unbeatable and that\u2019s why you can\u2019t knock us down, because we\u2019re going to keep getting up, because we are New York and we are New Yorkers and we are the Empire State and what we stand for, we will never give up on. We stand for freedom. We stand for democracy. We stand for being united against terrorism. We stand for the spirit of community that says you can\u2019t discriminate against anyone in our state on the basis of race or color, or creed. We stand for unity that we are one at the end of the day.\u201cWe are upstate and we are downstate, but we are one state. We are gay and we are straight but we are one state. We are black and we are brown but we are one state. And that unity and those principles and those convictions and that honor of public service is going to rise to the surface again this year. We will meet these challenges and we will make this state a better state and we will show this nation how to lead.\u201cThey elected you to lead. Let\u2019s lead. Together. Thank you, and God bless you.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Nor do the Black Lives Matter movement, the Occupy Wall Street protests and the armed ranchers who seized public lands in Oregon. But in the insurgent presidential campaigns and in social activism across the spectrum, a common thread is people angry at the way this country is no longer working for many ordinary citizens.And they\u2019re right: The system is often fundamentally unfair, and ordinary voices are often unheard.It\u2019s easy (and appropriate!) to roll one\u2019s eyes at Trump, for a demagogic tycoon is not the natural leader of a revolution of the disenfranchised.

{"Headline": "Supreme Court Seems Poised to Deal Unions a Major Setback", "Date": "2016-01-11", "News": "Supported byIn a closely watched case brought by 10 California teachers, the court\u2019s conservative majority seemed ready to say that forcing public workers to support unions they have declined to join violates the First Amendment.A ruling in the teachers\u2019 favor would affect millions of government workers and culminate a political and legal campaign by a group of prominent conservative foundations aimed at weakening public-sector unions. Those unions stand to lose fees from both workers who object to the positions the unions take and those who simply choose not to join while benefiting from the unions\u2019 efforts on their behalf.Under California law, public employees who choose not to join unions must pay a \u201cfair share service fee,\u201d also known as an \u201cagency fee,\u201d typically equivalent to members\u2019 dues. The fees, the law says, are meant to pay for collective bargaining activities, including \u201cthe cost of lobbying activities.\u201d More than 20 states have similar laws.Government workers who are not members of unions have long been able to obtain refunds for the political activities of unions like campaign spending. Monday\u2019s case, Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, No. 14-915, asks whether such workers must continue to pay for any union activities, including negotiating for better wages and benefits. A majority of the justices seemed inclined to say no.Collective bargaining, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said, is inherently political when the government is the employer. \u201cMany critical points are matters of public concern,\u201d he said, mentioning issues like tenure, merit pay, promotions and classroom size.The best hope for a victory for the unions had rested with Justice Antonin Scalia, who has written and said things sympathetic to their position. But he was consistently hostile on Monday.\u201dThe problem is that everything that is collectively bargained with the government is within the political sphere, almost by definition,\u201d he said.The court\u2019s four liberal members were on the defensive, asking whether there was good reason to overturn a 1977 decision by the court that allowed the fees.\u201cYou start overruling things,\u201d Justice Stephen G. Breyer said. \u201cWhat happens to the country thinking of us as a kind of stability in a world that is tough because it changes a lot?\u201dJustice Elena Kagan focused on the practical consequences of a decision in favor of the challengers.\u201cThis is a case in which there are tens of thousands of contracts with these provisions,\u201d she said. \u201cThose contracts affect millions of employees, maybe as high as 10 million employees.\u201dMichael A. Carvin, the lawyer for the teachers, emphasized what he said was the limited nature of the case. It was not, he said, an attack on the union\u2019s exclusive representation of all workers. A decision in his clients\u2019 favor, he added, would not affect private employers, who are not subject to the First Amendment.Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked whether workers \u201cwho paid these fees against their will\u201d were entitled to refunds.Mr. Carvin answered that \u201call we\u2019re asking is for prospective relief.\u201dThe fact that so much attention was devoted to the aftermath of a decision favoring the challengers suggested that at least some members of the court viewed it as a foregone conclusion.Unions say the teachers\u2019 First Amendment argument is a ruse. Nonmembers are already entitled to refunds of payments spent on political activities like advertising to support a political candidate. Collective bargaining is different, the unions say, adding that the plaintiffs are seeking to reap the benefits of such bargaining without paying their fair share of the cost.The larger threat, the unions and their supporters say, is that a decision in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor would encourage many workers who are perfectly happy with the work of their unions to make the economically rational decision to opt out of paying for it.Edward C. DuMont, California\u2019s solicitor general, arguing in support of the union, did not dispute that collective bargaining involved political issues that implicate workers\u2019 First Amendment rights.\u201cThere are deep public policy implications to many of the topics and to the general tenor of public employee bargaining,\u201d he said.But he said the government\u2019s interests outweighed those rights. \u201cWe need to be able to run our workplaces,\u201d he said.Mr. DuMont added that workers remained free to speak out in other settings.That did not sit well with Justice Kennedy. If a worker \u201cis required to pay $500 for someone to espouse a belief that he doesn\u2019t share,\u201d Justice Kennedy said, it would be small comfort \u201cthat he is now free to go out and argue against it. That means he has to spend another $500 so that it balances out? That makes no sense.\u201dDavid C. Frederick, a lawyer for the unions, urged the justices not to take a major step without more information. But Justice Kennedy indicated that the court might have all the information it needed. \u201cWe could assume,\u201d he said, \u201cthat a state is always benefited and is more efficient if it can suppress speech.\u201dLimiting the power of public unions has long been a goal of conservative groups. Even before Monday\u2019s argument, they had reason to be hopeful that their side would prevail in the case.Justice Kagan said the 2014 ruling, along with one from 2012, \u201cadmittedly expressed some frustration with Abood.\u201d But that was not enough, she said, to justify overruling a 40-year-old precedent.Mr. Carvin responded that the recent decisions had \u201cundermined the doctrinal underpinnings of Abood.\u201d He said the court had overruled important precedents in similar circumstances in 2010 in the Citizens United campaign finance decision.Some of the court\u2019s conservative justices said the consequences for public unions would not be particularly negative should the challengers prevail.\u201cWhy do you think that the union would not survive without these fees charged to nonmembers of the union?\u201d Justice Scalia asked. \u201cFederal employee unions do not charge agency fees to nonmembers, and they seem to survive. Indeed, they prosper.\u201dJustice Scalia seemed ready to vote to overrule the Abood decision.\u201cThe problem is that it is not the same as a private employer, that what is bargained for is, in all cases, a matter of public interest,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that changes the situation.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spanish Supreme Court Orders Bankia to Repay 2 Investors in Its I.P.O.", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Supported byMADRID \u2014 The Spanish Supreme Court ordered Bankia on Wednesday to reimburse two small investors for misleading them during its 2011 initial public offering.Under the ruling Bankia must pay one investor nearly 10,000 euros, or about $10,850, and the other nearly \u20ac21,000 euros, to cover their purchases of shares that eventually were nearly worthless.The ruling could be a boon to thousands of other investors who are suing the bank, accusing it of failing to fully disclose the loan problems that nearly caused the bank\u2019s collapse in 2012.The bank said on Wednesday that it was aware of lawsuit claims totaling \u20ac819 million euros. Bankia said it had adequate provisions for legal liabilities, having set aside \u20ac1.84 billion.The Supreme Court, saying that Bankia\u2019s prospectus for its public stock offering in 2011 had contained \u201cserious inaccuracies, \u2019\u2019 affirmed decisions by two regional courts that backed individual buyers of Bankia stock.In May 2012, the Spanish government seized control of the bank and ousted Mr. Rato after Bankia disclosed that it needed about \u20ac22 billion in fresh capital to stay afloat. The near-collapse of the giant mortgage lender then forced Spain\u2019s government to negotiate a European banking bailout of its savings banks. In the end, almost half of the 41 billion euros, or about $45 billion, of European rescue funding was required to shore up Bankia.Bankia, slimmed down and under new management, returned to profit in 2013 after reporting a loss of \u20ac19.2 billion for 2012, a record for the Spanish banking industry.Bankia raised over \u20ac3 billion in its initial public offering. The stock offering came after the merger of the seven savings banks, or cajas, that formed Bankia, under the leadership of Mr. Rato, a former finance minister and managing director of the International Monetary Fund. Bankia\u2019s merger was part of a broader consolidation of the caja sector, after the bursting of Spain\u2019s real estate construction bubble in 2008. The government encouraged the consolidation to get stronger cajas to absorb the mortgage losses of weaker ones.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Puerto Rico Pleads for Congressional Help as Lawsuits Are Filed", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "Supported byPuerto Rico\u2019s governor on Friday renewed his plea for Congress to provide bankruptcy protection for the debt-ridden island, after two bond insurers filed lawsuits over his decision to default on millions of dollars in bond payments last week.\u201cSwift action from our congressional leaders is necessary and what the people of Puerto Rico deserve,\u201d Gov. Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla said in a statement.Two insurers of Puerto Rican bonds that are now in default sued the governor and other senior officials on Thursday, saying they had illegally diverted money from some creditors so they could pay other creditors in full.Mr. Garc\u00eda Padilla said the lawsuit was a sign that a dreaded \u201crace to the courthouse\u201d had begun, leading to \u201clitigation pandemonium\u201d as different creditors sought to enforce their claims on the island\u2019s resources. He called on Congress to enact legislation that would give Puerto Rico the ability to take shelter in bankruptcy, where such creditor litigation would be automatically stayed.Democratic members of Congress have favored a bankruptcy law for Puerto Rico, but the Republicans who hold the majority in both houses have generally said they need more financial information first.\u201cWith no legal framework to handle this impending litigation crisis, both the Commonwealth and its creditors will soon face the opposite of due process and rule of law,\u201d Mr. Garc\u00eda Padilla warned.Assured Guaranty and Ambac said in their complaint that the clawback was unconstitutional, because it \u201csubstantially and unjustifiably\u201d impaired their contract rights under the United States Constitution. They also said they had constitutionally protected property interests in the money, because they held liens on the pledged funds.They acknowledged that their liens were subject to being paid after the general obligation bonds, but said the use of the clawback was still unlawful under the circumstances, \u201cnamely, where other available resources exist from which the public debt could be paid.\u201dFor months, Puerto Rico has been operating on a triage basis, diverting cash away from certain programs and services and using it to pay the bills deemed most urgent. The government came under criticism in December, for example, for using $120 million of public money to pay Christmas bonuses to public workers and retirees. The governor said he was required by law to pay the bonuses.The two insurers asked the court to declare the clawback unconstitutional and bar the Puerto Rican government from diverting any more pledged money. Their suit was filed in United States District Court in San Juan.The three public authorities whose bonds have been affected by the clawback are the Highways and Transportation Authority, the Convention Center District Authority and the Infrastructure Financing Authority. Although the holders of those bonds received some of the principal and interest payments due Jan. 1, those payments were made from prepaid reserves, which is considered a technical default.The Infrastructure Financing Authority did not have the prepaid reserves in place to make the payment, and Ambac stepped in and provided $10.3 million.Some of the legal and constitutional issues now in play are likely to be reviewed in Washington on Tuesday, when a subcommittee of the House Committee on Natural Resources is scheduled to hold a hearing on Puerto Rico\u2019s financial difficulties. The representatives are expected to focus on the problems of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, which accounts for about $9 billion of the island\u2019s total $72 billion in debt.videoAdvertisement"}

The Globes are given by the 83-member Hollywood Foreign Press Association, a group of mostly freelance journalists.An apparently gobsmacked Lady Gaga, winning best actress in a limited series or TV movie for the latest incarnation of FX\u2019s \u201cAmerican Horror Story,\u201d didn\u2019t get the message. \u201cI feel like Cher in that John Patrick Shanley film \u2018Moonstruck\u2019 right now,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the greatest moments of my life.\u201d She added, \u201cI wanted to be an actress before I wanted to be a singer.\u201dAs ever, Hollywood will pay as much attention to the snubs as to the winners.

But, then again, the Globes are the Globes; in particular \u201cSpotlight\u201d and \u201cThe Big Short\u201d cannot be written off for the Oscars. (Nominations will be announced Thursday; voting closed last week.)Television losers included HBO, which was nominated for seven awards but only managed to take home one \u2014 Oscar Isaac won for \u201cShow Me a Hero\u201d \u2014 and the streaming services Netflix (eight nominations, zero wins) and Amazon, which saw \u201cTransparent\u201d blanked.Amazon\u2019s \u201cMozart in the Jungle,\u201d however, about a charming New York conductor, did find surprisingly strong support among voters, who have a history of backing shows that have yet to pop. The series won best comedy \u2014 dethroning \u201cTransparent\u201d \u2014 and Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal won best comedic actor.

He finally found it, thanking the press association, his wife and his agents, past and present, before becoming unable to read his notes and trying (unsuccessfully) to borrow a pair of glasses.\u201cGod bless you all,\u201d he said, hurrying off the stage.Sunday\u2019s ceremony, broadcast on NBC from the ballroom of the Beverly Hilton hotel, will be scrutinized for clues about the Oscar race, but the truth is that the Globes are often predictive of little.Last year, \u201cBoyhood\u201d and \u201cThe Grand Budapest Hotel\u201d took the top Golden Globes. Oscar voters selected \u201cBirdman\u201d as best picture. Globe voters are also notoriously quirky; this year, for instance, they rather bizarrely classified \u201cThe Martian\u201d as a comedy.Globe nominations were announced before \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens\u201d was screened, so that blockbuster\u2019s absence on Sunday said nothing about its Oscar prospects. A snub last Tuesday by the Producers Guild of America, which did not count \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d among 10 best picture nominees, was perhaps more telling. But the Producers Guild also left out the Weinstein Company\u2019s \u201cCarol.\u201dBehind the scenes, stylists spent last week fretting about weather. Rainstorms started pounding the Los Angeles area on Tuesday, threatening a repeat of the 2010 Globes ceremony, when the red carpet turned into a lake and golf umbrellas and bedraggled assistants became the accessories of choice. On Sunday the weather was chilly for Los Angeles (mid-50s) and overcast.Inside the hotel, waiters scrambled to serve dinners that went largely uneaten, at least at the starrier tables. (On the menu: \u201csalt-baked heirloom sweet potatoes with creamed corn glaze.\u201d) Once upon a time, the Globes were a boozy spectacle, but most nominees \u2014 heeding the scolding eyes of their handlers \u2014 also avoided the plentifully available Mo\u00ebt & Chandon Champagne. One exception: Mr. DiCaprio, a best actor nominee, who arrived and knocked back a Ruby Red, a brightly colored mixture of Champagne and vodka.As ever, the ceremony\u2019s success will be determined by the Nielsen ratings. Last year, about 19.3 million people watched the Globes telecast, a 7 percent decline from 2014. Among adults 18 to 49, the group that advertisers pay a premium to reach, viewership fell by 11 percent. (NBC aggressively promoted the show in recent weeks, even though it was the only broadcast network not to receive a single nomination. Awkward.)Mr. Gervais, who hosted the Globes for three consecutive years starting in 2010, has previously said that he would like to host the Oscars. But an unwritten rule has generally kept the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences from employing an M.C. who has sharpened his or her teeth at the competing Globes.Advertisement"}

That happens when you\u2019re an African-American man suddenly living in a nation with a population of more than 1.3 billion. Mr. Baptiste\u2019s passing resemblance to Kobe Bryant also helped in a country that reveres the Los Angeles Lakers star.But it\u2019s his mission to introduce China to America\u2019s hip-hop culture and a trailer for an unauthorized Tupac Shakur biopic that have earned Mr. Baptiste global notoriety.\u201cHip-hop isn\u2019t even really American to them in China,\u201d Mr. Baptiste said in an online phone conversation from his home in Shaoxing. \u201cThere are large quantities of people who do know, but most people don\u2019t.\u201dMr. Baptiste, 27, grew up listening to Shakur, Nas and Jay Z. But since he moved to China, to complete his master\u2019s degree in international development, he has encountered Chinese students who seem to think the music stems from Korean pop. Mentions of the rap stars he idolized typically draw blank stares.That unfamiliarity inspired Mr. Baptiste to introduce rap pioneers to the Chinese, and the resulting Shakur project became an international online fascination.To make the trailer, Mr. Baptiste drew on his varied show business background. At 9, he was a member of a boy band looking to ride the crest of popular young R&B acts of the time, like Immature and Soul for Real. Mr. Baptiste said that the group was buoyed by a financial stake from the ventriloquist Shari Lewis, and that when she died, in 1998, the band effectively died with her. But Mr. Baptiste never gave up on performing.\u201cEver since then, I made up in my mind that I\u2019m meant to do this,\u201d he said.Turning his efforts to acting, Mr. Baptiste appeared in independent films as an undergraduate at Texas Southern University and spent a month studying abroad in Beijing. Academia sent him back to China when he enrolled in the master\u2019s program at Concordia University in Irvine, Calif. He has since appeared in a variety of Chinese commercials and promotional videos, most notably for the school where he teaches English.Mr. Baptiste occasionally injects African-American culture into his lessons, but the trailer for \u201cUntil the End of Time,\u201d named for a posthumous Shakur album, was something else entirely. The video tells the story of a rebellious Chinese boy writing a school report about the rapper, eventually befriending a woman who claims to be an old Shakur acquaintance. Before long, the boy finds a kindred spirit of sorts in the rap legend, who was killed in 1996 and is played in flashbacks by Mr. Baptiste.The actor also helped finance and produced the project, working closely with a young Chinese filmmaker and friend, Steven Sheng. \u201cWe kind of formulated this kid\u2019s story with the influence of Tupac being a rebel and how the two of them could come together,\u201d Mr. Baptiste said. They never completed the biopic. \u201cWe filmed just enough to put together a trailer,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the main thing was to get the point across, for people to get intrigued.\u201dThe video received more than 135,000 YouTube views before the Universal Music Group demanded that it be taken down. The trailer didn\u2019t get quite the same response in China.\u201cI already knew it wasn\u2019t going to be well received\u201d in China, where just a few thousand watched it, he said. \u201cIf we had a Taylor Swift look-alike in there, then it would have done really well. They love Taylor Swift in China.\u201d Still, Mr. Baptiste was satisfied with the outcome. Chinese viewers \u201csaw it, and it did its job.\u201d he said. \u201cThey know about it now.\u201dAdditionally, he has been emboldened by the attention the trailer received. He has begun production on a similar project centered on the Wu-Tang Clan.\u201cI\u2019m doubling down,\u201d he said, adding that he envisions several more projects.\u201cI\u2019m going to keep on promoting these things and pushing these things in China,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause it has to be done. The people in China need to know about this kind of stuff, because nobody else is teaching them about it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Build Affordable Housing in New York City", "Date": "2016-01-25", "News": "Supported byCritic\u2019s NotebookHurricane Sandy was the last straw for many residents of Ocean Village, a housing project in the Rockaways. Heralded as state of the art when it opened in 1972, this beachside campus of high-rises and four-story townhouses had, over the years, taken a nose dive, the victim of bad management, crime and rot. Sandy left homes flooded, and poor tenants bereft of electricity and hot water. Residents who could, fled.What happened? A new owner, L&M, a developer of subsidized housing, closed on a deal to buy the property two weeks after the storm, when one-third of Ocean Village\u2019s 1,093 apartments were vacant. The company poured $60 million into a renovation.Residents dependent on public subsidies worried they\u2019d face higher rents or be pushed out. L&M guaranteed that they could stay and that their rents wouldn\u2019t rise. Here\u2019s the deal: The company makes its money back partly through federal funds that cover the difference between existing rents and market rates. Swapping out old kitchens and bathrooms, sprucing up lobbies and hallways and redoing electrical and plumbing systems raise property values. After renovation, the government pays the developer more, and L&M can also rent out vacant apartments at market rates.As Ron Moelis, co-founder of L&M, put it: \u201cMaking improvements is a good investment. Good design creates a sense of community. People feel pride in where they live. That translates to less turnover, with residents taking better care of the property.\u201dIt\u2019s also proof that affordable housing can still be done right in New York City. The East Harlem Center for Living and Learning, which opened this fall, is another case. On the west side of Second Avenue, between 103rd and 104th Streets, it occupies what used to be a parking lot that belonged to the New York City Housing Authority. The lot was connected to Washington Houses, a 1950s-era project next door.In lieu of the lot, there\u2019s now an 11-story residential tower, with 100 percent of the apartments subsidized, serving a mix of working and disabled tenants, many from the neighborhood. The architecture is plain and practical. Some 77,000 people applied for 88 apartments. The building links to a pavilion with new offices for local nonprofits and the new 60,000-square-foot Dream Charter School for grades pre-K through eight.Serving 486 neighborhood students, it is the first new public school building in East Harlem in 47 years, designed by the architects Perkins Eastman. The school is light-filled, airy, transparent, with big windows opening onto the Washington Houses and rows of trees. Developers also paid for a new 20,000-square-foot public park, to replace a decrepit concrete one that had been on Second Avenue in what\u2019s effectively the school\u2019s front yard.The developers are Jonathan Rose Companies and Harlem RBI, a nonprofit educational organization with deep roots in the community. They started on the project in 2009. Negotiations with city agencies, unions and residents were arduous. As with Arverne, I heard overwhelmingly positive reactions, and no little amazement, in the neighborhood. Thirty school employees are housing authority residents. After-school programs serve 1,200 local children. Some parents and students I met were in tears, describing the school and park.New York City once set the standard for subsidized housing. The city started out building and maintaining tens of thousands of apartments for working families, sponsoring job training and social programs. It ran a budget surplus. Government programs like Mitchell-Lama and Section 8 arose to provide private developers with incentives to construct and manage high-quality low- and moderate-income housing. I grew up in Greenwich Village, where James Ingo Freed and I. M. Pei designed a refined trio of high-rises, two of the towers for New York University families, the other for low-income Mitchell-Lama residents. Many old Villagers hated the architecture, but like the Village back then, the project represented equity, openness and the new.Now the Village is like a gated playground for runaway wealth. Subsidized apartments all across town are converting to market-rate rentals and condos faster than City Hall can build affordable units or preserve old ones. The city Housing Authority is broke. Its aging properties face $17 billion in capital repairs.The Bloomberg administration belatedly contemplated seizing some underused Housing Authority parking lots for market-rate developments to help raise cash, but politicians did a lousy job of explaining the plan to tenants, who, predictably, went ballistic. As Shola Olatoye, the authority\u2019s current chairwoman under Mayor Bill de Blasio, put it the other day: \u201cAfter decades of broken promises, there\u2019s deep-seated distrust of government and a belief that speculators are only out to take land.\u201dShe added: \u201cBeyond words, what residents need is proof of concept.\u201dThat\u2019s where success stories like Arverne View and the East Harlem Center come in. Both are private developments, made possible through tax incentives and other publicly financed programs. Ms. Olatoye was vice president of Enterprise Community Partners, a real estate investment services company, when Enterprise sponsored the East Harlem Center. So she knows as well as anyone the lessons to be learned.There are a few big, obvious ones, I think. Before lifting a hammer, developers in both cases consulted with people who would be affected, listening to what they wanted, building consensus. Rich Berlin, the executive director of Harlem RBI, told me he and Jonathan Rose Companies spent years negotiating with tenant groups, community-based organizations, local chambers of commerce, parks advocates, elected officials and public-housing residents. \u201cWe created a core of stakeholders,\u201d he said.Both projects keep management teams on site, overseeing the properties, day in, day out. Neither project splurged on design, but in both cases, architecture mattered, to save energy, improve the neighborhood, spread dignity, add joy. They\u2019re clear proof of concept for skeptical tenants \u2014 accustomed to betrayal, reluctant to give up parking lots or anything else \u2014 that change can be good.And as in the case of the East Harlem Center, change can bring more than new housing. Neighborhoods need schools and parks, not just apartments, after all. They depend on good planning. That\u2019s what earns public trust. Mr. de Blasio\u2019s affordable-housing goals have run into headwinds partly because they don\u2019t grow out of integrated plans that reflect how neighborhoods work and what communities really want. To his credit, the mayor and his staff now seem to be at least talking more holistically about neighborhoods, infrastructure and design.He might also try to rise above politics. The East Harlem project got started under his predecessor. The Dream School is a charter. Mr. de Blasio ran for office opposing charters.He skipped the center\u2019s opening this fall. Last I heard, he still hadn\u2019t visited.He ought to check it out.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mexico Moves to Extradite Drug Kingpin Called El Chapo to the U.S.", "Date": "2016-01-09", "News": "Supported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 After long resisting requests from Washington, the Mexican government is moving toward extraditing Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Loera, the Mexican drug lord known as El Chapo, to the United States to face drug and murder charges there, Mexican officials said on Saturday.Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s lawyers are expected to fight extradition to the United States, where he faces at least seven indictments in federal courts on charges of drug trafficking and murder.Mr. Guzm\u00e1n, who escaped from prison last year, was captured on Friday after a gun battle near the coast in his home state, Sinaloa. His capture was the culmination of a monthslong manhunt in the mountains of the so-called Golden Triangle, a rugged area in the northwest of the country. After an intense gunfight in the coastal city of Los Mochis, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n was captured attempting to flee in a vehicle with one of his top lieutenants. By late Friday he was en route to the same prison he escaped from in July.Transferring Mr. Guzm\u00e1n to the United States would be an about-face for the government, which has in the past resisted efforts to extradite the drug lord as a matter of sovereignty. Mr. Guzm\u00e1n, the head of the Sinaloa Cartel, would first serve his time in Mexico before he was sent to the United States, officials had said.Almost exactly one year ago, Jesus Murillo Karam, the Mexican attorney general at the time, said: \u201cI can accept extradition, but when I say so. El Chapo has to stay here and do his time, then I\u2019ll extradite him. Some 300, 400 years later. That\u2019s a lot of time.\u201dEven as recently as three weeks before his escape from prison, through a mile-long tunnel connected to his shower stall, the United States made a formal extradition request for Mr. Guzm\u00e1n. But even if Mexico has come around to the idea of extradition, the legal process could take many months. Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s lawyers have already filed motions to block any extradition, dating from his last imprisonment in 2014, and the process must go through the judicial system. \u201cIt is not merely a matter of an executive decision,\u201d one of the officials said.For now, though, the attorney general\u2019s office appeared prepared to press on with the early steps leading to extradition. Noting the efforts by Mr. Guzman\u2019s lawyers to file injunctions, a statement from the office on Saturday said that none of them \u201cprevents the execution of these orders, much less the start of the extradition procedure.\u201d A spokesman for President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto declined to comment.In the past, experts say, the courts have generally sided with the government in extradition cases. But the idea that the process could be expedited is unlikely.\u201cThere is no fast-track extradition,\u201d said Agust\u00edn Acosta, a defense lawyer not involved in the case. \u201cThe process could take maybe as long as a year.\u201dThe United States has made several extradition requests for Mr. Guzm\u00e1n, and officials are hopeful he may be sent there as law-enforcement relations have improved, a Justice Department official said on Saturday. But the department has not received any definite commitment, the official said.\u201cIs it possible? Yes,\u201d said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in discussing international deliberations. \u201cBut I have not heard anything definitive.\u201d The official noted that Mexico had agreed to send several high-level fugitives, including Edgar \u201cLa Barbie\u201d Valdez, in September and said that relations between the two countries in law enforcement operations had improved drastically in recent months. Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch has now met twice with Ms. G\u00f3mez Gonz\u00e1lez.\u201cThere\u2019s a different mind-set,\u201d the official said.In the aftermath of Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s escape, relations between the Mexican and American governments were at a low. Offers of American assistance to Mexican law enforcement authorities, including drones and intelligence, were initially rebuffed.The decision mystified many on the United States side, and even led some within the Mexican government to grow impatient. Mr. Guzm\u00e1n, with the weight of Mexico\u2019s most powerful drug cartel behind him, was a particularly well-resourced fugitive.Here is what you need to know about the secret mountaintop meeting between Sean Penn and the drug lord Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Loera, also known as \u201cEl Chapo.\u201dBut the nature of the early relationship between the United States and Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s government was one of caution. When Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto came to office, he sought to break with the administration of his predecessor, Felipe Calder\u00f3n, who worked very closely with the Americans and devoted much of his time to prosecuting the American-led war on drugs.Individuals in the Calder\u00f3n administration said that toward the end of their time in office, there was a recognition that the Mexican government had done too much on behalf of the United States, to the point of even working against its own interests. They pursued the gangs with full force, breaking many of them apart while also creating an unpredictable group of organizations that were less disciplined and more violent.But the black eye of Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s escape, from the country\u2019s most secure prison, caused the government to begin rethinking its strategy. The reach of the drug baron, his ability to successfully bribe and threaten officials, bring incredible resources to bear and pull off the seemingly impossible have started to prompt a change of heart at the top.One of the officials said sending Mr. Guzm\u00e1n to the United States was simply the right thing to do, but denied that it was because Mexican institutions were not up to the task. But in both of his past escapes, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n has managed to involve prison officials, pointing once more to the challenges faced by Mexico.The manhunt for Mr. Guzm\u00e1n reached a finale in the early hours of Friday, when Mexican marines stormed a compound in Los Mochis where he had sought refuge with several others. During the ensuing firefight, which raged for more than an hour, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n escaped with a top lieutenant through a storm drain.The men emerged through a manhole, and then stole a car. But the authorities quickly tracked them down, capturing them along the highway from Los Mochis to Navojoa. Mr. Guzm\u00e1n was taken to Mexico City and, late on Friday night, paraded before media cameras in blue track pants and his signature mustache on his trip to the maximum security prison, Altiplano.With an estimated wealth of nearly $1 billion, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n was among the most well-financed fugitives in history. The hunt for Mr. Guzm\u00e1n may have been Mexico\u2019s most extensive manhunt ever. Investigators focused on the Triangle, along the borders of the states of Sinaloa, Durango and Chihuahua. They identified Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s logistics network, which included airplanes, runways and a range of property and vehicles.The search began with the investigation into his escape, as the police rounded up the people who built the tunnel and flew Mr. Guzm\u00e1n to a hiding place in the northwestern mountains. They tracked him to a ranch in the remote municipality of Pueblo Nuevo in Durango.By October, they were ready to act. Special forces units aboard a helicopter had him in their sights, but they could not shoot; Mr. Guzm\u00e1n was accompanied by two women and a girl, and the snipers held their fire.As he fled from the snipers, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n slipped and fell, injuring his leg and face, the authorities said at the time. Though he escaped, security forces were able to capture seven of his men, and those arrests led to more intelligence about his movements.Mr. Guzm\u00e1n retreated farther into the mountains, cut back his guard, and limited his communications, Ms. G\u00f3mez said. But by that time, Mexican intelligence was tracking his moves, helped in part by the feelers Mr. Guzm\u00e1n had put out to actresses and producers about making a movie about his life.By the end of December, the authorities became aware that Mr. Guzm\u00e1n would be traveling through a city. The government began tracking one of Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s chief tunnel architects, who was preparing different homes in the states of Sinaloa and Sonora for his boss\u2019s arrival.Among those homes being watched was the one in Los Mochis, a city of some 250,000 near the Sinaloan coast. After nearly a month of surveillance, on Wednesday, the authorities noticed unusual activity inside the house. At dawn on Thursday, a car appeared. Based on intelligence, the authorities said, they knew that Mr. Guzm\u00e1n was inside.At dawn on Friday, federal forces began a raid on the house. They were met with high-caliber gunfire. Mr. Guzm\u00e1n reverted to an old playbook: He fled.Hours later, the Mexican president, using his Twitter account, announced the news of his capture.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated, at one point, the year that Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Loera escaped from a Mexican prison. It was last year, not this year.An earlier version of the above correction omitted the source of the error. It was made during the editing process, not by the reporter.Eric Lichtblau contributed reporting from Washington, and Elisabeth Malkin from Mexico City.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York to Gain 30 Acres of Parkland From Catholic Nuns", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byUPPER NYACK, N.Y. \u2014 Sister Veronica Mendez adjusted her glasses and tried to remember the last time someone joined the religious order here. \u201cJoined and stayed?\u201d she pondered. \u201cIt would have been the 1970s.\u201d Sister Veronica, 73, said the order, whose members are better known as the Marydell sisters, chose to hold on to 10 acres, which include all 19 of its buildings. Among the structures are a convent, an outdoor chapel and rustic cabins used for weekend retreats and day-camp programs in summer.The order, which operates the Marydell Faith and Life Center, is selling the 30 acres to the trust for $3.1 million, an amount that Sister Veronica said was below market rate. \u201cSome people have suggested that we could get $10 million,\u201d she said matter-of-factly, as she showed off the land on a bitterly cold afternoon.The sloping property, which the order acquired in 1924, includes dense woodland and meadow stretching down to the Hudson. The sisters, who range in age from 68 to 98, believe the property is sacred and should be enjoyed by the public. \u201cWhen you see the land, you see what a gift it has been,\u201d Sister Veronica said. \u201cFor almost 100 years, it has been a summer camp and blessed by the laughter of children. It has also been blessed by people\u2019s prayers.\u201dFor the trust, which began discussions with the order more than a decade ago, the deal has involved pulling together several financing sources.The Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation has agreed to contribute $2.1 million of the purchase price. Another $450,000 is coming from the state\u2019s Mid-Hudson Regional Economic Development Council. The Village of Upper Nyack and the Durst Organization, which supports the Trust for Public Land, have each committed $100,000. And this past week, the Town of Clarkstown, which includes the village, pledged up to $300,000.At Marydell, negotiations were complicated by the need for the sisters to remain in residence. Carving out the 10 acres for the order made sense, given that all of the buildings were clustered there. Nine of the nuns live on the property, and eight others are in nursing homes or residences in Westchester County, New York City and Puerto Rico.For much of its history, Marydell\u2019s focus was the eight-week summer camp that it operated for some 130 girls. Most came from low-income neighborhoods in New York City. The girls slept in the cabins and swam, hiked, played baseball, did arts and crafts and watched movies.\u201cWe got too old and too few,\u201d said Sister Veronica, who was the camp director until 1988, when Marydell Camp officially closed. \u201cCamping is hard work.\u201dSince then, the order has rented out the cabins to a few camp programs, including one for children with disabilities. At the moment, the order is reaping some much-needed revenue by renting its property to Universal Television, which is using the cabins as the backdrop for a Hulu original series about a cult.The income has allowed the sisters to finally address maintenance on its buildings. \u201cThere were repairs that just weren\u2019t being made,\u201d Sister Veronica said.As for the $3.1 million the order will receive for its land, Sister Veronica said it would be used for both its ministry and medical expenses. \u201cIt will go into our savings to provide for the needs of us as we die off,\u201d she said.The sisters are also trying to sell a separate eight-acre parcel down the street from the Marydell Faith and Life Center. That property does not adjoin state parkland, and the order is willing to sell to a housing developer.But the sisters said they could not abide the idea of houses blanketing the 30 acres that would soon become state parkland. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Sister Veronica said, as a winter sunset bathed Hook Mountain in amber light. \u201cIt really is a priceless piece of property, no matter how much money anyone offered us. This just seemed right.\u201dAdvertisement"}

On Sunday, he died in a Nashville hospice. The cancer killed him, his daughter Kendall Hooker said. He was 85.Mr. Hooker\u2019s personal right-to-die campaign capped a flamboyant career as a perennial litigant and political candidate who figured in the Supreme Court\u2019s pivotal \u201cone person one vote\u201d ruling and helped persuade H. Ross Perot to mount an independent run for president in 1992.Although Mr. Hooker repeatedly lost his races for elective office, he managed to advance a progressive agenda, dominated by campaign finance reform, through his candidacies and as a plaintiff in the courts.As a special assistant to Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy in the early 1960s, Mr. Hooker was credited with helping to persuade the Justice Department to intervene in a lawsuit by Charles Baker, a Memphis Republican, against Tennessee\u2019s secretary of state, Joe Carr, over legislative redistricting.The United States Supreme Court decision in that case, in 1962, led to the drawing of voting districts for state legislatures and Congress on the basis of population, not geography, augmenting the political power of urban areas and minority groups.Mr. Hooker began beseeching Mr. Perot, a Texas billionaire who made his fortune from a data processing firm, to seek the presidency as early as November 1991. Three months later, when Mr. Perot challenged a supporter in Nashville to get him on the ballot in all 50 states, Mr. Hooker regarded that call as Mr. Perot\u2019s first public declaration of a candidacy.Mr. Hooker believed that in a volatile campaign season in which many voters said they were fed up with mainstream politicians, a third-party candidate might have potential, especially one who was independently wealthy.Mr. Perot received nearly 19 percent of the vote that November against President George Bush and Bill Clinton, who won with a plurality. Some analysts suggested that Mr. Perot\u2019s candidacy had cost Mr. Bush a second term.He was also the chairman of the company that franchised Minnie Pearl Fried Chicken, named for the Grand Ole Opry comedian. (The venture fizzled quickly.) The Securities and Exchange Commission investigated the company\u2019s accounting practices but found no evidence of wrongdoing.Mr. Hooker was born in Nashville on Aug. 24, 1930, to John Jay Hooker Sr., a prominent lawyer, and the former Darthula Williamson. He was a great-great-grandson of William Blount, who was a North Carolina delegate to the Constitutional Convention and one of the first United States senators from Tennessee.Mr. Hooker received a bachelor\u2019s degree from the University of the South in Sewanee, Tenn., in 1952; served in the Army Judge Advocate General\u2019s Corps; and graduated from Vanderbilt University Law School.His marriages to the former Eugenia Fort and Paula Lovell ended in divorce. He is survived by three children from his first marriage, Dara, Kendall and John; one from his second, James Thomas Lovell; four grandchildren; and a brother, Henry.In 1958, Mr. Hooker was enlisted to assist in a corruption case against a Tennessee judge accused of accepting a bribe from the Teamsters union. Among the witnesses against the judge was Kennedy, then a lawyer for a United States Senate committee investigating labor racketeering.He and Mr. Hooker became fast friends, and Kennedy recruited Mr. Hooker and John Seigenthaler, who became the editor of The Tennessean, to join him at the Justice Department.In 1961, Mr. Hooker was the executive secretary of the Tractors for Freedom Committee, which swapped farm equipment for prisoners after the abortive American invasion of Cuba.He lost the Democratic primary for governor in 1966, won the nomination in 1970 but lost to Winfield Dunn, a dentist and political unknown who was supported by the administration of President Richard M. Nixon. Mr. Dunn, who had characterized Mr. Hooker as inclined toward \u201csocialistic evils,\u201d became the state\u2019s first Republican governor in half a century.To his detractors, he was pigheaded, so much so that he was suspended from practicing law for 30 days in 2008 for filing frivolous suits. To his fans, he was fearless.\u201cHe was a man always chasing whatever the next dream was,\u201d John Y. Brown Jr., a former governor of Kentucky and a co-owner of Kentucky Fried Chicken, told The Associated Press after his death.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Expect Some Unicorns to Lose Their Horns, and It Won\u2019t Be Pretty", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorThe unicorn wars are coming, as the downturn in the market will force these onetime highfliers to seek money at valuations below their earlier billion-dollar-plus levels, known as \u201cdown rounds.\u201dWhether you are a spectator or part of the blood bath, here is what you can expect in the coming clashes among employees, founders and investors.The biggest battle in the down rounds will be between the common and the preferred shareholders.The fight will be a result of the way that the venture capital investments are structured. Employees and founders often hold common shares that sit below preferred shares held by the venture capitalists. The preferred shares typically have liquidation preferences and rights against being diluted, while the common shareholders have no such protections. The preferred shares are convertible into common shares at a price per share that reflects the valuation of the company at the time of the investment.Liquidation preferences provide that the preferred shareholders receive a minimum payment if the company is sold. They can even be set off in an initial public offering, as was the case in the Square I.P.O.Anti-dilution rights provide that when the new money comes in at the lower valuation, investors from prior rounds get compensated. The compensation is that the conversion price for their preferred shares into common is reset at the lower value.These two rights will pack a punch to the common shareholders. If the valuation goes down below the liquidation preference, the common shareholders will have their entire investments wiped out. Even if this does not happen, the anti-dilution rights will come out of the hide of the common shareholders.A down round hits employees and founders hard, evaporating the worth of their hard-won shares.So, expect boards to tread carefully when considering down rounds. The board will try to paper over the problems by allowing all of the shareholders, including employees, to invest in the down round.There may also be some halfhearted attempts to get preferred shareholders to waive their anti-dilution rights, but the waiver has to be unanimous, so don\u2019t expect it to happen often. Boards will also hire financial advisers to show that this is all fair to the employees and there was no other choice but to do the down round and reduce the value of the common stock. Expect the financial advisers to always find that this is the case.This leads to the second battle. Silicon Valley is a place where failure is held up as a virtue. Employees aren\u2019t going to stick around long if they see their equity stake wiped out. They will move to the next start-up and take their chances there.The down round is a \u201clemon\u201d signal to the market that the company\u2019s business plan is not working out. And one of the thorniest issues in dealing with down rounds is how a former unicorn keeps its employees after destroying the value of their shares.In some cases, the employees will be out of luck and left with nothing. This is more likely to happen if the company is sold at a lower valuation than if it raises money in a down round. But even if the common stock has some value, it is likely to be worth much less and certainly not a billion dollars.If stock incentives are often no longer an option, since all of the stock worth anything is held by investors in the preferred category, cash bonus plans or other incentive plans that pay cash in the event of a success may be necessary. The problem, of course, is that it just isn\u2019t as good as cold-hard stock with its potential for a big payout. So expect some hard bargaining and companies searching for ways to win back the loyalty of their employees.These efforts are likely to fail. No one likes to be told that, after winning the lottery, they have to give up the money. And so, it is no surprise that some companies do not survive down rounds, not because of finances, but because they can no longer keep their employees.Then there will be the battle between the new money and the old, as the preferred-stock holders, who invested at the top of the market, duke it out with the new down-round investors.The old money may sit back and rely on the anti-dilution rights and liquidation preferences to protect themselves from the new money. In most cases, this should be enough and the old preferred shareholders should be O.K. so long as the company value does not go off a cliff.But if the company is desperate, the new money may try to insist on seizing control of the company. The new money may also insist on super-contractual protections, like more aggressive anti-dilution rights and higher liquidation preferences that put it in a superior position to the old preferred money.Like the employees, the founders will suddenly find that all that money they thought they had has evaporated. The new money will now be in the position to decide whether to keep the founders. If the founders stay, they will own a far smaller stake in the company, but will likely be working harder. The owners will have to move forward managing an enterprise that is set back on its heels, burdened with the down-round label. This is a tough task, and one that is harder for a 20- or 30-something with a bruised ego.It all means that interesting times are coming to Silicon Valley. As the unicorns instead become donkeys, lawyers will be dusting off their files as they seek to structure these down rounds and avoid all-out warfare. In the negotiations, the lawyers will be trying to balance all these interests and slice up a smaller pie among unhappy employees, investors and founders.The goal will be to see not whether a billion dollars can be created, but rather whether any value can be salvaged as the unicorn bubble pops.Advertisement"}

Trump \u00e2\u0080\u0094 something he has been doing on the campaign trail, and something voters can expect to see more of in the weeks before the early voting begins.In post-debate talking points the campaign distributed to donors and supporters, the first item promoted Mr. Bush\u00e2\u0080\u0099s preparedness to be commander in chief in the wake of the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif.\u00e2\u0080\u009cJeb took on Donald Trump and the back benchers in the Senate once again, and articulated his plan to make America safer, stronger, freer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the suggested message read.And another talking point in the memo offered a similar theme: \u00e2\u0080\u009cJeb\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record of accomplishment can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be matched by the other candidates,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the message read. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo one in this field, from Donald Trump to Ted Cruz to Chris Christie to Marco Rubio, is more prepared to be president on Day 1 than Jeb Bush. \u00e2\u0080\u009c At the end of the donor call, Heather Larrison, the campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s finance director, urged supporters not just to continue to raise money, but also to help on the ground in the early voting states.\u201cWe are actively recruiting all of our friends, family, peers, colleagues for the deployment effort,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Larrison said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need boots on the ground in Iowa and New Hampshire and South Carolina, so if you all are willing to go \u00e2\u0080\u0094 if you all know friends who are willing to go \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we would love to have your help there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

BLUMBERGProvidence, R.I.To the Editor:Your article characterizes Bernie Sanders as \u201ca New Deal-style liberal.\u201d Mr. Sanders is a self-identified democratic socialist more akin to Norman Thomas, the leader of the Socialist Party during the New Deal era. Thomas was once asked if the New Deal had stolen his thunder by enacting a socialist agenda. No, he said, \u201cthey carried it out on a stretcher.\u201dHillary Clinton, as a progressive, is much closer to the political philosophy of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the New Deal. Roosevelt faced a dismal depression not with pie-in-the-sky proposals but with hardheaded pragmatism.GEORGE CURTINCamas, Wash.To the Editor:Critics of Bernie Sanders say that someone with such a progressive agenda could never get the cooperation of a Republican House or Senate. The implication is that we should vote for Hillary Clinton because she could get that cooperation.But Republicans hate her and have for two decades. Republicans made a pact when President Obama was elected that they would fight him at every turn, and they did, even when he supported their own ideas. The same would happen with Mrs. Clinton, and the same would happen with Mr. Sanders.JOHNNY TOWNSENDSeattle To the Editor:I am one of those people whose feelings are reflected in the CNN Values vs. Electability poll accompanying Mr. Blow\u2019s column.

Leaders\u2019 Exasperation Grows", "Date": "2016-01-26", "News": "Supported byThe members of the party establishment are growing impatient as they watch Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz dominate the field heading into the Iowa caucuses on Monday and the New Hampshire primary eight days later.The establishment candidates and their allies have spent about $35 million attacking one another, and there is no sign that they plan to relent anytime soon. A super PAC supporting Mr. Bush is targeting Mr. Rubio in advertisements in Iowa and New Hampshire for reversing himself on an immigration overhaul and on Tuesday began broadcasting a commercial accusing Mr. Rubio of exercising \u201cbad judgment\u201d for using a Republican Party credit card for personal expenses. Late last week, the same group began broadcasting a commercial in New Hampshire assailing Mr. Kasich for expanding health care in Ohio under the Affordable Care Act.That prompted Mr. Christie to lash out at Mr. Rubio on Sunday during a town-hall-style meeting in Portsmouth, N.H. The governor ridiculed Mr. Rubio at length for his incomplete attendance record in the Senate and noted that some of the ads on Mr. Rubio\u2019s behalf were funded by a group that did not have to disclose its donors.\u201cThese guys are so busy fighting one another that they\u2019re only continuing to facilitate the rise of Trump and Cruz,\u201d said Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a longtime Republican strategist.After the Iowa caucuses, and then the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 9, the pressure on those candidates who are lagging in the polls will intensify.\u201cWhoever is not named Trump and not named Cruz that looks strong out of both Iowa and New Hampshire, we should consolidate around,\u201d said Henry Barbour, an influential Republican strategist based in Mississippi.But it is not clear that the Iowa and New Hampshire results will come so neatly, or that the also-rans will be so willing to drop out after two states. Mr. Bush, in particular, still has the support of a well-funded super PAC. And even if he were to trail Mr. Rubio after the first contests, Mr. Bush might still fight on to South Carolina, where he recently won the support of Senator Lindsey Graham and where he plans to call on his older brother, former President George W. Bush.Some in the party now concede that it might take until March or beyond for the Republican establishment to coalesce behind an alternative to the current front-runners. And that could be too late to catch Mr. Trump or Mr. Cruz.Judd Gregg, a former senator from New Hampshire, said he believed his state would cull the field, but he acknowledged that the primary calendar \u2014 and the lineup of conservative Southern states that vote in March \u2014 could prolong the race.Robert F. List, a former Nevada governor, agreed.The current \u201ccircular firing squad against the lower team,\u201d Mr. List said, \u201cis not helpful.\u201dMany in the party say they believe the assault by Mr. Bush against Mr. Rubio has been particularly damaging.But it is not just supporters of Mr. Rubio who are uneasy about the attacks against him by the super PAC backing Mr. Bush, Right to Rise, an assault that will have lasted two months by the New Hampshire primary.Asked about the attacks, Mr. Cole, who has not endorsed a candidate, suggested Republicans would not tolerate them much longer if Mr. Bush did not show viability in Iowa and New Hampshire.\u201cYou need to be prepared to stop if the evidence is that it\u2019s not working,\u201d Mr. Cole said, lamenting the \u201camazing amount of resources wasted on one candidate.\u201dMr. Barbour, who is also uncommitted, was even blunter. \u201cWhy is Right to Rise spending all this money on somebody who can beat Hillary?\u201d he asked. \u201cMeanwhile, Trump and Cruz go mostly unscathed.\u201dMr. Barbour was so exasperated by the intra-establishment combat that this month he sought to raise money for the super PAC supporting Mike Huckabee that would have been spent to attack Mr. Cruz in Iowa. But Mr. Barbour found few donors willing to intervene in such a volatile race.The party\u2019s major contributors are starting to become increasingly vocal in their impatience.\u201cThe next couple of weeks are very important for Jeb,\u201d said William E. Oberndorf, who has given more than $1.5 million to Mr. Bush\u2019s campaign and the super PAC backing him.Others in the party\u2019s donor class are so worried that they are already envisioning another path to their preferred nominee, months after the primary contests, at the Republican convention this summer.Earle I. Mack, a real estate developer and former ambassador to Finland under George W. Bush, said the heavy bloodletting in the Republican race might prevent any candidate from clinching the nomination. In that case, he said, Republicans should turn to Speaker Paul D. Ryan.\u201cIn these horrible crossfires, with everybody shooting each other down, it would be good to nominate somebody uncontroversial, who could appeal to a broader electorate,\u201d Mr. Mack said.Jonathan Martin reported from Des Moines, and Alexander Burns from Manchester, N.H.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Iran Change?", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorRiyadh, Saudi Arabia \u2014 THE world is watching Iran for signs of change, hoping it will evolve from a rogue revolutionary state into a respectable member of the international community. But Iran, rather than confronting the isolation it has created for itself, opts to obscure its dangerous sectarian and expansionist policies, as well as its support for terrorism, by leveling unsubstantiated charges against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.It is important to understand why Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies are committed to resisting Iranian expansion and responding forcefully to Iran\u2019s acts of aggression.Superficially, Iran may appear to have changed. We acknowledge Iran\u2019s initial actions regarding the agreement to suspend its program to develop a nuclear weapon. Certainly, we know that a large segment of the Iranian population wants greater openness internally and better relations with neighboring countries and the world. But the government does not.Iran uses attacks on diplomatic sites as an instrument of its foreign policy. The 1979 takeover of the American Embassy in Tehran was only the beginning. Since then, embassies of Britain, Denmark, Kuwait, France, Russia and Saudi Arabia have been attacked in Iran or abroad by Iranian proxies. Foreign diplomats and domestic political opponents have been assassinated around the world.In Yemen, Iran\u2019s support for the takeover of the country by the Houthi militia helped cause the war that has killed thousands.\u0648\u0632\u064a\u0631 \u062e\u0627\u0631\u062c\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0645\u0644\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f\u064a\u0629 \u064a\u062a\u062d\u062f\u062b \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0637\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u062a\u0634\u0643\u0644\u0647 \u0625\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0633\u0637.Saudi Arabia will not allow Iran to undermine our security or the security of our allies. We will push back against attempts to do so.Saudi Arabia has been a victim of terrorism, often at the hands of Iran\u2019s allies. Our country is on the front line of fighting terrorism, working closely with our allies. Saudi Arabia has arrested thousands of terrorism suspects and prosecuted hundreds. Our fight against terrorism is continuing as we lead multinational efforts to pursue those who participate in terrorist activities, those who fund them and those who foment the mind-set that promotes extremism.The real question is whether Iran wants to live by the rules of the international system, or remain a revolutionary state committed to expansion and to defiance of international law. In the end, we want an Iran that works to solve problems in a way that allows people to live in peace. But that will require major changes in Iran\u2019s policy and behavior.

Quinn. The activists remain big donors to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s political efforts.But New Yorkers broadly opposed Mr. de Blasio\u2019s effort to end the industry, and some supporters of the mayor said they hoped he would abandon the cause.City officials did not elaborate on Sunday evening about the financing for the stable, which would be Central Park\u2019s first for commercial carriage horses, according to park historians. People briefed on the deal, who requested anonymity to describe discussions meant to be private, said that an area near the park\u2019s 86th Street Transverse would be the most likely site.The deal would prohibit pedicabs from operating in Central Park below 85th Street, eliminating a competitor to the carriage trade.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Economic Era for China Goes Off the Rails", "Date": "2016-01-07", "News": "Supported byA stock market plunge last summer, and a messy currency devaluation that followed, had faded from global view. In the relative calm, he seemed to usher in a new era of economic management, promising policy coordination at the highest levels to prevent another bout of turmoil.Less than three weeks later, his plans have been derailed as China\u2019s stock market and currency once again rattle investors around the world. The latest rout sets up a challenge for Mr. Xi, who has positioned himself as the master of the country\u2019s economy.At every turn, the president\u2019s efforts to manage the economy, market and currency have been undercut by global headwinds and haphazard policy making. Three initiatives this week, involving currency depreciation and two sets of stock market rules, have been particularly discordant. All three were hastily suspended after China\u2019s stock market plunged on Thursday morning.He also cannot move forward on the bolder actions needed to head off a more serious economic slump, such as forcing hopelessly indebted state-owned enterprises to stop borrowing money and shut down. Otherwise, he risks further eroding short-term confidence and growth, which have depended heavily on this borrow-and-spend mentality, and mass layoffs could follow.Mr. Xi\u2019s options are also more limited than in the past. He and his aides engineered the elevation of the renminbi to the ranks of the world\u2019s leading currencies, a status bestowed by the International Monetary Fund in November. But in doing so, he gave up some control, allowing market forces to play a bigger role.In the last couple of years, China had begun allowing, even encouraging, companies and people to invest more of their wealth overseas. Doing so helped reduce deflationary pressures at home from chronic overinvestment and overcapacity, and increased China\u2019s influence around the world.But a trickle of money leaving China to buy houses and other overseas investments has become a flood this winter. The central bank has responded by trying for the last three weeks to slowly guide the currency down as a way to help bolster exports and also make overseas investments seem more expensive and less appealing.The result has been chaotic. With the renminbi worth less by the day in the international markets, Chinese families and companies worry that their renminbi wealth will buy less tomorrow, spurring faster capital flight and worsening the currency turmoil.This week, regulators also put in place a so-called circuit breaker for the stock market, a mechanism that halts trading when shares fall too steeply. The new measure, which followed last summer\u2019s market slide, was aimed at stabilizing stocks. But in practice, it has amplified anxiety.Another measure, which banned large shareholders from selling stock, was supposed to expire on Friday. The looming deadline prompted smaller investors to dump shares.\u201cThese very high-level bodies were supposed to coordinate policy, and in this case there really was a failure of coordination,\u201d said Victor Shih, a specialist in Chinese financial policy at the University of California, San Diego.The resulting stress has driven share prices in China down 12 percent so far this week. The fall would have been even steeper if the new rules had not shut down the market repeatedly.In a stark about-face, the Chinese stock market regulator said Thursday night it would suspend the new measure, \u201cin order to preserve market stability.\u201d It is also extending the selling ban for another three months.With circuit breakers repealed on Thursday night and large shareholders told that they would have to wait another three months before they would be allowed to resume selling shares, the Shanghai Composite Index rebounded 1.5 percent on Friday morning.The combination \u2014 a troubled stock market and currency \u2014 has proved worrisome for global investors. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, the main benchmark in the United States, was off 2 percent on Thursday, and European and Asian shares were down broadly.Few analysts had expected such a quick retreat. \u201cRemoving the circuit breakers now means they have to admit they made a mistake,\u201d Hao Hong, the chief strategist at Bank of Communications International, the overseas arm of a big Chinese bank, said earlier in the day.For years, the response to economic weakness has been the same in China: spend, spend, spend.In some way, China is reverting to its old tactics.Over the last few months, the government has cut interest rates and introduced numerous measures to help stimulate growth. The central bank\u2019s response to the latest stock market fall has been to inject more money into the financial system, so that banks can keep lending.In the face of Monday\u2019s tumult, Prime Minister Li Keqiang visited one of the country\u2019s largest and most troubled state-owned steel companies, Taiyuan Iron and Steel Group. There, Mr. Li reassured workers, urging them to \u201crevive your strength and power.\u201dThe strategy, though, risks deeper problems down the road.By not shutting down struggling companies, China is putting off a much-needed shakeout. The country is also piling on debt to keep such businesses on life support.That makes it difficult to discern the underlying health of the economy, and runs counter to Mr. Xi\u2019s tough promise that China will clean up its corporate mess.Mr. Xi also cannot easily ask the central bank to print huge sums of money to bail out the stock market and struggling companies. Doing so now would risk flooding the economy with cash, causing a further decline in China\u2019s currency against the dollar.Some economists see ominous signs of a broader slowing.A quarterly survey of 2,000 Chinese manufacturers and other industrial companies shows that almost none are currently investing in new equipment and factories. \u201cIn the past four quarters, it\u2019s only 2 to 3 percent that are making expansionary investments,\u201d said Gan Jie, the director of the Center on Finance and Economic Growth at the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business in Beijing, who oversees the quarterly survey.Controlling the currency is already a problem. China has found itself in the difficult position of setting the value of the renminbi lower and lower each day, culminating in a fall of 0.51 percent Thursday morning alone. But the central bank tried to halt the renminbi\u2019s slide on Friday morning by fixing it 0.015 percent higher than the day before in mainland trading.China faces a similar steady drip of stock declines.China\u2019s stock markets have tended to be less correlated with the local economy than most countries\u2019 markets. That is because trading tends to be a speculative activity in China, mainly undertaken by retail investors who frequently have a herd instinct.The problem was on full display this week, as the new circuit breaker mechanism kicked in. The rule imposed a cooling-off period, halting trading for 15 minutes when losses reached 5 percent. After trading resumed, the steep slide continued, prompting the markets to close early twice this week when they reached a second circuit breaker of 7 percent.To some analysts, it was unnecessary. China already has a rule that each stock cannot drop more than 10 percent in a day.Even China tacitly admitted it had made a mistake. When the country\u2019s regulator abandoned the policy on Thursday night, it noted in a statement that it had imposed the policy despite having \u201cno experience\u201d in using a circuit breaker.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Tumultuous Housing Program in Algeria", "Date": "2016-01-09", "News": "Supported byALGIERS \u2014 The air was festive on a recent morning as families moved into their new apartments, courtesy of the Algerian government. Women\u2019s shrieks of joy sounded from the balconies as children tried out the swings beneath a large banner that declared, \u201cOur aim, Algiers, a capital without slums.\u201dBut the celebrations were quickly followed by disappointment, even anger. The construction was shoddy. Water coursed down the walls of the main hallway. And the apartments, at Cit\u00e9 Kourifa, were too small for families that had grown in the many years since they had applied for government housing.\u201cLast night, I had to spend the night in the car,\u201d said Ali Mehdad, 60, a retired taxi driver who had moved in the previous day with his family of eight, including a grandson. \u201cOne son is 35 and cannot get married, because how can you add more people here?\u201dThe government program, one of the most ambitious in the region, is Algeria\u2019s answer to galloping population growth, rapid urbanization and a housing crisis that, many argue, lies at the base of much of the country\u2019s despair.Critics, however, say the housing handouts are creating as many problems as they solve, fueling corruption, violence and a culture of dependency while opportunities to spur growth outside Algeria\u2019s vast oil sector are ignored.Even much of the construction, intended to generate employment and to diversify Algeria\u2019s economy from its dependence on the oil sector, has been outsourced to Chinese companies. Recently, Turkish and Egyptian companies have also joined the building boom.The housing program is nonetheless popular, and vastly oversubscribed. Nearly 70 percent of Algeria\u2019s 39 million people now live in cities along the northern coast, often in slums or in densely packed 1950s tenements rife with drugs and crime.The program amounts to a big government transfer of oil revenue to head off the kind of strains that could lead to unrest.Apartment blocks in pastel shades have sprung up in four new towns and scores of suburbs across the north of the country. The cost of the program is not public, but has run into billions of dollars after more than a decade, analysts say.\u201cIt is the only good thing that happened to Algeria,\u201d said Hakim Ghazi, 25, sitting with a friend outside a 10-year-old social housing project in Bab Ezzouar, on the southeast of Algiers.The World Bank and the United Nations say, however, that Algeria\u2019s problem is not so much a lack of housing as its exorbitant cost \u2014 caused by rigid government policies.Algeria is indeed a particularly volatile society, uprooted by two brutal wars in 60 years and chafing under authoritarian rule. Even the way the houses are distributed would hardly pass for a social program in most other countries.Riot police officers armed with Taser guns turn out in force each time housing lists are announced and relocations are carried out.The families who moved in December to the apartments at Cit\u00e9 Kourifa, in a suburb 20 miles east of the city center, said they had been told to prepare their belongings the day before and then ordered at 4 a.m. to vacate their homes in a slum across town.Only then were they shown the list of families allocated apartments and handed keys. By 10 a.m., bulldozers moved in to destroy the slum, to prevent others from occupying the homes. Five people whose names were not on the list were left homeless, former residents said.Nabila Ounas was one of those celebrating the move to Cit\u00e9 Kourifa last month. \u201cI\u2019m so happy,\u201d she said, showing off the apartment.\u201cWe were living in such conditions, surrounded by snakes and scorpions,\u201d she said. \u201cI lost my first child because of the conditions.\u201d Born prematurely in the slum, the baby survived only an hour, she said.But her joy was fragile. She began to weep as she recounted the turmoil of the move, how bulldozers destroyed the slum as they watched, and how a teenage neighbor slit his throat when he learned he had not been assigned an apartment.\u201cHis name was not on the list, and he committed suicide,\u201d she said, wiping her cheeks. \u201cHe was 16 or 17 years old. He was completely lost.\u201d The youth, named Abdennour, came from a broken family and fell through the net, she said.The government has created a time bomb by handing out apartments, said Rachid Tlem\u00e7ani, a professor of political science at the University of Algiers.\u201cWhy did the government not liberalize housing?\u201d he asked. \u201cIn Tunisia, you do not have this problem, because they had a strategy. Here, you rely on the state, which is very authoritarian and at the same time corrupt.\u201d \u201cAfter each decision, we have riots,\u201d he said.Elected mayors and heads of communes have been replaced over the years by government functionaries, who have been accused of selling apartments or taking bribes, Professor Tlem\u00e7ani said.In 2009, the General Inspectorate of Finance found that nearly 500 names on a housing list for 3,200 homes were children of high-level government officials and even of presidential staff members, El Watan newspaper reported.Housing has become such a source of anger and discontent that the mayor of one province stopped posting lists of people to be assigned apartments because each time, it set off violence.\u201cWe can manage the other problems, except the housing,\u201d said Amar Kamiche, a retiree who lives in a 1950s tenement in west Algiers. He never received government housing, despite applying in 1970, and he and his wife raised seven children in a tiny apartment where the toilet is in the kitchen.He recalled the optimism of the 1960s, when he traveled to France to train as a patisserie chef. \u201cWe never thought Algeria would be what it is today,\u201d he said in sadness. \u201cI left a great country, and I expected it to be greater when I came back.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Iowa, Ted Cruz Savors Lead Role", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byMr. Cruz has gotten to this point by amassing an energized and growing coalition of Christian activists and anti-establishment Republicans, an extensive organization and a deep reservoir of money. But he is also benefiting from a splintered opposition that does not have either the money or the will to halt his rise.Some supporters of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, for example, privately say they believe Mr. Cruz cannot be defeated in Iowa. While those claims may in part be gamesmanship \u2014 an attempt to build up Mr. Cruz\u2019s expectations here \u2014 more revealing is that neither Mr. Rubio nor the well-financed outside group allied with his campaign has spent money on television advertising in Iowa assailing Mr. Cruz.Mr. Cruz, obscured for much of last year by a shifting cast of attention-getting rivals, is relishing the turnabout.Joined on his 45-foot bus by a phalanx of aides and a camera crew from Showtime, and with a second motor coach carrying a swelling group of reporters, Mr. Cruz boasted about the fresh denunciations being directed his way. \u201cI guess something has changed,\u201d he said with barely concealed delight.But what gives his team pause \u2014 and what is to many Iowa Republicans the crucial question leading to Feb. 1 \u2014 is whether Mr. Trump will abruptly end his nice-guy routine with Mr. Cruz and begin attacking him in ads and behind the microphone at his big, highly publicized rallies.\u201cI\u2019m a little concerned about that,\u201d Representative Steve King of Iowa, Mr. Cruz\u2019s highest-profile Iowa surrogate and travel partner for part of the week, said about the possibility of a Trump offensive. \u201cTrump is so completely unpredictable, we don\u2019t know what he might do campaign-wise. We can\u2019t even begin to think about anticipating that.\u201dAccording to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.\u201cThey\u2019re fighting with rocks against bazookas,\u201d Mr. Strawn said.Mr. Cruz has become far more entrenched in Iowa than Mr. Gingrich was at this point in his campaign four years ago. With many conservative activists here feeling a sense of fury toward their party, Mr. Cruz has emerged as the candidate most effectively channeling that boiling anger.Conversations with dozens of Cruz supporters suggest that the dismay Iowa Republicans feel toward Washington is prompting them to coalesce behind Mr. Cruz, whom they see as the only viable conservative contender. \u201cWe need a winner,\u201d Susie Lee, 50, said Monday before Mr. Cruz made a late-night stop at a diner in Missouri Valley. \u201cHuckabee and Santorum are great guys, but they haven\u2019t been in office like Senator Cruz has, fighting.\u201dPamela Oviatt of Logan, a Santorum backer four years ago, showed up before 9 p.m. for Mr. Cruz\u2019s 10:30 appearance. She said that among activists, there was little talk of any rivals. \u201cCruz is the only one that\u2019s in the political system now that anybody is looking at twice,\u201d she said.Ms. Oviatt\u2019s distinction about Mr. Cruz\u2019s being a part of the political system remains a worry for the senator\u2019s backers.Iowa Republican leaders say that he is the preferred candidate among traditional activists. \u201cHe\u2019s winning the within-the-system, anti-establishment folks,\u201d said Don Kass, the Republican chairman in Plymouth County. But the party leaders also say that Mr. Trump is garnering support from people new to the caucuses.Indeed, Mr. Trump\u2019s backers here say they are confident that his attacks on the political status quo will bring out thousands of Iowans who have not previously caucused or even registered as Republicans, and his campaign is trying to register supporters as Republicans. But state party records indicate only modest gains in the numbers of registered Republicans over recent months, a pattern little different from that in past election years. There are now a little more than 612,000 registered Iowa Republicans. In early August, there were about 609,000.The threat Mr. Trump presents has nevertheless cast a shadow of uncertainty over the caucuses and the party. And that, in its own way, has aided Mr. Cruz: Mark Lundberg, the Sioux County Republican chairman, said he thought Mr. Cruz was one of the few candidates running who could appeal to angry Trump legions if Mr. Trump falls short.Mindful of this, Mr. Cruz has seldom mentioned Mr. Trump except to praise him. This week, however, he has started invoking Mr. Trump for another reason.Asked about attacks by some of his rivals, Mr. Cruz said that Mr. Trump was the target of a similar barrage a few weeks ago. He also told diners at a steakhouse in Carroll to expect ads assailing him to be unleashed in the coming weeks \u2014 the sort of onslaught that a true underdog would never receive.His eyes wandering to a political flier on a nearby table, Mr. Cruz seized on a bit of evidence. \u201cI\u2019m looking at a mailer some of y\u2019all may have seen: \u2018Ted Cruz is dangerous!\u2019\u00a0\u201d he read.\u201cYou know what?

Garibaldi, who as the first woman to serve on the New Jersey Supreme Court voted to uphold the death penalty and wrote decisions that defined sexual harassment in the workplace and declared Princeton\u2019s all-male eating clubs discriminatory, died on Friday in Hackensack, N.J. She was 81.The cause was complications of a stroke, Robert Tanzola, a cousin by marriage, said.Justice Garibaldi, a judicial pragmatist who tilted conservative in criminal cases, served on a court that gained a national reputation in the 1970s and \u201980s as innovative and progressive through its pioneering rulings on school financing and local zoning.Justice Garibaldi, a Republican, ruled that a divorced parent could leave the state with her children if the move would benefit them. She upheld the right of a murder victim\u2019s survivor to address the jury in death-penalty cases. And she declared that a prosecutor\u2019s use of challenges to exclude black jurors violated a defendant\u2019s right to an impartial trial.In 1990, Justice Garibaldi\u2019s ruling in Frank v. Ivy Club found that the exclusion of women from Princeton\u2019s private undergraduate eating clubs violated state antidiscrimination laws.She was prolific, writing more than 225 opinions, including several notable dissents. She sustained the validity of Breathalyzer tests in drunken-driving cases but dissented when the court ruled that party hosts were responsible if a guest to whom they served liquor drove away intoxicated and got into an accident.The decision was believed to be the first by any state court establishing the primacy of a patient\u2019s wishes when they conflicted with the policies of a medical institution.\u201cDeath comes to everyone,\u201d Justice Garibaldi wrote. \u201cHowever, in our society, due to great advances in medical knowledge and technology over the last few decades, death does not come suddenly or completely unexpectedly to most people.\u201d\u201cQuestions of fate,\u201d she noted, \u201chave become questions of choice.\u201dIn 1993, ruling in a case brought by a former Toys \u201cR\u201d Us employee, the court for the first time defined which conduct constituted sexual harassment and when employers could be held liable for an employee\u2019s behavior.Generally, according to the court\u2019s definition, a woman would have to prove that the conduct occurred because of her sex and that the harassing behavior was \u201csevere\u201d or \u201cpervasive\u201d enough to cause a reasonable woman to believe that the work environment had become \u201chostile\u201d or \u201cabusive.\u201dWhen Governor Kean nominated Ms. Garibaldi, then a 47-year-old tax lawyer, as an associate justice, she was only the 18th woman to serve on any state\u2019s highest court. In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Kean said that his faith in her had been validated.\u201cShe was so full of intelligence and integrity, you couldn\u2019t quarrel with her, and she was willing to stand up alone sometimes in her dissent,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew if I appointed the first woman it had to be a great one.\u201dMarie Louise Garibaldi was born in Jersey City on Nov. 26, 1934, to Louis Garibaldi, a doctor, and the former Marie Seventi. No immediate family members survive.She received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1956 from Connecticut College, where she majored in economics. After hearing that no business schools would accept women, she enrolled in Columbia University Law School. (Among the 11 other women in her class of 250 was Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a future United States Supreme Court justice.) Ms. Garibaldi graduated in 1959 and received a master of laws degree from New York University School of Law.She worked for the Internal Revenue Service but left to join a New Jersey law firm, Riker, Danzig, Scherer, Hyland & Perretti, where she was named a partner within three years. She then served as a municipal judge in Weehawken, N.J., was a co-chairwoman of Mr. Kean\u2019s successful campaign for governor in 1981 and was the first woman to head the State Bar Association.As a trailblazer in a former all-male preserve, Justice Garibaldi believed that though men and women could be equally qualified for the judiciary, they might bring different perspectives to the job.\u201cWhen you come to the court you bring your life experiences, and I think a woman has different life experiences than some men would have,\u201d she said when she was appointed. \u201cI expect I may bring a particular point of view, and it will be affected by the fact I\u2019m a woman, but my reasons will be grounded in the law.\u201d Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Case Could Widen Free-Speech Gap Between Unions and Corporations", "Date": "2016-01-18", "News": "Supported bySidebarAt the arguments in the case, Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, No. 14-915, the justices seemed poised to widen that gap by allowing government workers to refuse to support unions\u2019 collective bargaining activities, too.The case should prompt a new look at whether the differing treatment of unions and corporations is justified, said Benjamin I. Sachs, a law professor at Harvard.\u201cIf we\u2019re going to make this opt-out right for workers more and more muscular, which is what is going to happen with Friedrichs,\u201d he said, \u201cthe question of symmetrical treatment of shareholders just becomes that much more important.\u201dThe differing treatment is warranted, the Supreme Court has said, because it is hard to change jobs and easy to sell shares, and because shareholders can influence what corporations say.\u201cAllowing government to use the excuse of protecting shareholder rights to stifle the speech of private, voluntary organizations undermines the First Amendment,\u201d Justice Kennedy wrote.In Citizens United itself, Justice Kennedy said the case for differing treatment had gotten stronger.\u201cShareholder objections raised through the procedures of corporate democracy,\u201d he wrote for the five-justice majority, \u201ccan be more effective today because modern technology makes disclosures rapid and informative.\u201d\u201cMost individual shareholders cannot obtain full information about corporate speech or political activities, even after the fact,\u201d the brief said. \u201cNor can they prevent their savings from being used to speak in ways with which they disagree.\u201dThe question in the Friedrichs case is whether government workers who choose not to join unions may be required to pay fees to support collective bargaining. These workers are already entitled to a refund for fees spent on classic political activity. But they contend that all of a public union\u2019s activities are political and that being made to support them is compelled speech that violates the First Amendment.Accepting that argument, the professors\u2019 brief warned, would further tilt the political playing field in favor of corporate power.\u201cIf this court chooses to grant additional First Amendment rights to union nonmembers,\u201d the brief said, \u201cit will only further increase the extent to which they enjoy greater rights than do corporate shareholders.\u201dThere are important differences, of course, between making an investment and holding a job.For starters, it is much easier to sell stock than to change employers. But lots of people, and certainly those who follow conventional advice about how to invest prudently, keep their retirement savings in diversified holdings like mutual funds.\u201cMany individuals are effectively compelled to maintain investments in companies whose political expenditures they do not know and cannot control,\u201d the law professors\u2019 brief said.There is another important distinction between the teachers who brought the new case and investors in companies. The First Amendment is a limit on government power, and it does not directly affect private agreements, whether between companies and shareholders or between private employers and their workers.But at last week\u2019s argument, Justice Kennedy mused about whether that should be so, at least in the context of labor unions.\u201cI think that\u2019s correct as a basic distinction,\u201d he said of the difference between the government and private employers. But he told the teachers\u2019 lawyer that laws requiring workers at private firms to pay fees to their unions could also raise a First Amendment problem.\u201cThat is state participation in the very kind of coerced membership and coerced speech that you\u2019re objecting to,\u201d Justice Kennedy said of such laws.\u201cThe firm would be required, as unions are, to determine what percentage of its overall annual expenditures are political ones,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEach objecting shareholder would then be entitled to an annual dividend equal to their pro rata share of these political expenditures.\u201dProfessor Sachs said there was reason to think Congress might enact that kind of law. \u201cSuch a move would garner the support of the labor movement, some significant portion of the institutional investor and shareholder advocacy community, as well as the campaign finance reform community,\u201d he wrote.But that was four years ago, and he may have been optimistic.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s Paid Speeches to Wall Street Animate Her Opponents", "Date": "2016-01-21", "News": "Supported byFor a fee of $275,000, she had agreed to appear before the clients of GoldenTree Asset Management, the capstone of a lucrative speechmaking sprint through Wall Street that earned her more than $2 million in less than seven months.Mrs. Clinton said the Dodd-Frank rules, while unpopular among some on Wall Street, were a necessary response to the financial crisis, according to one person who attended, while making clear she viewed Wall Street as a partner in securing the country\u2019s economic future, not an enemy. We have to win together, she said, not divide ourselves.But her paid speeches are now emerging as the central line of attack in an increasingly bitter primary clash with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. In Sunday\u2019s debate in South Carolina and at a series of campaign appearances in Iowa this week, Mr. Sanders has argued that Mrs. Clinton is too personally beholden to Wall Street to effectively rein in the industry\u2019s excesses.In Iowa on Wednesday, Mr. Sanders went even further, seeming to mock her sizable speaking fees as borderline bribes from a powerful industry. \u201cYou got to be really, really, really good to get $250,000 for a speech,\u201d he said.The attacks have become one of Mr. Sanders\u2019s biggest applause lines in Iowa, where the median household earns about $52,229 a year. And Republican strategists are testing how to turn Mrs. Clinton\u2019s speaking fees against her in an election defined by rising economic inequality and stagnant middle-class wages. Even some of her supporters are questioning the wisdom of accepting the fees when she knew she might run for the presidency again.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.But the new attacks strike at what even some allies believe may be one of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s biggest vulnerabilities: not her positions on financial regulation, but her personal relationships with Wall Street executives, along with the millions of dollars Mrs. Clinton, her husband, and their family foundation have accepted in speaking fees or charitable contributions from banks, hedge funds and asset managers. Unlike Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Obama has never earned speaking fees from Wall Street.\u201cThe reason that Bernie is focusing on the speaking fees is that Hillary can\u2019t use the Obama defense,\u201d said Ed Rendell, a former Pennsylvania governor, who has supported Mrs. Clinton.In retrospect, Mr. Rendell conceded, Mrs. Clinton would have been better off giving fewer such speeches.\u201cAlthough they needed money, I think that Bill was raking in enough that Hillary didn\u2019t have to do it,\u201d Mr. Rendell said. \u201cTo people who earn $200,000 in seven years, it looks ridiculous.\u201d\u201cGoldman Sachs also provides very, very generous speaking fees to some unnamed candidates,\u201d he told voters at a winery in Carroll, Iowa, on Tuesday.In highlighting Mrs. Clinton\u2019s ties to Wall Street, Mr. Sanders is tapping into suspicion that remains potent in both parties years after the last Occupy Wall Street tents disappeared from Zuccotti Park in Lower Manhattan. Donald J. Trump, who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, has mocked hedge fund managers as \u201cguys that shift paper around\u201d and \u201cget lucky.\u201d Other Republicans have likewise sought to tap into popular discontent with Wall Street, blaming the Dodd-Frank legislation for letting \u201cthe big banks get bigger and bigger and bigger,\u201d as Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, another Republican presidential candidate, put it last fall.Sensitive to the sour public mood, Mrs. Clinton has layered her own speeches with calls to reduce income inequality and overhaul the country\u2019s \u201crigged\u201d economic system. In what was billed as a major economic speech before a Wall Street audience in July, Mrs. Clinton called for expanding Dodd-Frank and denounced fraud in the financial sector.Dennis M. Kelleher, the president of Better Markets, a financial industry watchdog group, said Mr. Sanders appeared intent on opening a new front on the issue of financial regulation.\u201cHe\u2019s got a plan, and she put out a plan. Your eyes glaze over,\u201d said Mr. Kelleher. With his attacks on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s speaking fees, Mr. Kelleher said, Mr. Sanders was trying to \u201cget out of the fight over whose plan is better.\u201d\u201cWall Street made her a multimillionaire,\u201d the ad, titled \u201cHillary\u2019s Bull Market,\u201d asserts. \u201cDoes Iowa really want Wall Street in the White House?\u201dOn Wednesday, the group escalated its attacks, targeting Mrs. Clinton\u2019s daughter, Chelsea Clinton, who in her 20s worked for a New York-based hedge fund run by a Clinton friend and campaign donor, Marc Lasry.But a Crossroads official said that its polls and focus groups of voters in battleground states suggested that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s speaking fee \u2014 typically around $225,000, or almost five times the median American household income \u2014 could be a potent line of attack with swing voters in November.One poll, from June, found that when informed that the Clintons had made $25 million in speaking fees since the beginning of 2014, slightly more than half of respondents said she \u201cdoes not understand\u201d the \u201cstruggles of ordinary Americans.\u201d Another poll, from November, found that Wall Street campaign contributions to Mrs. Clinton made a similar proportion of voters less likely to vote for her.\u201cOur focus groups with swing and independent voters, especially women, responded very negatively to the contrast between Hillary\u2019s rhetoric on Wall Street and her close financial ties to the industry,\u201d said Steven J. Law, the president of American Crossroads.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign has seized on the group\u2019s intervention to discredit Mr. Sanders. In a statement, Jennifer Palmieri, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s communications director, said Mr. Sanders was \u201ctaking his cues\u201d from Republicans and \u201cusing a Karl Rove attack to go after her.\u201dStill, interviews with voters in Iowa suggest that Mr. Sanders\u2019s attacks are finding an audience.\u201cIt\u2019s a gentle jab at Hillary,\u201d Joe Driscoll, 71, an architectural restorer from Honey Creek, said after one Sanders speech. He called the gibe \u201cclassy\u201d when compared with Chelsea Clinton\u2019s suggestion that Mr. Sanders would strip Americans of their health care. He said the connection of Mrs. Clinton to Goldman resonated with him and others who equated Goldman with Wall Street misdeeds. At an appearance before 1,200 people in Sioux City on Tuesday, Mr. Sanders attacked \u201cthe revolving door of politics and Wall Street,\u201d with two Treasury secretaries, one from each side of the political aisle, having Goldman Sachs on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. He called it a travesty that the executives who \u201cripped off\u201d Americans never did jail time, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s wrong, and we are going to change that.\u201dMr. Sanders seemed ready to move on when another thing suddenly seemed to occur to him: \u201cOh, by the way, I forgot to mention they also provide a lot of campaign contributions and speaking fees to unnamed candidates.\u201dRuss Gifford, from South Sioux City, said he had always figured that the relationship between Goldman Sachs and the Clintons was beneficial to the Clintons personally and the bank institutionally, but also to Americans who benefited from a strong economy fueled by success on Wall Street.Now, Mr. Gifford said, he is not so sure.\u201cBernie\u2019s calling it into question. \u2018Just how beneficial is it for us?\u2019\u201d Mr. Gifford said. He described himself as a longtime supporter of Mrs. Clinton but called Mr. Sanders \u201cvery impressive.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of the president of American Crossroads.

{"Headline": "Pakistan Arrests Jaish Militants Over Attack on Indian Air Base", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported byThe banned militant group, Jaish-e-Muhammad, has aggressively conducted attacks in the Indian-administered portion of Kashmir and elsewhere over the years, and Pakistani officials say it also has ties with the Pakistani Taliban and Al Qaeda.It was not immediately clear from the official statement how many Jaish members had been arrested. But officials said that raids were being conducted to seal any of the group\u2019s offices that might still be operational.\u201cBased on the initial investigations in Pakistan, and the information provided, several individuals belonging to Jaish-e-Muhammad have been apprehended,\u201d a statement from the prime minister\u2019s office said. \u201cThe offices of the organization are also being traced and sealed. Further investigations are underway.\u201dIndian officials have long accused the Pakistani military of nurturing groups like Jaish-e-Muhammad as proxies against India. And such groups have operated with relative impunity within Pakistan in recent years despite being officially outlawed.That Pakistan\u2019s military command \u2014 including the powerful army chief, Gen. Raheel Sharif, who was at the meeting to discuss the arrests \u2014 was willing to support action against Jaish-e-Muhammad was taken as a promising sign.\u201cThis is a very important step,\u201d said Ayaz Amir, a noted Pakistani columnist, while talking to a private television news network. \u201cIt is a signal that we are distancing ourselves from the policies of the past.\u201dIt was not clear, however, whether the arrests meant that foreign secretary-level talks between India and Pakistan, originally set for Friday but derailed after the attack, were back on.Mr. Azhar, who is on India\u2019s most-wanted list, was arrested in Kashmir in 1994, then released in 1999 in exchange for Indian passengers from a hijacked Indian Airlines plane. In 2001, he was accused of planning an attack on the Indian Parliament that left nine people dead.A spokesman for Mr. Modi\u2019s party said the arrests were \u201ca positive step.\u201d\u201cIf Pakistan acts against terrorism, then it is good for the people of both countries, because terrorists are enemies of the humanity,\u201d said Shrikant Sharma, head of the Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s media cell.Improving relations with India has been a priority for Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who hosted Mr. Modi at his home in Lahore during a surprise visit by the Indian leader on Dec. 25.But in the past, such thaws have been met with suspicion by the more hawkish elements in each country. Border clashes or militant attacks have broken out with notable regularity after important moments of reconciliation.That was the case with the Pathankot base attack, which came roughly a week after Mr. Modi\u2019s good-will visit with Mr. Sharif. Six gunmen infiltrated the air force base, in India\u2019s Punjab State, on Jan. 2 and held Indian forces at bay for days.\u201cThe objective obviously was to derail the Pak-India peace process,\u201d said Ayesha Siddiqa, a Pakistani security analyst. \u201cThere could be nervousness after Indian P.M. Modi\u2019s visit to Lahore.\u201d She agreed that moving against Jaish-e-Muhammad, which was strongly suspected in the attack, was an important gesture.In addition to Prime Minister Sharif and General Sharif, who are not related, the senior-level Pakistani meeting was attended by Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan; Finance Minister Ishaq Dar; the chief minister of Punjab Province, Shahbaz Sharif; the chief foreign affairs adviser, Sartaj Aziz; the military intelligence chief, Lt.

{"Headline": "Goldman to Pay Up to $5 Billion to Settle Claims of Faulty Mortgages", "Date": "2016-01-14", "News": "Supported byMore than seven years after the worst of the financial crisis, Goldman Sachs is again paying a price for the role it played.The Wall Street firm said on Thursday it had agreed to a civil settlement of up to $5 billion with federal prosecutors and regulators to resolve claims stemming from the marketing and selling of faulty mortgage securities to investors.Goldman, which is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday, said the settlement would reduce earnings in that period by approximately $1.5 billion on an after-tax basis.In the early days of the financial crisis, Goldman Sachs received an outsize share of criticism from politicians and the media as its trading desk made money by betting against the housing market in the run-up to the crisis.But in the end, Goldman\u2019s role in churning out faulty mortgages and securities backed by home loans to borrowers who could not afford them was smaller than that of many other Wall Street firms like Bank of America or JPMorgan Chase.As a result, Goldman\u2019s settlement is far smaller than the sums paid by other firms for selling flawed mortgage securities. Goldman is among the last firms to reach a civil settlement with a task force of federal prosecutors, state attorneys general and regulators empowered to investigate Wall Street\u2019s role in cobbling together securities from all the mortgages that borrowers found themselves unable to afford.The agreement in principle requires Goldman to pay $2.385 billion in civil penalties and $875 million in cash and provide up to $1.8 billion in relief to consumers.Bank of America in 2014 paid about $16.6 billion in a similar settlement with federal and state agencies, and JPMorgan Chase paid about $13 billion in 2013. In all, the banks have paid more than $40 billion in settlements to resolve claims investigated by the task force. All the mortgage settlements have included a certain amount of so-called soft money that is intended for loan modifications or foreclosure relief for consumers harmed by the bad mortgages. Some consumer advocates have raised concerns about how that money is allocated and how much comes directly from each bank\u2019s bottom line. In the case of Goldman, the soft money is the $1.8 billion.In the case of Bank of America, the soft dollar portion of its settlement totaled about $7 billion. But Bank of America was involved in writing far more mortgages to consumers than Goldman Sachs, and it is unclear exactly how Goldman\u2019s consumer relief will be doled out and to whom.The settlement is on top of the approximately $3 billion Goldman paid to the Federal Housing Finance Agency in 2014 to settle claims with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac over the sale of flawed mortgage securities. In that deal, Goldman settled the matter by buying back bonds from the mortgage finance firms.In 2010, Goldman paid $550 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission for its role in putting together a collateralized debt obligation called Abacus. That bundled deal of subprime mortgage securities resulted in losses to investors. But the so-called synthetic C.D.O. was constructed in such a way as to allow another investor to profit by shorting, or betting against, the mortgage securities that were packed into the investment vehicle.The settlement in principle that Goldman announced on Thursday did not involve C.D.O.s, but more traditional mortgage-backed securitizations.The deal resolves claims arising from Goldman\u2019s underwriting and sale of mortgage-backed securities from 2005 to 2007, during a period leading up to the financial crisis and a sharp decline in home prices across the country.In announcing the settlement now and including the cost in the fourth quarter, Goldman is trying to enter 2016 with a clean slate and put much of its outstanding regulatory issues behind it.In the short term, the settlement could greatly affect the fourth-quarter earnings that Goldman reports next week. In the third quarter, the firm reported a profit of $1.3 billion, or $2.90 a share.Shares of Goldman rose 1.5 percent to $161.39 on Thursday. \u201cWe are pleased to have reached an agreement in principle to resolve these matters,\u201d Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In 2016 Race, Local Matters Give Way to National Tone", "Date": "2016-01-17", "News": "Supported byIn 2016, all politics is national. The hometown industries and parochial peeves that once shaped the early primary contests are rapidly losing clout this election season, overcome by the intensifying ideological cast of Republican politics and a potent anger about the economy and terrorism that has thoroughly overshadowed priorities closer to home.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.In New Hampshire, where the most important campaign issue seems to be how often candidates show up, the leading contender, Donald J. Trump, has spent far less time there than other Republicans.One factor, some Republicans said, is the rising importance of the debates. Surveys by TargetPoint, a market research firm with Republican clients, indicated that voters have reacted far more powerfully to candidates\u2019 debate performances than to their political ads, said Alexander Gage, TargetPoint\u2019s chief executive.And the debates have been far more focused on national issues like immigration and terrorism than on regional ones. (In 2008, some Republicans recalled, one debate featured a sharp exchange over how to bring down the cost of hurricane insurance in Florida.)\u201cDebates are the bigger driver, and they by their nature don\u2019t focus on the local issues as much,\u201d Mr. Gage said. \u201cWhat we hear from the focus groups is, \u2018It\u2019s the country, not my state, not my town, that I am most focused on.\u2019\u201d\u201cYears ago, most of the news people got was local, so local issues dominated their news consumption,\u201d Mr. Tyler said. \u201cToday people get most of their news from New York-centric news organizations that focus on national and international stories.\u201dHistory suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.\u201cPeople are more likely to know what\u2019s going on a thousands of miles away than they are a mile down the street,\u201d he added.But perhaps the biggest force, Republican officials and strategists said, is that voters this year are paying close attention to issues like so-called crony capitalism and government spending. Some of the most engaged conservative voters, they said, are less willing to let slide a special tax break or earmarked boondoggle, even one benefiting their state.\u201cRank-and-file primary and caucus voters are angry and frustrated with the leadership in Washington, D.C., precisely because of those kinds of backdoor deals,\u201d said Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity. \u201cThey\u2019re more willing to respond to people with the guts to take a stand.\u201dThe strength of that response is being tested most intensely in Iowa, where Mr. Cruz hopes to become the first Republican to win the first-in-the-nation caucuses without supporting the ethanol mandate. Determined to prevent that outcome, ethanol producers have mounted a seven-figure campaign to press Mr. Cruz and other candidates on the issue.The group has attacked Mr. Cruz repeatedly, claiming that the Texas senator is currying favor with oil producers in his state and that he has changed his stance on the mandate. (Mr. Cruz once supported a bill that would have immediately ended the ethanol standard; he more recently introduced a bill that would phase it out over five years.)Mr. Cruz faced at least a dozen questions on ethanol from residents during his recent trip, but appeared largely unruffled.

Enough is enough!\u201d Nathan Arentsen, 29, cheered at another event in Des Moines, stamping his feet emphatically.On Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton even mocked Mr. Sanders at one point, imitating his defense for supporting a bill shielding gun manufacturers and dealers from liability. \u201cHe says, \u2018Well, I\u2019m from Vermont,\u2019 \u201d Mrs. Clinton noted before saying that home-state concerns were not a sufficient explanation.She is also trying to tap into the popularity of President Obama by embracing his record, and she is dispatching former President Bill Clinton here on Friday for the second time in two weeks \u2014 after insisting for months that she was not running for a third term for either man.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.An event Monday in Waterloo underscored Mrs. Clinton\u2019s challenge: About 300 people welcomed her enthusiastically and listened to her diligently, but many of them, still unsure, rebuffed Clinton aides trying to get them to sign \u201ccommitment cards\u201d to caucus for her.\u201cI personally want to find out if she\u2019s trustworthy or not,\u201d said Katie Bailey, 71, of Cedar Falls. \u201cThere\u2019s so much untrust. I want to eyeball her.\u201dMatt Fagerlind, 36, also attended the Clinton event, but found himself thinking about how Mr. Sanders\u2019s rallies had the same uplifting emotional intensity as Barack Obama\u2019s in 2008. \u201cI think Sanders is going to give her a good run,\u201d he said, describing himself as unmoved by Mrs. Clinton and planning to vote for Mr. Sanders.(Ultimately, a Clinton aide said, about half of the audience signed commitment cards.)A Sanders victory in Iowa would be a shock, given the institutional advantages held by Mrs. Clinton, a former secretary of state and a favorite of the Iowa Democratic establishment. It would also set off significant momentum for Mr. Sanders heading into the Feb. 9 primary in New Hampshire, where he holds a slight lead in the polls.Several of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the race candidly, said that they were anxious but not panicking about Iowa and that they believed she would still deliver a victory here.Still, some advisers said they were torn about whether the campaign would ultimately regret purposely holding small events in Iowa \u2014 a strategy Mrs. Clinton preferred \u2014 given Mr. Sanders\u2019s ability to continue to turn out and energize crowds, which they had not anticipated.Some members of her Iowa team, however, said they were confident that passion for Mrs. Clinton was intensifying.\u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s growing closer to caucus day,\u201d said Kane Miller, the Clinton campaign\u2019s organizing director for Polk County, which includes Des Moines. \u201cThis previous weekend was negative degrees, and 80 percent of people confirmed to volunteer were out knocking on doors. That\u2019s a great measure of enthusiasm.\u201dBoth Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton garnered applause on Monday night at the Brown and Black Forum at Drake University here, though the crowd seemed more delighted with Mr. Sanders as he denounced a 51 percent unemployment rate for black men with a high school education and joked that he would consider living in the White House to be public housing.The warmth for Mr. Sanders was notable because of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s historical popularity among minority voters, particularly African-Americans. She drew cheers for saying she would not use the term \u201cillegal immigrant\u201d and for pledging to help Central American countries stem the violence that people there flee.A poll published on Tuesday, by Quinnipiac University, found that Mr. Sanders had jumped to a lead in Iowa, with 49 percent to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 44 percent, after trailing her by 11 points in mid-December. The Quinnipiac poll also found that liberal Iowans were the most enthusiastic about the election, and that Mr.Sanders was the favorite among these voters. A New York Times/CBS News poll released on Tuesday showed Mrs. Clinton\u2019s once formidable lead shrinking from 20 points a month ago to seven points.The tightened race is revealing a sharp generational divide within the Democratic Party, with primary voters under age 45 favoring Mr. Sanders by a roughly 2-to-1 ratio.The Clinton campaign still has significant structural advantages in Iowa to help turn out caucus voters. The state\u2019s most popular Democrats have endorsed Mrs. Clinton, including former Senator Tom Harkin and former Gov. Tom Vilsack, helping her leverage their political networks. She also has endorsements from unions and groups like the Planned Parenthood Action Fund.Advisers for Mrs. Clinton say they have strong organizations in the most populous counties and have compiled data on tens of thousands of Democrats, many of whom who are receiving phone calls or visits from teams of volunteers who crowd field offices like Mr. Miller\u2019s. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, Robby Mook, is also a veteran of caucus contests, while strategists like Joel Benenson were part of Mr. Obama\u2019s campaign in 2008.Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters point to his grass-roots strengths: He has more than 14,000 volunteers in Iowa, and he has spoken to more than 40,000 people at events in the state so far, huge numbers that include young people, independents and new voters who might not be on pollsters\u2019 call sheets. (Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers declined to say how many volunteers she had or people she had spoken to in Iowa.)\u201cI think his secret weapon, maybe his silver bullet even, is the young adult population that hasn\u2019t been involved in politics up until this point,\u201d said Katie Mitchell, 28, a middle school teacher who lives in Des Moines.\u201cBernie Sanders feels new, and Hillary seems like a Washington insider,\u201d said Laura Cornell, 17, who was encouraged by friends to hear Ms. Dunham\u2019s pitch but remained committed to Mr. Sanders.Many of the Sanders supporters interviewed said they felt personally moved by what they described as his sincerity. Bert Permar, 86, a retired professor, said he had gone to four Sanders events and was now making calls to share the candidate\u2019s message.\u201cI love to see him. He motivates me,\u201d Mr. Permar said on Sunday, sitting in the front row at a Sanders forum on veterans\u2019 issues in Marshalltown. \u201cI get emotional. It brings tears that someone is talking about the issues that we should be concerned about.\u201dAlan Rappeport contributed reporting from Waterloo, Iowa.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wounded Warrior Project Spends Lavishly on Itself, Insiders Say", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Supported byJACKSONVILLE, Fla. \u2014 In 2014, after 10 years of rapid growth, the Wounded Warrior Project flew its roughly 500 employees to Colorado Springs for an \u201call hands\u201d meeting at the five-star Broadmoor hotel.They were celebrating their biggest year yet: $225 million raised and a work force that had nearly doubled. On the opening night, before three days of strategy sessions and team-building field trips, the staff gathered in the hotel courtyard. Suddenly, a spotlight focused on a 10-story bell tower where the chief executive, Steven Nardizzi, stepped off the edge and rappelled toward the cheering crowd.Since its inception in 2003 as a basement operation handing out backpacks to wounded veterans, the charity has evolved into a fund-raising giant, taking in more than $372 million in 2015 \u2014 largely through small donations from people over 65.Today, the charity has 22 locations offering programs to help veterans readjust to society, attend school, find work and participate in athletics. It contributes millions to smaller veterans groups. And it has become a brand name, its logo emblazoned on sneakers, paper towel packs and television commercials that run dozens of times.But in its swift rise, it has also embraced aggressive styles of fund-raising, marketing and personnel management that have many current and former employees questioning whether it has drifted from its mission.It has spent millions a year on travel, dinners, hotels and conferences that often seemed more lavish than appropriate, more than four dozen current and former employees said in interviews. Former workers recounted buying business-class seats and regularly jetting around the country for minor meetings, or staying in $500-per-night hotel rooms.The organization has also spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in recent years on public relations and lobbying campaigns to deflect criticism of its spending and to fight legislative efforts to restrict how much nonprofits spend on overhead.Some of its own employees have criticized it, too. William Chick, a former supervisor, spent five years with the Wounded Warrior Project. \u201cIt slowly had less focus on veterans and more on raising money and protecting the organization,\u201d he said.Mr. Chick, who was fired in 2012 after a dispute with his supervisor, said he saw the Wounded Warrior Project help hundreds of veterans. But like other former employees, he said the group swiftly fired anyone leaders considered a \u201cbad cultural fit.\u201dEighteen former employees \u2014 many of them wounded veterans themselves \u2014 said they had been fired for seemingly minor missteps or perceived insubordination. At least half a dozen former employees said they were let go after raising questions about ineffective programs or spending.A spokeswoman for the charity said it fired those people because of poor performance or ethical breaches, and that each of them was given the opportunity to address their work problems.\u201cSometimes employees make poor choices that can\u2019t be overlooked,\u201d Ms. Tezel said. \u201cAnd sometimes those employees are veterans.\u201dA For-Profit ModelVeterans organizations in the United States often reflect the era in which they were created: After World War I, they resembled fraternal orders. After Vietnam, many focused on advocacy in Washington.The Wounded Warrior Project cuts a different profile. Under Mr. Nardizzi\u2019s direction, it has modeled itself on for-profit corporations, with a focus on data, scalable products, quarterly numbers and branding.In an interview at the organization\u2019s four-story headquarters in a palm-lined office park in Jacksonville, Fla., Mr. Nardizzi, 45, said spending on fund-raising and other expenses not directly related to veterans programs has enabled the Wounded Warrior Project to grow faster and serve more people. It estimates that 80,000 veterans have used its services.\u201cI look at companies like Starbucks \u2014 that\u2019s the model,\u201d Mr. Nardizzi said. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at companies that are getting it right, treating their employees right, delivering great services and great products, then are growing the brand to support all of that.\u201dSuch ambitious programs would be impossible without significant spending on fund-raising and staff, said Mr. Nardizzi, who has become a vocal advocate of the idea that charities should be able to spend what they want on travel, fund-raising and executive salaries.\u201cHow many others are not scaling up to cure cancer, to help the environment, because there is a belief we shouldn\u2019t invest in those things?\u201d said Mr. Nardizzi, who was given $473,000 in compensation in 2014.The Wounded Warrior Project\u2019s roots are more humble. Its founder, John Melia, was a Marine veteran who had been injured in a helicopter crash off the coast of Somalia in 1992. When wounded troops began returning from Iraq in 2003, Mr. Melia remembered how he had arrived in a stateside hospital with only his thin hospital gown, and began visiting military hospitals to distribute backpacks stuffed with socks, CD players, toothpaste and other items.As the backpack project grew, Mr. Melia hired a few employees, including Mr. Nardizzi, a lawyer who had never served in the military but was an executive for a small nonprofit, the United Spinal Association, which served disabled veterans.They began raising millions of dollars and broadening their services to include adaptive sports for disabled veterans, employment and benefits help, and retreats to teach veterans to cope with post-traumatic stress disorder.By 2009, the group had grown to about 50 employees and $21 million in revenue. But by then, Mr. Melia and Mr. Nardizzi were fighting over the charity\u2019s future, with Mr. Nardizzi pushing for more aggressive expansion than Mr. Melia, former employees said.In January 2009, Mr. Melia resigned.Mr. Nardizzi said in an interview that Mr. Melia left to pursue business ventures. But Mr. Melia\u2019s ex-wife, Julie Melia, who worked at the charity at the time, said in an interview that her former husband felt like the organization was \u201cstolen from him.\u201d\u201cHe didn\u2019t want to leave, but it was obvious something was going to happen,\u201d Ms. Melia said.The organization paid Mr. Melia at least $230,000 after he stepped down, according to tax forms. He has never spoken publicly about his disagreements with Mr. Nardizzi, and declined to be interviewed.Today, on a list of 27 founders that was created by the charity\u2019s current leadership and handed out to all new employees, Mr. Melia\u2019s name appears well below the name of the charity\u2019s for-profit fund-raising consultant.Rising in a DownturnWhen Mr. Nardizzi took over, in the depths of the 2009 economic downturn, most charities had dialed back their fund-raising efforts, figuring that the nation was in no position to give.Mr. Nardizzi doubled his spending on fund-raising and has increased it an average of 66 percent every year since. The Wounded Warrior Project spent more than $34 million on fund-raising in 2014, according to tax records.The organization began producing inspirational ads featuring wounded veterans fighting to recover.\u201cThe secret sauce was the brand, and the mission,\u201d said Dave Ward, a vice president who left in 2015. \u201cWe put warriors on a pedestal and the nation wrapped its arms around that concept.\u201dBut as donations poured in, many former employees say the group became wasteful.\u201cPeople could spend money on the most ridiculous thing and no one batted an eye,\u201d said Connie Chapman, who was in charge of the charity\u2019s Seattle office for two years. \u201cI would fly to New York for less than a day to report to my supervisor.\u201dAll staff members flying to the charity\u2019s office at a military hospital in Germany traveled in business class, employees said. One current employee said her last-minute ticket cost $7,000.Mr. Nardizzi fired Ms. Chapman, an Iraq veteran with PTSD, in 2012 as part of a \u201cmanagement restructuring,\u201d she said.By 2014, the group was spending $7.5 million per year on travel, according to tax forms.The Wounded Warrior Project asserts that it spends 80 percent of donations on programs, but former employees and charity watchdogs say the charity inflates its number by using practices such as counting some marketing materials as educational.In 2014, the Wounded Warrior Project lobbied in California and Florida to fight proposals that would have required nonprofits to increase financial transparency. Both bills passed in amended forms that did not significantly affect the charity, Mr. Nardizzi said.Also around that time, the group hired the global public relations firm Edelman, which has represented Starbucks, Walmart, Shell and Philip Morris, to improve public perception of the charity and its overhead spending.Former employees said they questioned the charity\u2019s focus on money and marketing techniques. Erick Millette, an Iraq veteran, said he quit after growing disillusioned about his work with a program called Warrior Speak, which involved veterans\u2019 telling their stories of healing to audiences. The veterans collected donations at those events.\u201cI wasn\u2019t speaking anywhere unless I was collecting a check,\u201d said Mr. Millette, who worked for the program for about two years, until he left in 2014.Mr. Millette said the charity encouraged him to highlight its role in helping him recover from PTSD and traumatic brain injury. \u201cThey wanted me to say W.W.P. saved my life,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, they didn\u2019t. They just took me to a Red Sox game and on a weekend retreat.\u201dA Focus on MetricsAs donations increased, Wounded Warrior Project executives began using data to measure staff productivity. The metrics were intended to improve efficiency and help fund-raising. But some employees assert that the productivity goals were set so high that they eroded program quality.The Warriors to Work program, for instance, was intended to provide one-on-one counseling to develop r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and interview skills, then place veterans in suitable jobs.But executives quadrupled the number of job placements the program was expected to make each year, reducing the amount of time specialists had to find good ones, said Dan Lessard, who ran the program for about two years. He was fired in 2014 for what executives told him was insubordination.\u201cThey would just come up with numbers based on nothing,\u201d Mr. Lessard said. \u201cI would push back and they would get very frustrated and yell. By the time I left, we were just throwing guys in jobs to check off a box and hit the numbers.\u201dThe same push for numbers hit a program that brings wounded veterans together for social events. Former staff members said they had less time to develop therapeutic programs and so relied on giving veterans tickets to concerts and sporting events. To fill seats, they often invited the same veterans.\u201cIf the same warrior attends six different events, you could record that as six warriors served,\u201d said Renee Humphrey, who oversaw alumni outreach in Southern California for about four years. \u201cYou had the same few guys who loved going to free events.\u201dMs. Humphrey, an Iraq veteran with PTSD, was fired in 2013. Her termination was so abrupt that her work phone and credit card were shut off while she was leading an event.Mr. Nardizzi said his staff was constantly monitoring metrics to try to get the most out of every dollar donated. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard balance, but I think we strike the right balance,\u201d he said.He said that the organization regularly followed up with veterans who receive Wounded Warrior Project services and that the vast majority reported having good experiences.Multiple TerminationsPart of the organization\u2019s drive for growth has been a tough stance toward workers considered unproductive or disloyal.After Jesse Longoria recovered from a roadside bomb blast that nearly killed him in Iraq, he got a job with the organization training veterans to help other veterans.\u201cI loved it,\u201d the former Marine sniper said. \u201cBy giving back, I was helping myself and helping other vets.\u201dIn 2012, after he had been working for the charity about a year, he had to have his right arm amputated because of lingering damage from Iraq.Soon after the amputation, he said, he was racked by haunting emotions from Iraq and checked himself into suicide watch at a psychiatric ward.A week later, he was back at work when a fistfight broke out between veteran mentors who had been drinking after one of his training sessions. He was not in the room at the time but was held responsible for the fight, his boss at the time, Mr. Chick, said in an interview.Mr. Chick\u2019s own supervisor told him to fire Mr. Longoria. Mr. Chick said he refused, but was ordered by his boss to write an email recommending the firing. \u201cHe said you better do this or you are going to look disloyal to the organization,\u201d Mr. Chick said. \u201cIt was a very coercive conversation.\u201dThe Wounded Warrior Project said Mr. Longoria was terminated at Mr. Chick\u2019s recommendation. The organization fired Mr. Chick later the same day for insubordination.Mr. Longoria said he was offered money in exchange for signing a nondisclosure agreement, but refused. Other former employees said they had signed such forms, and could not speak.Mr. Longoria said after he was fired, he fell into depression but was also relieved. He said he felt guilty about what he saw as widespread waste.Once a child came by the office to donate a piggy bank. Another time a woman called to donate part of her son\u2019s life insurance after he was killed in Afghanistan, he said.\u201cIt got under my skin, started eating at me,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew where the money was going to. It seemed to me like it was a big lie.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the year in which Jesse Longoria, a former Marine sniper, had his right arm amputated. It was 2012, not 2011.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Anxieties of Impotence", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "Supported byAs Orwell walked, gun in hand, toward the elephant, a crowd of over 2,000 Burmese gathered behind him. They hated him, but it would be a diverting spectacle to see an elephant shot and they could use the meat. Orwell didn\u2019t want to shoot the poor creature, whose \u201cmust,\u201d or frenzied state, had passed and who was peacefully eating grass. But he felt the pressure of the crowd behind him. They\u2019d laugh at him if he didn\u2019t kill the thing.\u201cI was only an absurd puppet pushed to and fro by the will of those yellow faces behind,\u201d Orwell wrote. And so he subjected the animal to a long and agonizing death.In his essay nobody feels like they have any power. The locals, the imperial victims, sure didn\u2019t. Orwell, the guy with the gun, didn\u2019t feel like he had any. The imperialists back in London were too far away.That\u2019s sort of the way much of the world is today. As Anand Giridharadas writes in The International New York Times, \u201cIf anything unites America in this fractious moment it is a widespread sentiment that power is somewhere other than where you are.\u201dThese days people seem to underestimate their own power or suffer from what Giridharadas calls the \u201canxiety of impotence.\u201dSometimes when groups feel oppressed, they organize by coming up with concrete reform proposals to empower themselves. The Black Lives Matter movement is doing this.But in other cases the feeling of absolute powerlessness can corrupt absolutely. As psychological research has shown, many people who feel powerless come to feel unworthy, and become complicit in their own oppression. Some exaggerate the weight and size of the obstacles in front of them. Some feel dehumanized, forsaken, doomed and guilty.Today we live in a world of isolation and atomization, where people distrust their own institutions. In such circumstances many people respond to powerlessness with pointless acts of self-destruction.In the Palestinian territories, for example, young people don\u2019t organize or work with their government to improve their prospects. They wander into Israel, try to stab a soldier or a pregnant woman and get shot or arrested \u2014 every single time. They throw away their lives for a pointless and usually botched moment of terrorism.In a different way, the American election has been perverted by feelings of powerlessness.Americans are beset by complex, intractable problems that don\u2019t have a clear villain: technological change displaces workers; globalization and the rapid movement of people destabilize communities; family structure dissolves; the political order in the Middle East teeters, the Chinese economy craters, inequality rises, the global order frays, etc.To address these problems we need big, responsible institutions (power centers) that can mobilize people, cobble together governing majorities and enact plans of actions. In the U.S. context that means functioning political parties and a functioning Congress.Those institutions have been weakened of late. Parties have been rendered weak by both campaign finance laws and the Citizens United decision, which have cut off their funding streams and given power to polarized super-donors who work outside the party system. Congress has been weakened by polarization and disruptive members who don\u2019t believe in legislating.Instead of shoring up these institutions, many voters are inclined to make everything worse. Plagued by the anxiety of impotence many voters are drawn to leaders who pretend that our problems could be solved by defeating some villain. Donald Trump says stupid elites are the problem. Ted Cruz says it\u2019s the Washington cartel. Bernie Sanders says it\u2019s Wall Street.The fact is, for all the problems we may have with Wall Street or Washington, our biggest problems are systemic \u2014 the disruptions caused by technological progress and globalization, mass migration, family breakdown and so on. There\u2019s no all-controlling Wizard of Oz to slay.If we\u2019re to have any hope of addressing big systemic problems we\u2019ll have to repair big institutions and have functioning parties and a functioning Congress. We have to discard the anti-political, anti-institutional mood that is prevalent and rebuild effective democratic power centers.This requires less atomization and more collective action, fewer strongmen but greater citizenship. It requires the craft of political architecture, not the demagogy of destruction.Advertisement"}

Its latest concern is that the Polish and Greek governments may be flouting the rule of law.The flood of refugees, the risk that Britain may quit the European Union, and the euro crisis are bad enough.

What\u2019s more, if people can\u2019t rely on the rule of law, it is bad for investment.The Polish situation has garnered the most headlines. Last week, the European Commission started a preliminary assessment of whether Poland\u2019s new right-wing nationalist government was complying with the rule of law.This was partly because the government passed a law in December requiring the country\u2019s constitutional court to secure a two-thirds majority for most of its rulings, rather than a simple majority. Critics said this neutered the court as a check on government power.Then, this month, the government in Warsaw pushed through a law giving it the power to appoint the heads of state-run broadcasters. The next day it parachuted in a former member of Parliament from the governing party to run state television.Poland seems to be following a playbook pioneered by Hungary, whose nationalist government reduced the power of its top court and undermined the independence of its central bank earlier in the decade. Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister, said last week that he would block any proposed European Union sanctions against Poland.The European Union is founded on a series of principles that include democracy and the rule of law. When a country flouts these values, the Union can, as a last resort, remove that government\u2019s right to vote on Union matters.Although the European Commission has only started a preliminary investigation, this has already provoked a war of words. One Polish minister compared European Union \u201csupervision\u201d to the Nazi occupation in World War II.Investors have reacted badly. The zloty fell to a four-year low against the euro on Friday after Standard & Poor\u2019s cut the country\u2019s credit rating, saying the government had weakened the independence of major institutions.Now look at Greece. The chief executive of Piraeus Bank, the country\u2019s largest lender, resigned on Friday after rumors circulated that the government, led by the leftist Syriza party, was putting pressure on him to quit via the head of the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund, the vehicle that receives bailout money and injects it into Greece\u2019s banks. Piraeus\u2019s shares fell 22 percent in two days.When these rumors started circulating, Paulson & Co., a hedge fund that owns more than 9 percent of Piraeus, wrote to the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund to complain. It said it had invested in the bank in last month\u2019s share issue on the understanding that Anthimos Thomopoulos, whom it rated as \u201chighly capable,\u201d would remain as chief executive. John Paulson, the hedge fund\u2019s founder and manager, argued that the stability fund would not have the authority to request the chief executive\u2019s resignation and that, if it had delivered such a request on behalf of the government, it \u201cwould clearly have been in violation of the laws governing the HFSF and, in particular, safeguarding its independence from political interference.\u201dThe stability fund put out a statement on Thursday denying that it had made any such request. Later that day, the Eurogroup \u2014 the group of eurozone finance ministers \u2014 made clear that it wanted Greece to depoliticize its banks and public administration. Despite this, Mr. Thomopoulos resigned the following day.Given that the eurozone has lent Athens vast sums of money (some of it to recapitalize Piraeus Bank) and the European Central Bank is now Piraeus Bank\u2019s supervisor, there is a need to get to the bottom of what happened.There are also other worrying signs that the government of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras may be flouting the rule of law. Last year, it fired the head of the supposedly independent tax authority. It also passed a law giving the government more control over television broadcasting.Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who was elected leader of the opposition this month, said there had been an attempt \u201cto control the justice system, to tamper with independent authorities, to stuff the state with friends and family, and to roll back reforms in education.\u201dWhen Mr. Tsipras fired the tax boss, Greece\u2019s eurozone creditors barely murmured, despite the fact that tax evasion is one of the country\u2019s biggest problems. The European Commission seemingly didn\u2019t want to be too harsh on the government because it wanted to believe that its latest bailout plan, of 86 billion euros, or $94 billion, was working.But respect for the rule of law is probably even more important for Greece\u2019s economic future than balancing budgets and freeing up markets. It is also important for Poland\u2019s economy.The European Union is in a quandary over how to respond. It doesn\u2019t want to pick more quarrels when it is already fighting battles on multiple fronts. But if it turns a blind eye, bad behavior could spread.Advertisement"}

This time, though, it is from an upstart hedge fund, demanding two board seats and a potential sale of the company.Lion Point Capital, co-founded in 2014 by the former portfolio managers from Elliott Management and Perry Capital, has proposed two director candidates, whose names were not released, to stand for election at the company\u2019s annual meeting on May 3. The hedge fund also sent a letter on Dec. 23, urging Ally to create a strategic alternatives committee, a step that can often result in the sale of a company.Ally, which has objected to the activist investors\u2019 tactics, said it considered Lion Point\u2019s proposals but concluded that selling the company would not be in the best interest of all shareholders. The board will evaluate Lion Point\u2019s nominations and said it would express its views to investors in \u201cdue course.\u201d Ally, once known as the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, or GMAC, also noted that the hedge fund held less than a 1 percent stake in the company.\u201cAlthough we are troubled by Lion Point\u2019s tactics, our fundamental disagreement is with Lion Point\u2019s clear agenda to force a sale of Ally,\u201d Franklin W.

Then, the firm sent a letter with its demands in late December, requesting a positive response to the demands in less than two weeks. If the deadline was not met, Lion Point said it would nominate directors, according to the statement.Several committees and Ally\u2019s board met after Christmas to discuss these proposals and representatives had additional discussions with Lion Point, ultimately opposing the idea of a sale.Lion Point did not immediately respond for requests for comment on Monday.With less than a 1 percent stake, Lion Point would need to rally support from Ally\u2019s current shareholders to push through its recommendations. Cerberus Capital Management is Ally\u2019s largest investor, with an 8.6 percent stake, according to data compiled by S&P Capital IQ, a financial information provider.

{"Headline": "Ex-Suffolk County Police Chief\u2019s Arrest Comes Amid a Broader Federal Inquiry", "Date": "2016-01-03", "News": "Supported byEven today the crime is remembered, with a shudder, across Long Island.The prosecution\u2019s key witnesses included a teenager named James Burke, whose testimony against his neighborhood friends helped send them to prison.The murder happened in 1979, and the case began Mr. Burke\u2019s involvement with law enforcement. He grew up to become a police officer and, later, the top investigator in the Suffolk County district attorney\u2019s office. Eventually, he was named chief of the county police, a department of 2,300 officers, where he cut a swaggering, backslapping figure: a gregarious lawman with a bushy mustache that seemed in constant danger from the cigars he smoked.The case is explosive, not just for its tabloid-ready details, but because it comes at the same time as a broader federal investigation of the Suffolk County political machine and its hold over the local criminal justice system.Mr. Spota kept in touch with Mr. Burke, and after he was elected district attorney, hired him as his top investigator and eventually helped him become the county police chief in 2012. The scope of the federal investigation could mean Mr. Spota\u2019s long alliance with Mr. Burke will come back to haunt him.Wielding Outsize PowerFor federal investigators, an outline is beginning to emerge of a police department and a district attorney\u2019s office that have worked together to consolidate the power of Mr. Burke and Mr. Spota, and have relied on questionable surveillance methods to keep tabs on enemies real and imagined.No charges have been filed against Mr. Spota or his staff, and the Justice Department has not made public the nature of the investigation or whether it has found evidence of any crime.Interviews with people who have been questioned by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents, or who are cooperating with their inquiry, suggest it is turning into an examination of the police and prosecutor\u2019s outsize, unchecked power in their domain, the eastern half of Long Island, where glaring poverty and fantastic riches exist side by side. Federal investigators appear to be pursuing leads that broadly explore questions of influence and corruption in the criminal justice system. One avenue of inquiry has led agents to seek evidence about whether judgeships are for sale in Suffolk County, according to two people with knowledge of the inquiries.The United States attorney\u2019s office in Brooklyn, which is overseeing the investigation, has also taken a dim view of some of the surveillance practices employed by the Suffolk County district attorney\u2019s office.Mr. Spota has denied any knowledge of the episode involving the tracking device. Mr. Miskiewicz called the event \u201csomething out of the K.G.B.\u201dCentral to the political order is the district attorney, Mr. Spota. In the past year, Justice Department officials have met with county employees, politicians and former police officers who have said that Suffolk County investigations and prosecutions \u2014 as well as decisions not to prosecute \u2014 are often swayed by political considerations, according to interviews with more than five people who have spoken to F.B.I. agents or prosecutors.In one 2011 incident, the county\u2019s top elected official, Steve Levy, announced he would not seek re-election as part of a deal with Mr. Spota to resolve a campaign finance investigation. The details of any possible wrongdoing by Mr. Levy remain a mystery.That cleared the stage for Mr. Burke\u2019s rise. When Mr. Levy\u2019s successor as Suffolk County executive, Steve Bellone, was elected, Mr. Spota recommended Mr. Burke, then working for the district attorney, for the police chief\u2019s job, county officials said. Although Mr. Burke would technically be subordinate to a civilian police commissioner, it was clear who was in charge.No Friend of the F.B.I.Such an episode would have been a career-ender for most officers. But Mr. Burke \u2014 an aggressive young officer whom other officers, part admiringly and part mockingly, called Starsky after a member of the crime-fighting team in a 1970s television show \u2014 survived unscathed. Not much later, Mr. Burke was named his precinct\u2019s officer of the year.As police chief, Mr. Burke had a tendency to divide the world into good guys and enemies, with good-guy status going only to those in his circle.\u201cTo me, there is no better barometer of a person\u2019s integrity than to wind up at the top of Burke\u2019s enemy list,\u201d a former Suffolk County police commander, Patrick Cuff, said in a recent telephone interview. \u201cI know I\u2019m somewhere on it.\u201dWhen Mr. Burke took charge of the Suffolk County Police Department, he demoted Mr. Cuff to captain from assistant chief, a move apparently driven by ancient animosity between the two men. When Mr. Cuff later retired, Mr. Burke texted several subordinates with an unusual request.\u201cWe need a friendly to go to Cuffs retirement party to take accurate attendance,\u201d Mr. Burke wrote in a message obtained by federal prosecutors. \u201cWhoever goes has to be able to recognize faces. Enemies, bosses active and retired and politicians.\u201dHigh on the enemies list, apparently, was the F.B.I. Mr. Burke pulled most of his detectives off federal task forces in 2012, an order that came through while one of those being recalled was in the middle of taking a murder confession. Back with their old squads, the detectives found themselves out of favor. One, a respected gang investigator, John Oliva, came under suspicion of leaking information to a Newsday reporter. In an extreme step, the district attorney\u2019s office began to wiretap Detective Oliva, two former law enforcement officials said.The wiretap intercepted countless conversations in which the detective spoke with F.B.I. agents and prosecutors about some of the investigations he had been pulled from. Required to provide notification, Mr. Spota\u2019s top prosecutors went to the United States attorney in Brooklyn, Loretta E. Lynch, who is now the United States attorney general, to explain that they had overheard Justice Department officials talking.The conversation went poorly, according to three people who have heard about it from Justice Department officials. These people said the county prosecutors had been unapologetic, even as it emerged that they had listened in on conversations that had little to do with the leak investigation. Moreover, the prosecutors appeared to have failed to shut down the wiretap during conversations that had nothing to do with any suspected criminal activity, as is typically required.Mr. Spota, in a statement sent by email, said his office complied with the relevant rules and restrictions on wiretaps at all times.But one person familiar with the episode said Ms. Lynch was \u201cnot happy that these Suffolk prosectors are listening into federal agents talking about federal cases.\u201d This person said the episode had raised suspicions about whether the wiretap was mainly being used to learn what detectives were saying privately about Mr. Burke and to discover whether federal agents were having any success building a case against him.Interrogation RampageIf anything, this person said, the meeting with state prosecutors lent a new urgency to an existing, but faltering, federal investigation into Mr. Burke. That inquiry, opened in April 2013, had examined whether Mr. Burke violated the civil rights of Christopher Loeb, a heroin addict who financed his $100-a-day habit by breaking into cars.It was Mr. Loeb\u2019s bad luck \u2014 and, ultimately, Mr. Burke\u2019s even worse luck \u2014 that Mr. Loeb spotted a black duffel bag in a GMC Yukon that belonged to Mr. Burke.The duffel bag contained cigars and the chief\u2019s gun belt, as well as pornographic DVDs and sex toys, federal prosecutors said.Mr. Loeb was arrested, brought to the precinct and shackled to the floor of an interrogation room.When he asked for a lawyer, one detective told him, \u201cThis isn\u2019t \u2018Law & Order\u2019; you\u2019re not going to get an attorney,\u201d Mr. Loeb\u2019s testimony in a 2013 state court hearing showed.At some point, the chief interrupted the interrogation.\u201cChief Burke grabbed me by my cheeks and hit me on the top of my head,\u201d Mr. Loeb, who was sentenced to prison for up to three years, testified. Mr. Loeb responded by calling Mr. Burke \u201ca pervert\u201d and berating him for the pornography, federal prosecutors said, adding that Mr. Burke \u201cwent out of control, screaming and cursing at Loeb and assaulting him until a detective finally said, \u2018Boss, that\u2019s enough, that\u2019s enough.\u2019\u201dIn federal court last month, prosecutors claimed to have a strong hand, saying they had secured testimony from 10 police officers against Mr. Burke. In an unexpected development, a judge agreed with prosecutors that Mr. Burke, despite retiring in the fall, posed a danger to the community and ordered that he be denied bail.The prosecution seemed to be trying to isolate Mr. Burke, a tactic often intended to pressure defendants into cooperating with a federal investigation.Mr. Burke has entered a not guilty plea, and his lawyer, Joseph R. Conway, said Mr. Burke was not cooperating with the Justice Department.Still, the possibility that he might try to strike a deal is a main topic of speculation among Suffolk County politicians these days. And many remember how Mr. Burke got his start in public life: as a witness in a sensational case.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified the location of Smithtown, N.Y., where James Burke lives. It is on the North Shore of Long Island, not on the East End.Because of an editing error, an article on Monday about James Burke, the former police chief of Suffolk County, N.Y., who is being held in jail on charges of violating a thief\u2019s civil rights, referred incompletely in some copies to the area that Mr. Burke oversaw as police chief.

Today, Fairfield has about 60,000 residents, town officials said.G.E.\u2019s top executives and their staffs, about 200 people who live in Fairfield and surrounding towns, will move to Boston, a company spokeswoman said.

The company is also selling its remaining offices at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York, on the 52nd and 53rd floors, to offset the costs of the move.Residents and local leaders expressed unease about losing tax revenue and a number of high-paying jobs.G.E. has said that many of the 600 employees not moving to Boston will remain in Connecticut, moving to offices in Norwalk. The company has about 5,000 employees in Connecticut, with offices in Danbury, Norwalk, Plainville, Stamford and Windsor, according to Jennifer Erickson, the company spokeswoman.Ms. Erickson did not respond directly when asked how many jobs will remain in Connecticut. \u201cThe decision regarding the headquarters location is independent of any work restructurings,\u201d she said.G.E.\u2019s move will mean lost revenue for state and local coffers. The company is Fairfield\u2019s largest property-tax payer, with its bills varying from $1.6 million to $1.8 million in recent years. The state will also lose income-tax revenue from the company\u2019s highest earners.But the company\u2019s departure brings less tangible losses, too.

What seems like a permanent revolution among Twitter\u2019s senior ranks hasn\u2019t done any favors for the $12 billion media business. With the stock trading below its initial public offering price and Mr. Dorsey a part-time chief executive who also runs the payments company Square, the danger is that the company becomes aimless.The departing leaders include the head of product, of which there have been at least five since 2010, including a stint by Mr. Dorsey. His reinsertion as chief executive last year was the most prominent turn of the revolving door. He had led the company when it was a start-up, but wasn\u2019t an obvious choice to return because running a troubled yet fast-growing public company would normally be a full-time job. As well as bringing Mr. Dorsey back, Twitter has replaced its finance boss, chief operating officer and head of engineering since the company filed to go public in the summer of 2013.Revenue at the microblogging company is growing fast, increasing more than 50 percent annually. Yet the company is in the red, losing $430 million in the first nine months of last year. Adding more users may solve this problem, which is why Twitter spends heavily to develop new products. But the constant churn at the top must make it hard for the company\u2019s engineers to plan what they are doing.Add Twitter\u2019s market meltdown \u2014 the company\u2019s stock now trades about a third below where it went public in 2013 \u2014 and Mr. Dorsey\u2019s creation looks vulnerable. Moreover, unlike at many tech businesses, there\u2019s no dominant or super-voting shareholder able to block takeover attempts. Google, Facebook or a more traditional media company could perhaps be tempted to buy Twitter.That might be a better outcome than a fate like Yahoo\u2019s. The company squandered its moment in the sun and ended up struggling with its core businesses and looking for new ideas under a series of chief executives, the latest being Marissa Mayer. Twitter has not reached that point yet, but the possibility should focus Mr. Dorsey\u2019s mind on the need for greater stability.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Poll Was Conducted", "Date": "2016-01-05", "News": "Supported byPublic HealthQuestionnaires were administered online and by telephone in English and Spanish. There was a longer questionnaire for 1,204 respondents who reported problems paying household medical bills in the previous 12 months, and a shorter one for 1,371 respondents who did not report such problems.The Times and Kaiser contributed financing for the survey, and teams from both organizations worked together to develop the questionnaire and analyze the data. Each organization is solely responsible for its own interpretation and conclusions.A total of 1,956 panel members with Internet access completed the survey online; an additional 619 members without access were interviewed by telephone.For purposes of analysis, respondents who reported problems paying medical bills and respondents who reported no such problems were sampled at different rates. (Those with no problems were undersampled.) The two groups were then weighted to their proper proportion of the population.The combined results have been weighted to adjust for variation in the sample of the United States population ages 18 to 64 relating to geographic region, gender, race/ethnicity, age, education and household income.In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, overall results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking to interview all adults from this population. This margin of sampling error takes into account that weighting procedures increase its size slightly.For smaller subgroups, the margin of sampling error is larger. For example, it is plus or minus four points for both the group with problems paying medical bills and the group reporting no such problems.In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of the public may introduce other sources of error. Variation in the wording, order and translation of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republican Candidates Grapple With a Touchy Topic: Poverty", "Date": "2016-01-12", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneNot even Democrats, who by Republicans\u2019 own admission pretty much own the subject, have dedicated this kind of campaign time to those at the very bottom of the ladder. The votes simply aren\u2019t there. And that\u2019s especially true for Republicans.What\u2019s going on? Those on the left will argue that Republicans offer nothing more than a poison pill to pre-empt effective actions to help the poor. But conservatives have a coherent theory about the causes of America\u2019s entrenched poverty that fits well with their underlying worldview: it\u2019s largely the government\u2019s fault.The War on Poverty, started by President Lyndon B. Johnson half a century ago, failed to end it, they say, even after spending trillions of dollars. Moreover, welfare weakened the poor\u2019s moral spine. It sapped their self-reliance, undermined their belief in family. The fear of losing benefits entangled the poor in a web of dependency, deterring them from seeking jobs.Moderated by House Speaker Paul Ryan, who has made poverty a signature issue, Republican candidates unequivocally proclaimed that conservatism offers a better shot at pulling people up from the bottom. The first, most critical step is to get the federal government out of the poverty business, take the money from federal welfare programs and hand it to the states, which are closer to the problem and will have better ideas.\u201cFrom the government standpoint, we have actually been building a trap,\u201d Mr. Ryan said.Trouble is, the evidence doesn\u2019t much mesh with this view.There are nuggets worth mining. Mr. Ryan, like President Obama, supports expanding the earned-income tax credit \u2014 a wage subsidy largely limited to poor working parents \u2014 to make it more generous to childless adults. On another front, the candidates at the forum here in Columbia highlighted how the draconian incarceration policies embraced on both sides of the ideological divide in the last several decades have helped entrench poverty.Moreover, the standard Republican prescription that government help must be attached to employment could fit a bipartisan antipoverty program, as long as there were a way to exempt those incapable of working and to ensure that there were in fact jobs for the poor to do.For Republicans to retake the White House, they need to come up with something more than bromides.\u201cWe as Republicans have to go back to campaigning in places where we are uncomfortable,\u201d argued Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey.The growing concentration of income at the top over the last 30 to 40 years is making it increasingly difficult to ignore the lopsided distribution of economic spoils. \u201cThe American idea is that the condition of your birth does not determine the outcome of your life,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cThere are a lot of people who do not believe it is there for them.\u201dRepublicans will try, but it is becoming hard for them to simply make the case for more growth, supposedly stimulated by more tax cuts, counting on its fruits to be shared widely. They will have a hard time arguing that a growing income gap will naturally spur workers to improve their education.Unwilling to tackle inequality per se \u2014 to view society as pitting the top 1 percent against the rest \u2014 the thinkers in the party have turned to poverty as a challenge with which they can more readily engage.\u201cThe conservative movement has not been involved enough in poverty and has given over the entire territory to the left,\u201d said Arthur C. Brooks, president of the nonprofit American Enterprise Institute, which co-sponsored the event, organized by the Jack Kemp Foundation.\u201cWe know that if conservatives capture the traits that are typically associated with liberals \u2014 empathy and compassion \u2014 that fact will swing independent, persuadable voters by 10 percentage points to the right,\u201d Mr. Brooks argued. \u201cThat\u2019s not something that can win. It\u2019s the only thing that will.\u201dStill, it is going to be difficult to pull this off, because many Republicans, particularly those who are financing the campaign, care more about other things.All of them provide most of their benefits to the rich.As an antipoverty strategy, it\u2019s impossible to square the circle of the largess of Republican tax plans and military spending plans with their parsimony everywhere else. As Senator Rubio of Florida noted: \u201cWhat the other side is going to say is the Republicans, the conservatives, they are just looking to gut the antipoverty programs.\u201dYes, they will. And Republicans\u2019 priorities are helping the other side make its case.Email: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudi Aramco I.P.O. Prospect Reflects Kingdom Looking Beyond Oil", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s biggest petroleum exporter, is staring into a future in which its most valuable asset \u2014 the oil under its sands \u2014 is shrinking in value.So, in a potential strategic shift made public this week, Saudi Arabia is considering a public offering of shares in its giant state-owned oil company, Saudi Aramco, or possibly some of its subsidiaries.While investors might want to think twice before snapping up shares backed by a diminishing asset \u2014 huge in value though that asset might be \u2014 the Saudi kingdom has many good reasons to seek to monetize at least some of its oil wealth and begin diversifying its economy.\u201cThere is a political agenda behind this,\u201d said Val\u00e9rie Marcel, an independent consultant and author of a book on national oil companies. \u201cI think they are responding to the expectations of a new generation.\u201dAs the Saudi kingdom is engaged in a face-off with Iran that has further escalated tensions in the Middle East, it is well aware of the need to address the rising desires of its own people, despite the erosion of Saudi Arabia\u2019s vast wealth.In the view of Ms. Marcel and other Saudi watchers, the country\u2019s new leadership is trying to use the oil price collapse over the last two years to remake the economy and shift away from an oil-funded, government-dominated system to one where private business has a larger role. The leaders were appointed by King Salman, who came to power early last year after the death of his brother King Abdullah.\u201cThey are using this crisis as an opportunity to make structural changes in the economy\u201d that should have been made several years ago, said Rachel Ziemba, an analyst at Roubini Global Economics in New York.As is the case with other major oil producers, Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil income, which furnishes about 90 percent of government revenue, has been slashed by the fall in oil prices \u2014 about $35 a barrel now, down from $110 in early 2014. Although the Saudis still have about $630 billion in financial reserves, they are burning them at a rate of $5 billion to $6 billion a month, Ms. Ziemba estimates.But analysts say that an effort to list a stake in Saudi Aramco would present enormous complications. For one thing, the company annually hands over more than 90 percent of its profit, on average, to the government. Public shareholders would demand a piece of that money, which the government has often used for public projects having little to do with oil.Because Saudi Aramco has many talented managers, the company often acts as prime contractor to put these big projects into effect, often with little regard to whether they are profitable. Saudi Aramco, for example, is a key contractor for Jazan Economic City, an industrial zone in an impoverished area in the southwest part of the country. The company also builds sports stadiums, including the King Abdullah Sports City in Jeddah.\u201cFrom a cost-benefit analysis, these are good projects, but for a private investor, they are not a good investment,\u201d said Paul Stevens, a Middle East oil analyst at Chatham House, a London-based research organization. Mr. Stevens said that while Saudi Aramco was generally well managed, it would be \u201ca lousy company for a private investor.\u201dIn addition, a public listing of Saudi Aramco would require detailed revelations of its financial performance, which are not provided now, as well as scrutiny of matters like the size of its oil reserves, which have been questioned in the past. \u201cI think they would never list the full company,\u201d said Ms. Marcel, the author. \u201cThe government would not want those finances to be exposed.\u201dInstead, Ms. Marcel and others think that the Saudi government is probably considering putting a small portion of Saudi Aramco on the market or perhaps a package of refineries and other assets.As to why would the government want to go to the trouble of listing the company and facing controversy, the answer might be economic diversification.With the country\u2019s oil wealth slowly dwindling, Prince Mohammad is looking for ways to cut the budget, find new revenue and energize the private sector. He and his aides have already taken steps that were long considered almost impossible politically, like raising gasoline prices. Price increases for electricity and water are in the works, as is a value-added tax, a radical step in a country that has no income tax. They are also considering selling other assets, like airports.\u201cThe government is under a great deal of fiscal pressure,\u201d said Farouk Soussa, a Middle East economist at Citigroup in London. \u201cThey are looking at what assets might give them the biggest bang for their buck.\u201dThe Saudi leadership also seems to be hunkering down for a long siege of oil prices around the current levels. If prices of $30 to $50 per barrel are the new normal, then the government is going to need to find other ways of financing economic growth.With more than half of the Saudi population younger than 25, a recent study by the consultants McKinsey warns of a coming demographic bulge that will require creating almost three times as many jobs for Saudis as were created during the oil boom of 2003-13. Otherwise unemployment, estimated at 12 percent, could soar, creating a potentially volatile political environment in a country that is near war-torn Syria and is engaged in fighting in Yemen, its neighbor to the south.\u201cThe private sector has to do more of the heavy lifting going forward,\u201d Mr. Soussa said.Other big oil companies that are listed on stock exchanges but remain government-controlled include Statoil of Norway. Ms. Marcel said that many governments of emerging-market countries are considering partial listings of their national oil companies as a way of opening up to public scrutiny and curbing corruption. But she warned that having so much power in the hands of the deputy crown prince is a source of concern.\u201cThe new master is too powerful,\u201d she said. \u201cWho is going to hold him to account?\u201dAn earlier version of this article erroneously attributed a distinction to Saudi Arabia. It is the world\u2019s largest petroleum exporter, not the largest petroleum producer.An article on Saturday about the possibility of a public offering of shares in Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia\u2019s giant state-owned oil company, misstated the proximity of Saudi Arabia to Syria. They are separated by Iraq and Jordan; they do not border each other.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Growing Conflict in Wall St. Buyouts", "Date": "2016-01-04", "News": "Supported byDealBookIt goes by a rather innocuous-sounding name, the sort of phrase you might breeze past in a loan document: \u201cdesignated lender counsel.\u201dBut pay attention, because it\u2019s the latest conflict-ridden practice on Wall Street.Over the last several years, a new, insidious relationship has quietly developed between the nation\u2019s largest private equity firms, the banks that lend them billions to fund their buyouts and the law firms that advise on these deals.Historically, when a bank, like JPMorgan Chase, made a loan to a private equity firm planning a big acquisition, like the Blackstone Group, the bank would hire an outside law firm to scrutinize the loan and the transaction.That made a lot of sense: Loans made to finance private equity deals are some of the riskiest because they typically involve a lot of debt. They are called \u201cleveraged buyouts\u201d for a reason. Having a team of lawyers review an often complex loan document could keep a bank from making a deal that might later come back to haunt it. The Federal Reserve, so worried about these kinds of loans, has since the financial crisis sought to make it tougher for big banks to make highly leveraged loans by issuing rules that determine the amount of money they can lend.But neither the Federal Reserve nor any other regulator has addressed this latest private equity maneuver.Instead of allowing a bank to hire its own lawyers to vet a potential loan, many large private equity firms \u2014 Blackstone, Apollo Global Management, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Carlyle Group among them \u2014 now regularly require the banks to use a specific law firm that they designate, hence the term \u201cdesignated lender counsel.\u201d The private equity firms pay for the law firm\u2019s services, too.Think about it this way: It is, in effect, the equivalent of your employer giving you an employment agreement and telling you that the only lawyer who can look it over is the one the company has retained.Bankers and their in-house lawyers privately complain that the private equity firms are assigning them law firms that have little allegiance to them and might not necessarily have their best interests at heart. But given the pressure to secure these big loan deals \u2014 which can be worth hundreds of millions of dollars in fees \u2014 few are willing to publicly criticize the practice.Indeed, when I called private equity firms \u2014 representatives from which all refused to speak on the record about this practice \u2014 they all said that if the banks were really that upset about it, the firms would have already heard complaints.But that ignores the influence that private equity firms have over the banks, and the banks\u2019 lack of incentive to speak up. \u201cThe borrower has a lot of muscle, a lot of leverage,\u201d Robert Profusek, a partner at the law firm Jones Day and one of the few lawyers who would speak on the record about this issue, said of the private equity firms. \u201cWhen you\u2019re competing for business, you\u2019re not going to turn it down because you can\u2019t use law firm A rather than law firm B.\u201d (Mr. Profusek\u2019s firm does some work as designated lender counsel.)Not all private equity firms are pushing the banks to hire their recommended law firms. Notably, Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, one of the pioneers of the leveraged buyout industry, does not engage in the practice. A representative for the firm declined to comment. When I was reporting this column, many private equity executives and lawyers suggested that the practice had taken place for many years. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing new here,\u201d one dealmaker said. Another called it \u201cirrelevant.\u201d They said that the law firms assigned to work for the banks had a fiduciary duty to give them proper advice and that there would be too much reputational risk in rolling over for a private equity firm.That might be true, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that the law firms doing this work have two \u201cclients\u201d: the private equity firms that refer them all the business and the banks, to whom they owe the fiduciary duty.In the past, each bank lending money on a deal would hire its own law firm, which resulted in multiple law firms scrutinizing every transaction. Even then, assuming the deal was completed, the private equity firm paid the legal fees. Private equity firms defend the practice, saying it saves clients from having to pay double or triple the amount in legal fees. The firms also say that this practice takes place on big corporate loan deals. For many decades, large American companies that regularly issue debt, like I.B.M. and General Electric, have designated a law firm to represent the banks underwriting loans. The companies justify this because the deals are boilerplate. But in the private equity arena, it\u2019s very different. There is no great efficiency to having one law firm handle all of it, because each transaction is specific to a different company. It might be a real estate deal one day, and a technology or pharmaceutical deal the next.\u201cMost of the due diligence isn\u2019t about the firm, it\u2019s about the portfolio company. So it isn\u2019t like you build up this knowledge base,\u201d Mr. Profusek said.Some law firms, like Paul Hastings, have made a lucrative business serving as a designated lender counsel, aggressively marketing their services to the real client: the private equity firms. According to the Thomson Reuters Deals Intelligence, in 2010 Paul Hastings had virtually no relationship with banks making leveraged loans; today, it is the No. 2 ranked law firm in this business. A spokeswoman for Paul Hastings declined to comment.The banking industry\u2019s association, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, issued a report in 2013 that raised red flags about using designated lender counsel in the context of municipal bond offerings. The association said that the practice should be disclosed by the municipalities in their bond offering documents. \u201cAny undue influence by an issuer, however, that calls into question the qualifications or independence of underwriter\u2019s counsel may create risk to the issuer,\u201d it wrote.Of course, the choice of which law firm will represent a bank on a big private deal will not lead to the next financial crisis. But if regulators care about reducing risk and eliminating conflicts in the markets, this practice might be a good one to examine.Advertisement"}

Mr. Smith lamented to Mrs. Clinton that he could not afford to pay off his college loans and pursue his dream of owning a bowling alley, and the visit turned him into something of a local celebrity. He is now running for the Iowa House in his hometown district.\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt the end of it, she said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I would love to stop by your small business,\u2019 and I said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I would love that, too,\u2019\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Smith said introducing Mrs. Clinton on Wednesday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing motivates you more to clean a business than having a potential president stop by.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBowling alley visits have become something of a staple for presidential campaigns, and perhaps sensing the pitfalls of a gutter ball, Mrs. Clinton demurred from trying out the Adel lanes. During the 2008 Democratic contest, Senator Barack Obama bowled a 37 at the Pleasant Valley Lanes in Altoona, Penn. The area\u00e2\u0080\u0099s working-class voters were not impressed. Shrugging off the low score, Mr. Obama declared, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy economic plan is better than my bowling.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To which a man yelled, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt has to be!\u00e2\u0080\u009dMrs. Clinton seized on her opponent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gutter balls, challenging him to a bowl off. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA bowling night, right here in Pennsylvania. The winner takes all,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said during their heated primary fight. The contest played out on the set of \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show\u00e2\u0080\u009d when Mrs. Clinton missed the pins entirely on her first try, knocking a single pin down on her second attempt.The early period of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s current campaign, when she held small round-table discussions with a handful of handpicked Iowans, drew criticism for seeming staged, but Mrs. Clinton, who  focused on foreign policy in her four years at the State Department, says she got a lot out of them. She continues to refer to and draw on the stories she heard in the first few months of her candidacy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI went for education in college so I could teach, but I fell in love with bowling,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Smith explained to Mrs. Clinton in their first discussion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my biggest thing, is the barrier of entry and financing.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMrs. Clinton lit up as she recalled the period in her campaign when she wanted to hear directly from voters in Iowa and New Hampshire. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe all know about the student loan debt, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never heard anyone so persuasively link it to the slowdown in business startups,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve given me an insight that nobody else has,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said to Mr. Smith, \u201cand I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m grateful to you.\u201d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

After the voting that year, Republicans dominated state legislatures; they controlled a clear majority of the governorships; they had taken one chamber of Congress and were on their way to winning the other. Perhaps most important, a good many of the Republicans who had won these offices were not middle-of-the-road pragmatists. They were antigovernment libertarians of the Kochs\u2019 own political stripe. The brothers had spent or raised hundreds of millions of dollars to create majorities in their image. They had succeeded. And not merely at the polls: They had helped to finance and organize an interlocking network of think tanks, academic programs and news media outlets that far exceeded anything the liberal opposition could put together.It is this conservative ascendancy that Jane Mayer chronicles in \u201cDark Money.\u201d The book is written in straightforward and largely unemotional prose, but it reads as if conceived in quiet anger. Mayer believes that the Koch brothers and a small number of allied plutocrats have essentially hijacked American democracy, using their money not just to compete with their political adversaries, but to drown them out.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Races of Mankind\u2019 Sculptures, Long Exiled, Return to Display at Chicago\u2019s Field Museum", "Date": "2016-01-20", "News": "Supported byCHICAGO \u2014 For decades, the bronzes created by the artist Malvina Hoffman for the Field Museum\u2019s \u201cRaces of Mankind\u201d exhibit have had a ghostly afterlife at the institution. Hailed at their unveiling in 1933 as \u201cthe finest racial portraiture the world has yet seen\u201d and viewed by millions of visitors, the sculptures were banished to storage in 1969, embarrassing relics of discredited ideas about human difference.Some were later scattered through the museum, like the Australian aboriginal man who stood guard for a time outside a McDonald\u2019s on the ground floor, minus his original boomerang and spear. But to curators they remained strangely compelling, if troubling, objects.\u201cWhen I first came here, I sort of fell in love with them,\u201d Alaka Wali, an anthropologist at the museum, recalled recently. \u201cBut there was always debate about what the museum should do with them. They were problematic objects.\u201dIt\u2019s an idea, the show makes clear through wall texts and video touch-screen displays, that scientists have abandoned, though hardly one that has entirely gone away.\u201cIt\u2019s not as if just because scientists say race is not a biological fact, that it doesn\u2019t continue to have an impact,\u201d Ms. Wali, who curated the exhibition, said during a tour of the gallery. She stopped near a section discussing the legacy of scientific racism, which includes photographs of Black Lives Matter protests.\u201cScientists can now show that human genetic variation doesn\u2019t correspond to racial types,\u201d she said. \u201cBut people don\u2019t always listen to scientists.\u201dThe new exhibition, which runs through the end of the year, was financed in part by Pamela K. Hull, a granddaughter of Stanley Field, the museum\u2019s president from 1909 to 1964, who paid for the restoration of the bronzes.It was Field who, in 1929, voted with the museum\u2019s board to commission a group of artists to depict the world\u2019s varied \u201cracial types in a dignified manner.\u201d Instead, the whole job went to Hoffman, a New York sculptor who had studied with Rodin, in what The New York Times called \u201cprobably the largest commission ever granted any sculptor,\u201d male or female.Hoffman traveled the world looking for models with her husband, Samuel Grimson, who took thousands of photographs and made film clips of potential subjects. Hoffman, who once studied anatomy by dissecting cadavers alongside medical students, approached the project with a meticulous realism, using different patinas to subtly suggest skin tones.The \u201cRaces\u201d exhibit, which opened in 1933, included both simple busts and elaborate life-size pieces showing people shooting arrows, climbing trees or posing with spears. In the center stood \u201cUnity of Man,\u201d showing noble figures representing what were believed to be the world\u2019s three main racial groups shouldering the globe equally. But its overall thrust \u2014 driven home by diagrams showing different nose types and the like \u2014 was unmistakable: The world\u2019s peoples could be arranged in a hierarchy, from the primitive to the most civilized.About 10 million visitors viewed the exhibit over the next three decades, according to the museum, and a show of miniature reproductions traveled the country. But by the 1960s, the scientific theories behind the show had fallen into disrepute. In 1969, the exhibit was dismantled. The Field also halted publication of a \u201cMap of Mankind\u201d based on the exhibit, after receiving a letter from the poet Amiri Baraka (born LeRoi Jones), who denounced it as \u201cwhite racist pseudo anthropology.\u201dScience has shown today that \u201cwe share a common ancestry and the differences among people are not as great as they seem,\u201d according to the website for \u201cRace: Are We So Different?\u201d \u2014 a traveling exhibition created by the American Anthropological Association.At the Field, the few permanent exhibits that address human variation focus on cultural differences, like a wall of shoes from around the world that Ms. Wali curated in 1997.Hoffman, who died in 1966, was herself skeptical about the biological notions of race she was hired to illustrate. \u201cI will leave the much-disputed subject of what is meant by the word \u2018Aryan\u2019 to be fought out between expert anthropologists and Mr. Hitler,\u201d she wrote in \u201cHeads & Tales,\u201d her 1936 memoir about the commission.While a short video in the exhibition shows her measuring a Malaysian sitter\u2019s head with calipers, the show emphasizes her differences with scholars like the British anthropologist Sir Arthur Keith, a leading exponent of the idea of racial typologies (and the model for Hoffman\u2019s bust exemplifying the craggy Scot).\u201cThese people are individuals,\u201d not types, Hoffman said of the project in 1961.To recover that individuality, Ms. Wali and colleagues did extensive research into the real people behind Hoffman\u2019s sculptures, roughly half of whom have been identified by name.\u201cOne of our docents who is Chinese-American walked in and recognized him immediately,\u201d Ms. Wali said.The exhibition also corrects some muddled ethnic identifications, like the group labeled \u201cBalinese cockfight,\u201d despite the fact that one of the models was a man from Madura, another Indonesian island, whom Hoffman met in a Parisian restaurant where he worked as a waiter.Then there\u2019s the impressively muscled figure standing alone in a corner, looking like he got lost on the way to an exhibition of neo-Classical nudes. It was originally labeled \u201cNordic type,\u201d even though the model was Tony Sansone, a celebrated Italian-American body builder from New York.\u201cWe just call him Brooklyn man,\u201d Janet Hong, the exhibition\u2019s project manager, said with a laugh.The exhibition \u201creally shows the incredible diversity of human beauty,\u201d said Jen Feasal, an industrial electrician from Lansing, Mich., who had come to the museum specifically to see the new show. She was particularly moved, she added, by the bust of Ota Benga, a Congolese man who was displayed for a time in the Bronx Zoo under the label \u201cAfrican Pygmy\u201d; he committed suicide in 1916.Asked how she felt about people who might skip the darker stories told by the wall texts and just get lost in the fascinating faces, Ms. Wali said it was understandable. She turned to a bust of Nobosodrou, a Mangbetu woman from what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo.\u201cI could just look at her all day,\u201d Ms. Wali said. \u201cShe\u2019s just so beautiful.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "We Need a New Green Revolution", "Date": "2016-01-04", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsMaintaining this level of productivity has been quite a challenge in recent years and is likely to become more difficult over the next few decades as weather patterns, available water and growing seasons shift further and threats of invasive weeds, pests and pathogens rise.If agriculture is to have any chance of answering these challenges, we must have new and improved techniques and technologies. The problem is that agricultural innovation has not kept pace.Today, farm production has stopped growing in the United States, and agriculture research is no longer a priority; it constitutes only 2 percent of federal research and development spending. And, according to the Department of Agriculture, total agricultural production has slowed significantly since the turn of the century. We need another ambitious surge in agricultural science.History has shown that science can solve the nation\u2019s agriculture and food production problems, but to do so, the American system of food and agricultural research must be substantially reinvigorated. Research can tackle how to grow more food with fewer resources under increasingly difficult growing conditions. But this can be accomplished only if more of the brightest minds are engaged with enough funding to pursue transformative ideas.Experience has shown that the best way forward is funding research through a competitive process, with projects selected through a peer-review procedure that excludes politics. There is a program in the Agriculture Department that embraces these tenets, the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative, and its research grants show great promise.The potential is great, but the program has never been fully funded. Despite a $25 million increase in the omnibus budget agreement, the budget of the department\u2019s research initiative sits at half of what Congress authorized in 2008 when it created the program. In the 2014 fiscal year, the program\u2019s peer-review process identified approximately $1.1 billion in grants as worthy of funding, but the program could dispense only $270 million. We cannot kindle the next green revolution if we treat roughly three-quarters of a billion dollars in worthwhile scientific ideas as if they were table scraps.Throughout humanity\u2019s existence, farming and food production have always benefited from innovative solutions that solved challenges and looked beyond the horizon. Now more than ever, we need to embrace 21st-century science, fund it and turn it loose so we can develop better methods of putting food on the table. Our world is changing; the way we grow and produce food needs a much richer diet of scientific ingenuity to keep pace.Advertisement"}

The court ordered Ms. Compagnon not to leave the country and confined several other defendants, including Mr. Valero, to their homes at night.The defendants in the case include other Caval employees, former bank and municipal officials, a businessman and several lawyers, who were charged with a number of crimes. Five of them, including Mr. Valero, were also accused of bribery. Prosecutors said they were all involved in a speculative land deal that yielded millions of dollars in profit for Caval, with large kickbacks paid to those who facilitated it. When the deal came to light, public attention focused at first on how Caval had come to know that the land would be rezoned and whether Ms. Compagnon and her husband had done anything improper to obtain the loan. Mr. D\u00e1valos soon resigned from a position on his mother\u2019s staff overseeing government-sponsored charitable foundations and social programs, and has stayed out of the public spotlight since.Mr. Toledo, the prosecutor, said this week that there was insufficient evidence to charge Mr. D\u00e1valos.Ms. Bachelet has said she was not aware of the business dealings of her son and daughter-in-law. Even so, her ratings in opinion surveys have fallen steeply. In a poll by Plaza P\u00fablica Cadem released this week, just 25 percent of respondents said they approved of her presidency. \u201cThese times have been hard and very painful for me and my family,\u201d Ms. Bachelet said in a statement Friday. \u201cChileans demand and deserve equal opportunities and rights, and this also means equality before the law.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the charges that Natalia Compagnon is facing. They are tax crimes, not bribery.

Instead, poring over its holdings last summer, he chose mirrors and frames. So, when \u201cThom Browne Selects\u201d opens on March 4, visitors will end up looking at themselves \u2014 all the more so, since the walls and floor will be covered in holographic wallpaper in a reflective silver diamond pattern. This will be quite a departure for the museum, \u201calmost an hallucinogenic experience,\u201d said Matilda McQuaid, the deputy curatorial director at the Cooper Hewitt, who has worked closely with Mr. Browne on the exhibition.\u201cThe thing for me was to do something that brought my world into Cooper Hewitt,\u201d Mr. Browne, 50, said in a telephone interview. \u201cFor the past couple of seasons, I\u2019ve been interested in mirrors and reflections and the idea of uniformity, so it worked out almost perfectly.\u201dThe idea of uniforms comes up repeatedly in Mr. Browne\u2019s work, which resonates with the tension between individuality and conformity. Known for his gray flannel suits, traditional tailoring, constricted designs and strangely high-hemmed trousers, he is at once conservative and flamboyant.\u201cHis whole approach \u2014 in a funny way, it\u2019s Tim Burton meets Pierre Balmain,\u201d said David Revere McFadden, the chief curator emeritus of the Museum of Arts and Design, referring to the film director and the Paris couturier who created flight attendants\u2019 uniforms for TWA in the mid-1960s. There are \u201cinteresting echoes\u201d of those uniforms in Mr. Browne\u2019s work, added Mr. McFadden, who was the curator of decorative arts from 1978 to 1995 at the Cooper Hewitt, but at least Mr. Browne\u2019s designs do not require girdles.Commissioned jointly as part of a series by Phyllis Lambert, the architect and Seagram heiress, and the architect Gene R. Summers for their art-infused renovation of the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles, the Dine mirror is decorated with plaster casts of construction tools, among them a pair of shears and a hatchet. Guests were taken aback: \u201cTry sleeping with that over your head,\u201d a visiting pharmaceuticals executive told The Los Angeles Times after the hotel was sold in 1984. The mirror found its way to the Cooper Hewitt not long after \u2014 hatchet and all.In any case, individual objects are not the point. \u201cIt\u2019s an immersive environment,\u201d Mr. Browne said. \u201cEach object is important, but for me, I like it to be a total experience. I do the same thing with my shows. Of course, I want people to appreciate each piece, but the overall image is initially what I want people to be hit with.\u201dThe Cooper Hewitt experience will include not only the reflective wallpaper, donated for the occasion by the London fabric firm Osborne & Little, but also several items from Mr. Browne\u2019s studio, among them 60 pairs of silver-plated Thom Browne brogues and a vintage silver-plated Steelcase desk that weighs in at 400 pounds. The whole of it will be presented in a room-within-a-room to be constructed in the museum\u2019s Marks Gallery, as the rather froufrou music room of this 1902 Andrew Carnegie mansion is now known.Like a period room at the Metropolitan Museum of Art down the street, the gallery will have a barrier to prevent visitors from venturing more than a few feet inside \u2014 not that anyone is likely to mistake this for something out of an old house. \u201cI want it to be a very timeless world,\u201d Mr. Browne said. \u201cThe mirrors are from so many different periods, the desk is from midcentury, the wallpaper is very now.\u201d And then there are the shoes, which will be lined up on the floor with military precision.To anyone who has witnessed Mr. Browne\u2019s fashion displays, \u201cThom Browne Selects\u201d will seem somewhat familiar. A midcentury Steelcase desk and silver-plated brogues were featured in a Browne installation last fall at Le Bon March\u00e9, the chic Paris department store. Called \u201cOfficeman 2,\u201d it was set in a completely mirrored room. \u201cThe Officeman,\u201d Mr. Browne\u2019s men\u2019s wear show for last summer\u2019s New York Fashion Week, used a dizzying infinity of mirrors to deliver a similarly kaleidoscopic effect.As with the fashion shows, there will be a strong narrative aspect to the Cooper Hewitt installation. The question is whose narrative it will be. \u201cBecause there are mirrors, it can be a personal story for each person who sees it,\u201d Mr. Browne maintained. Still, Mr. Browne\u2019s own narrative will probably be dominant.The key to that story is Mr. Browne\u2019s upbringing in Allentown, Pa. The son of lawyers who invariably reported to their offices in suits, he grew up with all the trappings of conservative Middle America. His mother even silver-plated his baby shoes \u2014 an act Mr. Browne, in his own personal \u201cCitizen Kane,\u201d has imbued with near-Rosebud import.Fashion, in this narrative, is relegated to second place. \u201cI think fashion becomes not very interesting, because everybody thinks it has to change, as opposed to evolve,\u201d he said. Uniforms, on the other hand, are very interesting to him. \u201cThere\u2019s something so confident in almost adopting a uniform for yourself,\u201d Mr. Browne said. \u201cIt frees yourself to think about things that are possibly more important than fashion.\u201d And so, in Mr. Browne\u2019s world, uniformity encourages individuality \u2014 an idea visitors might want to think about as they catch their reflections in his mirror-filled room.An article on Tuesday about the exhibition \u201cThom Browne Selects,\u201d which is to open at the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in Manhattan in March, referred incompletely to the commission of a mirror by Jim Dine for the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles, a work that will be in the exhibition. It was a joint commission by the architect and Seagram heiress Phyllis Lambert and the architect Gene R. Summers, not solely Ms. Lambert.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Centerview Benefits From Wall St.\u2019s Pivot to Smaller Banks", "Date": "2016-01-05", "News": "Supported byIn a pink marble skyscraper opposite the Museum of Modern Art, 20 summer analysts at the investment bank Centerview Partners listened while Robert E. Rubin, the former Treasury secretary, opined on the state of the world.The analysts had been selected from a few thousand applicants, and most would return after graduation to work long days, nights and weekends at Centerview, which advises big corporations on mergers and acquisitions. Blair W. Effron and Robert A. Pruzan, the firm\u2019s co-founders, flanked Mr. Rubin at the head of the table.The conversation meandered from United States foreign policy to the Greek debt crisis. Then Mr. Rubin asked the students if they were always so preternaturally serious.\u201cWhen I was in college, we hung out in coffee shops and pondered the meaning of life,\u201d Mr. Rubin said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what a hedge fund was.\u201dNo one took the bait. The summer analysts were all business.Most of these fresh-faced graduates of elite colleges could have taken jobs at their pick of big banks. But their decision to join Centerview reflects a shift in the center of gravity on Wall Street. Increasingly, large corporations are turning to so-called boutique investment banks like Centerview for advice on deals and strategy.Boutiques are gaining favor for several reasons: They are unburdened by larger trading and financing operations that can create conflicts of interest. Their smaller staffs mean deals have a better chance of staying secret. And increasingly, they are luring the industry\u2019s most senior deal makers away from big banks.As the books close on a year that broke records with $4.7 trillion worth of deals, these boutiques have become a more powerful presence on Wall Street than ever before.Besides Centerview, the list of insurgents includes Lazard, Evercore Partners, Moelis & Company, LionTree and others. Some have been around for decades, while others are just setting up shop, seeking to capitalize on this rapidly changing market for top-dollar advice.At Centerview, Mr. Effron helped General Electric structure its disposal of GE Capital last year. He helped conceive a plan that would allow Kraft and Heinz to merge in one of the year\u2019s biggest deals. And he is advising Pfizer as it works on a $160 billion combination with Allergan.Alan Hartman, another partner at Centerview, suggested that the health care property company Ventas spin off a major division last year, which turned into a multibillion-dollar deal. Another partner, David A. Handler, routinely spends time with the technology giant Cisco Systems, mulling over potential acquisitions and sometimes simply helping the company think through its quarterly earnings release.These deal makers are well compensated for their work. Centerview reaped a $60 million fee for helping orchestrate the merger of Kraft and Heinz. It earned $40.8 million for helping Pharmacyclics sell itself to AbbVie in March. For helping Time Warner Cable secure a sale to Charter Communications, Centerview will make $27.5 million. It will receive $44.4 million for advising Salix on its sale to Valeant, and $32 million for helping Omnicare sell itself to CVS.For these assignments and others, Centerview earned about $600 million last year, according to a review of public filings, a huge sum for a firm with just 35 partners.To be sure, the big banks do all this and more. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase were again the top merger advisers last year, capitalizing on longstanding relationships with big companies and the ability to throw a lot of resources at complicated assignments. And when a company needs to borrow billions of dollars to finance an ambitious takeover, it must tap institutions with big balance sheets for loans. Often, companies will hire boutiques and big banks to work together on a deal.But boutiques, and Centerview in particular, are turning heads as they continue to rake in more fees and bigger assignments. A boutique was involved in each of the eight largest deals of the year, all of them worth $50 billion or more, and Centerview advised on three of those.Over a sushi lunch in 2005, Mr. Effron, then at UBS, and Mr. Pruzan, at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, decided they had enough with big banks and decided to found Centerview. At the time, they were at the vanguard of an exodus of top bankers from big firms, a movement that intensified after the financial crisis.In the years that followed, dozens of top bankers left big firms to join boutiques. Mr. Hartman had risen to become Bank of America Merrill Lynch\u2019s head of mergers and acquisitions for the Americas. But in 2009, he and several top colleagues, including Mark J. Robinson, left to join Centerview.In London, Robey Warshaw, a firm founded in 2014 by UBS and Morgan Stanley executives, is advising SABMiller on its proposed $104 billion sale to Anheuser Busch InBev and is also advising the BG Group on its $72 billion sale to Royal Dutch Shell.The forces motivating top talent to leave big banks are diverse, ranging from a frustration with bureaucracy to an appetite for riches.\u201cIf you\u2019re at a big bank, what you do or your group does doesn\u2019t move the needle,\u201d said Roger C. Altman, founder of Evercore Partners, a publicly traded boutique. \u201cAbove a certain size, no individual can do that. People want to have impact.\u201dIndependent firms can also lead to big paydays. After the financial crisis, boutiques were unburdened by the restrictions that reined in compensation at banks that took government bailouts, and paid deal makers millions without falling afoul of Washington.Centerview is not publicly traded, so it is not clear what the equity held by Mr. Effron and Mr. Pruzan is worth. Should they choose to take Centerview public, they would swiftly join the ranks of the world\u2019s richest bankers. Both men said there were no plans for an initial public offering.Yet as Centerview continues gaining momentum, the question is whether Mr. Effron and Mr. Pruzan have created a firm that is built to last.Small investment banks like Centerview have plenty of vulnerabilities. They are dependent on companies\u2019 willingness to pay top dollar for deal advice. A downturn in mergers can dry up business fast. Even in today\u2019s booming merger market, some boutiques are struggling. At Greenhill, fees from advising clients declined to $281 million in 2014 from $303 million in 2011.And though Mr. Effron and Mr. Pruzan strive to present the appearance of a single firm that transcends individuals, Centerview\u2019s clients are loyal to their bankers, whatever firm they happen to work at.\u201cOur relationship has always been more with Blair Effron than with any one bank,\u201d said Indra Nooyi, the chief executive of PepsiCo.Trying to create a bank that is bigger than such personal relationships is Centerview\u2019s primary challenge in the years ahead, and is why Mr. Effron and Mr. Pruzan personally select their summer analysts, and try to promote a collaborative culture by taking analysts on cultural outings and bringing in speakers like Mr. Rubin.\u201cWe\u2019re looking for our future partners,\u201d Mr. Pruzan said.A few days before Centerview\u2019s summer analysts chatted with the former Treasury secretary, Mr. Effron held a fund-raiser for Hillary Clinton at his duplex on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side.Attendees, including Mr. Altman of Evercore and Mr. Rubin, contributed $2,700 each. Mrs. Clinton spoke for about 30 minutes, took questions and posed for photos.Close ties to the Clinton campaign aside, Mr. Effron insists that he is focused on building Centerview for another 10 years and more. And despite the lure of I.P.O. riches, the Centerview founders insisted they were not looking to cash out anytime soon.\u201cWe\u2019re taking a longer view of what we are building,\u201d Mr. Pruzan said.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the work history of Mr. Pruzan. At the time he and Mr. Effron founded Centerview Partners, he was at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, not Commerzbank, which later acquired Dresdner Kleinwort.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cuomo, in State of State Speech, Unveils $20 Billion Housing Plan", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported byMr. Cuomo, in a broad and at times emotional vision of his 2016 agenda, put forth a $20 billion plan to add 100,000 permanent housing units over five years, and thousands more units of housing that would offer shelter and social services across the state. In doing so, he vowed to exert his influence over problems that have bedeviled New York City.Mr. Cuomo, in a convention hall adjacent to the State Capitol, spoke as the former leaders of the State Assembly and the State Senate, Sheldon Silver and Dean G. Skelos, prepare to be sentenced for their convictions on federal corruption charges.The governor\u2019s own concerns about a possible prosecution related to his interference and abrupt shutdown of an anticorruption panel known as the Moreland Commission in 2014 were eased on Monday, when the United States attorney in Manhattan said that there was \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d the governor had committed a crime.With a cloud of corruption still hanging over Albany, Mr. Cuomo proposed nearly a dozen ethics changes, including limiting legislators\u2019 outside income to 15 percent of their base salary, about $11,900 a year. Congress already has such a limit, and government watchdogs have long lobbied Albany to adopt similar rules.Mr. Cuomo also proposed a law to strip convicted lawmakers of their pensions and again recommended closing the so-called L.L.C. loophole, which allows corporate interests to channel large amounts of campaign funds to candidates through limited liability companies.Mr. Cuomo has had a mixed record on ethics, though he has blamed individual crooked lawmakers and the Legislature as a whole for not having the will to change Albany\u2019s corrupt culture.Dick Dadey, the executive director of Citizens Union, a government watchdog group that has proposed several similar ethics reforms, said he hoped the scope of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s proposals \u2014 touching on lobbying as well as voting, campaign finance as well as outside income \u2014 was an \u201cindication of his strong commitment to getting at least some of these accomplished.\u201dMr. Dadey added that the combination of the current political climate and Mr. Cuomo\u2019s proven ability to extract concessions from the Legislature made him optimistic that, if the governor wanted to, he could push his reforms through.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s budget proposes to reduce the state\u2019s spending on four-year colleges at CUNY by some $485 million \u2014 $240 million of which the state would put to a possible labor agreement with CUNY employees. Those so-called senior universities are currently financed by state money, financial aid and tuition; how the city would make up that $485 million is unclear. The budget also calls on the city to increase its contribution to growing Medicaid expenses, which had been frozen for several years.Mr. Cuomo, as he has in previous years, emphasized holding the line on spending.But, all told, the loss of CUNY funds and change to Medicaid could cost the city more than $500 million, said E. J. McMahon, president of the Empire Center for Public Policy, a conservative research group, who called such a move \u201cindefensible.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to actually cap spending,\u201d Mr. McMahon said. \u201cIt\u2019s another to shift it to your biggest locality.\u201dStill, if Mr. de Blasio was upset he did not show it, declining to take a verbal swipe at the governor for the cost shifting.\u201cIn broad strokes, this is a good day for sure and some real progress was made,\u201d the mayor said at a news conference after Mr. Cuomo\u2019s speech. He declined to comment on specifics, saying he had not had a chance to read the budget documents.Mr. Cuomo was bullish in his remarks, saying the state was \u201cstronger than at any point in recent history.\u201d And when the speech was interrupted by a prolonged outburst by State Assemblyman Charles Barron, a Brooklyn Democrat, the governor was unmoved by the heckling.\u201cWe came together; we refused to be intimidated,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said, responding \u2014 nearly shouting \u2014 to the assemblyman. Mr. Barron was escorted out.As he did last year, the governor combined his annual address with his budget proposal, unveiling some $154 billion in state spending for the 2016-17 fiscal year, including disaster aid, capital projects and other federal aid.A briefing book of the agenda and budget ran more than 500 pages and included scores of proposals and multiple other holdovers from previous years, including a vow to pass the Dream Act, which would allow undocumented immigrants to apply for state financial aid, and a pledge to raise the age of criminal responsibility to 18.But the governor also presented newer ideas, including a push to enact 12 weeks of paid leave for workers with a new child or sick relative. He introduced that proposal by recalling his relationship with his father, former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, and how he regretted not having spent more time with him.And the coming days will mark the beginning of actual negotiations, and details, though the governor\u2019s office did offer plans for financing, saying the $20 billion housing effort was expected to be paid through state money and various bank settlements. The $100 billion infrastructure plan would be financed by state, federal local and private sources.Such practical concerns have long occupied Mr. Cuomo\u2019s career as governor. But on Wednesday, he spoke at length about Sandra Lee, the television host whom he lives with in Westchester County and who received a diagnosis of breast cancer last year, and the death of his father on New Year\u2019s Day 2015, just hours after his son had been inaugurated in a second term.\u201cLife is such a precious gift, and I have kicked myself every day that I didn\u2019t spend more time with my father at that end period,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was my mistake, and a mistake I blame myself for every day.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gov. Cuomo on the State of New York", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported byEditorialOh, and he mentioned another New York problem.What followed from Mr. Cuomo was a litany of good-governance proposals that, though familiar, are still sorely needed: Publicly financing campaigns. Ending the rule that allows outside groups to donate campaign cash as freely as if they were people (the L.L.C. loophole, which has benefited Mr. Cuomo greatly). Limiting lawmakers\u2019 outside incomes to 15 percent of their base pay, which isn\u2019t as good as a ban, but would be progress. Making convicted lawmakers forfeit their pensions, to avoid the galling prospect of crooks like Mr. Silver and Mr. Skelos fattening their bank accounts with taxpayers\u2019 money while sitting in prison for public corruption.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s ethics proposals were tucked into the speech, well after he hit other points, like the news that New York now makes more Greek yogurt than Greece and, thanks to a new craft-beverage law, is home to flourishing numbers of wineries, breweries and cideries.It\u2019s possible to see these proposals as a rebuke to Mayor Bill de Blasio, whom Mr. Cuomo has accused of ineptitude on homelessness, citing the city\u2019s appallingly unsafe shelter system. Even so, Mr. de Blasio should overlook the criticisms and take any money the state offers. By plunging into this problem, the governor said, \u201cWe can say to the public of this state, \u2018Everything that can be done, we are doing.\u2019 \u201d If political one-upmanship leads to safer shelters and clears the streets, then the two men should hold hands and go for it.\u201cEvery time we walk by a homeless person we leave a piece of our soul on that curb,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said. In moments like those he was vivid and eloquent, reminding voters of his ability at times to rise above political calculation and empty promises. He was at his most persuasive when he was committing to an unabashedly progressive agenda: farsighted and compassionate.\u201cWe can raise the minimum wage to $15 and we can show this nation what real economic justice means,\u201d he said, claiming ownership of that urgent issue. He noted that McDonald\u2019s and Burger King, by paying wages too low to live on, were relying on the government to give workers the benefits they need to survive. He also laid into \u201cthe cost, the waste, the inefficiency\u201d of New York\u2019s 10,500 local governments, and promised $100 billion in infrastructure projects \u201cthat would make Governor Rockefeller jealous.\u201d\u201cWashington just can\u2019t get it done,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said, wrapping up his pep talk. \u201cIn New York, we can and we will.\u201d That claim is believable, as long as it includes ethics reform, the hard part, which remains Mr. Cuomo\u2019s Job 1.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Perilous Migrant Trail, Women Often Become Prey to Sexual Abuse", "Date": "2016-01-02", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 One Syrian woman who joined the stream of migrants to Germany was forced to pay down her husband\u2019s debt to smugglers by making herself available for sex along the way. Another was beaten unconscious by a Hungarian prison guard after refusing his advances.A third, a former makeup artist, dressed as a boy and stopped washing to ward off the men in her group of refugees. Now in an emergency shelter in Berlin, she still sleeps in her clothes and, like several women here, pushes a cupboard in front of her door at night.\u201cThere is no lock or key or anything,\u201d said Esraa al-Horani, the makeup artist and one of the few women here not afraid to give her name. She has been lucky, Ms. Horani said: \u201cI\u2019ve only been beaten and robbed.\u201dWar and violence at home, exploitative smugglers and perilous seas along the way, an uncertain welcome and future on a foreign continent \u2014 these are some of the risks faced by tens of thousands of migrants who continue to make their way to Europe from the Middle East and beyond. But at each step of the way, the dangers are amplified for women.Interviews with dozens of migrants, social workers and psychologists caring for traumatized new arrivals across Germany suggest that the current mass migration has been accompanied by a surge of violence against women. From forced marriages and sex trafficking to domestic abuse, women report violence from fellow refugees, smugglers, male family members and even European police officers. There are no reliable statistics for sexual and other abuse of female refugees.A 30-year-old Syrian mother of four fled the war with her family early last year. When her husband ran out of money to pay their smuggler in Bulgaria, he offered his wife as payment instead. For three months, she was raped almost daily to earn her family\u2019s onward journey.Soon her own husband was abusing her, too. A \u201ctwisted logic,\u201d Ms. H\u00f6hne said. \u201cWhat her husband made her do ended up tainting his honor. She became the guilty party.\u201dThe woman now has asylum and lives in Berlin with her children. Her husband, who lives elsewhere in Germany but has stalked her on the street in Berlin at least once, is under a restraining order. But she remains too terrified to provide even her first name, for fear of being killed by him or another relative over the perception that she brought \u201cdishonor\u201d to the family.Ms. H\u00f6hne says the woman displays all the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, including flashbacks, insomnia and trouble concentrating. \u201cOne moment she will seem perfectly healthy, the next she is in her chair opposite you dodging bullets in Damascus or reliving her abuse in Bulgaria,\u201d she said.Even in the relative safety of Germany, an asylum system struggling with the logistics of accommodating close to one million migrants in 2015 has been cutting corners when it comes to basic protections for women, like lockable bedrooms.\u201cThe priority has been to avoid homelessness,\u201d said Ms. Rabe, the German expert on gender-based violence. \u201cBut an environment that inadvertently facilitates violence is a risk factor. We cannot allow standards to slip.\u201dThat is easier said than done, said Jan Schebaum, who manages two homes for asylum seekers in east Berlin. There are two bathrooms per floor, and the rooms are full.One of the homes he runs is the emergency shelter where Ms. Horani, the makeup artist, stays. Of 120 adults there, most are Syrian and Afghan, and 80 are men.\u201cThe women are in the shadow of the men,\u201d Mr. Schebaum said. \u201cTheir voices are drowned out, and it\u2019s a problem.\u201dAt the food counter, where volunteers hand out hot soup and fresh fruit, the women are often last in line. They stay in their rooms a lot and rarely sign up for activities advertised on the notice board, like museum visits or concerts. One Syrian woman has not left the building since arriving two months ago because her husband, who has not yet arrived in Germany, prohibited her from doing so.In the laundry room, stories of domestic abuse circulate in hushed conversations among the women. There is a violently jealous husband on the fourth floor who has beaten his wife. There is a woman who has been beaten by her husband because they cannot have children. A couple of months ago, two Afghan men harassed an Afghan girl with lewd comments and pushed her off her bike before others intervened, a volunteer at the shelter said. But few incidents of violence are reported.The asylum claims of married couples are often linked, Ms. Rabe said, making the women more dependent on their husbands and more reluctant to be separated. In theory, German law is well equipped to deal with domestic violence, she said. But in practice, measures like the physical separation of partners are hard to carry out inside a shelter.The first time Mr. Schebaum learned about a husband beating up his wife he called the police, only to find the wife shouting at him for \u201cstealing her husband.\u201d Since then, he deals with reports of violence mostly through mediation, and by trying to empower the women in his homes.Last month one of his volunteers started a weekly walk for women. Even husbands who were initially skeptical allowed their wives to go. One woman left the premises for the first time. In the park she played a song on her cellphone and started dancing. \u201cThe longer we were outside, the more confident she became,\u201d recalled the volunteer, Vivien Roos, a 34-year-old yoga teacher.There is now an all-women knitting evening and an aerobics class. On Wednesday mornings, small groups of women go to the house of a volunteer for a private shower, nail-painting and grooming session.One afternoon a week, female social workers take migrant women to a cafe across the street for a \u201ccoffee hour.\u201d The walls are covered in graffiti, and it smells of smoke. But no matter. When Ms. Horani arrived with a large Arabic music selection on her smartphone, the scruffy interior was transformed into a bobbing sea of dancing head scarves.As some women painted their hands with henna and others traded frustrations about the time it was taking to get refugee status, Samar, a 35-year-old former employee of the Syrian Finance Ministry, opened up about the particular stress of being a woman on the move. Bombed out of her home in Darayya, a suburb of Damascus that early in the civil war became known for antigovernment protests, Samar spent 14 months on the road alone with her three daughters, ages 2, 8 and 13.\u201cI did not leave them out of my sight for one minute,\u201d she said in Arabic, speaking through an interpreter. She and other single mothers slept in shifts along the way, watching over their daughters and one another.But in Izmir, Turkey, about to board a boat to Greece, Samar was robbed and left with no money to pay the smuggler. A stocky man who called himself Omar, he offered to take her for free, but only if she had sex with him. Samar had heard him before, at night, in the hostel where she and other refugee women were staying, \u201cgoing to this room and that.\u201d\u201cEverybody knows there are two ways of paying the smugglers,\u201d she said. \u201cWith money or with your body.\u201dBut she refused, and Omar became angry. That night he burst into Samar\u2019s room, threatening her and her daughters before her screaming chased him away. Samar stayed in Turkey for almost a year to work and save up the 4,000 euros needed for the remainder of the journey.Sitting with her youngest daughter curled on her lap, Samar concluded: \u201cAlmost all men in the world are bad.\u201dAcross town, in west Berlin, Ms. H\u00f6hne sympathized, but had a more nuanced view. There are no easy solutions, she said. Female-only shelters are not an option because most families want to stay together. Some women rely on men for protection.

{"Headline": "David Brock, Ally of Hillary Clinton, Skewers New Bernie Sanders Ad", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "The race between Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Hillary Clinton ramped up Thursday with a top Clinton ally criticizing a new Sanders ad as focused too much on white Americans.Mr. Sanders released a 60-second commercial in Iowa on Thursday that features the Simon and Garfunkel song \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerica\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that seeks to remind his supporters how far he has come since declaring his candidacy. The ad is intended to motivate people to caucus for him on Feb. 1. No words are spoken, apart from the song\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lyrics, and Mr. Sanders is seen greeting voters on the campaign trail, first in small groups, then in gymnasiums and finally at huge rallies.David Brock, a longtime Clinton supporter who founded the \u201csuper PAC\u201d backing her, told The Associated Press on Thursday that the advertising presented a \u201cbizarre\u201d image of America focused on white voters. Mr. Brock also said the ad was a \u201csignificant slight to the Democratic base,\u201d according to the news agency.\u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom this ad it seems black lives don\u2019t matter much to Bernie Sanders,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Brock told The Associated Press.Mrs. Clinton has historically had close ties with black voters, and several polls show her with significant leads on Mr. Sanders among the black electorate.Mr. Brock has emerged in this campaign as one of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s most acerbic allies, challenging both her critics and unflattering news stories about her, and increasingly turning his fire on Mr. Sanders. On Thursday, Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders, dismissed Mr. Brock, who during Bill Clinton\u2019s administration was a writer for conservative publications, as \u201ca mud-slinging, right-wing extremist.\u201d And during Clarence Thomas\u2019s confirmation hearing to the Supreme Court, Mr. Briggs added, Mr. Brock \u201ctried to destroy\u201d Anita Hill, a black law professor who had accused Mr. Thomas of sexual harassment. Mr. Brock has acknowledged lying to hurt Ms. Hill\u2019s case.\u201cBernie Sanders, as everyone knows, has one of the strongest civil rights records in Congress,\u201d Mr. Briggs said in the statement. \u201cHe doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need lectures on civil rights and racial issues from David Brock.\u201dThe Clinton campaign did not immediately respond on Thursday night to requests for comment.Mr. Briggs also pointedly criticized Mrs. Clinton. \u201cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bad enough that Hillary Clinton is raising millions in special-interest money in her super PACS,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is worse that she would hire a mudslinger like David Brock. She should be ashamed of her association with Brock.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Sanders stuck to his usual themes as he began a two day swing through New Hampshire on Thursday, focusing on income inequality, campaign finance reform and his calls for raising the minimum wage.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Questions on Subsidies and Local Hiring Surround Syracuse Project", "Date": "2016-01-17", "News": "Supported byTo spur the project along, the state and the city gave the builder millions of dollars in public money. The investment, officials reasoned, would be more than worth it: In an area kneecapped for decades by the loss of manufacturing jobs, the Inner Harbor promised to employ at least 1,500 people.The Onondaga County Industrial Development Agency, which made the Inner Harbor deal, generally oversees projects outside Syracuse, with city projects falling under the jurisdiction of the City of Syracuse.Stephanie A. Miner, the mayor of Syracuse, said the county\u2019s willingness to entertain COR\u2019s proposal allowed the developer to go tax-break shopping for the most favorable terms. (Steven Aiello, COR\u2019s president, has described the deal with the county as a \u201cstrategic business decision\u201d that would allow the company to pass its tax savings to future tenants.)\u201cSomething has to be done to make sure that the people of the state of New York, including upstate, are seeing the benefits of their tax dollars,\u201d Ms. Miner, a Democrat, said in an interview. \u201cBecause what I see right now is upstate developers getting large public subsidies and tax breaks, and I don\u2019t see anything trickling down to anybody else.\u201dThe question of whether the state\u2019s largess can foster economic revitalization is a recurring issue in ailing upstate communities.From the state\u2019s point of view, subsidies have translated into real economic progress. A spokesman for the governor said the unemployment rate had dropped to 4.7 percent statewide in November, its lowest level since November 2007, and that New York State had added 759,300 private jobs since Mr. Cuomo took office. In central New York, the region around Syracuse, unemployment has fallen from 8.3 percent before Mr. Cuomo took office to 4.9 percent in November, according to figures provided by the governor\u2019s office. The region has added 9,300 private jobs in the same period.\u201cEveryone is entitled to their own opinion, but not their own facts,\u201d the spokesman, Richard Azzopardi, said. \u201cUnemployment is down across upstate New York, and private sector jobs are up.\u201d In a jab at Syracuse officials, he added that the state had the highest standard for contracting with minority and female-owned businesses in the country \u2014 \u201cmuch higher than the City of Syracuse, which also has no consistent policy for local hires on city projects.\u201dThe chief executive of the developer of the solar panel factory, LPCiminelli, is a major donor to the governor.COR, too, is a major player in central New York, a dominant developer that has received state financing for several projects in the region and a well-connected, openhanded political donor. Contributors associated with COR gave nearly $300,000 to the governor\u2019s 2014 re-election campaign, making them his largest bloc of donors from central New York.In the county deal, which was approved on Dec. 15 and which county officials defend as necessary to help complete an important project, COR is projected to save $44.6 million in taxes, paying about $18 million in lieu of taxes over 15 years instead. It has also received millions in other public subsidies, though the precise figure is in dispute: COR says it is no more than $7 million, while the city says it is more than $30 million.Of the nearly 300 workers employed to build an Inner Harbor hotel that is the first piece of the project, the developer says more than half are Syracuse residents.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more urgent facing the families and people of Syracuse than the need for jobs to mitigate and alleviate poverty,\u201d Ms. Miner said.An article on Monday about questions raised by subsidies for the planned Inner Harbor complex of hotels, upscale apartments and stores in Syracuse, N.Y., referred imprecisely to the relationship between the Onondaga County executive, Joanne M. Mahoney, and the Onondaga County Industrial Development Agency, which made the deal for the project. While Ms. Mahoney may hold sway over the agency, she does not \u201ccontrol\u201d it. Appointment authority for agency members and its executive director rests with the Onondaga County Legislature.Advertisement"}

The SIFI designation only costs $150 million a year, but that could change once regulators complete the rules for insurers.

This happened in the financial crisis of 2008, and history seems to be repeating itself this year with hedge funds, including Pershing Square and Icahn Enterprises, buffeted by the downturn. The result would not only be a reduction in the number of activist attacks. One or two highflying funds may collapse, and some of the stronger funds may survive and buy opportunistically.

{"Headline": "Ad Buys Position Marco Rubio to Dominate Iowa Airwaves", "Date": "2016-01-11", "News": "Supported bySenator Marco Rubio and his allies will deploy a barrage of ads across Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina before the first caucus and primary contests next month, spending less money than some of his opponents yet still managing to reach more television viewers.The efficient buying strategy benefits from months of planning and a decision to use precious campaign dollars for considerable chunks of Mr. Rubio\u2019s advertising. His rivals, on the other hand, are letting \u201csuper PACs\u201d bear much more of that financial burden.But the strategy depends on a level of unofficial coordination between the Rubio campaign and the unaffiliated super PACs and other groups that support him. Candidates and their campaigns are barred from directly working with super PACs, but the two can complement each other\u2019s advertising efforts by using public information.A review of advertising purchases for the next week shows that the campaign and its allied external groups are sharing the burden in key markets, like Des Moines and Manchester, N.H., with each spending roughly the same amount, though for different gross ratings points, a measurement that captures both the reach of an ad and the frequency with which it will appear.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.In Iowa, Mr. Rubio\u2019s campaign has committed to spend just under $3 million through the state\u2019s Feb. 1 caucuses. Conservative Solutions, a super PAC that supports him, has bought another $2.6 million worth of time. But Conservative Solutions is paying, on average, nearly twice as much as the Rubio campaign to get its ads seen by a comparable audience.Taken together, the ways the Rubio campaign and its allies are working in concert offer a striking contrast to how the campaign of Jeb Bush is working alongside a supportive super PAC. Mr. Bush\u2019s unaffiliated group, Right to Rise \u2014 which amassed a nine-figure war chest last year \u2014 is doing almost all the advertising on his behalf, offering his campaign far less flexibility and efficiency.But $100 million does not buy what it used to. While Right to Rise is spending $3.5 million in Iowa through the caucuses, the Rubio campaign\u2019s own ads should still be seen by a significantly larger audience, because of the lower price Mr. Rubio\u2019s campaign is paying for each one shown.Nearly three-quarters of the money Right to Rise reported raising during the first six months of last year, about $75 million, has either been spent or committed to advertising through mid-March.Using its own money for so much of its advertising also allows the Rubio campaign to exert greater control over its message.\u201cYou get control, you can plan, and all of these ads work better when they\u2019re coordinated,\u201d said Stuart Stevens, who was the senior strategist for Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign in 2012. \u201cWhat does a campaign mean? It means coordinated. It doesn\u2019t mean running random ads.\u201dThe trade-off for Mr. Rubio, in spending roughly as much on television as his outside supporters, is that less of the campaign budget is eaten up by costly television ads and more is available for get-out-the-vote efforts.Mr. Rubio\u2019s chief rivals in Iowa, Senator Ted Cruz and Donald J. Trump, are spending far less on television in the state. Although Mr. Trump has promised to \u201cspend big\u201d there, he had committed only $1.2 million to broadcast and cable television as of Monday.Mr. Rubio\u2019s campaign and Conservative Solutions reserved their time months ago, when it was far cheaper, as did Right to Rise and the super PACs supporting Govs. Chris Christie and John Kasich.\u201cWe did that so that we could be as effective and efficient and have a large presence on the air when voters were making their decisions,\u201d said Jeff Sadosky, an adviser for Conservative Solutions PAC, which supports Mr. Rubio.Advertisement"}

The group, which led his efforts on the national political stage, can accept unlimited contributions from donors because it operates outside of New York City\u2019s strict campaign finance rules. In November, the group received a $250,000 contribution from the family of George Soros, the wealthy liberal donor, and a $200,000 contribution from Unite Here, a labor union once led by John Wilhelm, who is Mr. de Blasio\u2019s cousin. Two real estate firms with business in New York City \u2014 DDG Partners and TF Cornerstone \u2014 also donated to the group last year, the records show. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo also disclosed records on Friday showing he had raised nearly $900,000 from limited-liability companies, or L.L.C.s, whose influence he is now seeking to curb.The groups affiliated with the mayor are not required by law to disclose all of their donors and expenditures, but do so anyway. But the full scope of his political effort was unavailable on Friday; a spokeswoman for the Progressive Agenda Committee, now a separate nonprofit, said it would disclose its expenditures on a different schedule because it is based in Washington.Mr. de Blasio\u2019s re-election fund, which is governed by the city\u2019s campaign finance limits, also disclosed documents on Friday. In the last six months, he raised $1,065,908; his fund spent $218,422. The group has about $850,000 on hand. The mayor spent $67,000 on polling in October and November as he pondered his re-election strategy. His team also spent nearly $800 at Bar Toto, an Italian restaurant in Park Slope, Brooklyn, that he favors.The donors to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign included the venture capitalist Fred Wilson; influential real estate players including Bruce Ratner and the Walentas family; and Randy L. Levine, the president of the Yankees. (Mr. de Blasio, who grew up in the Boston area, is a Red Sox fan.) Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign reported raising about $5.5 million over the last six months, with just over $16 million in cash on hand, according to documents filed with the State Board of Elections.Asked to address the apparent discrepancy, a spokesman for the Cuomo campaign said in a statement that while the \u201ccampaign follows all finance laws and will continue to do so,\u201d the governor had been a \u201cvocal supporter of closing the L.L.C. loophole.\u201d Advertisement"}

That is what Ellen Pao did when she was chief executive of Reddit. The company established pay ranges based on roles and experience and gave applicants nonnegotiable offers.If women can lose millions over their careers because they get job offers based on pay that is already low, one way to stop the pattern is to ignore their past salaries.\u201cDon\u2019t ask about salary history for new hires, and it really reduces the impact of previous discrimination,\u201d Ms. Babcock said. \u201cI think that is the most effective thing organizations can do.\u201dResearch has found that salaries at men and women\u2019s first jobs out of school are fairly similar.

{"Headline": "The Biggest Challenges of 2016", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "At the end of 2015, we asked what you felt was the greatest challenge facing the United States in the coming year. Over a thousand readers responded, and while their answers varied widely, a few common themes emerged. Below are some of the issues readers brought up the most frequently:Climate change The climate crisis dwarfs all other issues. Climate change has put weather on steroids. The oceans are becoming acidified. The adverse consequences are already having a disparate impact on the poor. And it will only get worse. We need to use less energy, replace fossil fuels with renewable energy (like wind and solar) for our remaining energy needs, and adopt land use practices that stop deforestation and unsustainable agriculture. Even if we stopped all carbon pollution today, impacts would continue to increase for some time due to the time lag in our climate system. It is important that we both move to eliminate fossil fuels, and begin to prepare for the impacts we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t avoid through smarter planning and actions to improve the resilience of communities to stronger and more frequent storms, droughts, heat waves and sea level rise.The biggest challenge faced by America in 2016 is that of moving our energy use away from fossil fuels in order to address climate change.There is overwhelming scientific consensus that the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases due to use of fossil fuels is warming earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s climate, and will result in sea level rise, loss of agricultural areas and increasingly severe weather events. The challenge is to create the political will to take aggressive action consistent with this knowledge by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels.The EPA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Clean Power Plan, and recent Paris agreement are steps in the right direction, but aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sufficient to put us on a safe path. We can achieve a greater reduction of carbon emissions by creating incentives which work throughout the economy to encourage conservation and a shift to low-carbon energy. Incentives such as a tax on fossil carbon can accomplish this without damaging the economy, if carbon-tax revenues are returned to households, for example as a dividend similar to a tax refund.As Bernie Sanders so simply said in the debate, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTerrorism can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bring down our civilization, but climate change can.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMoney in politicsThe biggest problem the United States faces in 2016 is the restoration of a constitutional democracy run by the people and for the people. We are on a slippery slope where gerrymandering, voter suppression and above all, limitless dark money in elections, has placed our country in the hands of a powerful ruling oligarchy. If any of the G.O.P. candidates is elected in 2016, through subsequent appointments, the Supreme Court will become an even more powerful tool of corporations and the super-rich. America will definitely continue on an irreversible slide into corporate fascism.There are many important issues (guns, terrorism, climate change, labor, immigration, globalization, infrastructure, defense, investment, taxation, healthcare, education, research) but they are all at the mercy of campaign finance reform. Fix the fixing of elections by the wealthy and corporations, and we can fix anything.EducationThe greatest challenge is to change our educational system so that it encourages and teaches critical thinking, the evaluation of claims and evidence, and the understanding of logical argument. American citizens could then understand the evidence for and consequences of global climate change, understand other cultures and their values, and understand how to evaluate candidates\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and legislators\u00e2\u0080\u0099 claims and lies. We could then move beyond ignorance and hatred to empathy, compassion, and more active participation in ridding ourselves of injustice and inequality.Education reform \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not just in 2016, but in every year. If we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really serious about giving every child an opportunity in this country, then we will work to have quality education \u00e2\u0080\u0094 good teachers, adequate resources, diverse classes \u00e2\u0080\u0094 available to all communities. This should require creative solutions, maybe more charter schools, or integration policies between districts, and above all, a greater commitment to change. It is a tragedy that with every passing year, more and more kids go through the American school system with a semblance of an education and little opportunity to attain more.America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest challenge is our shortfall in civic education. Its absence and the resulting dysfunction make us more vulnerable to every foreign and domestic threat. The whole country, from Senators to voters to candidates, needs remedial classes in basic governance. This lack of understanding leads to disappointment, a sense of betrayal, powerlessness and cynicism. Congress is certainly not modeling good government, but I suspect the uninformed electorate, lacking the information to direct its outrage, helps perpetuate the problem.Some years ago the teaching of Civics (how-a-bill-becomes-a-law, the balance of powers, and the basics of the electoral process) as a required course was ended. It was supposed to be integrated into other classes, but in many cases was simply set aside. The right and duty of every citizen to know about our government, to engage is the civil process and to vote needs to be elevated again. Oh where are those 7th grade civics teachers of my youth?PolarizationOur own culture of divisiveness is our biggest challenge. Tragically, this self-inflicted problem prevents us from dealing effectively with any of our other challenges (climate change, race relations, income inequality, Middle East Policy, declining infrastructure, underfunded basic science, etc., etc, etc.).The biggest threat to the United States is \u00e2\u0080\u009ca house divided against itself cannot stand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The poisonous political state this country has seen develop over the past ten years or so has caused almost a standstill for economic and social growth. There are too many people with anti-attitudes about immigrants, social reforms, and economic disadvantages for the working class. People seem to be turning on each other instead of embracing what has made our country great over the centuries. We should be past the hate mongers, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re far from it. In fact, it seems to be getting worse.The greatest challenge that U.S. society faces is the loss of capacity for meaningful national dialogue. As greater numbers of citizens lose their trust not just in institutions from government health agencies to grounded journalism, we seem to become more focused on truthiness than on a skeptical relationship with reliable data. If we cannot even agree on basic facts and reasonable scientific hypotheses (such as climate change), finding ways to take meaningful action becomes increasingly difficult.As someone who grew up in a tiny politically conservative agricultural community who now lives in a politically liberal urban area, I have friends on varying sides of these epistemological divides. I experience ever widening gaps as I navigate these relationships.InequalityThe widening disparity between the rich and the poor, with the shrinking of the middle class is a challenge that might just tear into the democratic fabric of America. Historically, America has rarely been threatened by the specter of inequality of this magnitude.The biggest challenge facing the United States in 2016 is social and economic inequality and how to narrow the gap between rich and poor. The way American institutions are performing now (for example, the education system from kindergarten to university, the tax system, the impoverished public sector, our social and religious values) we will soon arrive at a caste system in which reform will be impossible and America will become a very different country.The biggest threat facing the United States in 2016 is the same one that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s faced us for almost four decades: Class warfare by the wealthy on the working class. Bernie Sanders understands this, while none of the other candidates do.We are watching the elimination of our middle class without a shot fired. We are on a steady march towards another era of the Robber Barons where there will be just two classes: rich and poor, and with the majority of Americans having less money, who will provide the fuel for our consumer-driven economy? And what will happen to our tax revenues? And then how will we service our debt to creditors like China and others? Most empires fail within before they fail to external enemies, and unless we reverse this war on the working class by our oligarchy, our empire will fail too.\u00a0Though the concerns above came up frequently, they were far from the only ones readers mentioned. Below, a sampling of other readers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 thoughts on the year ahead:Reducing gun violence. About 90 Americans die every DAY from homicide, suicide, and accidents with guns. This dwarfs that of every other developed country. The proliferation of guns is a big reason for this (yes there are other factors too). Despite the fact that most Americans want sensible and enforceable gun laws, Congress refuses to act \u00e2\u0080\u0094 because of the NRA and their ilk. This cannot be blamed on Citizens United, because it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the money \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the political will of a determined few against the apathy of the many. Until Americans stand up (at the ballot box, statehouse, and Congress), they will continue to be injured and killed by guns at theaters, schools, their own homes, and virtually anywhere. We must care enough about our fellow Americans to stop this national suicide.The biggest challenge America faces in 2016: getting people out to vote.We are faced with opportunities to make a difference in various aspects of making our votes count in 2016. The person who is elected to president will no doubt in their tenure have the responsibility to choose and appoint a Supreme Court Justice. There are many ramifications from this choice \u00e2\u0080\u0094 women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reproductive rights, health care opportunities, just election rights, civil rights.People, such as in Wisconsin, have been shown that elections have consequences. Our state was lax in voting. We have been left with government leaders who have taken away jurisdiction over open records, voting, court actions, environmental issues, health care benefits, educational opportunities, workplace statues \u00e2\u0080\u0094 many aspects of our every day living that used to be taken for granted. Perhaps through this turmoil, citizens will realize yes, their votes do make a difference \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and even more, the lack of their votes makes a huge difference.Racism, in all its aspects and manifestations. Implicit racism affects relationships and interactions among people and within communities. Although different ethnic groups experience the negative effects of racism in different degrees and intensities, whenever incidents occur that are horrific or even simply incompatible with what we consider to be commensurate with our American values, it plays a role in virtually every social conflict in the U.S. We need to confront racism openly, honestly and with as much integrity as we can muster. Maybe we can then deal with manifest discrimination.A federal national debt of $20 trillion with no meaningful plan of repayment is a national disgrace. Both parties are to blame. As interest rate rise, the cost of this debt will further squeeze the federal budget for years to come. Just ridiculous. We must cut current spending or raise taxes and embark on a meaningful plan of repayment.Our biggest challenge will be resisting the urge to panic. Terrorists will inevitably strike somewhere, sometime, more than once. We will require calm and resolve, not politicians who seek advantage by scaring us to death, nor public officials who, good intentions aside, cannot display empathy. Never have Franklin Roosevelt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe have nothing to fear but fear itself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d seemed wiser. We have, of course, much more to fear, but fear itself is likely to be the worst danger.Overcoming the widespread ideas that rich people are the root of all evil and that more government is the answer to our problems would be at the top of my list.Right now the biggest challenge is to elect a president who can be trusted to lead this nation with competence \u00e2\u0080\u0094 someone who is rational, sane, level-headed, open-minded \u00e2\u0080\u0094 no cronyism, no ego trips.The greatest challenge is designing a work/home environment in which both mothers and fathers may earn a living and take care of their children and domestic life as a family. The old 40-hour work week model, in which fathers brought home the bacon while dependent-spouse mothers fried it up in a pan, is pass\u00c3\u00a9. Children need to be nurtured by both parents, and females as well as males need to earn our keep and use our talents and skills in the marketplace.In my view the biggest challenge that we face is restoration of our faith in the American way of life. We need to restore our pride in America and our can do ways. We need to restore our confidence in our ability to lead. We need to embrace our emerging diversity as a strength. We need to confidently look to the future and our place in that future. We need to reject talk of fear and rejoice in our ability to confront the overcome the challenges that we will face in the days ahead. As a country we are too good, too strong, too wise to give in to defeatism and negativity. As a country we have been blessed; let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use our blessing to return with strength and confidence to our place as a model for others to emulate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Penn Station\u2019s 5th Redesign Fails to Charm Some Critics", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported byBuilding BlocksThere was so much to pore over during the one-man infrastructure jamboree conducted last week by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo \u2014 apart from the question of how so many public works projects could be designed, engineered, reviewed, approved, financed and constructed \u2014 that it was easy to lose sight of individual proposals.They would also recall the vaulted skylights in the concourse of the original Penn Station, designed by McKim, Mead & White, which opened in 1910 and was demolished in the 1960s.In 1992, an intriguing idea arose. Within Farley, also designed by McKim, Mead & White, was a courtyard that contained a mail-sorting room nearly an acre in extent. Under this room were the westernmost ends of the longer passenger platforms of Penn Station.Why not turn that mail-sorting room into a grand new train hall?This was superseded last week by the latest plan, Farley 5, also by Skidmore, which did not impress longtime station watchers.\u201cFrom \u2018Wow!\u2019 to \u2018Meh\u2019 in five easy steps,\u201d he said. \u201cFarley 5 looks like it was designed by the same people who designed the Port Authority Bus Terminal. It\u2019s really heartbreaking.\u201dYou could argue that Farley 5 is better than Farley 4 because it retains the roof trusses. These would allow the public to visually comprehend the room\u2019s history and its industrial quality. They would also mask the bland courtyard facade, which was never intended to be seen by the public.But saying something is better is not the same as saying it is the best.For the Municipal Art Society and others, the answer is not shoehorning the station into Farley but relocating Madison Square Garden, which has been squashing Penn Station like a bug for the last half-century.In that case, Ms. Rowe said, the latest Farley renderings may be a brilliant use of reverse psychology \u2014 \u201cto galvanize the design community to say we can do something so much better.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Eases Restrictions on Financing Exports to Cuba", "Date": "2016-01-26", "News": "Supported byThe revised rules that will take effect on Wednesday will allow United States banks to provide direct financing for the export of any product other than agricultural commodities, still walled off under the trade embargo.Until now, American products sent to Cuba had to be paid for in advance in cash or routed through a third country, a costly and burdensome process. Items that have been banned for decades because they might benefit the Cuban government, such as textbooks, construction cranes or sanitation equipment, can now be approved by the American government case by case.Mr. Obama is pushing to do as much as possible to normalize relations with Cuba before he leaves office next year. He would like to travel to Cuba before his term ends, a visit that senior officials said would \u201chighlight progress\u201d in the relationship.But each incremental move underscores the steep obstacles facing two countries with fundamentally different governments and economies. American officials said they continued to have concerns about Cuba\u2019s human rights record, including limits on political expression. And they conceded that exports to Cuba would have to be approved and distributed by a state-run ministry.Critics contended that Mr. Obama was skirting Congress and rewarding a dangerous regime. Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey and a son of Cuban immigrants, said the moves would \u201cdo nothing to empower the Cuban people\u201d and would instead provide \u201ctheir oppressors the resources they need to tighten their grip.\u201dAdministration officials said the revised rules would help open Cuba\u2019s economy and government by exposing the country to more American goods, people and ideas.Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said the changes \u201cbuild on successive actions over the last year and send a clear message to the world: The United States is committed to empowering and enabling economic advancements for the Cuban people.\u201dThe regulations were released jointly by the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, which imposes and enforces sanctions, and the Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security, which oversees export controls. The rules also loosen limits on travel between the United States and Cuba and make it simpler to re-establish direct flights under a civil aviation agreement reached late last year.Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker said the action would ease exports for such purposes as disaster preparedness, educational and artistic pursuits, agricultural production and public transportation.\u201cWe will continue to support greater economic independence and increased prosperity for the Cuban people as we take another step toward building a more open and mutually beneficial relationship,\u201d she said in a statement.The rules build on three rounds of regulatory changes that the Obama administration has enacted unilaterally since Mr. Obama and President Ra\u00fal Castro of Cuba announced in December 2014 that their countries would reverse over a half-century of official hostility. Since then, American and Cuban officials have struck agreements to reopen embassies \u2014 a step achieved last summer \u2014 and environmental and civil aviation pacts.Like those announced a year ago, the latest changes relax travel restrictions, although tourism is still prohibited by statute. Americans traveling to Cuba to make films or record music, to organize professional meetings, or to work on cruise ships or airliners will be authorized to make the trips and spend money.The export financing changes will allow American companies for the first time in decades to sell goods directly to Cuban state-run enterprises and to use credit to do so. When Ms. Pritzker led a delegation to Cuba in October, officials there explained that if they needed to buy tractors from a foreign supplier, they would rather purchase them on credit from Brazil, for instance, than pay cash to a United States company, a senior administration official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions.\u201cWe recognize that in allowing some exports that primarily benefit the Cuban people, there may also be some ancillary benefits to the government,\u201d the official said. \u201cBut we\u2019re really focused on those sorts of things that benefit the everyday Cuban.\u201dThe administration said the prohibitions would still apply to exports that would go directly to the Cuban military, the police, or intelligence or security services, or that would generate revenue primarily for the state, such as sugar production.Proponents of the opening with Cuba commended the White House and renewed calls for Congress to lift the embargo, which tightly restricts most trade and commerce and discourages American companies from pursuing even the limited activities that the Obama administration has authorized.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Friend Gave to de Blasio Just as Client Won Permit to Stage Festival", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported byLast week, the company\u2019s Queens application was rejected, along with those of two rival promoters, after local opposition. Instead, A.E.G. Live was given clearance to hold a festival in July on Randalls Island; its rivals, Madison Square Garden and Founders Entertainment, did not receive similar permission to hold their events.On Jan. 11, the day the Randalls concert was announced, Mr. Ickes and his lobbying partner, Janice Enright, contributed $400 to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign account, the limit for a registered lobbyist. Mr. Ickes\u2019s wife, and the wife of his other partner, Kevin McCabe, each gave $4,950, the maximum allowed by law, financial records show.In all, Mr. Ickes, a longtime contributor to Mr. de Blasio, acted as the intermediary for $19,250 in donations in the four days leading up to the announcement that A.E.G. could bring its festival to Randalls Island.Finding the right site for a high-profile music festival can be critical to its success, and Mr. Ickes was not the only lobbyist involved in the concert fight who collected money for the mayor\u2019s campaign. In the fall, Suri Kasirer, a lobbyist for Madison Square Garden, delivered about $56,000 in contributions, and James Capalino, who represents Founders, delivered $29,690.City officials said on Tuesday that the administration assessed each application fairly and without favor. \u201cThe parks department makes decisions on all event permits based on a standard criteria that includes impact on the park and its users,\u201d Karen Hinton, the mayor\u2019s press secretary, said in a statement.There is no limit on how much a lobbyist can bundle for a New York City candidate, and spouses of lobbyists are not restricted in how much they can give, under city campaign finance regulations.The three promoters submitted applications in the fall for a Corona Park event. Community opposition increased, and A.E.G. Live submitted a separate application for a Randalls Island on Jan. 4. Ultimately, parks officials decided not to approve an event in Queens, fearing disruptions to the park.Parks officials say that Randalls Island, already the site of several large music festivals, is an option for any promoter. People briefed on the negotiations, who spoke on the condition of on anonymity to describe private details, said A.E.G.\u2019s rivals were not aware that a Randalls Island date was in play.Tom Russell, a partner of Founders Entertainment whose Governors Ball festival will be on Randalls Island in June, said the city typically \u201chas had a fair and open permitting system for events.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re concerned by the lack of transparency during this recent decision-making process and hope the city would continue to support locally grown businesses,\u201d Mr. Russell added.Madison Square Garden declined to comment; the company did not submit a separate application for Randalls Island.Mr. Ickes, who did not return requests for comment, has a lobbying firm based in Washington, and opened a New York branch after Mr. de Blasio was elected in 2013.A.E.G. Live, which is owned by the Republican donor Philip F. Anschutz, hired Mr. Ickes in 2014; his firm lobbied several city officials and agencies on the company\u2019s behalf, disclosure records show. Since Mr. de Blasio\u2019s election, Mr. Ickes has secured major clients like JPMorgan Chase and Microsoft.Told of the timing of Mr. Ickes\u2019s contributions, Susan Lerner, executive director of Common Cause New York, said she was concerned.\u201cIt smacks of prioritizing the interests of the powerful donors over the public interest,\u201d Ms. Lerner said. \u201cIt seems to be in direct contrast to what the mayor advocates for.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thoughts on a Poland in Flux: Readers Speak Out", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byThere is intense debate in Poland about the direction the country is taking under its new right-wing government, a debate that has spilled over into the European Union and that has raised questions about the direction of democracy in Eastern and Central Europe more than a quarter-century after the fall of the Berlin Wall.The push toward the right and a rise in nationalist fervor has left some Poles feeling disenfranchised and arguing that Poland would be better off cultivating Western alliances. Supporters of the new government, with links to rural Poland and the powerful Catholic church, say that news coverage of their country\u2019s new course has been unfair.More than 1,000 readers responded, bringing to life a conversation about Poland\u2019s direction. Here is a selection. The responses have been edited for length and clarity; those submitted in Polish include a translation.Jestem smutna i zadziwiona tym, jak szybko mo\u017cna podzieli\u0107 Polak\u00f3w na \u201cnas\u201d i \u201cwas,\u201d na \u201clepszych\u201d i \u201cgorszych,\u201d na \u201cpatriot\u00f3w\u201d i \u201czdrajc\u00f3w\u201d.

But it\u2019s beneficial for Law and Justice, so those in power carefully cultivate it and foment animosity on both sides of the conflict.I consider myself a liberal, and although I always vote, there isn\u2019t really a party in Poland that represents my views.The main change is the atmosphere. We are completely polarized as a society, and some of us are triumphant, some of us are worried. Still, a majority don\u2019t care much, as they are uninterested in politics and despise politicians.I am worried that the actions of the government will weaken our international position and hurt our relations with the E.U. This, in turn, will make it much easier for Russia to expand, once again, its influence over Central Europe.Wbrew pozorom ca\u0142kiem sporo si\u0119 zmieni\u0142o. Ludzie powariowali i temat\u00f3w politycznych trzeba unika\u0107 jak ognia. Wi\u0119kszo\u015b\u0107 takich rozm\u00f3w ko\u0144czy si\u0119 k\u0142\u00f3tniami, a do dyskusji o sytuacji w Polsce wszyscy nabrali ostatnio wyj\u0105tkowej ochoty. Pierwszy raz w \u017cyciu jestem autentycznie zm\u0119czony polityk\u0105 i uciekam od niej jak tylko mog\u0119.Contrary to appearances, a lot has changed. People have gone crazy and political subjects need to be avoided at all costs. Most political discussions end with fights, but somehow, people have recently acquired a taste for debates about Poland. For the first time in my life, I am tired of politics, and I try to escape it as much as I can.It makes me remember the Communist era. Government saying that everything is right, when thousands on the streets and experts say the opposite. For the first time since 26 years of freedom, I and my friends are worried about our democracy.I voted for PiS because I believe that Poland is still in the process of transforming from Communism and they are the ones who can finish this process. Eighty percent of our law is written in Brussels. We are being lectured on \u201cdemocracy\u201d by unelected commissars from the E.U. Polish people value liberty above all, and we want to decide on our own. PiS is far from perfect, but the best option yet. Foreign governments will not accept our democratic choices as they affect the interests of many foreign corporations who invest in Poland.As a translator working with E.U. documents and someone who has to care much about words, I feel oppressed by the sheer stupidity of the statements of our current government. Our minister of transport is deeply concerned about chemtrails. Our minister of foreign affairs considers riding a bike and being vegetarian as Marxist. And to add insult to injury, there is also the unbelievable insolence. A former Communist prosecutor is leading the efforts to dismantle the Constitutional Court. A guy involved in the financial schemes now presides the Finance Commission in the Senate. I have stopped listening to the radio and reading newspapers.I feel completely alone. I\u2019m a vegan, a cyclist and an atheist. There is no place for me here anymore. I can\u2019t watch my favorite TV station anymore, the budget in my city is lost due to World Youth Day. We want more bike paths and an Erasmus program! They steal our rights and a diversity rooted in Polish history.I am afraid that soon public media will be exclusively conservative and any other point of view will be treated as an action against the law. I was born in 1993 and have lived my whole life in a free, democratic country, and I want it to stay this way.I am not a fan of PiS, I have not voted for them, but I see major improvement in the quality of public debate in television. Topics that were silenced are now being mentioned even in major news programs (such as Middle Eastern immigration to Europe, anti-E.U. views, etc.).Nigdy nie przypuszcza\u0142em, \u017ce b\u0119d\u0119 bra\u0142 udzia\u0142 w demonstracjach w obronie demokracji. Do tej pory widzia\u0142em takie demonstracje tylko w telewizji \u2014 we wschodniej Europie oraz w archiwach z czas\u00f3w PRL-u. Nie spodziewa\u0142em si\u0119, \u017ce Polska, kt\u00f3ra by\u0142a wzorem dla Europy w walce o demokracj\u0119, mo\u017ce w pewnym momencie t\u0119 demokracj\u0119 zacz\u0105\u0107 traci\u0107.I never imagined that I would be taking part in demonstrations in defense of democracy. So far, I have seen such things only on television \u2014 in Eastern Europe or in historical records from the time of the Polish People\u2019s Republic. I never expected that Poland, which used to be a European role model in the fight for democracy, at some point could start losing this democracy itself.Poland has changed a lot since the Law and Justice Party came to power, mostly for the worse. However, there is one positive thing \u2014 the rise of civic society, which is something we never truly had in the past. Our country has been through a lot in the past, and we as a nation have shown that we will fight for our freedom and values we believe in.I hope that the new government will work on restoring the Polish economy based on our own production. Now, most of the factories in Poland are similar to those in the Far East \u2014 places where people assemble products for big foreign companies, very cheaply.Many of my friends who have never shown an interest in politics are suddenly paying very close attention. The changes here are alarming, and the mounting xenophobia a source of concern to expats who have made their home here.Jako osoba w homoseksualnym zwi\u0105zku boj\u0119 si\u0119 o moje \u017cycie i wolno\u015b\u0107.

{"Headline": "Underestimating Cruz and Trump: A Post-Mortem", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceThe two instead resemble the far-right or populist Republican candidates who have soared in early polls and sometimes even won a few primaries, but not the nomination. Think Pat Robertson in 1988, Pat Buchanan in 1996, Mike Huckabee in 2008 or Rick Santorum in 2012.I and the other Trump-Cruz doubters assumed the present would resemble the past because the present usually does end up resembling the past. Claims of \u201cthis time is different\u201d are wrong vastly more often than they\u2019re right. But they\u2019re not always wrong.Every recent nominee, in both parties, has done well in the invisible primary. Sometimes, the eventual nominee has won the invisible primary in a rout, as George W. Bush and Al Gore both did in 2000 and Mitt Romney did in 2012. Other times, the nominee has won it more narrowly or finished as a strong second (Barack Obama in 2008).By contrast, early poll leaders who flailed in the invisible primary, including Herman Cain and Newt Gingrich in 2012, faded. Capturing the public\u2019s attention for weeks or even months at a time wasn\u2019t enough to get them anywhere near the nomination.The invisible primary has mattered so much because it has been both a sign of strength and a source of strength. It\u2019s a sign of strength because party elites pay much closer attention to the presidential campaign in the early months than voters do. The elites make judgments about which candidates are strongest \u2014 with the best message and delivery \u2014 that many voters end up sharing.But it\u2019s also not entirely coincidental that voters tend to make the same choices as party leaders. Voters are influenced by the money, endorsements and good publicity that flow to the winners of the invisible primary. Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump never had a chance to fare well in the invisible primary, which made many of us believe the nomination was beyond their reach.Today\u2019s Republican Party, however, may be different from the party of the recent past.One factor is that some Republican elites have become radicalized in similar ways to the Republican base. Another is that elites who disagree with the party establishment can probably have a greater influence than in the past. The rise of inequality has created more deep-pocketed potential conservative donors, while the loosening of campaign-finance rules has made it easier for those donors to give large sums.There is still a good chance that the original Trump-Cruz skepticism will look good in hindsight. Perhaps Republican voters are simply spending more time this year flirting with unorthodox candidates, but will settle on a more typical candidate once the voting begins. And the party establishment still has levers \u2014 money, publicity, superdelegates \u2014 to influence the race. In a protracted contest, the establishment will pull many of those levers for Marco Rubio, Chris Christie or Jeb Bush.If one of them wins \u2014 an outcome that the prediction markets give a 44 percent chance of happening \u2014 it will be yet another sign of the importance of the invisible primary. It will mean people like me were right about a lot of things, and it will then be easy for us to claim that we were right all along.We weren\u2019t. The invisible primary is important, and it will remain important in future elections. But even if Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump ultimately lose, their success shows how politics occasionally changes. Large, unhappy portions of the Republican party have drifted from the establishment and grabbed some power from it. The past, as a result, is a less reliable guide to the future than it once was.Advertisement"}

The cause was heart failure. Mr. Horner was born on April 8, 1934 in Marquette, KS to Harriet and Marion Horner. He attended the University of Kansas\n                                        on baseball and football scholarships where he graduated in 1956 with a B.S. in business. He was a member of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity. He is also a graduate of the Stanford University Executive Program. During\n                                        his 35 years with KPMG (Peat Marwick Mitchell & Co.), Mr. Horner rose from entry-level accountant to Chairman and CEO. He was among the first in the accounting profession to foresee the globalization of markets\n                                        and the need for worldwide accounting standards, and he engineered the firm&aposs merger with Klynveld Main Goerdeler in 1987, forming KPMG and serving as the combined company&aposs Chairman and CEO as well as\n                                        Chairman and CEO of KPMG International. Subsequent to his retirement from KPMG in 1991, Mr. Horner served as Chairman and CEO of several private and public companies involved in international finance, real estate\n                                        and manufacturing.

{"Headline": "Sanders Makes a Rare Pitch: More Taxes for More Government", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceSenator Bernie Sanders\u2019s health care plan is advancing a notion that has long been out of fashion in American politics: that the federal government should provide a new, expensive service to most Americans, and that it should levy significantly higher taxes on most Americans to provide that service.He is proposing a health care plan that would require over a trillion dollars a year in new, broad-based taxes applying to nearly all Americans who work. His main opponent, Hillary Clinton, has reiterated President Barack Obama\u2019s pledge not to raise taxes even on many affluent families, setting her cutoff for tax increases at $250,000.According to revenue estimates provided by the campaign, $238 billion of his new revenues would come from taxes focused specifically on people making more than $250,000 a year or inheriting estates larger than $3.5 million.Income tax rates would get progressively higher at the top, maxing out at 52 percent for people making over $10 million per year. (Currently, the maximum federal income tax rate is 39.6 percent.) Mr. Sanders would eliminate tax preferences for capital gains for people making over $250,000, and also limit the value of tax deductions they could take.Still, this wouldn\u2019t be the main source of financing for his plan. Most of the new revenue, about $1.15 trillion a year, would come from broad-based taxes: $630 billion from a 6.2 percent employer-paid tax on payrolls; $210 billion from a 2.2 percent income tax, applied to the existing taxable income base; and $310 billion from the elimination of existing tax preferences for health benefits.The third item is a somewhat complicated idea: Currently, health insurance benefits are exempt from both income and payroll taxes. If employers didn\u2019t need to pay for health insurance, economists generally believe that, in the long run, their spending on health insurance would shift into taxable wages and salaries. That is, eliminating employer-based health insurance would cause wages and salaries to go up.Under Mr. Sanders\u2019s plan, employers would need to use some of the money they were spending on health insurance to pay the new 6.2 percent payroll tax, but this would be less than what they\u2019re spending on health insurance now. If the difference went into higher wages, that would mean $310 billion a year in new income and payroll taxes, on average over the next 10 years.This is key to the Sanders argument. His plan isn\u2019t just a big new government program paid for by big new taxes. It would replace private spending on health care, which is currently a huge burden on employees and employers. Yes, employees would pay some new taxes, and employers would pay a new payroll tax that would eat into wages, but it wouldn\u2019t eat into wages as much as health insurance premiums do now. Employers would have extra cash to hand out raises, more than offsetting the new taxes employees would have to pay.Jared Bernstein, an economist at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, argued there were reasons to think a move to single payer would lift economic growth by making the health care sector more efficient, even if it required large tax increases.\u201cPeople have correctly raised the caveat that restructuring the health care industry would be incredibly disruptive and shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly, but I don\u2019t think anyone who has taken a good look at that industry and compared the numbers to other countries would disagree that we could create a lot of efficiencies,\u201d he said.If Mr. Sanders\u2019s plan failed to contain costs as much as he projected, it would be significantly more expensive and require significantly more in tax increases than he has already proposed. It would also do less to increase economic growth.Alan Viard, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, raised another concern. Mr. Sanders\u2019s tax increases might not raise as much revenue as the campaign anticipated because of how the tax changes would change taxpayers\u2019 behavior. That is, individual high-income taxpayers could delay sales of assets to avoid creating taxable capital gains, and higher taxes could reduce economic activity and taxable income over all.A spokesman for the Sanders campaign said they did not make dynamic assumptions in modeling their plan. That is, while they estimated there would be an increase in taxable wages, they did not assume that changes to the health care system would cause the economy to grow over all, nor did they assume that higher tax rates would shrink the economy.\u201cI might not think the effects are as big as they\u2019re going to say,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you have to think there would be some adverse effects.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Finally Buys TV Ads, and Lots of Them", "Date": "2016-01-04", "News": "After months of waiting, Donald J. Trump has followed through on his promise to advertise, and advertise big, in early voting states in January. Mr. Trump, the front-runner in many polls for the Republican presidential nomination, had promised to spend at least $2 million a week on advertising; he has already reserved $1,996,165 in ads through Jan. 12, according to Elizabeth Wilner, a senior vice president at Kantar Media/CMAG, which tracks TV advertising. Several media buyers, some with rival campaigns and some independent contractors, called the television airtime substantial. Mr. Trump is not at saturation levels in many of the markets, but his level of ad buys are competitive with the other candidates.And he is acting on his own; while other candidates such as Jeb Bush and Senator Marco Rubio are supported by \u201csuper PACs\u201d advertising on their behalf, Mr. Trump has scorned help from outside groups after controversy surrounded a super PAC with ties to his campaign.  He reserved more than $1 million worth of air time in Iowa, with roughly $750,000 placed across seven broadcast markets and an additional $310,000 on 10 cable networks across the state. In New Hampshire, Mr. Trump has reserved about $550,000 worth of air time on broadcast television, with the majority in the Boston market. Additionally, he reserved more than $300,000 on cable in New Hampshire, across more than 10 networks. And he is currently in the process of reserving more radio ads in the state as well. Cable spending tends to be more targeted than broadcast spots and requires a level of sophistication. Dave Neal, the main strategist with Strategic Media Services, which placed Mr. Trump\u2019s spending, has been described by colleagues as a veteran of political niche buying. Mr. Trump\u2019s team appears to be buying week to week. He has placed ads on Fox News, the obvious target for his main audience, but also on ESPN, the Food Network and the History Channel.Either way, he faced skepticism about whether he would devote significant financial resources to advertising, and the $2 million in airtime buys could dispel those doubts for now. He said in an interview on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday that he felt \u201calmost guilty\u201d about how little had spent so far. According to the most recently available filings, as of the end of September, Mr. Trump had lent his campaign roughly $2 million, but it took in $4 million in donations. Political ads serve as repetitive reinforcement of a campaign\u2019s message. And for all the focus on Mr. Trump\u2019s free time on cable television, it isn\u2019t the same as a controlled, 30-second spot delivered into people\u2019s homes. \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

She will be a part of the company\u2019s nominating and corporate governance committee as well as its finance and investment committee, SunEdison said.A seat at the table will give Mr. Einhorn the chance to turn things around, for both his investors and the company.Mr. Einhorn is not the only one to have suffered a blow from SunEdison last year. And he is not the only voice to go up against the company, which has become a so-called hedge fund hotel, with more than 160 hedge funds in the stock in September, according to report by the research firm Novus.David Tepper and his firm, Appaloosa Management, are investors in TerraForm Power, a subsidiary of SunEdison, and filed a lawsuit this month over some details involving TerraForm\u2019s acquisition of Vivint Solar, a rooftop panel installer.As part of the deal with Greenlight Capital, SunEdison will not be able to issue equity without the approval of nearly all of its board members over a two-year period. This will take effect after it has finished its acquisition of Vivint Solar.Emmanuel T. Hernandez, the executive chairman of SunEdison\u2019s board, said on Wednesday that the move \u201cmakes clear our unequivocal commitment to SunEdison and its common shareholders.\u201dHe added, \u201cAs we work to navigate current market conditions, we are very pleased that we will have the benefit of tapping the expertise of a highly qualified director endorsed by a significant shareholder.\u201dLast year was a particularly rough one for Mr. Einhorn. Halfway through 2015, it appeared as if SunEdison would be a bright spot in his otherwise beleaguered portfolio of stocks. He called it in a letter to investors \u201cour only significant winner\u201d at the time as the stock moved from $24 a share to $29.91 a share over the second quarter. On Tuesday night before SunEdison announced the change to its board, its stock had closed at $3.05.In that same letter last summer, Mr. Einhorn urged investors to sit tight and signed off with a quote from the inventor Thomas A. Edison: \u201cA diamond is a piece of coal that stuck to the job.\u201dA veteran in the hedge fund industry, Ms. Gogel worked for Discovery Technology Fund, and founded a long-short equity hedge fund called Perennial Advisors.

But he is perhaps best known for his battle against New Century Financial, the mortgage company. In 2006, after threatening to wage a proxy war and oust three directors from New Century Financial, the company made him a director.One year later, as the subprime market was imploding and New Century\u2019s stock was plunging, Mr. Einhorn resigned from the lender\u2019s board five days after it disclosed that federal authorities had opened a criminal probe looking into accounting irregularities. A month later the company filed for bankruptcy.Gaining a seat on the board of a company has not always been a successful move for other hedge fund managers. William A.

{"Headline": "Chinese Stocks Fall Sharply, Leading Asian Markets Lower", "Date": "2016-01-26", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s stock market sank on Tuesday amid accumulating evidence of the Chinese economy\u2019s deeply rooted troubles and as the central bank pushed huge sums of money into the banking system.The drop took Chinese stocks to their lowest level in 13 months. It followed a sell-off in the United States on Monday that was caused by a fall in the price of oil, an indicator of global economic health. But it also comes at a time of lingering market volatility in China stemming from growth concerns and questions about Beijing\u2019s ability to manage its markets.European shares were down slightly in midday trading, while futures trading suggested that Wall Street stocks could be set to fall on Tuesday. Oil also resumed its decline on Tuesday in Asian trading, dropping less than 1 percent after falling beneath the psychologically important $30 level earlier in the Asian trading day.China\u2019s economy grew last year at the slowest pace in 25 years. Among other problems, it has a glut of old-line factories that make products like steel, glass and cement. That industrial overcapacity stems from years of debt-financed investment in industries that now show little sign that they can repay those loans.Beijing, which is seeking to rebalance its economy to focus more on consumer spending and services, is slowly moving to address those concerns. The country\u2019s State Council, or cabinet, decided on Sunday that it would close 100 million to 150 million tons of steel-making capacity. That is enough capacity to potentially rival the total annual steel output of Japan, the world\u2019s No. 2 steel maker, which totaled 110.7 million tons in 2014.By contrast, China produced 804 million tons of steel last year, even as demand faltered. Over all, China\u2019s steel-making capacity was set to reach 1.17 billion tons last year, according to estimates from Fitch Ratings.Li Xinchuang, the head of the China Metallurgical Industry Planning and Research Institute, told the official Xinhua news agency that the planned steel mill closings could cost 400,000 jobs. \u201cLarge-scale redundancies in the steel sector could threaten social stability,\u201d he warned.The State Council decision, which was released on Monday, also called for large reductions in coal mining capacity, without providing a target figure.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.China\u2019s markets are falling even as policy makers are attempting to rein in soaring capital outflows prompted by investors\u2019 seeking to avoid China\u2019s slowing growth and wide expectations that its currency will weaken. Excluding foreign investment, capital outflows probably rose to as much as $900 billion in 2015, economists at Standard Chartered wrote Tuesday in a research note.In response to the outflows, China\u2019s central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, has been eating into its reserves at a record pace in recent months. The central bank is selling dollars in an effort to prop up the value of the Chinese currency, the renminbi, which is under pressure to depreciate as China\u2019s growth prospects weaken.China\u2019s stock markets have also suffered from worries about whether the government will eventually allow the sale of a flood of additional shares. Government-backed groups have been buying shares since last summer in an unsuccessful effort to stem the markets\u2019 decline. That has raised the government\u2019s overall holdings at a time when many economic reformers had hoped the government would privatize more companies to increase efficiency.China\u2019s large private-equity funds also have a large and growing backlog of companies for which they would like to conduct initial public offerings, so as to exit their investments and pay back investors. \u201cThe exit numbers are too low compared to what has been invested,\u201d said David Brown, a PricewaterhouseCoopers partner who leads the consulting firm\u2019s greater China private equity group.Shanghai\u2019s main share index plunged in late trading on Tuesday to close down 6.4 percent, at a new one-year low. Japan\u2019s main share index closed 2.4 percent lower, while stocks in Hong Kong closed down about 2.5 percent.Investors in Asia were reacting in part to the sell-off in the United States on Monday, where the Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.3 percent and the broader Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-share index closed 1.6 percent lower.The renewed volatility in China\u2019s markets comes after a senior Chinese leader sought to reassure investors that the government would curb volatility.The FTSE 100 index in Britain was down 0.7 percent at midday, and the Euro Stoxx 50 index had fallen 0.3 percent.Advertisement"}

(\u201cWe talk at the end of the night,\u201d Mr. Cruz told an Iowa crowd recently, \u201cand typically we say, \u2018O.K., where are you today?\u2019 \u201d)In recent weeks, Mrs. Cruz, 43, has joined her husband for appearances in Iowa and across the South, often introducing him with their two daughters, 5 and 7, fussing at her sides.After about a decade as a financial adviser to the wealthy clients of Goldman Sachs, she has become a fund-raising power, specializing in soliciting maximum contributions from well-heeled donors.Mr. Cruz\u2019s allies and campaign aides describe her less as a \u201csecret weapon,\u201d the typical characterization of a political spouse, than as an all-purpose surrogate and strategist to be deployed as often as possible.Indeed, as Mr. Cruz emerges as a top contender in the Republican presidential field, there is no more vital supporter than his wife \u2014 the high-achieving partner who sacrificed her own ambitions, at considerable personal cost, to advance her husband\u2019s.\u201cGod leads you to where he can use you the most,\u201d she said in an interview last week. \u201cAnd it may not look exactly like you\u2019d expect.\u201dHer background in finance has proved useful: Quite at ease asking for large sums of money, Mrs. Cruz makes as many as 10 calls a day seeking the maximum contribution couples can make to the campaign.\u201cThe $10,800 contributions is my lane,\u201d she said.Inside the campaign, Mrs. Cruz has built a model that seems lifted from Wall Street, with donors labeled \u201cinvestors\u201d who are privy to \u201cquarterly investor meetings\u201d to discuss the \u201cproduct.\u201dShe also helped recruit an important fund-raiser, Lila Ontiveros, after Ms. Ontiveros left Goldman Sachs.Last spring, Mrs. Cruz took an unpaid leave of absence from Goldman, immediately focusing on fund-raising for the campaign. By the fall, she had begun appearing often at her own public events and, on occasion, taking their daughters to accompany Mr. Cruz at his.\u201cIt was deemed helpful by the campaign just to begin to show our family a little bit,\u201d she said, \u201cand to speak to voters on why I, as probably the person closest to Ted, see him as the person who should be leading our country.\u201dA Tough TransitionMrs. Cruz\u2019s business savvy showed early in life. As a 6-year-old in San Luis Obispo, Calif., she began operating a bustling bread stand, baking for four hours each day with her brother after school.\u201cShe stood out for knowing where she wanted to go,\u201d said Edward Haley, an international relations professor at Claremont McKenna and a longtime mentor. \u201cThe only question was how to find those opportunities.\u201dMrs. Cruz responded, \u201cIf you really want to keep in touch, I want to talk to you every day.\u201dBy May 2001, the Cruzes were married. Over the next several years, their union was tested.As Mrs. Cruz climbed the ranks of the Bush administration, eventually working at the National Security Council under Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Cruz\u2019s Washington track stalled, prompting him to return to Texas, where in 2003 he was appointed solicitor general, an influential post.The pair had reached a crossroads: Mrs. Cruz had made it in Washington. Mr. Cruz had made it in Texas.After the couple spent more than a year commuting to see each other, Mrs. Cruz diverted her career path to join her husband in Texas \u2014 taking on the challenge of returning to the financial services industry after years away. She initially joined Merrill Lynch in Houston, about 160 miles from Mr. Cruz\u2019s job in Austin.\u201cI was living in a city by myself again,\u201d she said in an interview, \u201cand that is sort of a strange circumstance to move to be with your spouse but then, like, not be with your spouse.\u201dBut Mrs. Cruz has seldom discussed the full toll of that transition and, in particular, the night of Aug. 22, 2005, when the Austin police fielded a call about a woman in a pink shirt with her head in her hands, sitting near an expressway.\u201cI don\u2019t have years and years of major suffering from this,\u201d she said, \u201cand I want to use it to strengthen people around me and to recognize that we all have rough patches.\u201dMrs. Cruz described seeking comfort in her faith and the company of those close to her, particularly a sister-in-law.Asked how Mr. Cruz had supported her, Mrs. Cruz called him \u201cpatient\u201d with what seemed like a \u201cweird decision, to say, \u2018Let\u2019s stay together and move home, but not move to the same city.\u2019 \u201d\u201cHe would just listen and give me a hug and say, \u2018I want to do whatever you want to do,\u2019 \u201d she recalled. \u201c \u2018And if you want to live in Houston to be at an investment bank, it\u2019ll be harder for me to not have you in Austin. But if that\u2019s what you want, let\u2019s do that.\u2019 \u201dRebounding in TexasIt did not take long for Mrs. Cruz to find her footing. She soon joined Goldman Sachs, where she was early to arrive each day and among the last to leave, impressing her boss at the time, Peter Coneway, who helped recruit her to the firm in 2005 and later recommended her to lead the office.Mr. Coneway recalled Mrs. Cruz\u2019s thriving in a region where the money management industry was largely a men\u2019s club.Amid their hectic schedules, the Cruzes started a family. When their daughters were born, some assumed that it would signal a professional change for Mrs. Cruz, but with the help of nannies, it did not.\u201cJust the fact that I came back from maternity leave was shocking to everyone in Houston,\u201d Mrs. Cruz said. She said having live-in help had allowed the Cruzes to take on more than some families could imagine.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.On the campaign trail, Mrs. Cruz can appear at turns upbeat and disarmingly sincere. Greeting supporters at a luncheon recently in Andover, Mass., she toggled between the warm, conspiratorial tone of a close friend and the campaign fluency of an operative. When a young volunteer based in Boston told her that it was tough to be a Cruz supporter in such a liberal city, Mrs. Cruz suggested a potential pitch.\u201cTed being a constitutionalist helps you a lot in places like Boston \u2014 10th Amendment, back to the states,\u201d she said, as if confiding a secret.\u201cI\u2019ll definitely try that out,\u201d the girl said, looking relieved.Between public appearances, Mrs. Cruz cajoles officials for coveted endorsements and travels, with or without Mr. Cruz, to meet potential donors.In recent weeks, Mrs. Cruz headlined a luncheon at a home in Los Angeles and a fund-raiser in Dallas. She was the guest of honor at an intimate reception in downtown Seattle. Between events, she phoned scores of donors, focusing on the ones most likely to give the maximum $10,800.\u201cMy role is very simple,\u201d Mrs. Cruz said. \u201cDoing whatever I can do to help Ted win.\u201dJonathan Martin, Jeremy Merrill and Ashley Parker contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Break From Big Rallies, Bernie Sanders Hits Iowa Plains by Bus", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported by\u201cWe got a new bus out there,\u201d Mr. Sanders said, referring to the coach with the Obama-echoing slogan \u201cA Future to Believe In\u201d written on the side. Saying he would take the bus to meetings with voters all over the state in the two weeks left before the caucus, Mr. Sanders added: \u201cIt is very different than other buses that I have ridden on, let me tell you that. You can walk around \u2014 comfortable seats.\u201dA luxury bus driving him to Carroll and Underwood and Sioux City is not the only thing different for Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign. After closing the gap with Mrs. Clinton in Iowa polls and taking a lead in New Hampshire, the anti-establishment Mr. Sanders, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist who for months refused to bring a pollster onto his campaign staff, spoke about his positive numbers with the gusto of Donald J. Trump.And despite vowing not to go negative against fellow Democrats, he answered Mrs. Clinton\u2019s attacks on his record by relishing her apparent decline (\u201cThe inevitable candidate,\u201d he said, \u201cis today not quite so inevitable\u201d) and explicitly questioning her foreign policy judgment (\u201cExperience does not necessarily equate to judgment\u201d). He also noted her connection to Goldman Sachs, which he argued symbolized the corrosive effect money had on American politics.In making the case that he was best positioned to take on Mr. Trump should he be the Republican nominee, Mr. Sanders, 74, sounded not unlike Mr. Trump, the real estate mogul and poll-obsessed reality star.\u201cIf you look into some of the polls that are coming out, and just, I think, a poll yesterday or the day before, we were defeating Donald Trump in a national poll by 15 points,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in the Opera House at the Fort Museum in Fort Dodge. Mrs. Clinton, on the other hand, was defeating Mr. Trump by 10 points, he said.\u201cSo I\u2019m glad that she\u2019s defeating him by 10 points, that\u2019s good,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s better that I\u2019m defeating him by 15. Another poll had me ahead of him by 13 points; she was up by seven. And in Iowa and New Hampshire, those battleground states, we were doing much better against Republicans than she is.\u201dAt Santa Maria, a restaurant and winery in Carroll in the western part of the state, Mr. Sanders added, \u201cI\u2019m not all that much into polls and all that stuff, but the last two national polls that came out,\u201d before trailing off. At the event, where he received a warm response in a large, packed room, he drew laughs when tacitly skewering Mrs. Clinton.\u201cAnd by the way, without naming any names, Goldman Sachs also provides very, very generous speaking fees to some unnamed candidates, very generous,\u201d he said to laughter. \u201cI know that some of my opponents are very good speakers, very fine orators, very smart people, but you got to be really, really, really good to get $225,000 a speech. That\u2019s all I\u2019ll say.\u201d\u201cI thought it was $600,000?\u201d a man in the audience called out.\u201cThat\u2019s for three speeches,\u201d Mr. Sanders said with a smile.But mostly, Mr. Sanders, who bitterly mentioned the news media\u2019s early depiction of him as a grumpy fringe protest candidate (\u201ca GQ kind of guy,\u201d he said sarcastically) seemed pleased with the present state of affairs.\u201cI\u2019m feeling good,\u201d he told the crowd in Carroll. \u201cWhat can I tell you?\u201dMr. Sanders began the day in Fort Dodge in a chilly room filled to capacity. Though the crowd was a mix of ages, on the stage behind Mr. Sanders, most of the 18 people seated under a sign that read \u201cA Future to Believe In\u201d appeared to be in their 20s or even their teens.After giving his first of the day\u2019s four stump speeches, highlighting the wrongs of society and calling for free college tuition, free universal health care and a campaign finance system that would set them right, a woman asked how he would get his proposals through a Republican-held Congress.Mr. Sanders gave his stock answer, that a political revolution would sweep more progressives into office along with him.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.\u201cI wish it would be that way,\u201d Jane Nettleton, 72, the Clinton supporter who had asked the question, said afterward. \u201cWhat he is doing is very idealistic and not very realistic.\u201d (Her husband, Don, was apparently more idealistic. \u201cI\u2019m going to caucus for Bernie,\u201d he said.)Rick Pawletzki, 58, a landlord from Carroll who said he had been campaigning for Democrats since John Kerry, said he had yet to see such a crowd in his hometown. Before the event, he said that he thought Mrs. Clinton would have a better chance against the Republican nominee, and that he preferred her more incremental approach to health care by improving on the Affordable Care Act. But after Mr. Sanders\u2019s speech, during which he lavished praise on President Obama, Mr. Pawletzki announced himself leaning toward Mr. Sanders.\u201cI\u2019m confident that something could get done if he\u2019s elected,\u201d he said.Expressing disgust at Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about Latinos, Muslims and Mr. Obama\u2019s natural-born citizenship, which he said was an attack on African-Americans, he added, \u201cI think we would defeat him, and I think we would defeat him with rather large numbers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It may also get a first look at some of the divestitures that may be required from the Media General deal with Nexstar.That agreement, however, was contingent on Meredith terminating its agreement with Media General. It took several weeks and a last-ditch attempt by Meredith for its own sweetened proposal, but Meredith eventually abandoned the deal.Nexstar agreed to acquire all outstanding shares of Media General for $10.55 a share in cash and 0.1249 of a share of Nexstar common stock for each Media General share. Based on Tuesday\u2019s closing stock price of Nexstar, the deal values Media General at about $16.69 a share. The company also has about $2.3 billion in debt, according to data compiled by Standard & Poor\u2019s Capital IQ.The companies valued the deal at $4.6 billion. The agreement also includes the potential for contingent value rights that will entitle Media General shareholders to the proceeds from an auction of spectrum by the Federal Communications Commission.Nexstar has received committed financing of $4.7 billion from Bank of America, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank.Bank of America served as the financial adviser to Nexstar, while RBC Capital Markets and Goldman Sachs worked with Media General.

{"Headline": "A Former Mexican Governor Is Arrested, but Not by His Own Country", "Date": "2016-01-21", "News": "Supported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 The anticorruption police swooped in on Humberto Moreira, a former Mexican governor notorious for multiplying his state\u2019s debt by 100 times in six years. The accusations were severe: among them, money laundering and misuse of public funds.Bail was denied.But there was an asterisk to the news that Mr. Moreira might be held accountable for how he spent the torrent of borrowed money that flowed into his state, Coahuila. He was arrested last Friday at the international airport in Madrid, not in Mexico, and it was the Spanish police who succeeded in building a case against him after Mexico\u2019s attorney general said there was no evidence to charge him.In Mexico, the news was greeted with a mixture of approval and shame. Although diminished by disgrace, Mr. Moreira had remained untouchable, a political ally of President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto who had helped build Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s 2012 candidacy.His arrest in Spain only served to underscore the weakness of Mexico\u2019s institutions when it comes to confronting corruption among the political class.\u201cMoreira is the prototype and synonym of corruption in Mexico,\u201d Juan E. Pardinas, director of the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness, said on Tuesday. \u201cHe is also the prototype of impunity. One of the big challenges is to build a rule of law and to transform the rule of impunity so the 13th- or 14th-largest economy in the world doesn\u2019t have to outsource to other countries the prosecution of these prototypes.\u201dMr. Moreira, 49, faces a hearing in Spain\u2019s National Court on Friday before the judge in charge of the investigation, Santiago Pedraz, who is expected to decide whether to release him from jail to await trial.Whether intentionally or not, the Spanish National Police\u2019s announcement of Mr. Moreira\u2019s arrest on Twitter seemed to taunt Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto. The announcement concluded, \u201c#missionaccomplished,\u201d the same phrase the Mexican president had proudly used to break the news of Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s arrest.The prospect of a long trial in Spain that opens up Mr. Moreira\u2019s finances to scrutiny could refocus public attention here on official corruption, an issue that has dogged the government since scandals in late 2014 over luxury homes that Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s wife and finance minister bought from a government contractor.Spanish prosecutors say that Mr. Moreira opened at least three bank accounts in Spain that received transfers of almost 200,000 euros, or $217,000, from two Mexican companies. Along with records of the transfers, the evidence against Mr. Moreira includes police wiretaps, according to court documents.At the first hearing after his arrest, Mr. Moreira said that the businesses were his and that the money had gone toward living expenses, court records show. Mr. Moreira rented an upscale property in 2013 in a suburb of Barcelona while studying for a master\u2019s degree there.Until then, Mr. Moreira had spent his career in government. In 2005, when he became governor of Coahuila, on the Texas border, he embarked on ambitious spending programs. They were unsustainable, said Javier Garza, a journalist in Torre\u00f3n, a city in Coahuila, but \u201cthey contributed to creating a network of political patronage.\u201dMr. Moreira left office to become the president of the Institutional Revolutionary Party early in 2011, uniting the party, known as the P.R.I., behind Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto as its presidential candidate.Coahuila borrowed most heavily in 2010, a year when more than a third of Mexico\u2019s states elected new governors. \u201cThe next year, he was elected president of the P.R.I.,\u201d Mr. Garza said. \u201cHe was the only candidate. He didn\u2019t get there without support.\u201d Although the state hid the debt until after Mr. Moreira left office and evidence emerged that documents had been falsified to show approval from the Coahuila State Congress for the loans, prosecutors cleared Mr. Moreira just before Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto took office.In June, the United States attorney\u2019s office in San Antonio unsealed a plea-bargain agreement with a Coahuila businessman, Rolando Gonz\u00e1lez Trevi\u00f1o. He said that he had sold a stake in a chain of local radio stations to Mr. Moreira for $1.84 million and that the money had been wired to accounts in Texas. The plea agreement alleged that a co-conspirator, referred to as CC1, who was the governor of Coahuila had stolen \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of dollars from the state.Kent A. Schaffer, Mr. Moreira\u2019s lawyer in Houston, said this week that those allegations were false. \u201cThese are people who in large part, to extricate themselves from their own legal problems, claim to be working at the behest of the governor,\u201d he said. The charges in Spain, he added, had come as a surprise.Elisabeth Malkin reported from Mexico City, and Raphael Minder from Madrid. Susan Beachy contributed research from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iggy Pop and Josh Homme Team Up for \u2018Post Pop Depression\u2019", "Date": "2016-01-21", "News": "Supported by\u201cWe\u2019re hanging on by the skin of our teeth, but we\u2019re making it through,\u201d Mr. Homme recalled of the group\u2019s initial practice with its singer a few days later. \u201cAnd by the time we get to \u2018Lust for Life,\u2019 we\u2019re all sweating and dancing around with this moronic look on our faces. Iggy looked over at me and \u2026\u201d Mr. Homme mimed a wink and a half-concealed thumbs up. \u201cWith Iggy, compliments are not forthcoming. It was a real moment.\u201dThe new songs are from \u201cPost Pop Depression\u201d (Loma Vista), an album Mr. Pop and Mr. Homme wrote and recorded together with utmost secrecy and full independence, which is scheduled to be released in March. Its music shows both songwriters\u2019 clear fingerprints: the pithy, hard-nosed clarity of Mr. Pop\u2019s lyrics and the unflinching tone of his voice; and the crispness, angularity and deft convolutions of Mr. Homme\u2019s chords and melodies. (The group will be making its debut on \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert\u201d Thursday night.)In some ways, \u201cPost Pop Depression\u201d also picks up where \u201cLust for Life\u201d left off. \u201cWhere those records pointed, it stopped,\u201d Mr. Homme said. \u201cBut without copying it,\u201d he continued, \u201cthat direction actually goes for miles. And when you keep going for miles you can\u2019t see these two records any more.\u201dThe lyrics reflect on memories, hint at characters and offer advice and confessions; they can be hard-nosed, remorseful, flippant, combative or philosophical. The album\u2019s theme, Mr. Pop said, is: \u201cWhat happens after your years of service? And where is the honor?\u201dOffstage, Mr. Pop is slighter and calmer than the hyperactive rocker he becomes in concert. His face is lined, his long hair unfussy; he has a professorial pair of eyeglasses. He answers questions thoughtfully, with a clear gaze, an occasional self-deprecating laugh and a vocabulary far more elaborate than the monosyllables that nail down his songs; he quoted de Tocqueville and the French author Michel Houellebecq.He continued: \u201cIn American life, because it\u2019s so hypercompetitive, what happens when you\u2019re finally useless to everyone except hopefully not yourself? What happens then? And can you continue to be of use to yourself? I had a kind of character in mind. It was sort of a cross between myself and a military veteran.\u201dPreparing \u201cPost Pop Depression\u201d was one thing that helped him cope with the aftermath of the attacks. \u201cThe fact that I had this to work on, it saved me,\u201d he said.Mr. Homme and Mr. Pop began writing and recording together last January, staying private. They financed the project without a record label. \u201cWe paid for whatever ourselves,\u201d Mr. Pop said. \u201cBut it was made to be heard \u2014 not to be some quirky thing that we did with our own money, ha-ha.\u201dThe result, Mr. Pop told Mr. Homme in a conversation after the rehearsal, was that \u201cyou took me to a place I\u2019d never been.\u201dMr. Homme replied: \u201cThis was to go where neither of us had gone before. That was the agreement. And to go all the way.\u201dLater, at a separate interview at Mr. Homme\u2019s Pink Duck studio in Burbank \u2014 surrounded by odd-brand guitars and amplifiers and his grandmother\u2019s paintings \u2014 Mr. Homme was more laudatory about Mr. Pop. \u201cHe is the last one of the one-of-a-kinds,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a much deserved victory lap for a man who\u2019s not sure if he won. But he did. He may have tunneled underground for lots of that, but he still got to the destination.\u201dFor Mr. Homme, making the album was an unexpected culmination of years of admiration for Mr. Pop\u2019s music. For Mr. Pop, it was a musical test.He had been living in Miami with his wife, at first spending long stretches doing nothing but going to the beach. But exposure via the Internet and commercials \u2014 \u201cpeople learn about music in those 10-second chunks,\u201d he said \u2014 gave the Stooges and Mr. Pop\u2019s solo albums a surge of popularity in the 2010s, he explained. But he wanted to make new music, for at least one more time: \u201cI was feeling challenged at this point in my life to prove my value as a musical artist, not as a symbol of anything.\u201dHow would he assess his own service?\u201cI did two good things,\u201d he said. \u201cI went out and actually delivered a real show to people in a real place where they don\u2019t forget it. I know because they come back and tell me. I put boots on the ground for many, many, many, many years and did something a little different.\u201dHe continued: \u201cThe other thing I did was, I stuck with something through difficulty \u2014 probably caused by myself mostly \u2014 but nonetheless to a point where a lot of mature people, especially men, come up to me wherever I am, and they pay respect for that. People feel I stuck with something for them, that is of use to them. It doesn\u2019t have too much to do with reality, but it is of use to them.\u201dIn a new song called \u201cSunday,\u201d Mr. Pop growls, \u201cThis job is a masquerade of recreation.\u201d It\u2019s autobiographical. \u201cIf I hear one more music star go, \u2018And I just love the job I have, and I\u2019m so grateful...\u2019,\u201d he said with a cackle. \u201cYou\u2019re working hard. You\u2019re in a panic for half of your life. You\u2019re under constant stress, you have no security, you\u2019re not sure if anybody really likes you anyway.\u201dThe collaboration started with a text message from Mr. Pop to Mr. Homme, who recalled, \u201cIt basically said, \u2018Hey, it would be great if we got together and maybe write something sometime \u2014 Iggy.\u2019\u201dIt was not an offer Mr. Homme took casually. Discovering Mr. Pop\u2019s first solo albums, he said, had caused him to break up Kyuss, his first nationally known band, in the mid-1990s. \u201cI was listening to \u2018Lust for Life\u2019 and \u2018The Idiot,\u2019 and I was traveling on tour with a very successful band,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought, \u2018That said what I wanted to say and I couldn\u2019t say it better.\u2019 So I quit.\u201dMr. Homme said that he promised Mr. Pop: \u201cIf we hate it, if we go, \u2018This is terrible,\u2019 I will take a shovel, and I will take the drives, and I will bury it in the dirt. It will say \u2018Iggy and Josh,\u2019 and someday, someone will build a house there, and they\u2019ll go, \u2018What the hell is this?\u2019\u201dThey recorded the album\u2019s nine songs in brief bursts at Mr. Homme\u2019s two studios: two weeks at his home setup in the desert, in Joshua Tree, and later for one week at Pink Duck. They collaborated fully; one ground rule was that neither would bring in complete songs, only ideas. And they had a conspiratorial minimum of sidemen: just Dean Fertita, from Queens of the Stone Age and the Dead Weather, on guitars and keyboards, and Matt Helders, from Arctic Monkeys, on drums.Mr. Pop and the band \u2014 which includes the musicians on the album along with Troy Van Leeuwen from Queens of the Stone Age, on guitar, and Matt Sweeney, from Chavez and countless sessions, on bass \u2014 are planning a brief tour in March. The set list will likely include \u201cSuccess,\u201d a song from \u201cLust for Life\u201d that Mr. Pop says he has never performed in concert. Mr. Homme said they are looking at \u201cvenues, not cities,\u201d choosing small, beautiful theaters where Mr. Pop\u2019s presence might still seem disruptive.\u201cThere won\u2019t be hardly any shows, and they won\u2019t be in big places, and you won\u2019t be able to get a ticket,\u201d Mr. Homme said. \u201cSo almost everyone won\u2019t see it. It will be like trying to catch smoke in your hands. And that makes it even better. It will be special, and it will be over in the blink of an eye.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "West Ham United Finds Its Sweep Spot", "Date": "2016-01-03", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Money cannot buy what makes an English club intrinsic to the community in which it plays.But times are changing fast in East London, where West Ham United has begun the countdown in its 112th and final year in the same stadium. Just nine more Premier League games will be played at the Hammers\u2019 Boleyn Ground before it is bulldozed to make room for housing and shops, but the team will neither be homeless nor aimless. Starting in June, it will play in the Olympic Stadium built for the 2012 London Games.With a 2-0 win against Liverpool on Saturday, West Ham completed its first home and away sweep of Liverpool in 52 years.There was something as basic as English sausage and mashed potatoes to Saturday\u2019s goals. Each came from the ball being hoist from the right wing and headed into the net. The first was scored by Michail Antonio who, despite what his name may suggest, was born and raised in London. The second was a trademark header from Andy Carroll, who was sold to West Ham by Liverpool three years ago.\u201cIf you stick the ball in there, he\u2019ll head it in,\u201d Harry Redknapp, a former West Ham player and manager, said on television after Carroll\u2019s goal finished off Liverpool.Simple headed goals are no longer staples of English soccer, which now is dominated by foreign players with teams often coached \u2014 as in the case with West Ham\u2019s Croatian manager, Slaven Bilic \u2014 in a much more grounded style.Bilic, once a tough defender for West Ham, returned to Boleyn Ground as coach half a year ago. He has overseen victories against Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea, often with play far more sophisticated than the high-ball tactic that undid Liverpool.Saturday\u2019s goals, Bilic said afterward, were tailored to capitalize on the opponent\u2019s known weakness in the air. The soccer that this coach prefers \u2014 and which the Hammers\u2019 own tradition was built upon \u2014 was also seen in the way that Manuel Lanzini and Dimitri Payet moved the ball along the grass.But the headed goals were specifically designed for this game, and each time they exposed the lack of height by Liverpool\u2019s 5-foot-9 right back, Nathaniel Clyne.The imperative this season for West Ham is to stay in the Premier League, for two reasons. The first is financial, as a new television deal starting next June will mean about $175 million for each of the 20 clubs in the Premier League.Second, the Olympic Stadium has 61,000 seats, almost double the capacity of Boleyn Ground. It helps the groundbreaking if the team, currently sixth in the standings, is having its most successful season in decades \u2014 and if there is room in the new stadium for not just lifelong fans, but for them to bring along a friend or two, also.West Ham won a bitter battle with Tottenham Hotspur to be the tenant in the Olympic Stadium. In effect, the Hammers\u2019 move meant it could sell off its old stadium and make the transition to modernity without spending hundreds of millions of dollars to upgrade.Arsenal, the first London club to undertake that costly exercise, has taken 12 years to get back to the pinnacle of the league after financing its own new stadium. Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur are about to go through that upheaval \u2014 and teams outside the capital are looking east and west to foreign investors to replace their century-old stadiums.One thing that doesn\u2019t change is the English appetite for soccer over the Christmas period. It was the fourth league game for both teams over 12 days, and in Liverpool\u2019s case the staleness showed.\u201cIt\u2019s not about disappointment,\u201d J\u00fcrgen Klopp, Liverpool\u2019s new manager, said after the defeat. \u201cIt\u2019s about being angry. We let them make two crosses, and score two headers.\u201dBilic agreed that Liverpool had greater possession of the ball and were hit with sucker punches on the break. \u201cWe basically let then have the ball in certain areas,\u201d the Croatian said. \u201cAnd we could have scored more.\u201dWhen West Ham searched for a new manager last summer, it tried to hire Klopp before turning to Bilic. In hindsight, the board chose the right man because the club\u2019s former player is tireless in converting his own affection for the club into a core value for the team.English soccer these days is overrun by foreign players. Seven out of every eleven in the Premier League are imported, and it is unlikely that Bilic would have suggested that West Ham pay 15 million pounds, about $22 million \u2014 the sum paid to Liverpool for Carroll \u2014 had he not already been on the payroll. But that amount was less than half of the \u00a335 million that Liverpool paid Newcastle for the big English striker.Liverpool discarded Carroll as much for his wayward lifestyle as for the injuries he broke down with. He stands6-foot-4 and, when fit, can overpower opponents. \u201cI thought he was brilliant,\u201d Bilic said Saturday. \u201cNot just because of his goal but holding the ball up, pressing their defenders, everything.\u201cIt is all down to him. Is he going to look after himself, work hard, train, rest, to maintain his position or to even make it better? Then, and only then, he will become a great asset for us, and it is up to him. I expect him to stick to what he was like recently. He would be very, very stupid to do otherwise.\u201dCarroll might be the Hammer of the year, but he shared Saturday\u2019s top billing with another Englishman. Wayne Rooney, who had scored only twice during Manchester United\u2019s repressed style of play this season, benefited Saturday from the team\u2019s midseason change of direction.United beat Swansea City, 2-1, and Rooney\u2019s winning goal catapulted him past Denis Law on the club\u2019s all-time scoring list, and he now is second only to Bobby Charlton. Law finished with 237 goals, while Rooney has 238. Charlton netted 249 after playing 250 games more than either of them in his United career.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Puerto Rico Utility\u2019s Debt Plan Still Fragile, Lawmakers Are Told", "Date": "2016-01-12", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Puerto Rico\u2019s troubled electric monopoly, mired in about $9 billion of debt, stands to run out of money by midsummer if its hard-won plans to restructure fall through \u2014 something that could happen this month, a top official of the utility told a congressional panel on Tuesday.Before all that debt can be restructured, the Puerto Rican legislature must first pass an enabling law \u2014 a law that, among other things, would lead to the island\u2019s first increase in the base rate for electricity since 1989.The legislature has about 10 more days to do that, according to the restructuring schedule. But already some lawmakers in San Juan are saying they will oppose the bill.\u201cI like to be an optimist, but it will be a challenge,\u201d said Lisa J. Donahue, the AlixPartners managing director who is working as the chief restructuring officer of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, known as Prepa.Asked what would happen to the deal without legislative approval, Ms. Donahue said: \u201cIt would fall apart.\u201d\u201cThere are contingencies that must be met, and if they are not met, we\u2019ll be back at the table,\u201d she added, after explaining that getting the deal even this far took negotiators 15 months.It involves an exchange of debt, with creditors accepting new bonds with an investment-grade rating and a face value 15 percent less than the junk-rated Prepa bonds they now hold. The new bonds would also have a slower payment schedule and a lower interest rate.\u201cLike Lisa said today, this is a good deal,\u201d said Stephen Spencer, a financial adviser to Prepa\u2019s bondholders, who monitored the hearing Tuesday. \u201cThere is always a point when it\u2019s time to stop hemming and hawing and act \u2014 and at this point it\u2019s up to the Puerto Rico legislature whether they want to pass the legislation and get this done.\u201dOn its existing debt, Prepa has a little more than $1 billion in principal and interest due before June 30. Without the increase in electricity rates, and other provisions of the restructuring plan, it will not have enough cash to pay.Puerto Rico just passed a critical debt-payment deadline on Jan. 1, and it managed to make some of the payments due only by defaulting on others. The defaults then prompted two bond insurers to file suit.The governor of Puerto Rico, Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla, has warned of a \u201crace to the courthouse\u201d in which more such creditors would sue to enforce their competing claims, leading to \u201clitigation pandemonium.\u201dPrepa also owed debt payments on Jan. 1, but a group of its creditors helped, in effect, to finance the payments in an effort to keep the fragile restructuring plan in play while waiting for the enabling law to be enacted.In the past, Prepa had the authority to set its own rates for electricity. The law required it to set rates high enough to cover its costs, including borrowing costs. But that did not happen.Instead, Prepa has held its base rate fixed since 1989, with an adjustment added on that rose and fell in tandem with the price of the fuel \u2014 mostly oil \u2014 that Prepa used to generate power.\u201cBecause Prepa\u2019s profit increases are linked to fuel cost increases, becoming more efficient would result in decreased profitability,\u201d said Doug Lamborn, the Colorado Republican who headed the hearing. He said Prepa, therefore, had no incentive to shift to clean, efficient generation technology. Its plants are antiquated and do not comply with either federal or local clean-air laws.To make matters worse, Prepa has a longstanding practice of bartering with municipalities on the island. In effect, it has gone for years without paying property taxes for its easements on municipal land, and in exchange has given the municipalities free electricity. The practice costs Prepa hundreds of millions of dollars a year.Members of the subcommittee wanted to know, among other things, whether the prospects for restructuring Prepa might be better if it had the standing to declare bankruptcy. Currently, the bankruptcy code specifically excludes Puerto Rico from Chapter 9, the chapter that governments use to reduce debt.Ms. Donahue said she believed access to bankruptcy would simplify the restructuring, because bankruptcy has tools for forcing holdout creditors to accept deals. She said all but 30 percent of Prepa\u2019s creditors, with $2.7 billion of bonds, have agreed to the planned restructuring deal.Prepa does not have to get all of those holdouts on board for the restructuring to succeed, she said \u2014 but it needs many of them, the holders of $2 billion worth of bonds.But one of the other witnesses, Jorge L. San Miguel, said he thought \u201cdelinking\u201d the restructuring from Chapter 9 bankruptcy was critical, because the deal was already fragile, and the possibility of bankruptcy was introducing too much uncertainty.Mr. San Miguel, a partner in the law firm of Ferraiuoli L.L.C. in San Juan, instead called on Congress to provide external oversight to the utility.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "North Korea Is Newest Frontier for a Daredevil Investor", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported byNow, he is betting on North Korea.James Passin, a hedge fund manager at Firebird Management, believes the nuclear-armed country sits on as much as a billion barrels of crude \u2014 enough to make it as big a producer as Oklahoma. If the oil exists, he wants to help unlock it.\u201cYou have a country with 25 million people \u2014 young, highly disciplined, literate \u2014 and a strong military-industrial complex,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that the early investors will be rewarded with potential for massive appreciation.\u201dThe risks of sinking cash \u2014 even just $7 million or so of Firebird\u2019s $700 million in assets \u2014 into a neo-Stalinist state with labor camps and virtually no private property are obvious. The geopolitical volatility was on full display last week, as North Korea claimed that it had tested a hydrogen bomb. And Mr. Passin is treading on murky investment territory, given the American sanctions against the country.His investors have experienced the wild rides that come with such frontier markets. Two of his funds are being liquidated after deep losses, including on banking in Iraq, gold in Armenia and oil and gas in Kenya.But Mr. Passin isn\u2019t deterred. \u201cI see opportunities when other people are afraid,\u201d he said.Mr. Passin, 44, studied philosophy at St. John\u2019s College in Maryland. He was inspired to enter finance, he said, in part by the story of Thales, a philosopher in ancient Greece who got rich by monopolizing olive presses before a bumper harvest he had foreseen in the stars.After graduating, Mr. Passin began his career as an editor at Taipan, a financial newsletter in Baltimore, recommending obscure foreign stocks.Peter Schiff, the chief of Euro Pacific Capital in Connecticut, met Mr. Passin in his newsletter days and later invested, on his advice, in Hurricane Hydrocarbons, an oil company in Kazakhstan, buying shares for as little as 25 cents apiece. Eventually, the company was sold at $55 a share, Mr. Schiff recalled.\u201cI\u2019ve bought some stocks from him that have gone to zero,\u201d Mr. Schiff said. \u201cBut this was such a big winner.\u201dIn 1999, Mr. Passin joined the New York-based Firebird, becoming one of several fund managers at the firm.\u201cHe took a very different path than your typical hedge fund manager,\u201d Mr. Schiff added. \u201cHe\u2019s not a Harvard M.B.A., he didn\u2019t work at Goldman Sachs, he didn\u2019t do a two-year internship \u2014 he\u2019s just a smart guy.\u201dContrarian instincts have led Mr. Passin to out-of-the-way markets like Chechnya, Congo and Somalia.Joseph Naemi, one of Mr. Passin\u2019s longtime business partners, recalled joining him in a brash attempt in 2002 to buy Uzbekistan\u2019s national oil company, Uzbekneftegaz. They had a meeting with a dozen Uzbek government officials, and Mr. Passin\u2019s pitch was simple: He was there to write a check for $600 million to $700 million to buy the entire company. But the country did not go for the proposal.\u201cThe skeptical look around the boardroom was actually hilarious,\u201d Mr. Naemi wrote in an email.In 2006, Mr. Passin toured Mongolia and zeroed in on its stock exchange. It was \u201cjust a room with some computers,\u201d Mr. Passin recalled.He said he snapped up shares in \u201canything that was listed.\u201d By 2011, the country\u2019s economy was clocking one of the fastest growth rates in the world \u2014 17 percent a year \u2014 as vast troves of minerals were discovered under the steppes.Since then, Mongolia\u2019s bull market has crashed, Mr. Passin said, and the economy has slowed. But he is redoubling his efforts there, aiming to construct a set of world-class Mongolian corporations \u2014 a project he has broadly likened to the empire-building of Genghis Khan.Mr. Passin is also wagering on distressed debt in the South Pacific. Firebird has been suing the tiny, destitute island nation of Nauru for repayment on about $24 million of defaulted government-backed bonds, equal to about one-sixth of the country\u2019s gross domestic product.Firebird, which bought the bonds from the original creditors at a fraction of their face value, stands to make money if it wins. The hedge fund has been fighting in Australian courts to garnish Nauru\u2019s state bank accounts \u2014 and briefly succeeded in freezing the accounts.The tactics are similar to those used by larger, more prominent firms like Elliott Management, run by the billionaire investor Paul E. Singer, who has sued Argentina over debt repayment.In December, Australia\u2019s highest court denied Firebird access to Nauru\u2019s state bank accounts. But Mr. Passin might still try to claim any wealth the eight-square-mile coral atoll holds outside Australia.\u201cWe will go to every corner of the world to find assets,\u201d he said.Mr. Passin\u2019s North Korean investments may be his most contentious.Firebird owns nearly half of a Mongolian company, HBOil, that entered a joint venture with the government of Kim Jong-un in 2013. The partnership gave the small company expansive rights to overhaul North Korea\u2019s primitive energy sector by opening 100 gas stations, restarting a derelict refinery and drilling for oil and gas.The projects have yet to materialize. Companies have been searching for oil and gas there since the 1980s, and it remains unclear whether the country has any significant quantities.Mr. Naemi, who is advising HBOil, believes there are deep reserves of oil \u2014 perhaps as much as a billion recoverable barrels on land. But the current low price of oil means that if it exists, and can be extracted, it still might not be profitable.Mr. Passin\u2019s investment also raises legal questions. Alexandra L\u00f3pez-Casero, a sanctions lawyer at the Boston-based law firm Nixon Peabody, said the investment might violate American sanctions against North Korea absent a license from the Treasury Department in Washington. Other experts disagree, noting that the United States has not issued a blanket prohibition on investing in the North.Mr. Passin said that Firebird had neither sought such a license nor needed one. He added that an expert had reviewed the venture for him and concluded that it was legal.Some analysts worry that any oil exploitation would fortify Mr. Kim and others in the country\u2019s ruling elite. \u201cThe security risk is not small, as the oil business in D.P.R.K. is exclusively handled by the Communist Party and the military,\u201d said Keun-Wook Paik, an expert on North Korean oil at the research institution Chatham House, using the abbreviation for the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, the country\u2019s official name. \u201cIt will be a kind of Pandora box opening.\u201dMr. Passin dismisses such concerns.He said business with North Korea would both benefit ordinary people and encourage the totalitarian state apparatus to become \u201cmore open and less harsh.\u201d Besides, he argued, if the West avoided commerce with unsavory nations, much of the world would be off limits.\u201cI believe there are companies that will emerge out of the D.P.R.K. that will be of lasting importance,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will survive for centuries.\u201dRick Gladstone contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s Twist on Paid Leave: She Plans to Tax Wealthiest", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "Supported byWork-Life BalanceThe difference was how she plans to pay for it.Mrs. Clinton proposed taxing the wealthiest Americans. Plans by others have called for new payroll taxes for everyone to finance a federal paid leave fund, or federal tax credits to encourage businesses to voluntarily offer leave.The Clinton campaign was vague about the details of the financing. \u201cAmerican families need paid leave, and to get there, Hillary will ask the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share,\u201d her campaign\u2019s announcement said. \u201cShe\u2019ll ensure that the plan is fully paid for by a combination of tax reforms impacting the most fortunate.\u201dMrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign said the plan would guarantee that people who had worked a minimum number of hours would receive at least two-thirds of their pay, up to a ceiling.The three states that offer paid family leave \u2014 California, Rhode Island and New Jersey \u2014 also finance it through payroll taxes that support existing temporary disability programs.The biggest objection to paid leave has been from business owners who say they do not want to pay for it, which Mrs. Clinton said her plan would avoid.Marco Rubio, the only Republican presidential candidate to have offered a detailed plan for paid leave, has said he does not support federally mandated paid leave because he thinks neither businesses nor taxpayers should have to pay for it.American workers currently get 12 weeks of leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act, which President Bill Clinton signed in 1993 \u2014 but it is entirely unpaid, and applies to only about half of workers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Founders Fund Leads a Financing Round for Nubank, a Brazilian Start-Up", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The billionaire and prominent Silicon Valley financier Peter Thiel has returned to investing in Brazil, even as the country remains mired in recession and faces almost weekly political upheavals.A Nubank spokeswoman, Mariana Netto, responded to an email inquiry seeking information on the new financing and a request for an interview with a company executive by saying, \u201cAt the moment, we do not have any information.\u201dThe new investment values Nubank at approximately $500 million, according to two individuals, significant for a company less than three years old.The Founders Fund backing of Nubank appears to be its first investment in Brazil and South America, at least based on disclosed and known investments. The firm, just over 10 years old, raised its first fund back in 2005.On the surface, backing Nubank may seem to be a counterintuitive move as many institutional investors have fled Latin America\u2019s largest economy in recent years, and its gross domestic product has decreased for three straight quarters.Mr. Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook, has a reputation for going against the grain. But Founders Funds notes on its website that being contrarian \u201cdoes not mean simply doing the opposite of what the majority does.\u201d Rather, the company says, \u201cThe most contrarian thing to do is to think independently.\u201d Taking on Brazil\u2019s financial establishment is certainly that.They have been neither vulnerable to the moribund economy the rest of the country has grappled with over the last several years nor the policies enacted by leftist governments that have led the country since 2003. That is partly because Brazil has long had extremely high interest rates. Its current benchmark Selic rate stands at 14.25 percent.The current deepening recession and rising inflation are increasing pressure on the Central Bank to raise the rate even further. While the Central Bank kept the rate unchanged at its last meeting, economists expect an increase when it meets later this month and continued pressure for more increases throughout this year. That is in part because, \u201cInflation will remain a key macro issue in 2016,\u201d according to a research note published on Dec. 30 by Alberto Ramos, Head of Latin America Economic Research for Goldman Sachs.That also means higher credit card interest rates. Many Brazilians already pay annual rates as high as 415.3 percent as of the end of November, up from 327.8 percent one year earlier, according to Central Bank data. Average annual credit card interest rates in Brazil have risen in 10 of the last 11 months, reaching 99 percent in November, up significantly from 74.5 percent in the same month in 2014, according to that same Central Bank report.In contrast, Nubank has not changed its 7.75 monthly interest rate in over a year. It also hopes that being digital both reduces overhead and results in better customer service. Banks, after telecommunications companies, usually generate the most customer complaints in Brazil. That has helped its popularity here grow.More than one million Brazilians have applied for the card and approximately 300,000 are on a waiting list while their credit history is examined, Nubank said in the fourth quarter of last year.An earlier version of this article misstated the role of Peter Thiel at PayPal. He was a co-founder, not the founder.Advertisement"}

They also wonder what criteria doctors use to assess whether a patient is ready to leave.\u201cIt\u2019s complicated and depends on more than clinical factors,\u201d said Dr. Ashish Jha, a Harvard physician who sees patients at a Boston Veterans Affairs hospital. \u201cSometimes doctors overestimate how much support is available at home and discharge a patient too soon; sometimes we underestimate and discharge too late.\u201dChanging economic incentives \u2014 which are not always evident in individual cases \u2014 have also played a role in how long patients tend to stay. Recent changes to how hospitals are paid appear to be affecting which patients are admitted and how frequently they are readmitted.One way to economize is to get patients out of the hospital sooner. The prospective payment system pays a hospital the same amount whether a Medicare patient stays five days or four. But that extra day adds costs that hit the hospital\u2019s bottom line.\u201cWhen asked by hospital administrators to keep patients in observation status, many physicians comply,\u201d Dr. Jha told me. \u201cSome hospitals\u2019 electronic medical systems will alert emergency physicians when a patient has been recently discharged, and they\u2019re encouraged to keep them in the emergency department and not readmit them.\u201dThe influence of hospital financing is hardly perceptible to an individual patient. But the record is clear: Financing matters, and it affects both hospital admission and discharge decisions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Losing the Rams, St. Louis Wins", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported bySports BusinessDon\u2019t cry for St. Louis, sports fans.But the economics underpinning the recent deal St. Louis and the State of Missouri tried to put together to keep the Rams would have been financially ruinous. Let\u2019s not be coy about this: St. Louis, a city of fewer than 320,000 people, with a shrinking tax base, simply couldn\u2019t afford to help finance the $1 billion stadium that the Rams\u2019 billionaire owner, E. Stanley Kroenke, was seeking. Its mistake was in trying.Stadium financing has always been a struggle for St. Louis. In 1995, hoping to attract an N.F.L. franchise, the city, the state and the county built what was essentially a spec stadium, originally called the Trans World Dome. (The naming rights later shifted to Edward Jones, the financial services company.) The stadium was paid for entirely with public funds, with the three entities agreeing to repay $258 million in bonds. The city\u2019s share of that was $6 million a year, which it expected to generate from so-called game-day taxes \u2014 that is, taxes on everything sold inside the stadium during a game.In recent years, those game-day taxes have consistently fallen short, amounting to around $4.8 million a year, according to Andrew Arkills, a financial analyst who dissected the numbers for stadium opponents. The difference was being paid out of the city\u2019s coffers, meaning that those were tax dollars not going to the police or teachers or city services.In 2002, angered by the prospect of large public subsidies for a new baseball stadium being planned for the Cardinals, the voters in the city and the far wealthier and more populous county passed referendums that required voter approval to use taxpayer funds for a St. Louis sports stadium.But professional sports owners are constantly agitating for bigger, better, more profitable stadiums, and that was hardly going to change with the passage of a mere referendum or two. Indeed, the essential professional sports business model is to push governments to use public subsidies to cover as much of the cost as possible. As with any big company, threatening to leave for another city is a time-honored way for sports franchises to extract such money. (Although, unlike the case with General Electric, which on Wednesday announced its relocation to Boston, there is little evidence that professional sports franchises offer lasting economic benefits. They do, however, add value in terms of civic pride and in-person entertainment.)You can argue until you\u2019re blue in the face that billionaires shouldn\u2019t seek public handouts to build sports stadiums. But using other people\u2019s money is precisely why they\u2019re billionaires. (Kroenke, I should note, is a somewhat different case; his considerable net worth is bolstered by his marriage to a Walmart heiress.)Kroenke and the Rams had a clause in their lease allowing them to leave for another city if the Edward Jones Dome dropped below the top tier of N.F.L. arenas. This clause gave them the leverage to demand public assistance for a planned new stadium, as new arenas like \u201cJerry\u2019s World,\u201d Jerry Jones\u2019s $1.15 billion AT&T Stadium for the Dallas Cowboys, dwarfed the dome, financially and aesthetically.Kroenke also had the threat of Los Angeles, which is the nation\u2019s second-largest television market and has lacked a team since the Rams and the Raiders left 21 years ago. It is also a city that any number of N.F.L. owners have threatened to leave for in their (mostly successful) efforts to extract public financing for new stadiums.Kroenke\u2019s threat was different, though: A real estate developer as well as a professional sports owner, he had bought a large tract of land in the Los Angeles suburb of Inglewood. At the same time, the San Diego Chargers and the Oakland Raiders, both of which were also unhappy with their stadiums, were publicly eyeing Los Angeles.The contortions St. Louis and the State of Missouri put themselves through to keep the Rams would be comical if they weren\u2019t so sad. The city went to court and got a ruling that voided the law calling for voters to have a say in the granting of public subsidies, which infuriated taxpayers. The county, rather than calling for a vote of its citizens, dropped out. The governor, Jay Nixon, a Democrat, put together a task force to save the Rams.The city, which originally put up $70 million, ultimately agreed to pay nearly $150 million \u2014 money it didn\u2019t really have. Remember that game-day tax? Instead of using it to pay off the bonds on the dome \u2014 $100 million is still owed \u2014 it cravenly agreed to turn it all over to the Rams. The state cut a naming-rights deal with National Car Rental for $158 million \u2014 money it was going to turn over to the team. Jerry Jones, who wanted the Rams back in Los Angeles, sniffed that $158 million wouldn\u2019t buy a lobby in Los Angeles.The N.F.L. claims that St. Louis always had a real shot at retaining the Rams, a claim that\u2019s hard to believe. Kroenke had devised plans to build not just a stadium in Inglewood but a huge N.F.L. complex, which would include retail, hotels, the whole bit. It was a real estate play as much as a football stadium play.And in their application to the N.F.L. to relocate to Inglewood, the Rams sneered at the St. Louis proposal.\u201cThe public contribution is only $355 million \u2014 less than the $400 million\u201d the Rams had been promised, it said.\u201cAll of the costs of stadium operations and Capital Expenditures funding have been shifted\u201d to the Rams for the next 30 years.\u201cThe rent and operating structure are 20 times what the Rams pay now.\u201dThe heart bleeds.The truth is, whatever the deficiencies of the proposal from the city and state, it was more than the city, especially, could bear. It would have broken St. Louis\u2019s back, and quite likely forced cutbacks in service that the city badly needs. And it raises again the question of whether cities should really be in the business of subsidizing sports facilities. Is keeping a football team more important that putting police officers on the street? More important than giving teachers raises?Of course not. But mayors and governors can\u2019t bring themselves to tell a team good riddance when it threatens to leave. Instead, they move heaven and earth to keep the team \u2014 even if, as in the case of St. Louis, they can\u2019t afford it. That\u2019s why the pro sports business model works so well. It relies on the expectation that government officials will panic at the thought of losing a team.Two final notes.First, in case you\u2019re wondering, Kroenke and the Rams are not getting a penny in public money from Inglewood, Los Angeles or California, even though the stadium they are building is quite likely to cost more than $2 billion. This may seem astounding, given their demands in St. Louis, but it\u2019s not. The Inglewood stadium has the potential to be far more profitable than any new stadium in St. Louis. And St. Louis never had the real estate possibilities that Inglewood does. In St. Louis, Kroenke was the owner of the Rams. In Inglewood, Kroenke will be the owner of the Rams plus the developer of a retail and entertainment complex that Jones has described as Disneyland for professional football. Kroenke is putting up $800 million in equity. That\u2019s what developers do. Not that he\u2019s going to go broke if it turns out he made a bad bet.Second, there is the question of what is going to happen to the other two teams vying for Los Angeles, the Chargers and the Raiders. The two teams jointly put their chips on a different site near Los Angeles, in nearby Carson. They lost. One of them will almost surely become a tenant of Kroenke\u2019s in Inglewood; Kroenke envisions having two teams play in his new $2 billion sandbox.It is not likely to be a pleasant prospect. Kroenke is a tough negotiator, and he will also be able to maximize the value of his stadium in a way that his tenant will not. Dean A. Spanos, the San Diego Chargers\u2019 chairman, in particular finds himself in a terrible spot. For some 14 years, he has been trying to get a new stadium built in San Diego. He\u2019s gotten nowhere, and his constant agitation over the issue has made him a pariah in San Diego.In the same meeting in which the N.F.L. owners voted for the Kroenke-Inglewood proposal, they agreed to give Spanos up to a year to decide whether he would join Kroenke in Inglewood. The word is that Spanos doesn\u2019t want that; given the Rams\u2019 long history as a Los Angeles team, the Chargers would always play second fiddle. And Kroenke would be his landlord.His best bet, really, would be to use that year to put together a financing package for San Diego, where the Chargers have played since 1961. Last summer, the city and county said they would put up $350 million, money that they were going to have to spend (over decades) refurbishing Qualcomm Stadium, where the team currently plays. The voters would have to approve it, however, and it might also have to get through a difficult environmental review. Spanos, believing the offer was a delaying tactic meant to keep the Chargers out of Los Angeles, ignored it.He still has the leverage that Los Angeles affords, but that leverage runs both ways. Everyone in San Diego can see that he\u2019s in a pickle. And voter sentiment is such that a stadium proposal is an uphill battle. Whatever Spanos does next will make for fine grist for a sports business columnist. Who knows? Maybe he\u2019ll move the Chargers to London.Better late than never.Email:\u00a0nocera@nytimes.com \nTwitter: @noceraNYT Doris Burke contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "On Display at CES, Tech Ideas in Their Awkward Adolescence", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtBut if news from CES feels especially desultory this year, it might not be the show that\u2019s at fault. Instead, blame the tech cycle. We\u2019re at a weird moment in the industry: The best new stuff is not all that cool, and the coolest stuff isn\u2019t quite ready.It\u2019s not that today\u2019s tech is terrible \u2014 lots of potentially groundbreaking ideas are just around the corner. In product labs across the world, engineers and designers are working to turn a collection of annoying buzzwords \u2014 artificial intelligence, virtual reality, wearables, the \u201cInternet of things,\u201d autonomous cars and drones \u2014 into products that we find irresistible. They are all pushing the limits of what machines can currently accomplish, and working to come up with business models that customers will stomach. In time, after years of experimentation and incremental advances, many of these technologies might become mainstays.But that future will take a few years to pan out. In the meantime, you can expect to be bombarded with early versions of tomorrow\u2019s tech that are bound to feel janky and incomplete. Welcome to Prototype World, a brief intermission in your regularly scheduled program of disruption, during which everything new will more or less stink.\u201cIt\u2019s like the junior high years in technology,\u201d said Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies. \u201cWe\u2019re in those awkward teenage years where everything looks and feels funky.\u201dOver the next couple of CESes, there\u2019s a good chance we will see a lot of devices that will feel not quite ready. Virtual reality will underwhelm, artificial intelligence will feel annoyingly unintelligent, and cars and drones that navigate themselves will seem safer when parked. There will be wearables you won\u2019t want to wear and home devices that will make you want to buy a new place.\u201cIt will eventually cross that hump and become mature, but it\u2019s not there right now,\u201d Mr. Bajarin said.It\u2019s unsurprising that early versions of new tech will be a bit flawed. But what\u2019s unusual about the current moment is how many new, interdependent technologies are coming about at the same time. We\u2019re in the middle of a grand cycle in technology \u2014 the revolution pushed by smartphones, social networks and ubiquitous online servers (that is, the cloud everyone talks about). Over the last decade, these three technologies have altered wide swaths of the business world, destroying and creating hundreds of billions of dollars in wealth in sectors as varied as media and transportation.Venture capitalists are eager to see these trends continue. Fred Wilson, a co-founder of Union Square Ventures, told me he was paying close attention to opportunities for mobile devices and social networks to alter health care, finance and education.Hunter Walk, of the firm Homebrew, echoed this idea. \u201cIt may be true that there\u2019s not a consumer-tech phenomenon that breaks through this year, but the cascading wave of tech goodness from mobile isn\u2019t close to being done when we look at this other part of your life called work,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I\u2019m not bored.\u201dI take his point; we in the press are often quick to become bored and demand the next great thing. And yet, what can I say? I am kind of bored. Even if smartphones and social networks have lots of room to grow before conquering the world, they feel like old, mature tech. This is an industry that moves on anticipation of the next great thing. Artificial intelligence, virtual reality, autonomous vehicles and wearable computers are the building blocks of tomorrow\u2019s great tech cycle. The trouble is, the cycle is just getting started.But how will Apple get there from here? Improving the watch will require lots of fundamental advances over a period of years \u2014 smaller, faster processors and radios; better batteries; better artificial intelligence and voice recognition, among other things. Can Apple provide all that? Probably, and if it doesn\u2019t, some other smartwatch maker will most likely do it. But it won\u2019t happen this year. It might not even happen next year. You\u2019ll just have to wait.Similar advances will also be required to perfect self-driving cars and self-flying drones. Advances in A.I. will also power a set of intelligent assistants far smarter than Siri, some that don\u2019t make you tear your hair out.All this could be grand: A few years from now, if you believe the boosters in Vegas this week, many of us will be shuttling around in self-driving cars, regularly plugging into reality-defying virtual worlds, and adorning ourselves with smart jewelry that will seamlessly integrate our bodies with the Internet. Our homes will be connected, our drones will be autonomous and our phones will sizzle with artificial intelligence.That\u2019s a good vision to keep in mind as you struggle, over the next few years, to get anything to work as it should.Email: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjoo Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "After David Bowie\u2019s Death, \u2018Lazarus\u2019 Holds New Meaning for Fans", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported byTuesday was an emotional night at New York Theater Workshop, as fans and artists came together to see \u201cLazarus,\u201d one of David Bowie\u2019s final creations, now in a new light.It was the first staging of the show since Mr. Bowie\u2019s death on Sunday night, which came with the revelation that he had been secretly battling cancer during much of the musical\u2019s creation. The show, which features both new songs and old favorites by Mr. Bowie, is about an alien trapped on earth, clinging to hope of some kind of immortal life in space.In the theater\u2019s lobby, a video screen displayed a photograph of David Bowie, alternating with a lyric from the musical: \u201cThis way or no way/You know I\u2019ll be free/Just like that blue bird/Ain\u2019t that just like me.\u201dBut there was little else to mark the occasion. The actors and creative team, most of whom had no idea Mr. Bowie had been sick, collectively decided not to add anything before or after the show about the artist\u2019s death; instead, they said, they wanted the art to speak for itself. But the production clearly had new meaning for them; Charlie Pollock, an actor in the show, called the evening \u201ccathartic\u201d and \u201csweet,\u201d and he added, \u201cIt was sort of amazing to get to be a small part in this work.\u201dThe Tuesday night performance had long been sold out \u2014 as had much of the run, which began Nov. 18 \u2014 so almost everyone in the audience had no idea their attendance would also become a sort of tribute. Many said they were huge Bowie admirers, just beginning to grapple with how to see his art in light of his death.\u201cYes, it\u2019s about the work of art tonight, but it\u2019s also about the person that did the work,\u201d said Paul Caddell, 53, of New York. \u201cThis is like his requiem \u2014 like he planned it all.\u201dRoberta Bethencourt, 57, of Asbury Park, N.J., showed up wearing a sequined shirt with a large image of Mr. Bowie as a young man, with two different colored eyes, surrounded by stars.\u201cI\u2019m an avid Bowie fan, and I got the tickets before the holidays,\u201d she said, tears in her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a gift from David.\u201dA few theater industry leaders attended the show, including Joseph V. Melillo, the executive producer of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, who coincidentally had tickets for Tuesday night. He had once dined with Mr. Bowie and his wife, Iman. \u201cI\u2019m sad for the loss of this great artist,\u201d he said.\u201cLazarus\u201d was written by Mr. Bowie and the Irish playwright Enda Walsh, and directed by the Belgian theatermaker Ivo van Hove. The show is a sequel to \u201cThe Man Who Fell to Earth,\u201d a 1963 novel by Walter Tevis that in 1976 was adapted into a film starring Mr. Bowie. In the film, Mr. Bowie portrayed Thomas Newton, an alien stranded on earth; the musical, starring Michael C. Hall as Mr. Newton, depicts the character decades later, drinking gin, watching television, isolated in his apartment, talking to characters in his head, and declaring, \u201cI\u2019m a dying man who can\u2019t die.\u201dAlthough the musical\u2019s final performance is Jan. 20 \u2014 a benefit staging to raise money for New York Theater Workshop, an Off Broadway nonprofit organization in the East Village \u2014 it is likely to have a future life.Robert Fox, a British producer who has financed the show\u2019s development, said in an email, \u201cIt\u2019s too early to say where or when exactly \u2018Lazarus\u2019 will open next \u2014 London seems to be a possible starting point, but I don\u2019t rule anything out.\u201d He added, \u201cEven before David\u2019s death there was massive interest from all over the world, which has escalated since yesterday.\u201dInside the packed auditorium, a somber crowd watched raptly until the show\u2019s end, with Mr. Hall \u2014 seemingly a stand-in for Mr. Bowie \u2014 lying on the floor inside the outline of a rocket ship. The audience applauded and then silently filed out.Afterward, Eileen Palmer, 56, of St. James, N.Y., was teary, imagining Mr. Bowie\u2019s state of mind during the creative process.\u201cYou get a little glimpse of what the journey might be like,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Lawyer Who Became DuPont\u2019s Worst Nightmare", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "FeatureRob Bilott was a corporate defense attorney for eight years. Then he took on an environmental suit that would upend his entire career \u2014 and expose a brazen, decades-long history of chemical pollution.Supported byWhite had lived in Vienna, a northern suburb of Parkersburg, and as a child, Bilott often visited her in the summers. In 1973 she brought him to the cattle farm belonging to the Tennants\u2019 neighbors, the Grahams, with whom White was friendly. Bilott spent the weekend riding horses, milking cows and watching Secretariat win the Triple Crown on TV. He was 7 years old. The visit to the Grahams\u2019 farm was one of his happiest childhood memories.When the Grahams heard in 1998 that Wilbur Tennant was looking for legal help, they remembered Bilott, White\u2019s grandson, who had grown up to become an environmental lawyer. They did not understand, however, that Bilott was not the right kind of environmental lawyer. He did not represent plaintiffs or private citizens. Like the other 200 lawyers at Taft, a firm founded in 1885 and tied historically to the family of President William Howard Taft, Bilott worked almost exclusively for large corporate clients. His specialty was defending chemical companies. Several times, Bilott had even worked on cases with DuPont lawyers. Nevertheless, as a favor to his grandmother, he agreed to meet the farmer. \u2018\u2018It just felt like the right thing to do,\u2019\u2019 he says today. \u2018\u2018I felt a connection to those folks.\u2019\u2019The connection was not obvious at their first meeting. About a week after his phone call, Tennant drove from Parkersburg with his wife to Taft\u2019s headquarters in downtown Cincinnati. They hauled cardboard boxes containing videotapes, photographs and documents into the firm\u2019s glassed-in reception area on the 18th floor, where they sat in gray midcentury-modern couches beneath an oil portrait of one of Taft\u2019s founders. Tennant \u2014 burly and nearly six feet tall, wearing jeans, a plaid flannel shirt and a baseball cap \u2014 did not resemble a typical Taft client. \u2018\u2018He didn\u2019t show up at our offices looking like a bank vice president,\u2019\u2019 says Thomas Terp, a partner who was Bilott\u2019s supervisor. \u2018\u2018Let\u2019s put it that way.\u2019\u2019Terp joined Bilott for the meeting. Wilbur Tennant explained that he and his four siblings had run the cattle farm since their father abandoned them as children. They had seven cows then. Over the decades they steadily acquired land and cattle, until 200 cows roamed more than 600 hilly acres. The property would have been even larger had his brother Jim and Jim\u2019s wife, Della, not sold 66 acres in the early \u201980s to DuPont. The company wanted to use the plot for a landfill for waste from its factory near Parkersburg, called Washington Works, where Jim was employed as a laborer. Jim and Della did not want to sell, but Jim had been in poor health for years, mysterious ailments that doctors couldn\u2019t diagnose, and they needed the money.DuPont rechristened the plot Dry Run Landfill, named after the creek that ran through it. The same creek flowed down to a pasture where the Tennants grazed their cows. Not long after the sale, Wilbur told Bilott, the cattle began to act deranged. They had always been like pets to the Tennants. At the sight of a Tennant they would amble over, nuzzle and let themselves be milked. No longer. Now when they saw the farmers, they charged.Wilbur fed a videotape into the VCR. The footage, shot on a camcorder, was grainy and intercut with static. Images jumped and repeated. The sound accelerated and slowed down. It had the quality of a horror movie. In the opening shot the camera pans across the creek. It takes in the surrounding forest, the white ash trees shedding their leaves and the rippling, shallow water, before pausing on what appears to be a snowbank at an elbow in the creek. The camera zooms in, revealing a mound of soapy froth.\u2018\u2018I\u2019ve taken two dead deer and two dead cattle off this ripple,\u2019\u2019 Tennant says in voice-over. \u2018\u2018The blood run out of their noses and out their mouths. ... They\u2019re trying to cover this stuff up. But it\u2019s not going to be covered up, because I\u2019m going to bring it out in the open for people to see.\u2019\u2019The video shows a large pipe running into the creek, discharging green water with bubbles on the surface. \u2018\u2018This is what they expect a man\u2019s cows to drink on his own property,\u2019\u2019 Wilbur says. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s about high time that someone in the state department of something-or-another got off their cans.\u2019\u2019At one point, the video cuts to a skinny red cow standing in hay. Patches of its hair are missing, and its back is humped \u2014 a result, Wilbur speculates, of a kidney malfunction. Another blast of static is followed by a close-up of a dead black calf lying in the snow, its eye a brilliant, chemical blue. \u2018\u2018One hundred fifty-three of these animals I\u2019ve lost on this farm,\u2019\u2019 Wilbur says later in the video. \u2018\u2018Every veterinarian that I\u2019ve called in Parkersburg, they will not return my phone calls or they don\u2019t want to get involved. Since they don\u2019t want to get involved, I\u2019ll have to dissect this thing myself. ... I\u2019m going to start at this head.\u2019\u2019The video cuts to a calf\u2019s bisected head. Close-ups follow of the calf\u2019s blackened teeth (\u2018\u2018They say that\u2019s due to high concentrations of fluoride in the water that they drink\u2019\u2019), its liver, heart, stomachs, kidneys and gall bladder. Each organ is sliced open, and Wilbur points out unusual discolorations \u2014 some dark, some green \u2014 and textures. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t even like the looks of them,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018It don\u2019t look like anything I\u2019ve been into before.\u2019\u2019Bilott watched the video and looked at photographs for several hours. He saw cows with stringy tails, malformed hooves, giant lesions protruding from their hides and red, receded eyes; cows suffering constant diarrhea, slobbering white slime the consistency of toothpaste, staggering bowlegged like drunks. Tennant always zoomed in on his cows\u2019 eyes. \u2018\u2018This cow\u2019s done a lot of suffering,\u2019\u2019 he would say, as a blinking eye filled the screen.\u2018\u2018This is bad,\u2019\u2019 Bilott said to himself. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s something really bad going on here.\u2019\u2019But his father, who late in life enrolled in law school, encouraged Bilott to do the same. Surprising his professors, he chose to attend law school at Ohio State, where his favorite course was environmental law. \u2018\u2018It seemed like it would have real-world impact,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018It was something you could do to make a difference.\u2019\u2019 When, after graduation, Taft made him an offer, his mentors and friends from New College were aghast. They didn\u2019t understand how he could join a corporate firm. Bilott didn\u2019t see it that way. He hadn\u2019t really thought about the ethics of it, to be honest. \u2018\u2018My family said that a big firm was where you\u2019d get the most opportunities,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I knew nobody who had ever worked at a firm, nobody who knew anything about it. I just tried to get the best job I could. I don\u2019t think I had any clue of what that involved.\u2019\u2019At Taft, he asked to join Thomas Terp\u2019s environmental team. Ten years earlier, Congress passed the legislation known as Superfund, which financed the emergency cleanup of hazardous-waste dumps. Superfund was a lucrative development for firms like Taft, creating an entire subfield within environmental law, one that required a deep understanding of the new regulations in order to guide negotiations among municipal agencies and numerous private parties. Terp\u2019s team at Taft was a leader in the field.As an associate, Bilott was asked to determine which companies contributed which toxins and hazardous wastes in what quantities to which sites. He took depositions from plant employees, perused public records and organized huge amounts of historical data. He became an expert on the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s regulatory framework, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act. He mastered the chemistry of the pollutants, despite the fact that chemistry had been his worst subject in high school. \u2018\u2018I learned how these companies work, how the laws work, how you defend these claims,\u2019\u2019 he said. He became the consummate insider.Bilott was proud of the work he did. The main part of his job, as he understood it, was to help clients comply with the new regulations. Many of his clients, including Thiokol and Bee Chemical, disposed of hazardous waste long before the practice became so tightly regulated. He worked long hours and knew few people in Cincinnati. A colleague on Taft\u2019s environmental team, observing that he had little time for a social life, introduced him to a childhood friend named Sarah Barlage. She was a lawyer, too, at another downtown Cincinnati firm, where she de\u00adfended corporations against worker\u2019s-compensation claims. Bilott joined the two friends for lunch. Sarah doesn\u2019t remember him speaking. \u2018\u2018My first impression was that he was not like other guys,\u2019\u2019 she says. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m pretty chatty. He\u2019s much quieter. We complemented each other.\u2019\u2019They married in 1996. The first of their three sons was born two years later. He felt secure enough at Taft for Barlage to quit her job and raise their children full-time. Terp, his supervisor, recalls him as \u2018\u2018a real standout lawyer: incredibly bright, energetic, tenacious and very, very thorough.\u2019\u2019 He was a model Taft lawyer. Then Wilbur Tennant came along.The Tennant case put Taft in a highly unusual position. The law firm was in the business of representing chemical corporations, not suing them. The prospect of taking on DuPont \u2018\u2018did cause us pause,\u2019\u2019 Terp concedes. \u2018\u2018But it was not a terribly difficult decision for us. I\u2019m a firm believer that our work on the plaintiff\u2019s side makes us better defense lawyers.\u2019\u2019Bilott sought help with the Tennant case from a West Virginia lawyer named Larry Winter. For many years, Winter was a partner at Spilman, Thomas & Battle \u2014 one of the firms that represented DuPont in West Virginia \u2014 though he had left Spilman to start a practice specializing in personal-injury cases. He was amazed that Bilott would sue DuPont while remaining at Taft.\u2018\u2018His taking on the Tennant case,\u2019\u2019 Winter says, \u2018\u2018given the type of practice Taft had, I found to be inconceivable.\u2019\u2019Bilott, for his part, is reluctant to discuss his motivations for taking the case. The closest he came to elaborating was after being asked whether, having set out \u2018\u2018to make a difference\u2019\u2019 in the world, he had any misgivings about the path his career had taken.\u2018\u2018There was a reason why I was interested in helping out the Tennants,\u2019\u2019 he said after a pause. \u2018\u2018It was a great opportunity to use my background for people who really needed it.\u2019\u2019This did not sit well with the Tennants, who began to suffer the consequences of antagonizing Parkersburg\u2019s main employer. Lifelong friends ignored the Tennants on the streets of Parkersburg and walked out of restaurants when they entered. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m not allowed to talk to you,\u2019\u2019 they said, when confronted. Four different times, the Tennants changed churches.Wilbur called the office nearly every day, but Bilott had little to tell him. He was doing for the Tennants what he would have done for any of his corporate clients \u2014 pulling permits, studying land deeds and requesting from DuPont all documentation related to Dry Run Landfill \u2014 but he could find no evidence that explained what was happening to the cattle. \u2018\u2018We were getting frustrated,\u2019\u2019 Bilott said. \u2018\u2018I couldn\u2019t blame the Tennants for getting angry.\u2019\u2019With the trial looming, Bilott stumbled upon a letter DuPont had sent to the E.P.A. that mentioned a substance at the landfill with a cryptic name: \u2018\u2018PFOA.\u2019\u2019 In all his years working with chemical companies, Bilott had never heard of PFOA. It did not appear on any list of regulated materials, nor could he find it in Taft\u2019s in-house library. The chemistry expert that he had retained for the case did, however, vaguely recall an article in a trade journal about a similar-sounding compound: PFOS, a soaplike agent used by the technology conglomerate 3M in the fabrication of Scotchgard.Bilott hunted through his files for other references to PFOA, which he learned was short for perfluorooctanoic acid. But there was nothing. He asked DuPont to share all documentation related to the substance; DuPont refused. In the fall of 2000, Bilott requested a court order to force them. Against DuPont\u2019s protests, the order was granted. Dozens of boxes containing thousands of unorganized documents began to arrive at Taft\u2019s headquarters: private internal correspondence, medical and health reports and confidential studies conducted by DuPont scientists. There were more than 110,000 pages in all, some half a century old. Bilott spent the next few months on the floor of his office, poring over the documents and arranging them in chronological order. He stopped answering his office phone. When people called his secretary, she explained that he was in the office but had not been able to reach the phone in time, because he was trapped on all sides by boxes.\u2018\u2018I started seeing a story,\u2019\u2019 Bilott said. \u2018\u2018I may have been the first one to actually go through them all. It became apparent what was going on: They had known for a long time that this stuff was bad.\u2019\u2019Bilott is given to understatement. (\u2018\u2018To say that Rob Bilott is understated,\u2019\u2019 his colleague Edison Hill says, \u2018\u2018is an understatement.\u2019\u2019) The story that Bilott began to see, cross-legged on his office floor, was astounding in its breadth, specificity and sheer brazenness. \u2018\u2018I was shocked,\u2019\u2019 he said. That was another understatement. Bilott could not believe the scale of incriminating material that DuPont had sent him. The company appeared not to realize what it had handed over. \u2018\u2018It was one of those things where you can\u2019t believe you\u2019re reading what you\u2019re reading,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018That it\u2019s actually been put in writing. It was the kind of stuff you always heard about happening but you never thought you\u2019d see written down.\u2019\u2019Bilott learned from the documents that 3M and DuPont had been conducting secret medical studies on PFOA for more than four decades. In 1961, DuPont researchers found that the chemical could increase the size of the liver in rats and rabbits. A year later, they replicated these results in studies with dogs. PFOA\u2019s peculiar chemical structure made it uncannily resistant to degradation. It also bound to plasma proteins in the blood, circulating through each organ in the body. In the 1970s, DuPont discovered that there were high concentrations of PFOA in the blood of factory workers at Washington Works. They did not tell the E.P.A. at the time. In 1981, 3M \u2014 which continued to serve as the supplier of PFOA to DuPont and other corporations \u2014 found that ingestion of the substance caused birth defects in rats. After 3M shared this information, DuPont tested the children of pregnant employees in their Teflon division. Of seven births, two had eye defects. DuPont did not make this information public.In 1984, DuPont became aware that dust vented from factory chimneys settled well beyond the property line and, more disturbing, that PFOA was present in the local water supply. DuPont declined to disclose this finding. In 1991, DuPont scientists determined an internal safety limit for PFOA concentration in drinking water: one part per billion. The same year, DuPont found that water in one local district contained PFOA levels at three times that figure. Despite internal debate, it declined to make the information public.(In a statement, DuPont claimed that it did volunteer health information about PFOA to the E.P.A. during those decades. When asked for evidence, it forwarded two letters written to West Virginian government agencies from 1982 and 1992, both of which cited internal studies that called into question links between PFOA exposure and human health problems.)By the \u201990s, Bilott discovered, DuPont understood that PFOA caused cancerous testicular, pancreatic and liver tumors in lab animals. One laboratory study suggested possible DNA damage from PFOA exposure, and a study of workers linked exposure with prostate cancer. DuPont at last hastened to develop an alternative to PFOA. An interoffice memo sent in 1993 announced that \u2018\u2018for the first time, we have a viable candidate\u2019\u2019 that appeared to be less toxic and stayed in the body for a much shorter duration of time. Discussions were held at DuPont\u2019s corporate headquarters to discuss switching to the new compound. DuPont decided against it. The risk was too great: Products manufactured with PFOA were an important part of DuPont\u2019s business, worth $1 billion in annual profit.But the crucial discovery for the Tennant case was this: By the late 1980s, as DuPont became increasingly concerned about the health effects of PFOA waste, it decided it needed to find a landfill for the toxic sludge dumped on company property. Fortunately they had recently bought 66 acres from a low-level employee at the Washington Works facility that would do perfectly.By 1990, DuPont had dumped 7,100 tons of PFOA sludge into Dry Run Landfill. DuPont\u2019s scientists understood that the landfill drained into the Tennants\u2019 remaining property, and they tested the water in Dry Run Creek. It contained an extraordinarily high concentration of PFOA. DuPont did not tell this to the Tennants at the time, nor did it disclose the fact in the cattle report that it commissioned for the Tennant case a decade later \u2014 the report that blamed poor husbandry for the deaths of their cows. Bilott had what he needed.The Tennants settled. The firm would receive its contingency fee. The whole business might have ended right there. But Bilott was not satisfied.\u2018\u2018I was irritated,\u2019\u2019 he says.DuPont was nothing like the corporations he had represented at Taft in the Superfund cases. \u2018\u2018This was a completely different scenario. DuPont had for decades been actively trying to conceal their actions. They knew this stuff was harmful, and they put it in the water anyway. These were bad facts.\u2019\u2019 He had seen what the PFOA-tainted drinking water had done to cattle. What was it doing to the tens of thousands of people in the areas around Parkersburg who drank it daily from their taps? What did the insides of their heads look like? Were their internal organs green?Bilott spent the following months drafting a public brief against DuPont. It was 972 pages long, including 136 attached exhibits. His colleagues call it \u2018\u2018Rob\u2019s Famous Letter.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018We have confirmed that the chemicals and pollutants released into the environment by DuPont at its Dry Run Landfill and other nearby DuPont-owned facilities may pose an imminent and substantial threat to health or the environment,\u2019\u2019 Bilott wrote. He demanded immediate action to regulate PFOA and provide clean water to those living near the factory. On March 6, 2001, he sent the letter to the director of every relevant regulatory authority, including Christie Whitman, administrator of the E.P.A., and the United States attorney general, John Ashcroft.DuPont reacted quickly, requesting a gag order to block Bilott from providing the information he had discovered in the Tennant case to the government. A federal court denied it. Bilott sent his entire case file to the E.P.A.\u2018\u2018DuPont freaked out when they realized that this guy was onto them,\u2019\u2019 says Ned McWilliams, a young trial lawyer who later joined Bilott\u2019s legal team. \u2018\u2018For a corporation to seek a gag order to prevent somebody from speaking to the E.P.A. is an extraordinary remedy. You could realize how bad that looks. They must have known that there was a small chance of winning. But they were so afraid that they were willing to roll the dice.\u2019\u2019With the Famous Letter, Bilott crossed a line. Though nominally representing the Tennants \u2014 their settlement had yet to be concluded \u2014 Bilott spoke for the public, claiming extensive fraud and wrongdoing. He had become a threat not merely to DuPont but also to, in the words of one internal memo, \u2018\u2018the entire fluoropolymers industry\u2019\u2019 \u2014 an industry responsible for the high-performance plastics used in many modern devices, including kitchen products, computer cables, implantable medical devices and bearings and seals used in cars and airplanes. PFOA was only one of more than 60,000 synthetic chemicals that companies produced and released into the world without regulatory oversight.\u2018\u2018Rob\u2019s letter lifted the curtain on a whole new theater,\u2019\u2019 says Harry Deitzler, a plaintiff\u2019s lawyer in West Virginia who works with Bilott. \u2018\u2018Before that letter, corporations could rely upon the public misperception that if a chemical was dangerous, it was regulated.\u2019\u2019 Under the 1976 Toxic Sub\u00adstances Control Act, the E.P.A. can test chemicals only when it has been provided evidence of harm. This arrangement, which largely allows chemical companies to regulate themselves, is the reason that the E.P.A. has restricted only five chemicals, out of tens of thousands on the market, in the last 40 years.It was especially damning to see these allegations against DuPont under the letterhead of one of the nation\u2019s most prestigious corporate defense firms. \u2018\u2018You can imagine what some of the other companies that Taft was representing \u2014 a Dow Chemical \u2014 might have thought of a Taft lawyer taking on DuPont,\u2019\u2019 Larry Winter says. \u2018\u2018There was a threat that the firm would suffer financially.\u2019\u2019 When I asked Thomas Terp about Taft\u2019s reaction to the Famous Letter, he replied, not quite convincingly, that he didn\u2019t recall one. \u2018\u2018Our partners,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018are proud of the work that he has done.\u2019\u2019Bilott, however, worried that corporations doing business with Taft might see things differently. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m not stupid, and the people around me aren\u2019t stupid,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018You can\u2019t ignore the economic realities of the ways that business is run and the way clients think. I perceived that there were some \u2018What the hell are you doing?\u2019 responses.\u2019\u2019The letter led, four years later, in 2005, to DuPont\u2019s reaching a $16.5 million settlement with the E.P.A., which had accused the company of concealing its knowledge of PFOA\u2019s toxicity and presence in the environment in violation of the Toxic Substances Control Act. (DuPont was not required to admit liability.) At the time, it was the largest civil administrative penalty the E.P.A. had obtained in its history, a statement that sounds more impressive than it is. The fine represented less than 2 percent of the profits earned by DuPont on PFOA that year.Bilott never represented a corporate client again.It was one thing to pursue a sentimental case on behalf of a few West Virginia cattle farmers and even write a public letter to the E.P.A. But an industry-threatening class-action suit against one of the world\u2019s largest chemical corporations was different. It might establish a precedent for suing corporations over unregulated sub\u00adstances and imperil Taft\u2019s bottom line. This point was made to Terp by Bernard Reilly, DuPont\u2019s in-house lawyer, according to accounts from Bilott\u2019s plaintiff\u2019s-lawyer colleagues; they say Reilly called to demand that Bilott back off the case. (Terp confirms that Reilly called him but will not disclose the content of the call; Bilott and Reilly decline to speak about it, citing continuing litigation.) Given what Bilott had documented in his Famous Letter, Taft stood by its partner.A lead plaintiff soon presented himself. Joseph Kiger, a night-school teacher in Parkersburg, called Bilott to ask for help. About nine months earlier, he received a peculiar note from the Lubeck water district. It arrived on Halloween day, enclosed in the monthly water bill. The note explained that an unregulated chemical named PFOA had been detected in the drinking water in \u2018\u2018low concentrations,\u2019\u2019 but that it was not a health risk. Kiger had underlined statements that he found particularly baffling, like: \u2018\u2018DuPont reports that it has toxicological and epidemiological data to support confidence that exposure guidelines established by DuPont are protective of human health.\u2019\u2019 The term \u2018\u2018support confidence\u2019\u2019 seemed bizarre, as did \u2018\u2018protective of human health,\u2019\u2019 not to mention the claim that DuPont\u2019s own data supported its confidence in its own guidelines.Still, Kiger might have forgotten about it had his wife, Darlene, not already spent much of her adulthood thinking about PFOA. Darlene\u2019s first husband had been a chemist in DuPont\u2019s PFOA lab. (Darlene asked that he not be named so that he wouldn\u2019t be involved in the local politics around the case.) \u2018\u2018When you worked at DuPont in this town,\u2019\u2019 Darlene says today, \u2018\u2018you could have everything you wanted.\u2019\u2019 DuPont paid for his education, it secured him a mortgage and it paid him a generous salary. DuPont even gave him a free supply of PFOA, which, Darlene says, she used as soap in the family\u2019s dishwasher and to clean the car. Sometimes her husband came home from work sick \u2014 fever, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting \u2014 after working in one of the PFOA storage tanks. It was a common occurrence at Washington Works. Darlene says the men at the plant called it \u2018\u2018Teflon flu.\u2019\u2019In 1976, after Darlene gave birth to their second child, her husband told her that he was not allowed to bring his work clothes home anymore. DuPont, he said, had found out that PFOA was causing health problems for women and birth defects in children. Darlene would remember this six years later when, at 36, she had to have an emergency hysterectomy and again eight years later, when she had a second surgery. When the strange letter from the water district arrived, Darlene says, \u2018\u2018I kept thinking back to his clothing, to my hysterectomy. I asked myself, what does DuPont have to do with our drinking water?\u2019\u2019Joe called the West Virginia Department of Natural Resources (\u2018\u2018They treated me like I had the plague\u2019\u2019), the Parkersburg office of the state\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection (\u2018\u2018nothing to worry about\u2019\u2019), the water division (\u2018\u2018I got shut down\u2019\u2019), the local health department (\u2018\u2018just plain rude\u2019\u2019), even DuPont (\u2018\u2018I was fed the biggest line of [expletive] anybody could have been fed\u2019\u2019), before a scientist in the regional E.P.A. office finally took his call.\u2018\u2018Good God, Joe,\u2019\u2019 the scientist said. \u2018\u2018What the hell is that stuff doing in your water?\u2019\u2019 He sent Kiger information about the Tennant lawsuit. On the court papers Kiger kept seeing the same name: Robert Bilott, of Taft Stettinius & Hollister, in Cincinnati.But Bilott faced a vexing legal problem. PFOA was not a regulated substance. It appeared on no federal or state list of contaminants. How could Bilott claim that 70,000 people had been poisoned if the government didn\u2019t recognize PFOA as a toxin \u2014 if PFOA, legally speaking, was no different than water itself? In 2001, it could not even be proved that exposure to PFOA in public drinking water caused health problems. There was scant information available about its impact on large populations. How could the class prove it had been harmed by PFOA when the health effects were largely unknown?The best metric Bilott had to judge a safe exposure level was DuPont\u2019s own internal limit of one part per billion. But when DuPont learned that Bilott was preparing a new lawsuit, it announced that it would re-evaluate that figure. As in the Tennant case, DuPont formed a team composed of its own scientists and scientists from the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection. It announced a new threshold: 150 parts per billion.Bilott found the figure \u2018\u2018mind-blowing.\u2019\u2019 The toxicologists he hired had settled upon a safety limit of 0.2 parts per billion. But West Virginia endorsed the new standard. Within two years, three lawyers regularly used by DuPont were hired by the state D.E.P. in leadership positions. One of them was placed in charge of the entire agency. \u2018\u2018The way that transpired was just amazing to me,\u2019\u2019 Bilott says. \u2018\u2018I suppose it wasn\u2019t so amazing to my fellow counsel in West Virginia who know the system there. But it was to me.\u2019\u2019 The same DuPont lawyers tasked with writing the safety limit, Bilott said, had become the government regulators responsible for enforcing that limit.Bilott devised a new legal strategy. A year earlier, West Virginia had become one of the first states to recognize what is called, in tort law, a medical-monitoring claim. A plaintiff needs to prove only that he or she has been exposed to a toxin. If the plaintiff wins, the defendant is required to fund regular medical tests. In these cases, should a plaintiff later become ill, he or she can sue retroactively for damages. For this reason, Bilott filed the class-action suit in August 2001 in state court, even though four of the six affected water districts lay across the Ohio border.Meanwhile the E.P.A., drawing from Bilott\u2019s research, began its own investigation into the toxicity of PFOA. In 2002, the agency released its initial findings: PFOA might pose human health risks not only to those drinking tainted water, but also to the general public \u2014 anyone, for instance, who cooked with Teflon pans. The E.P.A. was particularly alarmed to learn that PFOA had been detected in American blood banks, something 3M and DuPont had known as early as 1976. By 2003 the average concentration of PFOA in the blood of an adult American was four to five parts per billion. In 2000, 3M ceased production of PFOA. DuPont, rather than use an alternative compound, built a new factory in Fayetteville, N.C., to manufacture the substance for its own use.Bilott\u2019s strategy appeared to have worked. In September 2004, DuPont decided to settle the class-action suit. It agreed to install filtration plants in the six affected water districts if they wanted them and pay a cash award of $70 million. It would fund a scientific study to determine whether there was a \u2018\u2018probable link\u2019\u2019 \u2014 a term that delicately avoided any declaration of causation \u2014 between PFOA and any diseases. If such links existed, DuPont would pay for medical monitoring of the affected group in perpetuity. Until the scientific study came back with its results, class members were forbidden from filing personal-injury suits against DuPont.A reasonable expectation, at this point, was that the lawyers would move on. \u2018\u2018In any other class action you\u2019ve ever read about,\u2019\u2019 Deitzler says, \u2018\u2018you get your 10 bucks in the mail, the lawyers get paid and the lawsuit goes away. That\u2019s what we were supposed to do.\u2019\u2019 For three years, Bilott had worked for nothing, costing his firm a fortune. But now Taft received a windfall: Bilott and his team of West Virginian plaintiff lawyers received $21.7 million in fees from the settlement. \u2018\u2018I think they were thinking, This guy did O.K.,\u2019\u2019 Deitzler says. \u2018\u2018I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he got a raise.\u2019\u2019Not only had Taft recouped its losses, but DuPont was providing clean water to the communities named in the suit. Bilott had every reason to walk away.He didn\u2019t.Bilott represented 70,000 people who had been drinking PFOA-laced drinking water for decades. What if the settlement money could be used to test them? \u2018\u2018Class members were concerned about three things,\u2019\u2019 Winter says. \u2018\u2018One: Do I have C8 in my blood? Two: If I do, is it harmful? Three: If it\u2019s harmful, what are the effects?\u2019\u2019 Bilott and his colleagues realized they could answer all three questions, if only they could test their clients. Now, they realized, there was a way to do so. After the settlement, the legal team pushed to make receipt of the cash award contingent on a full medical examination. The class voted in favor of this approach, and within months, nearly 70,000 West Virginians were trading their blood for a $400 check.The team of epidemiologists was flooded with medical data, and there was nothing DuPont could do to stop it. In fact, it was another term of the settlement that DuPont would fund the research without limitation. The scientists, freed from the restraints of academic budgets and grants, had hit the epidemiological jackpot: an entire population\u2019s personal data and infinite resources available to study them. The scientists designed 12 studies, including one that, using sophisticated environmental modeling technology, determined exactly how much PFOA each individual class member had ingested.It was assured that the panel would return convincing results. But Bilott could not predict what those results would be. If no correlation was found between PFOA and illness, Bilott\u2019s clients would be barred under the terms of the agreement from filing any personal-injury cases. Because of the sheer quantity of data provided by the community health study and the un\u00adlimited budget \u2014 it ultimately cost DuPont $33 million \u2014 the panel took longer than ex\u00adpected to perform its analysis. Two years passed without any findings. Bilott waited. A third year passed. Then a fourth, a fifth, a sixth. Still the panel was quiet. Bilott waited.\u2018\u2018This case,\u2019\u2019 Winter says, \u2018\u2018regardless of how hugely successful it ends up, will never in the Taft firm\u2019s mind replace what they\u2019ve lost in the way of legal business over the years.\u2019\u2019The longer it took for the science panel to conduct its research, the more expensive the case became. Taft continued to pay consultants to interpret the new findings and relay them to the epidemiologists. Bilott counseled class members in West Virginia and Ohio and traveled frequently to Washington to attend meetings at the E.P.A., which was deciding whether to issue advisories about PFOA. \u2018\u2018We were incurring a lot of expenses,\u2019\u2019 Bilott says. \u2018\u2018If the scientific panel found no link with diseases, we\u2019d have to eat it all.\u2019\u2019Clients called Bilott to say that they had received diagnoses of cancer or that a family member had died. They wanted to know why it was taking so long. When would they get relief? Among those who called was Jim Tennant. Wilbur, who had cancer, had died of a heart attack. Two years later, Wilbur\u2019s wife died of cancer. Bilott was tormented by \u2018\u2018the thought that we still hadn\u2019t been able to hold this company responsible for what they did in time for those people to see it.\u2019\u2019Taft did not waver in its support of the case, but the strain began to show. \u2018\u2018It was stressful,\u2019\u2019 Sarah Barlage, Bilott\u2019s wife, says. \u2018\u2018He was exasperated that it was lasting a long time. But his heels were so dug in. He\u2019s extremely stubborn. Every day that went by with no movement gave him more drive to see it through. But in the back of our minds, we knew that there are cases that go on forever.\u2019\u2019His colleagues on the case detected a change in Bilott. \u2018\u2018I had the impression that it was extremely tough on him,\u2019\u2019 Winter says. \u2018\u2018Rob had a young family, kids growing up, and he was under pressure from his firm. Rob is a private person. He didn\u2019t complain. But he showed signs of being under enormous stress.\u2019\u2019In 2010, Bilott began suffering strange attacks: His vision would blur, he couldn\u2019t put on his socks, his arms felt numb. His doctors didn\u2019t know what was happening. The attacks recurred periodically, bringing blurry vision, slurred speech and difficulty moving one side of his body. They struck suddenly, without warning, and their effects lasted days. The doctors asked whether he was under heightened stress at work. \u2018\u2018Nothing different than normal,\u2019\u2019 Bilott told them. \u2018\u2018Nothing it hadn\u2019t been for years.\u2019\u2019The doctors ultimately hit upon an effective medication. The episodes ceased and their symptoms, apart from an occasional tic, are under control, but he still doesn\u2019t have a diagnosis.\u2018\u2018It was stressful,\u2019\u2019 Bilott says, \u2018\u2018not to know what the heck was going on.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018There was relief,\u2019\u2019 Bilott says, understated nearly to the point of self-effacement. \u2018\u2018We were able to deliver what we had promised to these folks seven years earlier. Especially since, for all those years, DuPont had been saying that we were lying, trying to scare and mislead people. Now we had a scientific answer.\u2019\u2019DuPont\u2019s continuing refusal to accept responsibility is maddening to Bilott. \u2018\u2018To think that you\u2019ve negotiated in good faith a deal that everybody has abided by and worked on for seven years, you reach a point where certain things were to be resolved but then remain contested,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018I think about the clients who have been waiting for this, many of whom are sick or have died while waiting. It\u2019s infuriating.\u2019\u2019As part of its agreement with the E.P.A., DuPont ceased production and use of PFOA in 2013. The five other companies in the world that produce PFOA are also phasing out production. DuPont, which is currently negotiating a merger with Dow Chemical, last year severed its chemical businesses: They have been spun off into a new corporation called Chemours. The new company has replaced PFOA with similar fluorine-based compounds designed to biodegrade more quickly \u2014 the alternative considered and then discarded by DuPont more than 20 years ago. Like PFOA, these new substances have not come under any regulation from the E.P.A. When asked about the safety of the new chemicals, Chemours replied in a statement: \u2018\u2018A significant body of data demonstrates that these alternative chemistries can be used safely.\u2019\u2019When asked about the Madrid Statement, Dan Turner, DuPont\u2019s head of global media relations, wrote in an email: \u2018\u2018DuPont does not believe the Madrid Statement reflects a true consideration of the available data on alternatives to long-chain perfluorochemicals, such as PFOA. DuPont worked for more than a decade, with oversight from regulators, to introduce its alternatives. Extensive data has been developed, demonstrating that these alternatives are much more rapidly eliminated from the body than PFOA, and have improved health safety profiles. We are confident that these alternative chemistries can be used safely \u2014 they are well characterized, and the data has been used to register them with environmental agencies around the world.\u2019\u2019This advisory level, if indeed announced, might be a source of comfort to future generations. But if you are a sentient being reading this article in 2016, you already have PFOA in your blood. It is in your parents\u2019 blood, your children\u2019s blood, your lover\u2019s blood. How did it get there? Through the air, through your diet, through your use of nonstick cookware, through your umbilical cord. Or you might have drunk tainted water. The Environmental Working Group has found manufactured fluoro\u00adchemicals present in 94 water districts across 27 states (see sidebar beginning on Page 38). Residents of Issaquah, Wash.; Wilmington, Del.; Colorado Springs; and Nassau County on Long Island are among those whose water has a higher concentration of fluorochemicals than that in some of the districts included in Rob Bilott\u2019s class-action suit. The drinking water in Parkersburg itself, whose water district was not included in the original class-action suit and has failed to compel DuPont to pay for a filtration system, is currently tainted with high levels of PFOA. Most residents appear not to know this.Where scientists have tested for the presence of PFOA in the world, they have found it. PFOA is in the blood or vital organs of Atlantic salmon, swordfish, striped mullet, gray seals, common cormorants, Alaskan polar bears, brown pelicans, sea turtles, sea eagles, Midwestern bald eagles, California sea lions and Laysan albatrosses on Sand Island, a wildlife refuge on Midway Atoll, in the middle of the North Pacific Ocean, about halfway between North America and Asia.\u2018\u2018We see a situation,\u2019\u2019 Joe Kiger says, \u2018\u2018that has gone from Washington Works, to statewide, to the United States, and now it\u2019s everywhere, it\u2019s global. We\u2019ve taken the cap off something here. But it\u2019s just not DuPont. Good God. There are 60,000 unregulated chemicals out there right now. We have no idea what we\u2019re taking.\u2019\u2019Bilott doesn\u2019t regret fighting DuPont for the last 16 years, nor for letting PFOA consume his career. But he is still angry. \u2018\u2018The thought that DuPont could get away with this for this long,\u2019\u2019 Bilott says, his tone landing halfway between wonder and rage, \u2018\u2018that they could keep making a profit off it, then get the agreement of the governmental agencies to slowly phase it out, only to replace it with an alternative with unknown human effects \u2014 we told the agencies about this in 2001, and they\u2019ve essentially done nothing. That\u2019s 14 years of this stuff continuing to be used, continuing to be in the drinking water all over the country. DuPont just quietly switches over to the next substance. And in the meantime, they fight everyone who has been injured by it.\u2019\u2019Bilott is currently prosecuting Wolf v. DuPont, the second of the personal-injury cases filed by the members of his class. The plaintiff, John M. Wolf of Parkersburg, claims that PFOA in his drinking water caused him to develop ulcerative colitis. That trial begins in March. When it concludes, there will be 3,533 cases left to try.An article on Jan 10. about legal action against DuPont for chemical pollution referred incorrectly to DuPont\u2019s response in the 1970s when the company discovered high concentrations of PFOA in the blood of workers at Washington Works, a DuPont factory. DuPont withheld the information from the E.P.A., not from its workers. The article also misstated the year DuPont agreed to a $16.5 million settlement with the E.P.A. It was 2005, not 2006. In addition, the article misidentified the water district where a resident received a letter from the district noting that PFOA had been detected in the drinking water. It was Lubeck, W.Va. \u2014 not Little Hocking, Ohio. The article also misidentified the district where water tested positive for PFOA at seven times the limit. It was Little Hocking, not Lubeck. And the article misidentified the city in Washington State that has fluorochemicals in its drink-ing water. It is Issaquah, not Seattle.Nathaniel Rich is a contributing writer for the magazine and the author of \u2018\u2018Odds Against Tomorrow.\u2019\u2019 He lives in New Orleans and is a frequent contributor to The New York Review of Books and The Atlantic.Advertisement"}

But with advancements in photography, such facsimiles fell out of favor with researchers, and the works were banished to an attic in Frobenius\u2019s former home in Frankfurt after his death in 1938.\u201cWhen we pulled them out, we were blown away,\u201d said Richard Kuba, head of the collection at the Frobenius Institute. \u201cWe thought, there is a Klee in them, a Franz Marc.\u201dThe Berlin exhibition pays tribute to the largely unseen artists behind the works, most of them young women from prominent Frankfurt families who joined Frobenius on his expeditions. In addition to scaling ladders or crouching in dark caves to render the prehistoric works on canvas, they also helped to set up camp or dig vehicles out of the sand.They played a small role in art history, Mr. Kohl said, transmitting the spirit of the original rock paintings by depicting them in a way that was both accurate and artistic. Such artistry, however, later diminished the worth of the reproductions as scientific documentation.\u201cThe ability of the human eye to select and render what was most important about the original images made them more influential on artists working at the time than photographs,\u201d Mr. Kohl said.The largest of the works are more than six and a half feet tall and more than 35 feet long, including a 1929 mural from what is now Lesotho showing hunters pursuing a herd of antelope. It was created by connecting more than a dozen smaller canvases together.Another large work, from a cave in Indonesia, traces the outline of human hands and feet, in deep plum hues and slate grays. The colors reflect the natural pigments used in the original rock paintings, predominaantly shades of brown, red or yellow.Because Frobenius was validating cultures that at the time were considered \u201cprimitive\u201d or \u201cna\u00efve\u201d in the West, he was constantly struggling to secure financing for his exhibitions.He refused to join the Nazi party, but he sold some of the watercolors to the government to ensure the survival of his foundation. He later received funding from the Nazi Culture Ministry to sponsor a European tour of about 150 works. The works then traveled to 31 locations in the United States, starting at the Museum of Modern Art in 1937.In the 80 years since the watercolors were last displayed, the understanding of the interconnectedness of early African and European culture has been widely researched. But when Frobenius was carrying out his expeditions, even the most cultured Europeans and Americans had never seen the rock art and paintings of prehistoric cultures. The watercolors helped bring the works from distant and hard-to-reach places to Western viewers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After a Tumultuous Year for Investors, the Experts Look Ahead", "Date": "2015-12-31", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseBut low gas prices and a strong dollar were good for United States consumers, who had more money to spend, lifting the American economy. Even though broad market averages were flat, United States stocks reached lofty valuations by historical measures.These are some of the big questions preoccupying investors as the new year gets underway. For answers, I turned to some of 2015\u2019s most successful investors and analysts for my annual look at the year ahead.\u25a0So much went wrong for investors in energy and other commodities this year that it\u2019s hard to imagine that 2016 could be any worse. This week, a barrel of Brent crude approached $36, the lowest since 2004, continuing what appears to be a record decline from over $100 a barrel in June 2014.The strong dollar added downward pressure on oil and commodities, which are priced in dollars, as the Federal Reserve pursued a tighter monetary policy. Global demand for oil grew in 2015, but not nearly fast enough to keep pace with supply. And China\u2019s economy, where rapid growth was supposed to drive demand for years, cooled noticeably.With oil prices so low, it\u2019s tempting to say the worst is over, as many hedge fund managers did earlier in 2015, only to get burned. But Damien Courvalin, senior strategist in the Global Investment Research Commodities team at Goldman Sachs, told me this week that it was too soon for the all-clear signal. While Goldman expects oil prices to recover eventually, even by late 2016, over the near term the same forces that drove prices to new lows in the last year, starting with oversupply, shadow the market. Goldman\u2019s three-month forecast for oil prices is $38, about where they are now, but they could go as low as $20, Mr. Courvalin suggested.\u201cWe\u2019re more concerned about the downside risks than the upside potential at this point,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople keep asking if it\u2019s time to get excited about energy, but we believe that conversation is premature.\u201dIn theory, slumping prices, and the resulting financial stress for marginal producers, should lead to cutbacks in production. There have been some, \u201cbut supply has proven surprisingly resilient,\u201d Mr. Courvalin said. After a long period of capital investment driven by high prices for oil and other commodities, many production facilities are only now coming on line, \u201cand they\u2019re going to produce, no matter what the price,\u201d Mr. Courvalin said.He compared recent oil price moves to the period from 1976 to 1989. After peaking in 1980, oil prices fell through much of the \u201880s, finally bottoming in 1988. So far, the current period, beginning in 2005, looks similar. If the pattern continues \u2014 a big if \u2014 a recovery should begin by 2018, which is still two years away. \u201cIt could even be another decade,\u201d Mr. Courvalin said, \u201cbefore prices sustainably return to the levels of the past few years.\u201d\u25a0Mr. Heugh, who is based in Hong Kong, manages the Morgan Stanley Institutional Fund Global Opportunity Portfolio, which gained over 20 percent in 2015. Mr. Nadel is senior portfolio manager in New York for Royce\u2019s International Premier Investment Fund, which gained over 17 percent in 2015, and the Royce European Small-Cap Fund, up nearly 14 percent. Both managers invest in relatively concentrated portfolios, by fund standards, that don\u2019t closely track broad indexes, which helped them outperform their respective indexes in the last year by a large margin. And both avoided the energy sector. Mr. Heugh\u2019s largest holdings as of November were Facebook, the software concern Epam Systems and Amazon. Mr. Nadel\u2019s were VZ Holding, a Swiss financial services company; Clarkson P.L.C., a shipping firm based in London, and Bajaj Finance in India.Several money managers are predicting another flat-to-down year for United States equities for the same reasons stocks were flat in 2015 \u2014 high valuations, expectations of rising interest rates, a strong dollar and continued weak oil and commodity prices.But both Mr. Heugh and Mr. Nadel see future opportunities in international stocks. \u201cThe U.S. has outperformed the rest of the world for quite a few years now, and the strong dollar has been exacerbating this trend,\u201d Mr. Heugh said. \u201cThese cycles tend to reverse themselves over time, sometimes violently.\u201dHe sees many opportunities in Asia, including China, which he notes is still growing, even if at a slower pace. \u201cAsia is trading at a discount to its historical multiples of free cash flow and earnings, while the U.S. and Europe are trading at premiums,\u201d he said.But Mr. Heugh focuses more on fundamental stock analysis and less on broad geographic or macroeconomic forces. He said he looked for high-quality companies with competitive advantages that deter potential competitors. Then, \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter which region outperforms in a given year or three- or five-year period, you will become partners in great businesses and have the potential to benefit as partners over time.\u201dMr. Nadel said he also looked for stocks of international companies that benefit from high barriers to entry. \u201cI\u2019m not big on predictions, but the stage is set nicely for investing internationally,\u201d he said. While the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has risen 75 percent over the last five years, international small-cap indexes have contracted slightly. \u201cDividend yields are over twice as generous outside the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cI think in 2016 we could see some catch-up.\u201dHe especially likes some companies based in India, a country with \u201csome of the best 10-year prospects in the world,\u201d and Brazil, whose market \u201chas to have hit rock bottom \u2014 at least, I hope so.\u201d He said he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about the prospects for emerging markets. He praised structural reforms in Japan and said a wave of immigration should eventually benefit developed European economies.\u25a0The long bull market in bonds sputtered in 2015, as the Fed finally raised its target federal funds rate by a quarter point for the first time since 2006. United States Treasuries and most investment-grade corporate bonds barely eked out positive returns, and junk bonds plunged in a panicky sell-off late in the year.Travis King, head of investment-grade credit at Voya Investment Management in New York, managed a 1.3 percent return for the Voya Investment Grade Credit Fund. While modest, that was better than most fixed-income funds, and Morningstar has ranked his fund the No. 1 corporate bond fund over the most recent three-year period. Mr. King said that even with the Fed expected to continue a slow but steady rise in interest rates, he anticipated modest positive returns again in 2016.\u201cOur market view is for a slow and gradual rise in the Fed funds rate, with Japanese and European rates staying very low,\u201d Mr. King said. \u201cIn that environment, we think corporate bonds will be a winning trade, but you have to be selective.\u201d In 2015, his fund rotated toward bonds from money center banks and other financial concerns, which helped it outperform its benchmark. He said he expected to continue that emphasis in 2016. \u201cWe think financials are still a good place to be overweight,\u201d Mr. King said.As for junk bonds, he said he thought that the worst of the sell-off might have run its course. \u201cYields are starting to push 9 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are still avoiding high-yield debt from the energy sector, but elsewhere you\u2019re seeing some stability. In a world where the 10-year Treasury is yielding 2.25 percent, 8 percent or 9 percent starts to look pretty interesting.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Operating on a Shoestring, Ireland Struggles to Develop First-Rate Tennis Players", "Date": "2016-01-16", "News": "Supported byMore than 40 nations will be represented at the Australian Open, which begins Monday, more evidence of how truly global tennis has become.But one nation that prides itself on its sporting prowess will again be absent. Since tennis entered the professional era in 1968, only six Irishmen and two Irishwomen have made it to the main draw of a Grand Slam event. Only one man \u2014 Louk Sorensen at the 2010 Australian Open \u2014 has won a Grand Slam singles match. Of the two Irishwomen to win at a major, the more recent was in 1976.It is hard to imagine now that Ireland was once a leading light in the tennis world. In the 1890s, Irish players won five Wimbledon singles titles. In the 1960s, it hosted a tour event that attracted the great Australian Rod Laver. In 1983, it even hosted the United States, led by John McEnroe, in the Davis Cup.Now, hampered by a shortage of resources, it is seemingly stuck in the past, battling stuffiness and a misguided investment on artificial grass, a playing surface that does not produce the technique required for tennis in the 21st century.\u201cI would say in tennis terms, Ireland\u2019s always been a third-world tennis nation,\u201d said Garry Cahill, the technical director of Tennis Ireland. \u201cWe\u2019re not seen as that in other areas, but in tennis, we have always been. We\u2019ve never had the injection of funding that\u2019s necessary really to get guys out there and produce players. Unless a player is lucky enough to get some sponsorship that would help him to travel and have a coach on the road, it\u2019s actually almost impossible for an Irish player, at the moment.\u201dCahill was Ireland\u2019s Davis Cup captain for four years until 2014. Eight years ago, he helped to set up an academy for 60 of Ireland\u2019s top junior players, which now has a budget of just 140,000 euros, or about $153,000, from the Irish Sports Council.\u201cAll we can do is we provide a certain number of weeks where we provide a coach to be on the road,\u201d said Cahill, who added that most of the investment in Irish sport was directed toward the Olympic Games. \u201cWe can\u2019t pay for the travel, the hotels. The most we can do for any player is a fixed number of weeks of a year with a coach on the road, and that\u2019s in big groups \u2014 we can\u2019t do that for individual players.\u201dMore than 80,000 people are members of tennis clubs in Ireland, from a population of fewer than 5 million, a figure comparable to that of neighboring Scotland, which has produced second-ranked Andy Murray and top doubles players in recent years. Scotland, as part of Britain, received 800,000 pounds ($1.15 million) in 2015 from the Lawn Tennis Association, which itself is largely financed by the profits made each year at Wimbledon.Ireland operates on a shoestring. Lacking funding, McGee, who has spent most of his career battling just below the main ATP Tour, resorted to writing letters to numerous companies, looking for sponsorship.\u201cI think, especially coming from Ireland, it\u2019s tougher because we don\u2019t have the backing of let\u2019s say, the U.S.T.A., like the Americans, or the French, the Aussies, or the Brits, with the big federations,\u201d McGee said, referring to the United States Tennis Association.Two months ago, James Cluskey, an Irishman who played college tennis at Louisiana State and who reached a career-high ranking of 145th in doubles, retired at 29, having earned $61,382, nowhere near enough to make a living.More than 90 percent of Ireland\u2019s tennis courts are artificial grass, a fast, low bouncing surface that is cheap and easy to maintain but considered terrible for development and technique.\u201cI think it\u2019s a massive thing to change,\u201d Cluskey said. \u201cI understand the costs and all that, but I think if we\u2019re interested in producing players, we need to change the surface.\u201dIreland\u2019s problems go deeper. Just like the All England Club, many clubs in Ireland still have an all-whites clothing policy.\u201cSomeone emailed me and said a kid needs to be able to watch Roger Federer on TV, go and buy his shirt and be able to play when he goes to the club and not be told he can\u2019t wear that shirt,\u201d Cluskey said. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s a no-brainer to change that rule. I know some people are into tradition, and I understand Wimbledon and all that stuff as well, but I want to see as many kids as possible at one stage in their life have a racket in their hands.\u201dCluskey suggested Ireland try to tap into the Irish-American community in an effort to attract investment, having learned a lot from a successful crowdfunding venture a couple of years ago.\u201cI realized there are people who are interested in tennis and want to help,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the States, the colleges are so good at tapping into their alumni, and we need to find a way to reach out to these Irish-Americans. Also, a lot of tennis people go on to be successful in other areas in their life \u2014 we need to reach out to former players who are in business now.\u201dIreland\u2019s greatest success in the Davis Cup came with the help of Matt Doyle, an American with Irish roots. In 1983, Doyle and Ireland competed in the World Group but lost a relegation playoff to an American team that included McEnroe and Peter Fleming.Cahill said he believed investors were more likely to support an individual than a nation or academy.\u201cIt\u2019s always been my opinion that you need someone with Irish roots that has an interest in tennis, that takes an interest in an individual,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has to be almost an Irish-American who likes the sound of a story of an Irish kid who doesn\u2019t have the money, has talent and wants to invest in it.\u201cIt\u2019s a huge frustration. We\u2019re trying to do the right things, we\u2019re trying to support the players we can, but we know that we can only get them to a certain point unless they\u2019re lucky enough to find an investor. Ultimately, the goal for us is like that of other countries, to get players into the top 100, play Grand Slams, build the profile of the sport. And it is frustrating when you know that there is a huge barrier there which you can\u2019t do what the top nations are doing because you don\u2019t have the resources.\u201dAn article last Sunday about the lack of resources available for Irish professional tennis players misstated the citizenship of Matt Doyle, who led Ireland in Davis Cup competition in 1983. He is a naturalized Irish citizen, not a naturalized American citizen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Protesters in Haiti Demand That President Quit", "Date": "2016-01-24", "News": "Supported byPORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti \u2014 Volcy Assad, a Haitian political activist, stood before an enormous plume of black smoke emanating from a pile of burning tires and made it clear that the demands of protesters had changed.\u201cToday we are demanding the departure of Michel Martelly,\u201d Mr. Assad said on Saturday, referring to the Haitian president. Around him, groups of young men, faces covered with T-shirts and bandannas to shield from tear gas, had blocked the streets with rocks.One day earlier, officials had bowed to widespread civil unrest and postponed a single-candidate presidential runoff vote that was to be held on Sunday. Now, feeling emboldened in their objections to the first round of voting, which many saw as deeply fraudulent, protesters are demanding the ouster of President Martelly. With just two weeks left in office, he has become the central figure in a growing political scandal here that threatens the stability of a nation with a long history of social unrest and turmoil.Mr. Martelly\u2019s supporters took to the streets on Sunday in counterprotests and vowed to keep him in office, a scenario of competing rallies that experts feared would lead to violence. In Port-au-Prince this weekend, protesters burned cars and barricaded streets as the police responded with water cannons and tear gas.In a situation several experts described as \u201cfluid,\u201d it became increasingly unclear whether Mr. Martelly would remain in office until Feb. 7, when his mandate is scheduled to end. \u201cThey intend to push the insurrection to force the president to leave before Feb. 7,\u201d said Annibal Coffy, a lawyer who has served as a consultant to the Haitian Senate. \u201cI think there is no way the country will survive a week of violent manifestations.\u201dThe October presidential race, in which 54 candidates competed, was mired in fraud, according to opposition leaders and human rights groups. Because no candidate won a majority, a runoff was scheduled for Sunday, but protesters who expected a rigged outcome blocked streets and burned voting centers, leading to the postponement.The United States State Department, which has been criticized for supporting the disputed election, issued a statement on Sunday condemning the protests.\u201cThe United States is taking great interest in how elections in Haiti are unfolding,\u201d Mark Toner, a deputy spokesman, said in a statement, \u201cand expects that persons responsible for organizing, financing or participating in electoral intimidation and violence will be held accountable in accordance with Haitian law.\u201dOn Election Day in October, the elections board distributed special passes to 900,000 observers from all political parties, who were allowed to vote outside their home precincts. Human rights groups said party loyalists used the accreditations to cast multiple ballots.Mr. Martelly\u2019s handpicked successor, a banana exporter named Jovenel Mo\u00efse, came in first with 33 percent of the vote. Mr. Mo\u00efse is a virtual unknown, and many members of the opposition believed that the vote had been rigged on his behalf. The government denied the accusations. The United States and international observer groups said quick counts showed that the results of the race were accurate, despite the irregularities.Jude C\u00e9lestin, a former government construction official who came in second, boycotted the runoff and refused to campaign. Civic, business and religious leaders argued that a one-candidate runoff should not take place, but Mr. Martelly failed to recognize the growing discontent among the populace. As recently as Thursday, he gave a combative radio address insisting that the vote would go forward, which further infuriated opposition groups. The vote was canceled hours later, but the protests continued. Mr. Martelly\u2019s spokesman did not respond to requests for comment on Sunday.Mr. Martelly, a former Carnival singer known as Sweet Micky, is blamed for the electoral crisis because he failed to hold elections during his five years in office. The terms of every elected official in the country eventually expired, leaving Mr. Martelly to rule by decree for an entire year.He was also criticized for efforts to change municipal boundaries in an area where he owns property and for creating a police brigade accused of repressive tactics. \u201cThe Martelly regime hasn\u2019t brought anything for the population,\u201d said Yves Jean Joseph, 34, an unemployed protester. \u201cHe had four years to hold elections, and instead he destroyed the Parliament. What we had were not elections. It was ballot stuffing.\u201dPoliticians spent the weekend in back-room negotiations to determine who would lead a transitional government after Mr. Martelly\u2019s term ends. People close to the negotiations said the president wanted to extend his term until a new election was held.Guy Philippe, a Senate candidate whose runoff was also delayed, called for an uprising if the president were forced out.\u201cI am ready and we are ready to defend the democracy, no transition,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president will stay and continue his mandate as requested by the law.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Monday about a demand by Haitian protesters that their president resign misstated, at one point, the day of the scheduled presidential runoff election, which was postponed. As the article correctly noted elsewhere, it had been scheduled for this past Sunday, not last Friday.Advertisement"}

Her government salary was slashed by one third, and rampant inflation put some basic groceries like eggplant and cucumbers out of reach.Indignant and fearing worse amid Russia\u2019s accelerating economic problems, Sergei joined an unauthorized demonstration last week by hundreds of older Russians who gathered under the bronze statue of a Cossack horseman on the main square here and chanted, \u201cReturn our benefits!\u201dThe last time oil prices dropped so low and stayed there, in the 1980s, the Soviet Union disintegrated. Steadily rising prices since 2000 have lifted Russia out of poverty and economic chaos, buoying the prosperity of many Russians with it. Mr. Putin was lucky enough to be president for much of that period, but he now faces an extended decline, with real incomes shrinking.In Krasnodar, Mr. Titov, 64, braced for harder times. \u201cI do not know what they will cut, but I know it will affect us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are watching all this with alarm. It is clear that the government lacks the necessary resources to give us a normal life.\u201dSergei Galustian, 65, a retired police officer, lives on a downtown street with just 27 houses, their proximity making it easy to assess change.\u201cNobody is starving yet, but incomes are definitely down,\u201d he said, noting that homes are colder, that neighbors turn on just two lamps after dark where they once used five and that people have stopped buying new clothes. Retail sales across Russia were down by 13.1 percent for the year ending in November, according to official statistics, with car sales off nearly 40 percent.The 100 or so workers at the giant Seydin Machine Tool Factory, once the pride of the city during the Soviet era, have not seen a paycheck for a year and recently received layoff notices. They, too, have on occasion gathered in the main square to demand their back pay. The workers \u201chave to take to the streets!\u201d they wrote in an open letter to Mr. Putin.In a tradition dating from Soviet times, most firms, and especially state-run companies, tend to cut hours or stop paying salaries rather than fire people to diminish the chances for social unrest.In Moscow on Wednesday, about 15 employees of Sbarro, the pizza chain based in Ohio, stood in the brutal cold outside one franchise holding signs saying, \u201cGive us our money.\u201d Several said they had not been paid for at least three months.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.\u201cThey just tell us they have problems,\u201d said Sergei Yudichev, 50, a driver for the chain for more than two years.Albeit poorer, Russia remains a petro state, so there are pockets of plenty. Rolls-Royce reported a 5 percent jump in sales last year, the rich splurging as the value of their assets nose-dived.Others just seemed oblivious. Moscow\u2019s City Hall advertised for tenders for its banquets, noting that menu items should include foie gras and Parma ham (which is banned elsewhere in Russia because of sanctions).Social media erupted in mocking resentment. One Russian quoted a famous line by the Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovski from the 1917 revolution, \u201cEat pineapples, munch your grouse!\u201d and left unstated the second line, \u201cYour last day is coming, bourgeois!\u201dRussia pumped record amounts of oil last year, nearly 11 million barrels per day, but that pace will not save it in the current global glut. The main government strategy so far seems to be to cut spending and to rely on its reserves until oil prices improve.Russia has around $360 billion in foreign currency reserves and some $120 billion in two rainy day funds, down from just under $160 billion a year ago. At current spending rates, however, the two funds are expected to last only 18 months. It might also sell significant stakes in state-run companies like the oil giant Rosneft or Sberbank, and it will not increase military spending.Mr. Titov, a veteran organizer for the Communist Party, said he felt the economic problems were contributing to a corrosive sense of drift. \u201cRussia always lived with some manner of national idea, a goal: We were building socialism and communism,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is no national idea. Now, we just go with the flow and it is not clear in what direction.\u201dRussian involvement in wars in Ukraine and Syria has swelled the general whirlpool of anxiety, with the possibility of a global war discussed on state-run television. Some analysts accuse the Kremlin of deliberately seeking overseas adventures to distract people from domestic economic woes.\u201cPeople are more alarmed and more tense, because now we are speaking not only about their well-being, but their lives in general,\u201d said Valery Fedorov, director general of the government-owned Russia Public Opinion Research Center, known by its Russian initials, Vciom.Many analysts expect people to do what Russians always do in hard times \u2014 hunker down, tend to their vegetable plots and wait it out. Others say that Russians have gotten used to a higher standard of living and that they will protest losing it.The government allows street protests over issues like lost wages, but its distinctly authoritarian edge emerges in the face of political action.So far, local governments have reacted lightly to the protests. The governor of the Krasnodar Region restored transportation passes for the older Russians receiving the lowest pensions.Some residents, like Mr. Titov, groused that the wealth was being wasted on prestige projects rather than helping ordinary people. Still, he does not expect Russians to sour on Mr. Putin any time soon. In nearby Sochi, Russia spent around $50 billion to host the 2014 Winter Olympics, and a similar construction juggernaut is building stadiums nationwide for the 2018 World Cup.\u201cThe Russian people got what they wanted, a czar ruling the country,\u201d he said of Mr. Putin. \u201cWhat we need is an effective manager, but what we got is the Olympics, soccer and war.\u201dAlexandra Odynova contributed reporting from Krasnodar, and Ivan Nechepurenko from Moscow.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Iowa, Jobs Are Plentiful but Workers Are Not", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byAMES, Iowa \u2014 Unlike the indoor basketball court, foosball tables or fireside lounge at Workiva\u2019s sprawling campus here, the oversize green prize wheel centered among a hive of work stations is not meant for break times.Only employees who refer new hires get a chance to spin it and win up to $2,500.\u201cThirty percent of our recruiting comes from that wheel,\u201d said Matthew M. Rizai, chief executive of Workiva, a cloud-based software firm. The hunt for workers is unrelenting, he said. \u201cWe always have openings.\u201dAt 3.4 percent, Iowa\u2019s unemployment rate is among the lowest in the country. With major metropolitan areas \u2014 crowded with hard-hat construction sites \u2014 painting an alluring picture of steady economic progress, business leaders here retain a sunny optimism that is rarely heard from the presidential candidates.But now that Iowa has achieved a tightening labor market that is the envy of most other states, many companies are confronted with a different set of challenges pushing them to rethink everything from recruiting to economic development.Some immigrants, particularly those without sought-after credentials in technology or science, say they have had trouble finding a job. Salih Salih, 34, who came to the United States as a refugee from Eritrea 10 years ago, said he believed his accent had been a handicap for him and many other people. \u201cThey\u2019re measuring their ability by how they speak English,\u201d said Mr. Salih, who has experience in maintenance and as an electrician.Mr. Salih has found temporary work through People360, an employment agency in Des Moines, but has struggled to find a permanent position despite a college degree and stellar evaluations.Immigrants can encounter difficulties, said Mr. Nelson, the Kemin chief executive, but he added that the acute labor shortage was nudging some skeptics in the business community to be more welcoming. \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s going to relieve us is getting immigrants into the state,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving babies is still a 20-year process.\u201dWith a growing number of retirees and stiff competition for young workers from surrounding Midwestern cities, getting people to resettle in Iowa is necessary for growth, said David A. Swenson, an economist at Iowa State. The state\u2019s important meatpacking, animal feed and dairy industries \u201chave been able to maintain profitability because of immigrant labor.\u201dBut even a relatively modest change in Iowa\u2019s demographics has helped foster a political backlash.Indeed, the state has a hard time attracting outsiders. For some employers, the recruitment strategy includes luring home people with an Iowa connection.\u201cAs a local business, we want people who are tied into the area,\u201d said David Kenworthy, chief executive of Storey Kenworthy, an office supply and furniture company. \u201cWe like to have people returning to Iowa, raise their family and put in roots.\u201dMark Core, an executive vice president at Vermeer, said that his customers say \u201cthe No. 1 thing holding back growth is labor \u2014 every time.\u201dSmall-town Iowans have a huge role in picking the next president. Their deep commitment to the process paints a distinct portrait of democracy.The shortage has a ripple effect. \u201cIt hurts a lot thinking we could add even more people if our end users could find more people to operate our machinery,\u201d Mr. Core said.How the lives of six residents intersected with the campaigns in the last week.Potential newcomers are given a detailed assessment of a particular area\u2019s labor market: how many people are unemployed or willing to switch jobs; how far they would commute; and a sampling of wages.When a company\u2019s representatives (Ms. Durham would prefer not to name names) recently came looking to pay below the $10 median wage that many Iowans now consider the minimum acceptable, Ms. Durham told them, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to find people at that wage.\u201dMany employers say they have raised wages to attract workers, particularly skilled ones, but the insistent complaints about labor shortages have put less pressure on wages in Iowa than expected, economists say.\u201cWage and salary earnings are very much less than the overall national average,\u201d said Mr. Swenson, of Iowa State, citing sectors that include finance, insurance and professional services. \u201cIf the labor supply is tight and you\u2019re not bidding up prices, you\u2019re just making noise.\u201dSome employers have an eye on the rearview mirror, where the last recession still looms large. Though Storey Kenworthy had a record year in 2015, Mr. Kenworthy, its chief, remembers seeing revenue drop more than a third in 2008 and being forced to cut staff. Since then, \u201cwe tried to look at things a little differently,\u201d he said, citing fixed costs like labor. A result is a trend around the country: more emphasis on nonwage benefits and bonuses that can be trimmed back if business dips. Since 2011, wages at the firm have risen to 2.5 from 2 percent annually, Mr. Kenworthy said, with employees now bringing home $48,000 on average. Yearly bonuses and profit sharing add 10 percent more.David Leto, executive vice president of the Palmer Group, an employment agency in Des Moines, said wages had steadily increased but \u201cemployees know not to ask for the moon here.\u201dEmployers are also conscious of keeping parity among existing workers and new hires, he said.He echoed a theme voiced by many Iowa employers: Here, someone can \u201clive big\u201d \u2014 find good schools for children and live in a comfortable house at a fraction of the cost on the coasts.\u201cNot everyone,\u201d Mr. Rizai said, \u201cwants to go to Silicon Valley.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dov Charney Argues in Court for His Return to American Apparel", "Date": "2016-01-21", "News": "Supported by\u201cThere was a plan behind the scenes to steal the company from me,\u201d Mr. Charney testified in Bankruptcy Court in Delaware. \u201cSince then, it\u2019s been a constant hide-the-ball.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a merchant, I\u2019m a creative artist, I\u2019m a photographer, I\u2019m a marketer, I\u2019m an industrialist,\u201d Mr. Charney said, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t want to hand over my company. This is coercion.\u201dAfter two days of testimony from various witnesses and in the face of an impending snowstorm, Judge Brendan L. Shannon said that he would postpone his ruling on American Apparel\u2019s bankruptcy until Monday morning. But he could still decide to extend proceedings even longer or postpone the retailer\u2019s exit from bankruptcy.\u201cI recognize that there is not consensus in the room,\u201d the judge said, referring to the differing plans between the investors backing Mr. Charney, and the company and its creditors who oppose the Charney proposal.But a new alliance between Mr. Charney and the investment funds Hagan Capital Group and Silver Creek Capital \u2014 which have offered to buy American Apparel in a bid valued at $300 million and rehire its founder \u2014 has brought Mr. Charney back into the fray.American Apparel\u2019s senior bondholders are seeking approval of an opposing plan, backed by a majority of the company\u2019s creditors, which would cut about $200 million in debt. Under that plan, the retailer would be taken over by lenders, including Monarch Alternative Capital, Coliseum Capital and Goldman Sachs Asset Management.In animated testimony, Mr. Charney characterized the company\u2019s snub as the latest move in a plot by current and former directors at the company, as well as onetime investment fund allies, who were now blocking his return.Mr. Charney\u2019s account was disputed by American Apparel\u2019s lawyers, and his testimony was interrupted several times by Judge Shannon, who asked him to stop \u201cfree associating.\u201dMr. Charney testified that the board had tried to blackmail him in 2014 by threatening a campaign of \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d unless he surrendered his minority stake in the company and resigned.Mr. Hagan backed Mr. Charney\u2019s allegations.\u201cThere was a lack of dialogue and negotiation,\u201d Mr. Hagan said, calling the company\u2019s interaction with his firm \u201chostile.\u201d\u201cIn my opinion, there was a freeze-out of anyone involved with Dov,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they were trying to scare us away.\u201dThe dispute between Mr. Charney and his former company has been the latest messy chapter for a retail chain that Mr. Charney founded in 1989, and whose T-shirts and bodysuits came to define the alternative look of the 1990s and 2000s. The retailer\u2019s commitment to keeping local manufacturing jobs in Los Angeles, and its championing of progressive causes like immigration reform and marriage equality also earned American Apparel a following among young shoppers.Mr. Charney fueled the dizzying growth of those early years, and his kinetic lifestyle seemed to embody American Apparel\u2019s anti-establishment flair. But soon, the founder was accused of crossing boundaries, and of sexually harassing employees. Mr. Charney has steadfastly denied most accusations as unfounded.The two-day bankruptcy court hearing jumped from analyses of complex financial agreements to musings on the state of American manufacturing and retailing to a discussion of American Apparel\u2019s famous disco pants.Paula Schneider, who took over as American Apparel\u2019s chief executive in January 2015, painted a picture of a company that was in dire straits. \u201cWe were out of key sellers. We were out of disco pants. We were out of pleated skirts,\u201d she testified on Wednesday.\u201cDisco pants? You can\u2019t have a shortage of those,\u201d Judge Shannon remarked, to laughter from the court.\u201cNo, you really can\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Schneider said.American Apparel\u2019s counsel opted not to cross-examine Mr. Charney, saying his rambling testimony had shown he could not be expected to provide information relevant to the company\u2019s turnaround.\u201cAt the end of the day, the Hagan-Charney proposal that came forward is an inferior proposal,\u201d said Scott Greenberg, a lawyer representing American Apparel.\u201cThe proposal leaves the debtors with more leverage, with less liquidity and comes with uncertain and uncommitted financing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt requires by its own terms the consent of our bondholders, which is clearly not forthcoming.\u201dThe bid would therefore lead to \u201ca series of litigious and potentially ugly battles that would further damage the company,\u201d he said.Ms. Schneider said that American Apparel continued to reel from Mr. Charney\u2019s freewheeling management. She said that the company\u2019s hyper-sexualized advertising strategy had caused it to get kicked off Facebook, robbing the retailer of a big e-commerce sales vehicle, and had prompted several lawsuits in Europe.But she said the bankruptcy was the biggest drag on the company\u2019s business.\u201cMost people hear bankruptcy, and they think we\u2019re going out of business,\u201d Ms. Schneider said. \u201cBut they walk in the stores and are sorely disappointed that everything isn\u2019t on clearance.\u201cThe quicker we can get out of bankruptcy, the quicker we can get new product in the stores, the better off the company will be.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He also became a consultant for Microsoft and collaborated on a movie that was accepted by the Sundance Film Festival \u2014 even though he gradually lost the ability to talk and became paralyzed except for his eyes.Mr. Gleason has A.L.S., a motor-neuron disease that afflicts an estimated 20,000 Americans. Patients lose muscle control, which eventually causes difficulty in swallowing and breathing. There is no cure, or even an effective treatment; the average life expectancy is two to five years after the diagnosis.\u201cThe disease takes away your entire physical body and almost always leaves your mind and eyes intact,\u201d Mr. Gleason wrote in an email. \u201cWhen diagnosed with A.L.S., most people are expected to fade quietly away and die.\u201d He decided to forge a different path.As is common among people with A.L.S., the diagnosis took about a year; that is because there is no test for the disease. The only way to determine that someone has A.L.S. is to test for and rule out a range of other diseases.\u201cAfter I was diagnosed, I did some research and found those who were living, and living with purpose despite their diagnosis, were doing so through the use of technology,\u201d Mr. Gleason writes.According to the ALS Association, 75 percent of those with the disease require assistance in order to communicate. New devices, many of them making use of eye-tracking technology, have allowed patients to describe their symptoms to doctors, caregivers and family members, ensuring that they receive better medical care, and have also enabled them to resume some of their hobbies and stay in contact with people via social media, lessening the physical and social isolation of the disease.Mr. Gleason had always been tech-savvy, and when he realized he would soon lose the use of his fingers, he tested out the assistive technologies available for A.L.S. patients at the time. He found that they weren\u2019t fast or powerful enough, and many tablets were not compatible with eye-tracking technology, he says. In 2014 he was tapped to appear in Microsoft\u2019s first Super Bowl commercial. Afterward, he asked the company to make its Surface Pro 2 tablet, which was featured in the advertisement but wasn\u2019t enhanced for people with A.L.S., more useful for people with disabilities.To his surprise, Microsoft said yes. The company flew him to a Microsoft hackathon in Seattle, where he challenged its corps of technologists to come up with a chair that he could drive with his eyes. Twenty-four hours later, they produced a prototype. Microsoft then hired Mr. Gleason as a consultant as it proceeded to fine-tune the chair and also improve the tablet\u2019s compatibility with eye-gaze technology.As for Mr. Gleason, \u201cIt\u2019s revolutionized my life,\u201d he writes. \u201cIt has set me free.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cuomo Revives Long-Stalled Plan to Add Track to L.I.R.R.", "Date": "2016-01-05", "News": "Supported byThe plan, which would add a track to part of the Main Line, would increase the number of trains serving the system, and would, the governor said, deliver a boost to Long Island\u2019s economy.Speaking to a business group at a breakfast in Nassau County, Mr. Cuomo said more reliable rail service would lure more drivers out of their cars and onto mass transit and that would in turn ease congestion on Long Island\u2019s roads.\u201cWe can make mass transit more attractive, faster, more comfortable,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said in his speech to the Long Island Association. \u201cPeople will be more willing to come out of their cars and get into the trains, which is exactly what we have to do.\u201dThe proposed third track, which would run between Floral Park and Hicksville, has been discussed for decades. But it has faced opposition from residents along the route, and it is estimated to cost at least $1 billion.In announcing his effort to move the plan forward, the governor said several million dollars would be spent to start the process, but he did not explain how he intended to finance the cost of constructing an additional track.But as the list of expensive projects grows, many of the details about how they will be financed have not been disclosed, or in some cases even decided.The governor announced the plan as part of a series of events leading up to his State of the State speech next week. A range of groups representing commuters, the construction industry and transportation planners praised the proposal, saying it would reduce bottlenecks on the railroad while allowing more trains to travel from New York City to Long Island for people making the reverse commute.The authority\u2019s current capital plan is still awaiting the approval of state leaders, but officials at the authority said the project could be added to the plan in the future. Republican leaders in the State Senate have recently pushed for more money for upstate roads and bridges in order to approve the capital plan.Asked by a reporter whether the tunnel was a pipe dream, Mr. Cuomo responded by asking if plans like the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and the George Washington Bridge were pipe dreams.Mr. Cuomo said the new plan envisions a somewhat shorter track, which would help reduce the number of properties that would need to be acquired, at least in part, for the project.In 2008, an earlier version of the plan was delayed because the authority did not have the money to pay for it.Leaders on Long Island had varied reactions on Tuesday. The Suffolk County executive, Steve Bellone, a Democrat, said he supported the third-track proposal, arguing that it would improve the region\u2019s economy.But Edward P. Mangano, the Nassau County executive, a Republican who represents the area where the track would be added, took a more cautious tone.\u201cThe M.T.A.\u2019s prior proposal displaced too many homeowners, and we look forward to learning how this plan differs from that of the past,\u201d Mr. Mangano said in a statement.Thomas Tweedy, the mayor of Floral Park, said he had not seen the specific proposal yet, but he did not like the sound of it. He raised concerns about the authority\u2019s ability to complete big projects in a timely manner and the problems construction could cause in his community.\u201cWe thought this was dead and buried,\u201d Mr. Tweedy said.Separately, Mr. Cuomo on Tuesday pledged $300 million for the state\u2019s environmental protection fund for the next fiscal year.

{"Headline": "Morgan Stanley Provides Billionaire Steven Cohen With Loan Secured by Art", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported byIt is not uncommon for wealthy art collectors to take out multiple lines of credit to fund purchases. In the past, Mr. Cohen, 59, has used similar personal loans from Deutsche Bank and other Wall Street banks to finance and defray the cost of some of his big art purchases, which have included works by Jeff Koons, Damien Hirst, Alberto Giacometti and Pablo Picasso. It is estimated that his art collection is worth about $1 billion.Morgan Stanley, however, is providing a line of credit to Mr. Cohen at a time when both his business and personal prospects look far brighter. It could be a shrewd business move for the Wall Street bank, given that Mr. Cohen\u2019s former hedge fund once accounted for 3 percent of the daily trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange.His new firm, Point72 Asset Management, the $11 billion family office which succeeded SAC, has been no slouch, either.The firm, which manages mainly Mr. Cohen\u2019s own personal fortune, has had a second consecutive successful year. In 2015, Point72 was \u201chighly profitable,\u201d said a person briefed on the firm\u2019s performance who spoke on condition of anonymity, even as many big name hedge funds posted double-digit losses. Point72, which employs more than 900 people, had a gross profit of more than $2.5 billion in 2014, its first year as a family office.On Tuesday, the firm announced that it was opening an office in London that could eventually employ up to 70 people. In 2013, SAC shut its London office, laying off dozens, during the height of the insider trading investigation, which led to securities fraud convictions for five former employees of Mr. Cohen.This month, Mr. Cohen reached a civil settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in an administrative matter that will allow him and his firm to begin managing money from outside investors in two years. The settlement was a victory for Mr. Cohen as the S.E.C. initially sought a lifetime ban for him for failing to supervise an employee at his former hedge fund who was convicted of insider trading. Mr. Cohen resolved the matter without admitting any wrongdoing or paying a personal fine.For a man who not too long ago was a prime target for federal authorities trying to root out improper trading in the $3 trillion hedge fund industry, Mr. Cohen, arguably one of the more successful stock traders of his generation, is back on top of the world.Morgan Stanley\u2019s private bank arranged a personal loan of an unspecified sum for the billionaire investor. The loan is secured by \u201cartwork collateral pieces,\u201d according to a filing.A Morgan Stanley spokesman declined to comment on the loan. Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for Mr. Cohen, also declined to comment on the new loan.Mr. Cohen\u2019s love of art has been well chronicled, as have some of his big purchases and major sales at auctions.In November, for instance, he sold a portrait of the former Chinese leader Mao Zedong by Andy Warhol for more than $47 million at a Sotheby\u2019s auction. He bought it in 2007 in a private transaction for $17 million.A number of the works he has accumulated have been on display over the years at the Stamford, Conn., headquarters of his firm, at his house in East Hampton, N.Y., and at his 35,000-square-foot Greenwich, Conn., mansion. One of Mr. Koons\u2019s \u201cBalloon Dog\u201d statues has graced the lawn of that estate.In recent years, Mr. Cohen has begun lending some of his collection to museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art. In 2014, the charitable foundation that he and his wife, Alexandra, manage gave $110,000 to the Bruce Museum in Greenwich. And last summer, the foundation gave $2 million to the Whitney Museum of American Art.Alexandra Stevenson and Chad Bray contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cuomo Announces $1 Billion Expansion for Javits Center", "Date": "2016-01-07", "News": "Supported byAlmost from the day that the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center opened in 1986, exhibitors and hotel operators complained that the black glass complex along 11th Avenue in Manhattan was too small, too hard to navigate and perpetually damp from a leaky roof.Successive New York governors, in turn, have announced their plans for a lavish expansion only to see them founder.Under the plan, Javits North, a semipermanent structure currently anchoring the center\u2019s 40th Street end, would eventually be demolished and replaced with a four-level garage for tractor-trailers bringing in displays and other equipment.Some analysts contend that the convention business contributes little to the economy, as cities across the country discount fees to lure the same shows. But Mr. Cuomo promised that the Javits Center\u2019s expansion to 3.3 million square feet \u2014 a more than 50 percent increase \u2014 would bring more trade shows, jobs and tax revenue to New York.\u201cThe Javits Center has long been an economic generator for this state,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said at a news conference at the center on Thursday. \u201cBut we want to build and expand it to ensure it remains a premier venue for the next generation.\u201dState officials said the center was exploring using \u201cexisting resources\u201d and other public and private financing options to pay for the project. Real estate executives expect the center to sell two nearby parcels of land for about $1 billion, although state officials would not say whether that was part of the plan.Some elected officials, the hotel workers\u2019 union and the hotel association lauded the governor\u2019s plan, which comes less than two years after the state completed a $463 million makeover of the convention center, which included the addition of Javits North.Although Javits is not the nation\u2019s largest convention center \u2014 that is McCormick Place, in Chicago \u2014 it is widely regarded as the busiest, with very little down time.Most convention centers are publicly owned and do not make money. Instead, officials hope to attract out-of-town visitors who book hotel rooms, shop and eat in restaurants, generating jobs and tax revenue.But Heywood T. Sanders, a professor of public administration at the University of Texas, San Antonio, says public investments in convention centers rarely live up to their promise.\u201cYou\u2019re competing in an incredibly overbuilt environment where cities are giving away their space for free,\u201d said Professor Sanders, author of \u201cConvention Center Follies: Politics, Power and Public Investment in American Cities.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to get ahead.\u201dMr. Sanders said convention and trade show attendance at the four major centers in the country \u2014 in Atlanta, Chicago, Las Vegas and Orlando \u2014 fell to 3.8 million in 2014, down by almost one million people since 2006.The same thing is true, he said, at the Javits Center, where trade show and convention attendance in 2014 was 629,500, well below the 966,730 attendees in 2006.In measuring performance, Professor Sanders does not count attendance at public shows, like the auto or boat shows, which generally attract attendees from the local area who do not book hotel rooms or go out to dinner at fancy restaurants.State officials say the small amount of meeting-room space at the Javits Center has hampered its capability to attract larger, more profitable shows. The expansion, they say, will quintuple the amount of meeting-room and ballroom space. In addition, the center for the first time would have 500,000 square feet of contiguous exhibition space.Events at the center in 2014 attracted more than two million visitors, counting both public shows and conventions and trade shows, state officials said.The state canceled plans to nearly double the size of the Javits Center in 2008, after the projected cost swelled to $3 billion from $1.8 billion.The proposal collapsed within six months.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mr. Cuomo\u2019s Challenges: The Short List", "Date": "2016-01-01", "News": "Supported byEditorialFor Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, 2016 could and should be a year of great achievement. He is not facing re-election and is not seeking a spot on the national Democratic ticket. That means his considerable drive and political talents can be trained on making the state more livable for its 20 million inhabitants, and its government more ethical.Mr. Cuomo will combine two important speeches \u2014 his annual State of the State and his budget address \u2014 in one address on Jan. 13. Here are some ideas.The No. 1 issue should be the most obvious: the abysmal transgressions of the Albany crowd. Mr. Cuomo has acknowledged the need for ethics reform after the corruption convictions of two Albany powerhouses, Sheldon Silver and Dean Skelos. But he keeps trying to lower expectations, arguing that there is little he can do about runaway political spending as long as the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision is in force, and blaming the Republicans in the Legislature for doing nothing to reform its own scandalous behavior.These are excuses meant to shield Mr. Cuomo from future criticism. Of course he will need the Legislature\u2019s help. But that does not excuse him from pushing an aggressive agenda.For starters, he should try to close the loophole that allows secretive limited liability companies to contribute as much as individuals can to candidates in statewide races, thus evading the much lower limits imposed on corporations. And he should join the mayors of New York City and Buffalo in refusing to take any more campaign contributions from L.L.C.s.Likewise, unlimited \u201chousekeeping\u201d donations to political parties should also be banned. The Joint Commission on Public Ethics, which is supposed to monitor Albany\u2019s politicians, needs to be stronger and more transparent; its failure is one reason Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, has had to do the tough work of rooting out Albany corruption.Mr. Cuomo must lead the way in persuading lawmakers to limit their income from outside work, to state clearly the source of that income and to bar income associated with anyone doing business before the state. More broadly, and more crucially, he should push hard for the public financing of all state candidates, to provide a way for newcomers to compete with hardened incumbents and finally give voters real choices.Mr. Cuomo should find a way to expand paid family leave and move more quickly to a goal he has publicly espoused: a minimum wage of $15 an hour. This will take some doing, given the opposition from Republican senators, but this governor can make it happen.He cut funding for the homeless in New York City in 2011, but now he promises an ambitious plan to tackle the problem. That is good news as long as the plan provides adequate funding and leads to a more productive relationship with Mayor Bill de Blasio. He also needs to address disturbing problems in the state prisons, and use contract negotiations with prison guards this spring to hold them accountable for abuse of prisoners.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Xerox Chief Removed Ego From Decision to Split Company", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsChief executives usually have big egos. Ursula Burns, though, is handing bragging rights to the billionaire investor Carl C. Icahn.Mr. Icahn agitated for the split and revealed a stake in Xerox last November. Ms. Burns told investors the previous month that the board was seriously considering strategic options for the company. Xerox suffers from shrinking sales in its photocopying and printing business, known as document technology, and from a steady decline in its stock price since late 2014.Ms. Burns does have one problem relating to the new plan. Her defining bet in 2009, the same year she took the helm at Xerox, was to buy Affiliated Computer Services for $6.4 billion. This so-called business-process outsourcing operation \u2013 managing often paper-based administrative tasks for companies in health care, finance and other sectors \u2013 is now being separated again.She may be right that seven years in business are like seven dog years: Things change quickly. But the reversal somewhat undermines her earlier judgment, and if nothing else may mean that it is time for leaders with new ideas at the two planned Xerox offshoots.That said, corner-office occupants more often than not fit themselves into any significant corporate rejig. At Hewlett-Packard, whose split is something of a model for Xerox, the 2014 decision to separate into two companies came with news that Meg Whitman would continue as chief executive of one and chairwoman of the other. When eBay, another Icahn target, announced its divorce from PayPal the same year, it named two new chief executives but said its boss, John Donahoe, would remain on the board of one or both the companies.Advertisement"}
