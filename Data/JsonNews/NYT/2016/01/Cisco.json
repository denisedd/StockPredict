{"Headline": "Matteo Renzi, Italian Premier, Pushes for a Place at Europe\u2019s Power Table", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported by\u201cI\u2019m the leader of a great country,\u201d Mr. Renzi said during an interview last week. \u201cI have my ideas.\u201dMr. Renzi, too, argues that European Union institutions are too bureaucratic and too dominated by a clique of elites and favored nations, especially Germany. Yet he does not want to destroy European institutions.Instead, he is demanding that Italy be given a seat at the power table with Ms. Merkel and President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France.\u201cIf we are looking for a European solution to the refugee problem, then it is not right that Angela first speaks to Hollande and then calls European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, and I only find out about it in the press later,\u201d Mr. Renzi told the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on Thursday, in advance of his visit to Berlin.In his office last week, Mr. Renzi said Europe lacked a larger, positive vision on fighting unemployment and spurring growth and also needed a foreign policy strategy in the Middle East and Africa to curb migration. He said bureaucrats in Brussels must not only focus on fighting with national governments over budget flexibility or achieving fractional deficit targets.\u201cThis is not Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a nightmare.\u201dNearing his two-year anniversary as prime minister, Mr. Renzi said Italian credibility had suffered from past political dysfunction. But he pressed his case that, under his leadership, Italy had now earned the right to be taken seriously, as his government has passed a succession of political, labor, public administration and economic reforms.\u201cAfter two years of listening, now I speak,\u201d said Mr. Renzi, adding that Italy is too often portrayed as a problem child of Europe, dependent on largess from Brussels when, in fact, it contributes more to European Union coffers than it receives in return. \u201cItaly is not the problem, as in the past.\u201dMr. Renzi\u2019s frustrations steadily mounted last year, as he clashed with different European Union officials, and then confronted Germany during a two-day summit meeting of European leaders in Brussels.This month, Mr. Renzi publicly sparred with Mr. Juncker, who warned the Italian leader to stop badmouthing the European Commission \u201cat each street corner.\u201d Mr. Renzi responded by saying Italy had regained a leadership role and others must \u201cdeal with it.\u201dThe money for Turkey is likely to be a major topic of discussion on Friday with Ms. Merkel, who strongly supports the deal and whose own political prospects depend on slowing the numbers of incoming refugees.In Rome, many analysts and politicians say Mr. Renzi\u2019s confrontational tactics reflect genuine Italian frustrations with Brussels. For years, Italy sought financial help on migration but got little from European Union officials.\u201cTo a certain point, he is right,\u201d said Gian Luigi Gigli, a lawmaker in Italy\u2019s lower house. \u201cWe were considered the kids at school who were not doing our homework. In a way, we have done our homework.\u201dBut many analysts also point out that Mr. Renzi is under political pressure at home, as the economy, while improving, is still sluggish and his reforms have not had enough time to bring major changes to people.Taking a tougher stance with Brussels helps him fend off populist political challenges. And other analysts argue that Mr. Renzi is trying to gain leverage as he negotiates with Brussels over more flexibility for Italy\u2019s national budget.Mr. Gigli added that Mr. Renzi was playing a dangerous game and that Italy could only push so far. He said economic indicators were improving in Italy but the country\u2019s staggering public debt remained a critical problem. This week, Italian bank stocks plummeted, as investors were unimpressed with the government\u2019s new agreement with Brussels on addressing nonperforming bank loans.\u201cHow far can we go with this confrontation?\u201d he asked. \u201cThere is the risk that we really can be beaten.\u201dOne question is whether other European leaders will follow Mr. Renzi\u2019s direction, especially in southern countries where left-wing governments are gaining.Fredrik Erixon, an analyst in Brussels, said Mr. Renzi could also benefit from growing resentment toward Germany, as others also complain that Berlin is imposing its will on European Union institutions more directly than in the past.\u201cHe is basically doing what the German government and other governments would be up to \u2014 trying to fight for their national interests,\u201d said Mr. Erixon, director of the European Center for International Political Economy, a research institute. \u201cAnd he is doing it in a way that is not kowtowing to Berlin.\u201dGaia Pianigiani contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Let\u2019s call it, Who\u2019s Losing?But don\u2019t expect it to shift much. Asking \u201cwho\u2019s losing?\u201d misses a larger truth about how thoroughly Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft now lord over all that happens in tech.Who\u2019s really losing? In the larger picture, none of them \u2014 not in comparison with the rest of the tech industry, the rest of the economy and certainly not in the influence each of them holds over our lives.But for much of the last half-decade, most of these five giants have enjoyed a remarkable reprieve from the bogeymen in the garage. And you can bet on them continuing to win. So I\u2019m coining the name the Frightful Five.Though competition between the five remains fierce \u2014 and each year, a few of them seem up and a few down \u2014 it\u2019s becoming harder to picture how any one of them, let alone two or three, may cede their growing clout in every aspect of American business and society.Indeed, the Frightful Five are so well protected against start-ups that in most situations, the rise of new companies only solidifies their lead.This gets to the core of the Frightful Five\u2019s indomitability. They have each built several enormous technologies that are central to just about everything we do with computers. In tech jargon, they own many of the world\u2019s most valuable \u201cplatforms\u201d \u2014 the basic building blocks on which every other business, even would-be competitors, depend.These platforms are inescapable; you may opt out of one or two of them, but together, they form a gilded mesh blanketing the entire economy.The Big Five\u2019s platforms span so-called old tech \u2014 Windows is still the king of desktops, Google rules web search \u2014 and new tech, with Google and Apple controlling mobile phone operating systems and the apps that run on them; Facebook and Google controlling the Internet advertising business; and Amazon, Microsoft and Google controlling the cloud infrastructure on which many start-ups run.Many of these platforms generate what economists call \u201cnetwork effects\u201d \u2014 as more people use them, they keep getting more indispensable. Why do you chat using Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp, also owned by Facebook? Because that\u2019s where everyone else is.Then there\u2019s the data buried in the platforms, also a rich source for new business. This can happen directly \u2014 for instance, Google can tap everything it learns about how we use our phones to create an artificial intelligence engine that improves our phones \u2014 and in more circuitous ways. By watching what\u2019s popular in its app store, Apple can get insight into what features to add to the iPhone.\u201cIn a way, a lot of the research and development costs are being borne by companies out of their four walls, which allows them to do better product development,\u201d Mr. Parker said.This explains why these companies\u2019 visions are so expansive. In various small and large ways, the Frightful Five are pushing into the news and entertainment industries; they\u2019re making waves in health care and finance; they\u2019re building cars, drones, robots and immersive virtual-reality worlds. Why do all this? Because their platforms \u2014 the users, the data and all the money they generate \u2014 make these far-flung realms seem within their grasp.Which isn\u2019t to say these companies can\u2019t die. Not long ago people thought IBM, Cisco Systems, Intel and Oracle were unbeatable in tech; they\u2019re all still large companies, but they\u2019re far less influential than they once were.Even with these difficulties, it\u2019s unclear if the larger dynamic may change much. Let\u2019s say that Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce company, eclipses Amazon\u2019s retail business in India \u2014 well, O.K., so then it satisfies itself with the rest of the world.So get used to these five. Based on their stock prices this month, the giants are among the top 10 most valuable American companies of any kind. Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft are the top three; Facebook is No. 7, and Amazon is No. 9. Wall Street gives each high marks for management; and three of them \u2014 Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook \u2014 are controlled by founders who don\u2019t have to bow to the whims of potential activist investors.So who\u2019s losing? Not one of them, not anytime soon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Looking for Signs That Apple\u2019s Runaway Growth Is Waning", "Date": "2016-01-24", "News": "Supported byAlready, some investors have begun to treat Apple in a new way: as a \u201cvalue\u201d stock, a label typically attached to companies that generate predictable business results or a reliable dividend, rather than ones that deliver runaway revenue growth. Value stocks often command much lower valuations than growth stocks.\u201cPeople were in love with Apple because hits like the iPod and iPhone created phenomenal growth,\u201d said Ernesto Ramos, a fund manager at BMO Global Asset Management, which manages $18 billion and counts Apple as its largest holding. \u201cAs investors shifted their minds around the fact that it\u2019s no longer going to deliver the same sort of huge growth over the next five years, the stock became a value play.\u201dMr. Ramos says his firm still owns Apple in some of its growth funds, but began including the stock in value funds in mid-2013.Switching from being a growth stock to being a value stock can also be a long and painful process. Growth investors need to sell a company\u2019s shares and drive down the price until it is low enough to tempt value investors, who buy stocks they think are cheap compared with the intrinsic value of the company. In the tech industry, a shift from growth to value also often signals to investors that a company is facing newer competitors with more innovative products, raising the question of how relevant the company can remain.\u201cInvestors don\u2019t like to see the words tech and value combined because when growth slows at a tech company, it usually means that something essentially is not working,\u201d said Angelo Zino, a senior analyst at the research firm S&P Capital IQ.A spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment.Any change would have repercussions beyond Apple because its soaring performance in recent years helped lift the broader market. If Apple shares were removed from the equation, the performance of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index in five of the last seven years would drop by about 1 percentage point, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices. In 2014, for instance, the index rose 13.7 percent with Apple and 12.9 percent without Apple.The Apple effect is even more pronounced when technology names are isolated. For tech stocks on the S.&P. 500 as a group, annual gain in 2009 declined by 6 percentage points when Apple shares were not included, dropping to 56 percent from 62 percent.The effect was more muted last year as Apple\u2019s growth decelerated, according to the data.Investors have turned to Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet, which owns Google \u2014 collectively referred to as the FANG stocks \u2014 for growth. Those companies are each expected to show annual revenue gains of 23 to 40 percent for the last three months of 2015, while Apple is projected to deliver 3 percent revenue growth, according to Bloomberg data.Mr. Ramos says companies like Amazon have bigger growth potential for his fund than Apple, though he plans to continue owning Apple shares. \u201cAmazon will see about 20 percent revenue growth, and earnings per share are expected to jump considerably,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a very strong growth story.\u201dApple shares have already been buffeted in recent months because of worries about the slowing economy in China, which the company counts as one of its largest markets. Half a dozen companies that provide parts for the iPhone also blamed weak demand from Apple for lower-than-expected earnings, causing worries about the company\u2019s sales trajectory.\u201cIf you wanted to outperform the market, the FANG stocks did better,\u201d said Jonathan Krinsky, an analyst at MKM Partners, though he added that Apple remained a must-watch stock because it composed such a large part of many stock indexes.Investors may still someday reanoint Apple as a growth stock, especially if the company can create a best-selling new product that drives up its sales rate. Wall Street analysts cite Microsoft as an example of a business that lost steam and then made the adjustments necessary to deliver strong revenue growth again.Apple has been reclassified as a value stock before. FTSE Russell, which makes several closely followed stock indexes, found in 2013 that Apple no longer met its criteria to be treated purely as a growth stock. Some of the company\u2019s enormous market capitalization was reallocated to the Russell Value Index, as well as being in the Russell Growth Index. A year later, when the company\u2019s sales had risen strongly with the introduction of the iPhone 6, FTSE Russell placed Apple solely back in the growth index.Tom Goodwin, FTSE Russell\u2019s senior research director, said that stock price, sales growth and analyst expectations determine whether a company is placed in the growth or value index, or in both. About a third of the stocks that Russell tracks are included in both indexes, he said.But until Apple reveals another hit or shows a significant pickup in iPhone sales growth, Apple should be viewed as a value-oriented name, Mr. Zino said.\u201cHistorically Apple was the name to own if you wanted to outperform the market,\u201d he said. \u201cNow there are other places to look.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "PAID FOR AND POSTED BYWe now live in the age of digitization. Connected technologies can monitor everything from our bodies and cars to factories and businesses. Unprecedented amounts of data are being collected and analyzed to solve real-world problems as personal as asthma attacks and as complicated as car accidents, pipeline ruptures and supply chain breakdowns. This is happening today. And it\u2019s only the beginning.At the same time, the world faces a growing litany of complicated challenges. There are doubts that enough water and food can be distributed to growing populations. Job creation appears insufficient to narrow the widening gap between the rich and poor, further driving social and political instability. These are just a few of the known problems today.While the challenges may seem insurmountable, there are reasons for optimism. The Internet of Things and other technologies that link people, data and devices can provide the tools for confronting economic inefficiency, climate change and more. Companies are also more focused on the issues beyond the bottom line, and a new generation of workers is ready to take action.With the confluence of grand global problems and digital transformation, the world needs individuals who not only have the desire to make the world better but also the knowledge and skills to do so. A new generation of problem solvers must be discovered, prepared and engaged.Companies, meanwhile, are moving in the same direction as CEOs are demanding more sustainable and socially conscious practices. \u201cEveryone\u2019s making an effort to do a little bit more,\u201d says Allie Williams, executive director of the Corporate Responsibility Association.That\u2019s a change from a generation ago, when most people and companies were concerned about themselves and their profits. \u201cPeople are much more connected to each other today,\u201d says Anita McGahan, a professor of strategic management at Toronto\u2019s Rotman School of Management.\u00a0Education \u2014 the key connection of young people to their careers and the future \u2014 is also changing. Today, professors are teaching students to solve problems, become social entrepreneurs and to think critically. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to simply teach our students how to advertise toys and bubble gum,\u201d McGahan says. \u201cSocial consciousness and social entrepreneurship are at the heart of the biggest business opportunities for this century.\u201d\u00a0The McKinsey study traces the problem to the fact that major stakeholders are not engaging with each other. A third of companies say they never work with educators. Of those who do, fewer than half said the communication was effective. Meanwhile, fewer than half of the youth surveyed said they had an understanding of what to study for a profession with openings and decent wages.\u00a0Billions of connected sensors and other devices are collecting unprecedented amounts of data that can be analyzed and acted upon by people or computers. The Internet of Things, the connection of people, data, and processes, is transforming how we do everything. Patients wearing connected watches can send their heart rates to their doctors; sensors on store shelves can tell store managers when to restock; cars can now tell you when you get too close to a car or that you\u2019re steering the wrong way. Every industry will operate differently in the future than it does today. To work with such rapidly evolving technologies, students need to learn how to solve problems that they don\u2019t even know exist yet.\u00a0This technology will only become more powerful in the future. People will be able to predict when they\u2019re about to have a heart attack, sensors will be able to monitor minute changes in global temperatures, devices will stop pipeline leaks or bridge collapses before they happen and much more. \u00a0There is no question IoT will play an important role in solving global problems. Even today, it\u2019s being used on smaller-scale global challenges such as clean water and agriculture. The not-for-profit organization Living Goods, for instance, deploys a small army of door-to-door entrepreneurs to villages in Uganda and Kenya to dispense drugs and advice\u00a0on improving health and generating wealth. All transactions are done through a basic smartphone, which serves a tool for collecting health data and distributing information to people in need.In areas where it operates, Living Goods has reduced childhood mortality by more than 25 percent, while also pushing drug prices down 17 percent and cutting in half the prevalence of counterfeit drugs. \u201cWhat's the most powerful tool in their bag?\u201d asks Living Goods CEO Chuck Slaughter. \u00a0\u201cA simple, feature-free mobile phone.\u201dSensors are also being put to use to help some of the 800 million people \u2014 or one-ninth of the world\u2019s population \u2014 who don\u2019t have access to clean water. The international development organization Water for People uses the technology to collect and analyze data in India, Bolivia, Uganda and other clean water-starved nations. Thanks to its work, nearly 200,000 people gained access to improved water in 2014.The Internet of Things is also beginning to help address hunger in a world where roughly 805 million people consume less than the recommended 2,100 calories per day. In Africa, a network of inexpensive sensors was installed for a small farming community. Radio towers built by the Hershey Company collected the data, which was analyzed by sophisticated software that told the farmers when and where to plant their crops to maximize the yield.\u201cThe farmers made money and in turn that made their community stronger and more vibrant,\u201d says Williams of the Corporate Responsibility Association. \u201cA great deal of education was needed to use the technology, but that resulted in more meaningful decisions and more meaningful ways for people to do things.\u201dMaximizing the benefits of IoT on a global scale will require skills that traditional educational institutions haven\u2019t traditionally taught in the past. Workers will need a breadth of knowledge across a number of high-tech fields, including data analytics, security, programming and infrastructure management. They also need to be creative and innovative \u2014 and for some entrepreneurial.By 2020, IoT is expected to become a $19 trillion industry with 26 billion interconnected devices, according to Cisco Systems. It has the potential to be a powerful tool for solving global problems \u2014 or a major missed opportunity if there are not enough workers to support it.While many businesses are focused on social change, Cisco is combining technology and education with the goal of creating a pipeline of global thinkers to tackle the future\u2019s most difficult challenges. The networking pioneer has been educating workers since 1997, when it started the Cisco Networking Academy, as a set of courses and certificate programs.\u00a0Today, the Networking Academy partners with more than 9,500 institutions that teach one million students each year in over 170 countries. Between 2005 and 2014, more than 1.3 million students have started new jobs as a result of the program.\u00a0The Networking Academy is about far more than helping workers fix network problems \u2014 it\u2019s giving people the chance to be on technology\u2019s cutting edge and to contribute to society and business in more meaningful ways. Students learn from instructors with diverse backgrounds and do hands-on work that can be applied in real-life and unexpected situations.\u201cYou can\u2019t anticipate everything,\u201d says Amanda Cumberland, a research and evaluation specialist with Cisco. \u201cIf you teach someone a coding language, for instance, then that could become obsolete. But teach them how to think about coding and to understand the principles of it and they can apply it to whatever new skill is coming out.\u201dAs many skills as people learn at the Networking Academy, it\u2019s the program\u2019s focus on problem solving that\u2019s benefiting these future leaders the most. The world is changing so quickly that today\u2019s workers will have to be able to think quickly and creatively.\u201cWe are harnessing the power of technology to launch a generation of problem solvers,\u201d says Tae Yoo, senior vice president of corporate affairs at Cisco. \u00a0\u201cThey are being taught to innovate like technologists, think like entrepreneurs and act as social change agents.\u201d\u00a0Networking Academy students are challenged in hackathons and problem-solving contests to find solutions using Internet of Things and other technologies. They\u2019re connecting their skills and critical thinking to real-world problems big and small.\u00a0One group of French students wanted to solve a problem for the uncle of one of its members. The uncle was blind and using an old walking stick to get around. The group thought that there must be a better way. After speaking to organizations for the visually impaired, an idea hit them: Build an Internet-connected device that would harness data to help people get around. The walking cane built by the team of students accesses the Internet via a 3G connection and can relay information, such as when a stoplight is red or green, GPS directions, street repair details and more to a headset worn by the visually impaired user.In 2014, the team won a competition run by Cisco and used the prize to get Handisco, a company that\u2019s developing and manufacturing these canes off the ground.\u00a0The team is proof that smart problem solving, when combined with technology, is making the world a better place and creating jobs as well. \u201cA lot of people haven\u2019t had access to what we have today,\u201d says Florian Esteves, the team member who now leads Handisco. \u201cBut it\u2019s important for me and my team to give people that technology, to give it to the people who really need it.\u201d\u00a0Another student, Zoe Rose, also sees her future connected to bigger global issues. The 26-year-old IT staffer says her Networking Academy experience helped her understand the important role people like herself play so that technology can solve the world\u2019s most important problems.\u00a0While at the Networking Academy, she was part of Cisco\u2019s Dream Team, a group of 10 Networking Academy students who are tasked with setting up 1,000 network access points at a major conference in San Francisco. Working with fellow students and mentors, she learned the importance of creative and critical thinking to solve real-world problems \u2014 and that\u2019s stayed with her.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re superheroes,\u201d Rose says. \u201cTechnology is going to help solve many of the world\u2019s issues, and we\u2019re at the forefront of that change.\u201dMuch like how networks become more powerful as the number of sensors and other connected devices grow, so does the impact of the Networking Academy as more students pass through the program. Esteves and Rose are just two examples of what will become the new\u00a0generation of global problem solvers.The news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "Global Tensions Threaten to Upstage World Economic Forum in Davos", "Date": "2016-01-18", "News": "Supported byTensions reminiscent of the Cold War keep flaring with Russia and in the Middle East \u2014 not to mention over the Korean Peninsula. Europe is struggling to cope with a refugee crisis that risks fracturing the European Union, even as the bloc tries to counter a rising security threat from the Islamic State. Britain may vote this year on whether to leave the European Union altogether. And China\u2019s growth slowdown could prompt the second global financial crisis within a decade.Given those strains, the official Davos theme this time \u2014 \u201cMastering the Fourth Industrial Revolution\u201d \u2014 may sound oddly out of tune, and the various panels on the topic could prove to be little more than sideshows.Klaus Schwab, the World Economic Forum\u2019s founder and one of the best-connected men on the planet, is nonetheless using the forum\u2019s website to urge the cadre of bankers, politicians, tech executives and trend makers to ponder \u201cthe fusion of technologies across the physical, digital and biological worlds, which is creating entirely new capabilities and dramatic impacts on political, social and economic systems.\u201dThe big-thought themes of Davos often billow above current events. Last year, the topic was \u201cThe New Global Context,\u201d a reference to shifting political, economic and social forces in the world. The year before focused on the \u201cReshaping of the World.\u201d If such banners are somewhat elusive, so, too, is the gathering\u2019s ability to map solutions to more immediate problems.But then, problem-solving is not really the point. More than anything, Davos, at about 5,120 feet, is about high-altitude networking.The forum is where hedge fund managers, central bankers, chief executives, social-media magnates, heads of state, self-help gurus, artists, celebrities, fashion models and even archbishops engage in the equivalent of intellectual or corporate speed dating. If all goes well, they may pry open a possible business deal, pad out a contact list or maybe receive enlightenment about affairs outside their professional expertise.Many deal makers retreat to hotel suites for much of the conference, forsaking the official program in favor of a whirl of meetings, emerging only to attend private parties in exclusive chalets on the Davos slopes or invitation-only power dinners.This year\u2019s tech luminaries are to include Jack Ma, the head of China\u2019s online retail giant Alibaba; John T. Chambers, the chief of Cisco Systems, the Internet hardware maker; Eric E. Schmidt, executive chairman of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company; and Sheryl K. Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook.And then there are the captains of the financial industry, including Jamie Dimon, the head of JPMorgan Chase; Gary D. Cohn, Goldman Sachs\u2019s chief operating officer; and top executives from most of the world\u2019s major banks.Also on hand will be a host of regulators who oversee the big banks, including Jacob J. Lew, the United States Treasury secretary, as well as an influential coterie of central bankers who determine monetary policy, including Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank.Foremost among their concerns this year may be whether problems in China, whose rapidly slowing economy has rattled stock and commodity markets around the world, could cause a relapse into global financial instability just as Europe and the United States are recovering from the last crisis. No clear remedies are likely to emerge from Davos, though, because top leaders from China, as in years past, will not be present.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France are conspicuously avoiding the gathering this year, judging it more effective to grapple with pressing problems back home.And then there is the controversy surrounding North Korea. Last fall, the conference organizers took the unusual step of inviting a delegation from Pyongyang. But shortly after North Korea trumpeted a nuclear bomb test on Jan. 5, the Davos organizers disinvited the delegates \u2014 prompting North Korean officials to declare the snub \u201cseriously unjust.\u201dAnd yet, in the honeycomb of private side rooms inside the old nuclear bunker where the main conference takes place, or on the leather couches of the nearby five-star Belvedere Hotel, a favorite place for private dinners and parties, there are always opportunities for key players to make progress on thorny subjects.This year, for instance, Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, is expected to meet on the sidelines with Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece, who defied the fund and Europe\u2019s political elite for many months last year over the terms of a multibillion-euro bailout, risking his country\u2019s exit from the eurozone. More recently, Mr. Tsipras, having turned from a defender of the poor to a mainstream leader eager to save Greece from further financial turmoil, is expected to try to persuade Ms. Lagarde to send more of the fund\u2019s money to Athens.And even if no big policy breakthroughs are achieved, at least there will be star power. Justin Trudeau, the youthful new Canadian prime minister, will give a keynote address aiming to sell a fresh image of Canada to the world.The stalwarts will continue to show up, including Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, who may be pressing his case that Britain should stay in the European Union if the bloc is willing to cut his country a new deal. From the United States, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is leading a delegation including Secretary of State John Kerry and Ashton Carter, the secretary of defense.As for the movers and shakers who have not had time to brush up on this year\u2019s official theme \u2014 how artificial intelligence and robotics are changing humanity \u2014 Mr. Schwab, the forum\u2019s founder, has conveniently published a new book, \u201cThe Fourth Industrial Revolution.\u201dA link on the World Economic Forum\u2019s website whisks readers to Amazon, where the 4,300-kilobyte e-book can be purchased for about $8 \u2014 a digital value that no billionaire should be able to resist.Advertisement"}

Already Ted Cruz\u2019s strategists were discussing a run. His longtime adviser Jason Johnson would go on to spend most of 2014 researching how Republicans had won and lost presidential elections, while the senator appeared at various Iowa fund-raising events. When word began to circulate in March 2015 that Marco Rubio and Rand Paul would be announcing their candidacies sometime in April, by the end of the Senate recess, Cruz\u2019s game plan started to emerge. They set their sights on a date in late March, which would allow Cruz to dominate the news and draw a quick infusion of campaign money for at least a week before attention turned to Rubio and Paul. Needing to move quickly, and not wanting to tip off the opposition, Cruz\u2019s senior staff sought out a telegenic venue where a heavily conservative audience could be assembled on a moment\u2019s notice.That was how, 16 months after his father took the stage there, Ted Cruz became the first politician to launch a presidential campaign at Liberty \u2014 the largest Christian university in the world, with an enrollment of 77,000 students. His March 23 speech, which he hand-scribbled the evening before and delivered without benefit of notes or a teleprompter, included this pivotal thought: \u2018\u2018Today, roughly half of born-again Christians aren\u2019t voting. They\u2019re staying home. Imagine instead millions of people of faith all across America coming out to the polls and voting our values.\u2019\u2019 That exhortation, an echo of his father\u2019s plea to \u2018\u2018vote for righteous people,\u2019\u2019 reflected the Cruz team\u2019s key political calculation: Of the 22 states that will be casting their ballots for a Republican nominee between Feb. 1 and March 5, 11 of them feature a Republican electorate that is more than 50 percent evangelical. Even more significant, the first state to vote is Iowa, roughly 60 percent of whose Republican caucus-goers describe themselves as evangelical Christians. As had been the case in recent election cycles, if Cruz could persuade this voting bloc to coalesce around him, then in this crowded field of Republican candidates he would almost certainly emerge the winner in Iowa. And unlike previous caucus winners, Cruz was already building a formidable national campaign organization that could capitalize on an Iowa victory and propel him toward the nomination.One morning early in January, in the lobby of a public library in Onawa, Iowa, I listened to Cruz\u2019s campaign manager, Jeff Roe, as he explained a central challenge of his previous few months. \u2018\u2018Prior to March 23,\u2019\u2019 Roe said, \u2018\u2018if you were to word-cloud \u2018Ted Cruz,\u2019 which we do every day \u2014 take all the Google mentions and Internet searches, dump them into a file and form a cloud \u2014 you can\u2019t find \u2018evangelical.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 In other words, voters were largely unaware of the Tea Party firebrand\u2019s religious faith. To convince evangelicals that Ted Cruz was the \u2018\u2018righteous\u2019\u2019 candidate, Roe told me, his team needed to sell him as such, from the very beginning: \u2018\u2018Regardless of what you\u2019ve got in the bank, you\u2019d better determine the narrative of the campaign, and show that\u2019s who we are, every day.\u2019\u2019Behind the scenes, Cruz and his team were in fevered competition with Rubio, Ben Carson, Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum to lock down the evangelical vote. The Cruz campaign courted movement leaders like Dr. James Dobson, who formally endorsed Cruz on Dec. 17 and joined the candidate on the Iowa campaign trail soon after. Eleven days after Dobson\u2019s endorsement, the Texas political activist and longtime Cruz supporter David Barton gathered about 300 \u2018\u2018faith leaders\u2019\u2019 for a meet-and-greet with Cruz at the ranch of the Republican billionaire Farris Wilks in Cisco, Tex. \u2018\u2018He was with them six hours, and about an hour and 20 minutes of that was nothing but prayer, and Ted was right in the middle of it,\u2019\u2019 Barton told me. \u2018\u2018The spiritual leaders wanted to pray for the country, and he was completely comfortable with that, and that was a pleasant surprise to many of them.\u2019\u2019As a fund-raiser, Ted Cruz has given victory-starved evangelicals some cause to believe that his campaign is, as the Iowa conservative talk radio host and Cruz supporter Steve Deace puts it, \u2018\u2018superior to what we\u2019ve seen from any other movement conservative that\u2019s ever run for the presi\u00addency.\u2019\u2019 Cruz has raised over $50 million from more than 600,000 donations, including those from the Wilks brothers of Texas, who also have given $15 million to Cruz\u2019s super PAC: all numbers that establish him as a top-tier candidate. He has built large campaign organizations in the states immediately following Iowa \u2014 New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada \u2014 and has also traveled extensively through the March 1 \u2018\u2018Super Tuesday\u2019\u2019 states of Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Arkansas and Oklahoma. Though his team is not staffed with the sort of elite Republican operatives who work for Rubio and Jeb Bush, it has thus far waged one of the most professional and error-free campaigns in the field.The results of these efforts will become manifest on Feb. 1, when Iowa Republican voters will settle the current hard-fought contest between Cruz and Donald Trump. Trump poses a threat to Cruz\u2019s presidential ambitions because, unlike the Texan, he does not seem to possess an electoral playbook, and instead can get by with something Cruz lacks: a lot of potential voters seem to like him and are titillated by the idea of him as president. Exactly two weeks before the Iowa caucus, when Trump himself spoke at Liberty University, he botched a Bible quotation and, against university rules, uttered a profanity, two miscues that Cruz would never commit. All the same, Liberty\u2019s president, Jerry Falwell Jr., declared that \u2018\u2018Donald Trump is a breath of fresh air,\u2019\u2019 and Trump has pulled ahead of Cruz in some national polls of evangelical voters.But Cruz\u2019s campaign manager, Roe \u2014 a beefy veteran operative from Kansas City, Mo., with narrow, gleaming eyes \u2014 told me that by at least one unit of measurement, their tactics were already working. \u2018\u2018In the word clouds we used to do before he announced, the words that always came up were \u2018Texas,\u2019 \u2018Tea Party,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Roe said confidently. \u2018\u2018Now it\u2019s \u2018Christian,\u2019 \u2018evangelical,\u2019 \u2018conservative,\u2019 \u2018leader,\u2019 \u2018strong.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019The last remark provoked knowing chortles in the stairwell. The volunteers came from 26 different states, but the plurality of them were Texans. The undecided Iowa voters they met on doorsteps or on the phone often commented on their unmistakable accents. The volunteers would acknowledge their origins and then say: \u2018\u2018Well, is there anything we can tell you about Ted? Because we\u2019re from Texas, and we know him really well.\u2019\u2019 As one of them, Maggie Wright \u2014 a 70-year-old from the Fort Worth area who made her rounds in a sedan painted with portraits of Cruz \u2014 recounted to me: \u2018\u2018We say: \u2018Well, we know Ted\u2019s positions. He\u2019s for states\u2019 rights, for all the Constitution, he will not allow us to bash the gays but won\u2019t let anybody do jihad on the Christians.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019Though Cruz must do well in Iowa to establish momentum in the other early caucuses and primaries, the state in recent history has been a dubious springboard to national success. Since 1976, three winners of Iowa\u2019s contested Republican caucuses have ultimately gained the national party\u2019s nomination, but only one \u2014 George W. Bush, in 2000 \u2014 went on to become president. The last two caucus winners, Huckabee in 2008 and Santorum in 2012, managed to rally Iowa\u2019s social conservatives but lacked both the resources and the breadth of support to compete against John McCain and Mitt Romney, whose campaign themes were less pitched to the Christian right.And so the Cruz campaign has sought to assure Iowa evangelical leaders of two things: that Cruz is one of them, and that he can win the presidency. In return, Cruz\u2019s campaign team has sought from Iowa evangelical leaders not only their endorsement but also their commitment to rally congregants to the polls. Leading this effort has been Rafael Cruz, who since his son\u2019s announcement has spent 29 days in Iowa, talking to fellow evangelical ministers in groups ranging from 25 to 350.Bob Vander Plaats, a major evangelical activist in Iowa, told me, \u2018\u2018Evangelicals have really felt a great need to have one of the their own in the White House, and the last couple of election cycles they\u2019ve frankly felt a bit used.\u2019\u2019 He went on to say that in the general election, \u2018\u2018we\u2019ve gone with the guy who can win, but let\u2019s not talk about principles and wink-wink he\u2019ll deliver once he\u2019s there. And I think you now see that frustration in the huge numbers who stay home on Election Day.\u2019\u2019 Vander Plaats has enthusiastically endorsed Cruz; he says the conventional wisdom regarding an evangelical nominee can be proved wrong.\u2018\u2018When you run a true conservative like Ronald Reagan, you\u2019re going to win,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018George W. Bush, who said his mentor was Jesus \u2014 you win. The past two elections, we\u2019ve been leaving millions of conservatives home, because they see no reason to vote. Not this time. Now we have a full-spectrum conservative in Ted Cruz. This is a base election, and everyone knows it. And I think he crushes Hillary.\u2019\u2019It\u2019s a notable feature of Cruz\u2019s political r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that he became an outsider only after the insiders rebuffed him. He first materialized in the political world as a domestic-policy adviser for the 2000 presidential campaign of George W. Bush. He quickly became known for his arrogance and ambition: One story was that he introduced himself to a colleague with the proclamation, \u2018\u2018I\u2019m Ted Cruz, and I\u2019m going to be Texas\u2019s first Hispanic governor.\u2019\u2019 Little of today\u2019s ideological staunchness was apparent back then. As one of the Bush campaign\u2019s top officials recalls of him: \u2018\u2018Conservative? Yes. Principled conservative torchbearer fighting the fight in the bowels of the campaign? Nope.\u2019\u2019Cruz wrote in his 2015 autobiography, \u2018\u2018A Time for Truth,\u2019\u2019 that it was \u2018\u2018a crushing blow\u2019\u2019 when he failed to receive a top post in the Bush administration. Not long after becoming the Texas solicitor general in 2003 at age 32, Cruz confided his ambitions for higher office during a four-hour meeting with the Republican establishment\u2019s reigning guru, his fellow Texan Karl Rove. The Bush consigliere advised the young solicitor general to bide his time. He spent the next few years developing a reputation as a notably tough and creative lawyer, winning several high-profile Supreme Court cases, and in 2008 he left office for a partnership at a private firm in Houston. The following year, Cruz decided to run for state attorney general after it appeared that the seat might become vacant. Cruz devotes several pages in his autobiography to describing how he persuaded former President George H.\u2009W. Bush to endorse him, only to be bullied by Rove into withdrawing his name so that a Bush crony could run in his place. (An adviser involved in the machinations told me that Cruz had misleadingly implied to the elderly Bush that he would be the only Republican in the race, when in fact it was well known in Republican circles that two friends of the Bushes were also eyeing the job.)Today\u2019s Washington outsider made a second pitch to the Republican establishment in 2010, before he kicked off a long-shot campaign for the Senate seat being vacated by Kay Bailey Hutchison. Both the state and national Republican chieftains offered him little in the way of encouragement. While trying to convince the Texas party chairman at the time, Steve Munisteri, that he could be a legitimate candidate, Cruz asked, \u2018\u2018What if I managed to raise $5 million?\u2019\u2019 Munisteri recalls saying, \u2018\u2018Well, then at the end of the day, that\u2019s $5 million you won\u2019t have anymore.\u2019\u2019It was only then that Cruz began to make a virtue out of his inability to impress the insiders. His 2012 Senate race was straight out of the Tea Party playbook, complete with endorsements from Sarah Palin and Rand Paul. Compared with his current quest for the presidency, the Senate candidate Cruz\u2019s courting of evangelicals was comparatively muted. This was because his chief opponent, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, was himself a rock-solid social conservative. Still, the upstart could not afford to cede the evangelical vote to Dewhurst. Cruz\u2019s former digital director Vincent Harris (who is now affiliated with Rand Paul\u2019s campaign) says that Cruz\u2019s father played an important role in his upset victory. \u2018\u2018When Ted couldn\u2019t be somewhere, Rafael was always there, and he got those crowds so fired up,\u2019\u2019 Harris recalls. \u2018\u2018Rafael was the dog whistle to evangelicals, saying things that libertarian and Tea Party types wouldn\u2019t hear as much but that evangelicals really understood.\u2019\u2019After scoring his upset victory in 2012, Cruz took his Tea Party platform with him to Washington, while his evangelical predilections remained in the margins. (Unlike his current monologues on the presidential campaign trail, Cruz\u2019s numerous speeches in 2013 seldom if ever contained biblical references. Though he quoted from Proverbs during his 21-hour anti-Obamacare floor speech, Cruz actually spent far more time reciting the Dr. Seuss book \u2018\u2018Green Eggs and Ham.\u2019\u2019) What did resurface was the same arrogance that had alienated his Bush colleagues, and that Cruz in his autobiography says he put behind him after the Bush experience taught him \u2018\u2018to treat others with greater respect and humility.\u2019\u2019Cruz has continued to struggle to get along with his Republican allies. Just 10 days after winning his Senate election in Nov. 2012, Cruz spoke in Washington before a decidedly friendly gathering hosted by the Federalist Society, of which he is a member. Many of the attendees had supported the presidential campaign of Mitt Romney. In his speech, Cruz gleefully mocked the conservative credentials of the vanquished candidate, saying, \u2018\u2018I\u2019m pretty certain Mitt Romney actually French-kissed Barack Obama\u2019\u2019 during their final debate. As one attendee who had contributed to both Cruz and Romney later said, \u2018\u2018He managed to offend so many good people in that room who had killed themselves for Mitt.\u2019\u2019Cruz also wasted little time offending his Republican colleagues in the Senate, well before any ideological battle lines had been drawn. Barely a month after the new Texas senator was sworn in, the Republican senators held a retreat in an ornate Library of Congress reading room. According to a senior aide who was present, Cruz \u2018\u2018arrived late, raring for a fight, sat down and almost immediately started engaging aggressively and theatrically in a way that was so out of place for Senate politesse, but especially for someone brand-new. People were looking around like, \u2018Who the hell does this guy think he is?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019But the questions about whether the guy named Ted can win the nomination, let alone the presidency, run deeper than concerns over his likability. In particular, the campaign\u2019s audacious decision to focus more on revving up the evangelical community than on broadening its outreach to young and Hispanic voters is a high-risk strategy that, should it backfire, might do more than cost Cruz the White House. His deeply conservative rhetoric could cost Republicans the Senate, erode their majority in the House and reinforce the party\u2019s reputation among emerging demographic groups as the party of embittered and narrow-minded white men.Cruz makes a special point in his stump speech to mock this apocalyptic scenario. After all, he tells audiences, the same fears were voiced in 1980, about an idealistic conservative candidate whom the Washington elite considered an extremist. Instead, Cruz reminds them, the outsider named Reagan inspired millions of disenchanted voters who yearned for a return to American primacy, following the failed policies of a Democratic president both at home and abroad.Even Cruz\u2019s own advisers find fault with this analogy. As one of them said to me: \u2018\u2018I think he\u2019s much more of a movement conservative than Reagan was. I mean, he\u2019s not putting Sandra Day O\u2019Connor on the Supreme Court.\u2019\u2019 The Reagan-Cruz parallels break down on other levels as well. America is not in a recession, as it was in 1980. The Republican nominee\u2019s opponent will not be an unpopular president but instead, in all likelihood, a female nominee who will be seen as a history maker. Reagan benefited from a less-polarized electorate, attested to by the fact that he garnered 27 percent of the Democratic vote in 1980. By contrast, only 7 percent of the 2012 Democratic electorate chose Romney, who, unlike Cruz, had governed in the blue state of Massachusetts. And the Reagan Revolution was abetted by the shift of white Southerners, who had long viewed themselves as Democrats, to the Republican Party. That revolution has already been fought and won by the Republicans. To win the general election without reaching toward the center, Cruz will have to create his own groundswell with another conservative voting group.The supposition that evangelicals could be this group is also shaky. Cruz\u2019s team argues that about 10 million such voters who did not vote in the 2000 election turned out for Bush in 2004 and have stayed home since. The Bush campaign strategist Matthew Dowd maintains that the increase in evangelical voters was much smaller, prob\u00adably closer to two million. (Given that the overall turnout increase from 2000 to 2004 was less than 17 million voters, and that nearly half of those voters went for John Kerry, the 10 million estimate would seem to be mathematically un\u00adlikely.) Dowd argues as well that the dominant issue in 2004 for all voting groups, including evangelicals, was national security; socially conservative causes like marriage and abortion, Dowd says, \u2018\u2018didn\u2019t even make the top five.\u2019\u2019 Researchers also dispute that Romney drove away evangelicals in 2012. \u2018\u2018In fact, they were overrepresented \u2014 they were 20 percent of the population but made up 26 percent of the electorate,\u2019\u2019 says Robert P. Jones, of the Public Religion Research Institute. Moreover, 78 percent of them cast their ballots for Romney, the same share of the evangelical vote that Bush received in 2004.But perhaps the diciest assumption made by the Cruz campaign is that it not only can turn out more registered evangelical voters than Romney did but also can recruit millions of unregistered evangelicals at the same time. Every demographic group includes many people who have no interest in the political process, and persuading them to engage is not as simple a matter as offering an appealing slate of issues. Should she become the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton will be mining the electoral turf for new voters as well. And in general, the task is an easier one for Democrats, given that their targets are more densely concentrated in urban areas. Cruz\u2019s strategists assert that Clinton will not inspire voters the way Obama did, and this may well be true. But the same might be said of Cruz among various voter groups. With his hard-line stance on immigration, will he repel even more Latino voters than Romney, who received a paltry 27 percent of their votes? Though Cruz might catalyze large pockets of unregistered evangelicals, Jones and others suggest that such voters are primarily in states like Alabama and Tennessee that are already firmly in the Republican column. Pursuing them with a deeply conservative platform could gain Cruz very few electoral votes, while costing him significantly among moderate voters in swing states like Virginia and Ohio.For some Republicans, this situation suggests a more disquieting comparison. \u2018\u2018What\u2019s flawed about Cruz\u2019s approach is that it\u2019s the same argument Barry Goldwater made in 1964,\u2019\u2019 says Doug Gross, a longtime fixture in the Iowa Republican establishment who worked on the Bush and Romney campaigns of 2000 and 2008 and has not endorsed anyone in the 2016 field. Though 80 percent of Republicans fell in line with Goldwater at the polls, only 36 percent of voters under 30, 38 percent of women and 6 percent of nonwhites preferred him over the landslide winner, Lyndon Johnson. \u2018\u2018While Cruz may seem pure and virtuous within the confines of his own base, you can\u2019t get elected with those voters, because there simply aren\u2019t enough of them. Now, within the Republican Party, the establishment and Tea Party are probably in a standoff. But within the general electorate, there are far more of me than there are of him.\u2019\u2019There is only one way to know for sure what will happen if Republican voters nominate Ted Cruz \u2014 and some in the party establishment are already braced for it, with Job-like resignation. As Gross told me: \u2018\u2018We may have to learn this lesson the hard way. This may well be the year that Cruz wins the nomination and we have to have a bloodletting as our medieval cure.\u2019\u2019This country, Cruz said, is \u2018\u2018in crisis.\u2019\u2019 But, he added, \u2018\u2018I\u2019m here this morning with a word of hope and encouragement and exhortation. All across the state of Iowa and this country, people are waking up. There is a spirit of revival that is sweeping this country.\u2019\u2019 The candidate went on in a cadence that frequently descended into stage whispers or attenuated pauses, his face clenched in Shakespearean rapture, varying barely a syllable from the monologues he would deliver with equal fervor in 27 other stops on this six-day swing through the Hawkeye State.Whether Cruz was making a personal connection to this audience in Boone \u2014 whether they truly liked the messenger and not just his message, whether they saw in him the affable Reagan to whom he invited comparison \u2014 was difficult to judge. But at least a dozen times during his reliably 32-minute oration, someone standing nearby me murmured, \u2018\u2018Amen.\u2019\u2019 Some of their faces went taut with resolve as he declared: \u2018\u2018The men and women of this room scare the living daylights out of Washington. And when politicians are terrified, liberty is never safer. What we are seeing is a grass-roots army coming together!\u2019\u2019Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Challenging Uber, Lyft Bets on a Road Wide Enough for Two", "Date": "2016-01-09", "News": "Supported byThe word \u201cmonopoly\u201d has a distinctly nefarious ring to it, conjuring up images of thuggish industrialists in smoky rooms, scheming to undermine their rivals.Yet in Silicon Valley, it\u2019s not at all uncommon for one company to dominate a particular field. Google is the runaway leader in online search. Facebook is the largest social network in the world by a wide margin. Amazon is far and away the biggest e-commerce site.But while market dominance is hard to break, that doesn\u2019t stop upstarts from trying. In the case of Uber, it is Lyft that is doing its best to keep up.\u201cWe\u2019re gaining share in the United States,\u201d said John Zimmer, Lyft\u2019s president and co-founder. \u201cThat\u2019s not what happens when one player has a complete monopoly.\u201d\u201cThe mere possession of monopoly power, and the concomitant charging of monopoly prices, is not only not unlawful; it is an important element of the free-market system,\u201d Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in that opinion. \u201cThe opportunity to charge monopoly prices \u2014 at least for a short period \u2014 is what attracts \u2018business acumen\u2019 in the first place; it induces risk-taking that produces innovation and economic growth.\u201dIn the book \u201cZero to One,\u201d which he wrote with Blake Masters, the investor and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel offers tips on how to create monopolies, arguing that once achieved, they lead to more innovation.\u201cMonopolies drive progress because the promise of years or even decades of monopoly profits provides a powerful incentive to innovate,\u201d he writes. \u201cThen monopolies can keep innovating because profits enable them to make the long-term plans and to finance the ambitious research projects that firms locked in competition can\u2019t dream of.\u201dAnd regulators have not been cracking down on Silicon Valley. Given how many big technology companies loom large in their respective markets, there have been relatively few big antitrust actions brought against tech giants.\u201cThis is different from the old monopolies of the industrial age,\u201d Robert Reich, the former labor secretary, said of technology companies.Unlike United States Steel or Standard Oil, two of corporate history\u2019s biggest brutes, today\u2019s tech monopolies are rarely the exclusive provider of an essential commodity. Instead, many achieve their initial dominance by distinguishing themselves in a crowded marketplace, then rapidly taking market share thanks to the power of network effects \u2014 that is, the more people use a service, the more valuable that service becomes to other people, who join in and make the service all the more popular.Network effects helped Google, Facebook and Amazon run away from their competitors, and are helping Uber today. Google wasn\u2019t the first search engine, Facebook wasn\u2019t the first social network, and Amazon wasn\u2019t the first to sell goods online. There are still many other sites for search, social and e-commerce. But despite an array of options, users keep coming back to the market leaders.Some argue, however, that the regulatory framework needs to adjust for a new kind of market dominance.Along with network effects, another hallmark of today\u2019s tech monopolies is that, perhaps fearing obsolescence, they diversify. While Microsoft still makes its Windows and Office software, it also owns Skype and has a big video gaming business. Google is now a subsidiary of Alphabet, a new parent company that is also home to a health care company, a self-driving-cars division and a venture capital firm. Amazon is expanding its cloud computing and streaming-media businesses. And Facebook has diversified into messaging with WhatsApp, photos with Instagram, and virtual reality with Oculus Rift.This, too, creates challenges for regulators. When mergers and acquisitions are part of the natural life cycle of start-ups and venture capital, it isn\u2019t easy to block deals that might hypothetically reduce competition down the road. As a result, regulators have blessed many acquisitions that, to critics, appear to be deeply anticompetitive.Gary Reback, a lawyer who helped prompt a landmark antitrust investigation into Microsoft and is now pursuing Google in Europe, makes the case that Google bought its way to dominance in online advertising through the acquisition of DoubleClick, bought its leadership in mobile by purchasing Android and bought its strong mapping franchise in the deal for Waze. Similarly, Facebook bought two of its nearest rivals, WhatsApp and Instagram. If any of those deals had been blocked, Mr. Reback argues, behemoths like Google and Facebook might today be facing more concerted competition.\u201cOnce one of these companies gets a monopoly, it\u2019s easy to spread the monopoly to adjacent markets by acquisition,\u201d Mr. Reback said. \u201cYou would think antitrust enforcers would know this by now.\u201dWhile monopolies in the tech industry are perhaps easier than ever to achieve, industry experts contend they are also more vulnerable than ever before. The advent of the smartphone and widespread access to broadband Internet connectivity have democratized access to creative new technologies.\u201cSun Microsystems. EMC. Cisco. All these were considered the dominant market players in their category at the time,\u201d said Rich Wong, a venture capitalist at Accel Partners. \u201cThen the vast majority of them got whacked by this thing called the cloud.\u201dAnd of course, billions of people browse the web without Google, use other social networking apps besides Facebook, and shop on websites besides Amazon. Though no upstarts have replaced them yet, none are immune to disruption.As for Uber, if it\u2019s not a monopoly already, it is the giant in the ride-hailing market, at least in the United States. One rival, Sidecar, shut down last month, and Lyft is its last meaningful competitor on a national scale. (Uber faces a tougher road abroad, where it is tangling with regulators in Europe, recently withdrew from Frankfurt and is fighting against entrenched rivals in China and other international markets.)As the underdog, Lyft is trying to put more drivers on the road and acquire new users. Like Uber, the company is private, and neither shares much information about performance. But Mr. Zimmer said the company was quickly increasing market share in the United States. He also sees the on-demand ride business as different from search or social media and more like telecommunications companies, where several big competitors can compete on service.\u201cJust like AT&T and Verizon need three bars of coverage,\u201d he said, \u201cwe get down to two to three minutes of wait time for a vehicle to arrive. Once it gets to that point, there\u2019s no difference in behavior between services. That\u2019s when you compete on experience.\u201dStill, Lyft will be hard pressed to unseat Uber.\u201cThe network effects hold competition at stiff arm\u2019s length,\u201d said Steve Cheney, an entrepreneur and co-founder of Estimote, a micro-location platform for mobile developers.Or perhaps the ride-hailing market is big enough for both Uber and Lyft. Monopolies don\u2019t necessarily mean there is no competition whatsoever.

{"Headline": "All-Bedouin Tech Company Hints at Shift in Israel", "Date": "2016-01-09", "News": "Supported byHer mother is illiterate, and her father drives a truck. The Bedouin village in which she lives does not have enough electricity at night to power the laptop she brings home from the office; work must stop once the battery runs out. In a conservative society that frowns on female drivers, she said, she does not have a license.Fortunately for people like Ms. Hawashleh, companies like Sadel and government initiatives aimed at bringing more young Arabs into the technology work force are trying to change that.\u201cIt was a phenomenon in Bedouin society,\u201d said Ibrahim Sana, the chief executive of Sadel, which he set up in 2013 with an Israeli technology investor. \u201cYouths were graduating from college in software engineering and other technological studies, and ended up as gas station attendants or teachers.\u201dMr. Sana, 35, now employs a dozen people. He found one of his employees, who had graduated from college with distinction, stocking shelves in a supermarket. Another was working as an apprentice locksmith.\u201cIt is a real change for those looking from outside, and from within, to feel that we are part of this country,\u201d Mr. Sana said. \u201cIsrael is a leader in high-tech, and we want a piece of that.\u201dMr. Sana\u2019s experience is unusual. Many Bedouins have trouble finding such jobs, he said, because they live far from the commercial center of the country, often in villages that the authorities refuse to recognize, without infrastructure; or because recruitment often works through word of mouth and personal contacts that the Bedouins do not have. Then there is basic prejudice, he said, as well as the fact that English is a third language after Arabic and Hebrew for many Arab citizens. Sadel, in an industrial park about five miles from a growing technology center in Beersheba, mixes technology with tradition. At lunchtime, for example, the employees take out their prayer mats and perform Muslim midday prayers.On a recent afternoon, Bassam Abu Zaed, 27, a web and Android developer and a quality assurance team leader, finished his prayers and was soon back at his desk developing a diagnostics application for mobile devices that he intends to sell to cellphone companies.Sadel is also unusual in that it hires Bedouin women, whose employment opportunities are usually limited to fields such as education. Rifaa Azbarga, 26, one of three women working at Sadel, received a degree in software engineering and then taught math in the Bedouin town of Keseife \u201cbecause everyone told me they never take Arabs into high-tech.\u201d She now builds websites for businesses and is developing an Android application that combines radio news, advertising and chat functions.Ms. Hawashleh, one of 11 siblings, went to school in the village of Abu Qreinat, which has a population of about 5,000. A star pupil, she said she had only herself to compete with and constantly strove to raise her grades.After a year of studying math and computer science at Ben-Gurion University, Ms. Hawashleh dropped out because she needed to help support her family, and taught in the village school until a friend who worked at Sadel introduced her to the company.Ms. Hawashleh said that her parents, who were born in Abu Qreinat, want her to marry within the extended family, but that she would prefer to look farther afield and perhaps move to one of the larger Bedouin towns in the area.\u201cMy parents say that they know what\u2019s good for me,\u201d Ms. Hawashleh said with a giggle, sitting on an embroidered mattress next to her mother. \u201cTo teach, marry and have a family.\u201dDespite this, her mother, Hesen, 50, said she and her husband were proud that they had educated their girls and were happy about her career.Ms. Hawashleh said that when she first began working at Sadel, her parents did not tell relatives, assuming that they would disapprove of her working in a company away from home.\u201cNow,\u201d she said, \u201cthey all know.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook to Shut Down Parse, Its Platform for Mobile Developers", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Most of what Parse does involves things most people will never see. Parse helps developers with support and tools, so that independent programmers can spend more time writing code and less time on keeping up the back end. Developers who use Parse include those at Quip, a productivity app, and Expedia\u2019s Orbitz, a travel website. Facebook would make money from Parse by storing data from developers and sending customers product notifications.Achieving that goal, however, would be no easy feat. Microsoft, Google and Amazon have similar developer offerings, along with a much richer set of other computing tools and services that developers need. Amazon Web Services, in particular, has in the past two years stressed both its developer tools and analytic services, so companies can think about what to build next. In every case, these companies can also benefit by selling other computing services, like complex commercial databases, which Facebook does not provide.Parse seemed like a good opportunity for expansion. At the time, Internet businesses were in the midst of a major industry change, as users were shifting away from desktop computing and increasingly relying on mobile devices. Parse, the thinking went, could provide Facebook the opportunity to be the foundation of a whole new generation of developers building mobile apps in the age of the smartphone.Facebook also would have had to invest untold millions of dollars in capital and, more importantly, engineering talent, to get the Parse business fully off the ground to have a better chance at making a dent in competitors like Amazon, Microsoft and Google.Moreover, Facebook has already made two big, risky bets in Oculus, the virtual reality platform, and WhatsApp, the messaging service. Neither service currently generates material revenue for Facebook.Parse may have touched millions of people through the apps that developers built there, but that mattered little against Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s size. With more than 1.5 billion registered users, a population of even 15 million customers is not 1 percent of Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s audience. Building up Parse, it seems, eventually became more of a distraction than it was worth.\u201cMoving forward we want to dedicate more resources to high-impact products and services in areas like analytics, monetization, discovery, and authentication,\u201d Michael Kirkland, a Facebook spokesman, said in a statement. \u201cAs a result, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made the difficult decision to wind down support for Parse.\u201dOther Silicon Valley companies have encountered similar difficulties. Inside Cisco Systems, in its heyday, there was pressure to build businesses that yielded $1 billion or more in revenue, since anything less could not affect the overall company. Facebook, which unlike other clouds has not sought to rent computing and software to businesses, must essentially find this from social networking.Developers who used Parse will have a set of tools and a year-long window to be able to migrate their data off of the platform to other services.\u201cWe\u2019re proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished together with the Parse community, and we thank them for their support,\u201d Mr. Kirkland said.FollowAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Centerview Benefits From Wall St.\u2019s Pivot to Smaller Banks", "Date": "2016-01-05", "News": "Supported byIn a pink marble skyscraper opposite the Museum of Modern Art, 20 summer analysts at the investment bank Centerview Partners listened while Robert E. Rubin, the former Treasury secretary, opined on the state of the world.The analysts had been selected from a few thousand applicants, and most would return after graduation to work long days, nights and weekends at Centerview, which advises big corporations on mergers and acquisitions. Blair W. Effron and Robert A. Pruzan, the firm\u2019s co-founders, flanked Mr. Rubin at the head of the table.The conversation meandered from United States foreign policy to the Greek debt crisis. Then Mr. Rubin asked the students if they were always so preternaturally serious.\u201cWhen I was in college, we hung out in coffee shops and pondered the meaning of life,\u201d Mr. Rubin said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what a hedge fund was.\u201dNo one took the bait. The summer analysts were all business.Most of these fresh-faced graduates of elite colleges could have taken jobs at their pick of big banks. But their decision to join Centerview reflects a shift in the center of gravity on Wall Street. Increasingly, large corporations are turning to so-called boutique investment banks like Centerview for advice on deals and strategy.Boutiques are gaining favor for several reasons: They are unburdened by larger trading and financing operations that can create conflicts of interest. Their smaller staffs mean deals have a better chance of staying secret. And increasingly, they are luring the industry\u2019s most senior deal makers away from big banks.As the books close on a year that broke records with $4.7 trillion worth of deals, these boutiques have become a more powerful presence on Wall Street than ever before.Besides Centerview, the list of insurgents includes Lazard, Evercore Partners, Moelis & Company, LionTree and others. Some have been around for decades, while others are just setting up shop, seeking to capitalize on this rapidly changing market for top-dollar advice.At Centerview, Mr. Effron helped General Electric structure its disposal of GE Capital last year. He helped conceive a plan that would allow Kraft and Heinz to merge in one of the year\u2019s biggest deals. And he is advising Pfizer as it works on a $160 billion combination with Allergan.Alan Hartman, another partner at Centerview, suggested that the health care property company Ventas spin off a major division last year, which turned into a multibillion-dollar deal. Another partner, David A. Handler, routinely spends time with the technology giant Cisco Systems, mulling over potential acquisitions and sometimes simply helping the company think through its quarterly earnings release.These deal makers are well compensated for their work. Centerview reaped a $60 million fee for helping orchestrate the merger of Kraft and Heinz. It earned $40.8 million for helping Pharmacyclics sell itself to AbbVie in March. For helping Time Warner Cable secure a sale to Charter Communications, Centerview will make $27.5 million. It will receive $44.4 million for advising Salix on its sale to Valeant, and $32 million for helping Omnicare sell itself to CVS.For these assignments and others, Centerview earned about $600 million last year, according to a review of public filings, a huge sum for a firm with just 35 partners.To be sure, the big banks do all this and more. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase were again the top merger advisers last year, capitalizing on longstanding relationships with big companies and the ability to throw a lot of resources at complicated assignments. And when a company needs to borrow billions of dollars to finance an ambitious takeover, it must tap institutions with big balance sheets for loans. Often, companies will hire boutiques and big banks to work together on a deal.But boutiques, and Centerview in particular, are turning heads as they continue to rake in more fees and bigger assignments. A boutique was involved in each of the eight largest deals of the year, all of them worth $50 billion or more, and Centerview advised on three of those.Over a sushi lunch in 2005, Mr. Effron, then at UBS, and Mr. Pruzan, at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, decided they had enough with big banks and decided to found Centerview. At the time, they were at the vanguard of an exodus of top bankers from big firms, a movement that intensified after the financial crisis.In the years that followed, dozens of top bankers left big firms to join boutiques. Mr. Hartman had risen to become Bank of America Merrill Lynch\u2019s head of mergers and acquisitions for the Americas. But in 2009, he and several top colleagues, including Mark J. Robinson, left to join Centerview.In London, Robey Warshaw, a firm founded in 2014 by UBS and Morgan Stanley executives, is advising SABMiller on its proposed $104 billion sale to Anheuser Busch InBev and is also advising the BG Group on its $72 billion sale to Royal Dutch Shell.The forces motivating top talent to leave big banks are diverse, ranging from a frustration with bureaucracy to an appetite for riches.\u201cIf you\u2019re at a big bank, what you do or your group does doesn\u2019t move the needle,\u201d said Roger C. Altman, founder of Evercore Partners, a publicly traded boutique. \u201cAbove a certain size, no individual can do that. People want to have impact.\u201dIndependent firms can also lead to big paydays. After the financial crisis, boutiques were unburdened by the restrictions that reined in compensation at banks that took government bailouts, and paid deal makers millions without falling afoul of Washington.Centerview is not publicly traded, so it is not clear what the equity held by Mr. Effron and Mr. Pruzan is worth. Should they choose to take Centerview public, they would swiftly join the ranks of the world\u2019s richest bankers. Both men said there were no plans for an initial public offering.Yet as Centerview continues gaining momentum, the question is whether Mr. Effron and Mr. Pruzan have created a firm that is built to last.Small investment banks like Centerview have plenty of vulnerabilities. They are dependent on companies\u2019 willingness to pay top dollar for deal advice. A downturn in mergers can dry up business fast. Even in today\u2019s booming merger market, some boutiques are struggling. At Greenhill, fees from advising clients declined to $281 million in 2014 from $303 million in 2011.And though Mr. Effron and Mr. Pruzan strive to present the appearance of a single firm that transcends individuals, Centerview\u2019s clients are loyal to their bankers, whatever firm they happen to work at.\u201cOur relationship has always been more with Blair Effron than with any one bank,\u201d said Indra Nooyi, the chief executive of PepsiCo.Trying to create a bank that is bigger than such personal relationships is Centerview\u2019s primary challenge in the years ahead, and is why Mr. Effron and Mr. Pruzan personally select their summer analysts, and try to promote a collaborative culture by taking analysts on cultural outings and bringing in speakers like Mr. Rubin.\u201cWe\u2019re looking for our future partners,\u201d Mr. Pruzan said.A few days before Centerview\u2019s summer analysts chatted with the former Treasury secretary, Mr. Effron held a fund-raiser for Hillary Clinton at his duplex on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side.Attendees, including Mr. Altman of Evercore and Mr. Rubin, contributed $2,700 each. Mrs. Clinton spoke for about 30 minutes, took questions and posed for photos.Close ties to the Clinton campaign aside, Mr. Effron insists that he is focused on building Centerview for another 10 years and more. And despite the lure of I.P.O. riches, the Centerview founders insisted they were not looking to cash out anytime soon.\u201cWe\u2019re taking a longer view of what we are building,\u201d Mr. Pruzan said.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the work history of Mr. Pruzan. At the time he and Mr. Effron founded Centerview Partners, he was at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, not Commerzbank, which later acquired Dresdner Kleinwort.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thoughts on a Poland in Flux: Readers Speak Out", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byThere is intense debate in Poland about the direction the country is taking under its new right-wing government, a debate that has spilled over into the European Union and that has raised questions about the direction of democracy in Eastern and Central Europe more than a quarter-century after the fall of the Berlin Wall.The push toward the right and a rise in nationalist fervor has left some Poles feeling disenfranchised and arguing that Poland would be better off cultivating Western alliances. Supporters of the new government, with links to rural Poland and the powerful Catholic church, say that news coverage of their country\u2019s new course has been unfair.More than 1,000 readers responded, bringing to life a conversation about Poland\u2019s direction. Here is a selection. The responses have been edited for length and clarity; those submitted in Polish include a translation.Jestem smutna i zadziwiona tym, jak szybko mo\u017cna podzieli\u0107 Polak\u00f3w na \u201cnas\u201d i \u201cwas,\u201d na \u201clepszych\u201d i \u201cgorszych,\u201d na \u201cpatriot\u00f3w\u201d i \u201czdrajc\u00f3w\u201d. Taki podzia\u0142 jest absurdalny, niczym m\u0105drym niemotywowany, ale PiS-owi jest na r\u0119k\u0119, wi\u0119c rz\u0105dz\u0105cy starannie go piel\u0119gnuj\u0105 i podsycaj\u0105 wzajemn\u0105 niech\u0119\u0107 obu stron konfliktu.I feel sad and astonished at how quickly one can divide Poles into \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem,\u201d \u201cbetter\u201d and \u201cworse,\u201d \u201cpatriots\u201d and \u201ctraitors.\u201d This division is absurd and not supported by any rational arguments. But it\u2019s beneficial for Law and Justice, so those in power carefully cultivate it and foment animosity on both sides of the conflict.I consider myself a liberal, and although I always vote, there isn\u2019t really a party in Poland that represents my views.The main change is the atmosphere. We are completely polarized as a society, and some of us are triumphant, some of us are worried. Still, a majority don\u2019t care much, as they are uninterested in politics and despise politicians.I am worried that the actions of the government will weaken our international position and hurt our relations with the E.U. This, in turn, will make it much easier for Russia to expand, once again, its influence over Central Europe.Wbrew pozorom ca\u0142kiem sporo si\u0119 zmieni\u0142o. Ludzie powariowali i temat\u00f3w politycznych trzeba unika\u0107 jak ognia. Wi\u0119kszo\u015b\u0107 takich rozm\u00f3w ko\u0144czy si\u0119 k\u0142\u00f3tniami, a do dyskusji o sytuacji w Polsce wszyscy nabrali ostatnio wyj\u0105tkowej ochoty. Pierwszy raz w \u017cyciu jestem autentycznie zm\u0119czony polityk\u0105 i uciekam od niej jak tylko mog\u0119.Contrary to appearances, a lot has changed. People have gone crazy and political subjects need to be avoided at all costs. Most political discussions end with fights, but somehow, people have recently acquired a taste for debates about Poland. For the first time in my life, I am tired of politics, and I try to escape it as much as I can.It makes me remember the Communist era. Government saying that everything is right, when thousands on the streets and experts say the opposite. For the first time since 26 years of freedom, I and my friends are worried about our democracy.I voted for PiS because I believe that Poland is still in the process of transforming from Communism and they are the ones who can finish this process. Eighty percent of our law is written in Brussels. We are being lectured on \u201cdemocracy\u201d by unelected commissars from the E.U. Polish people value liberty above all, and we want to decide on our own. PiS is far from perfect, but the best option yet. Foreign governments will not accept our democratic choices as they affect the interests of many foreign corporations who invest in Poland.As a translator working with E.U. documents and someone who has to care much about words, I feel oppressed by the sheer stupidity of the statements of our current government. Our minister of transport is deeply concerned about chemtrails. Our minister of foreign affairs considers riding a bike and being vegetarian as Marxist. And to add insult to injury, there is also the unbelievable insolence. A former Communist prosecutor is leading the efforts to dismantle the Constitutional Court. A guy involved in the financial schemes now presides the Finance Commission in the Senate. I have stopped listening to the radio and reading newspapers.I feel completely alone. I\u2019m a vegan, a cyclist and an atheist. There is no place for me here anymore. I can\u2019t watch my favorite TV station anymore, the budget in my city is lost due to World Youth Day. We want more bike paths and an Erasmus program! They steal our rights and a diversity rooted in Polish history.I am afraid that soon public media will be exclusively conservative and any other point of view will be treated as an action against the law. I was born in 1993 and have lived my whole life in a free, democratic country, and I want it to stay this way.I am not a fan of PiS, I have not voted for them, but I see major improvement in the quality of public debate in television. Topics that were silenced are now being mentioned even in major news programs (such as Middle Eastern immigration to Europe, anti-E.U. views, etc.).Nigdy nie przypuszcza\u0142em, \u017ce b\u0119d\u0119 bra\u0142 udzia\u0142 w demonstracjach w obronie demokracji. Do tej pory widzia\u0142em takie demonstracje tylko w telewizji \u2014 we wschodniej Europie oraz w archiwach z czas\u00f3w PRL-u. Nie spodziewa\u0142em si\u0119, \u017ce Polska, kt\u00f3ra by\u0142a wzorem dla Europy w walce o demokracj\u0119, mo\u017ce w pewnym momencie t\u0119 demokracj\u0119 zacz\u0105\u0107 traci\u0107.I never imagined that I would be taking part in demonstrations in defense of democracy. So far, I have seen such things only on television \u2014 in Eastern Europe or in historical records from the time of the Polish People\u2019s Republic. I never expected that Poland, which used to be a European role model in the fight for democracy, at some point could start losing this democracy itself.Poland has changed a lot since the Law and Justice Party came to power, mostly for the worse. However, there is one positive thing \u2014 the rise of civic society, which is something we never truly had in the past. Our country has been through a lot in the past, and we as a nation have shown that we will fight for our freedom and values we believe in.I hope that the new government will work on restoring the Polish economy based on our own production. Now, most of the factories in Poland are similar to those in the Far East \u2014 places where people assemble products for big foreign companies, very cheaply.Many of my friends who have never shown an interest in politics are suddenly paying very close attention. The changes here are alarming, and the mounting xenophobia a source of concern to expats who have made their home here.Jako osoba w homoseksualnym zwi\u0105zku boj\u0119 si\u0119 o moje \u017cycie i wolno\u015b\u0107.

I can also say that under the rule of Prime Minister Donald Tusk, my quality of life was significantly lowered. To maintain financial stability, I had to emigrate to Britain to work.
